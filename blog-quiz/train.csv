JSZ5Y36,male,24,"from a refrigerator magnet    For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin  real life.  But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first,  some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid.  At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.  This perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness.  Happiness is the way.  So treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one.  Happiness is a journey, not a destination.       -Father Alfred D'Souza"
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Words from other people's mouths My first thought to share is the one that's been with me the longest.  I came across this about three years ago in Oakland, CA on a plaque enshrined to Jack London.  He called it his ""Credo"": I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out      in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.  I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom      of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and       permanent planet.  The function of man is to live, not to exist.  I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.  I shall use my time. Next is from T.S. Eliot's poem  Four Quartets .  These passages are from the fourth quartet, ""Little Gidding"": What we call the beginning is often the end And to make and end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.  [...]  We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. Come to think of it, this next quote has been in my presence even longer than Jack London's credo.  It's scrawled in my quote book from February of my junior year at UConn.  This thought from Mark Twain - or, more accurately, Samuel Clemens - is most appropriate as I struggle with what to do with the rest of my life, in all aspects: Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. I'll write more in a bit.  For now, this is enough."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Why oh why   Why -- the question of my life.  I always ask it, and rarely answer it.  I really hate my job right now.  I don't enjoy teaching.  Well, I don't enjoy it enough to justify doing it.  I like parts of it, but there's just so much... crap.  I feel run-down.  Thanks to my guitar -- I've been into playing lately, and it helps.    Vernon Chorale tonight.  Not terribly excited about that.  Oh, and Loki has been missing for almost two days.  I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, but wherever he is, it's a good spot."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"It's Day 2 in San Francisco for us and last night was bullshit.  It was our second night at the state park in Marin County north of the city, but last night the fog came in with a vengeance.  So much so, in fact, that it condensed on all the trees around our site and then the trees started raining on us.  No rain in the parking lot, rain under the trees.  What the fuck.  So I woke up around 6:30 to an empty tent, which was dripping wet.  Dan had headed for the car to sleep because he was cold just before the trees began to piss on us.  Add to that the fact that I hadn't put on the rain fly due to the beautiful weather... and you pretty much get the picture.  Rain was dripping in on me, and had been for some time, evidently.  The tent was drenched, although I wasn't for some reason.  So I packed up the tent in the rain and stuffed all the wet stuff in the trunk.  Tonight we're staying at a Hyatt on the Embarcadero so that we can enjoy the city for the Fourth.  I also need a break from the rain.  And a shower.  Should be fun :).  Off for more adenvtures.  Ehren out."

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"urlLink from Rilke - Letters to a Young Poet - Letter 7   We know little, but that we must trust in what is difficult is a certainty that will never abandon us; it is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be one more reason for us to do it.   It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation. That is why young people, who are beginners in everything, are not yet capable of love: it is something they must learn. With their whole being, with all their forces, gathered around their solitary, anxious, upward-beating heart, they must learn to love."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Great weekend   Things are interesting.  I've spent the afternoon and evening here at home by myself, and as usual, things are getting cerebral.     The CMEA conference on Friday was exactly what I needed, in many ways I wasn't aware of.  It was good to see people from my graduating class from UConn.  It was great to be around other music teachers.  And my seminar was... well, it was really good.  I was proud of it.  I was nervous, but got off to a good start.  My personality came through even when I wasn't the smoothest of talkers, and some of the 25(!!!) people there really seemed to enjoy it.  I wonder if I can take my own advice?  I sure had a lot of good stuff to say on Friday.  Stuff about not burning out and the like.  Man, it felt good to do that... even if I did it on my own instead of with people.  Actually, especially because I did it on my own.    I very much need to start calling parents.  I just hate confrontation.  I don't like to call parents and tell them that their pride and joy is being a pain in my rear end.  But my sanity may depend on it.  April and May could become reeeeally long.  Plus, there might be other consequences too, that I can't discuss here.  But they wouldn't be good.  I need to start calling parents right after school.  Even though I have rehearsal until 5pm.  Gah.  Had a great weekend.  Partied two nights in a row.  Man, it's been a long time since I did that.  My attitude today has been just kind of mellow as a result.  Paychecks are nice.  Going to go think too much again."

You'll learn next time...:)  hey, it's summer, right?  You're young, right?  You've got the rest of your life to be responsible!!  well, I'm here and you're not and I'm having the time of my life and you're at home being ""RESPONSIBLE"" and working like the rest of the societally-brainwashed proles out there...heehehe... gotta remember to live... later all, out for more fun.  wish y'all were here!"

But the beginning of the week was so shitty that I just couldn't see past it to conceiving of anything else.  And here I am, gasping for breath like one who just finished the marathon.    I'm considering so many things for next year, and I don't have answers to most of them.  Somehow, this is okay with me now, because I'm on top of making things better.    Vague?  Yes.  But I'm okay with that... and plus, I don't have more specifics anyway.   The weather is beautiful today.  Summer is finally on the way.  I didn't think the cold weather and rain would ever leave this year.  Seems I needed it more than ever.  The days are finally here when the outdoors isn't so harsh and cold and barren.  I live for this time of year.  Would it become less special if I lived somewhere where it was like this all year round?  I can't imagine it.  Someday, I'll work it out.  One more year in Connecticut, then grad school... and the sky's the limit.    Choir banquet tonight with Lauren.  Who would have thought?  Life really does spiral back on itself.  Looking forward to a great time.  See you all there."

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Almost... there...   Well, for better or for worse, I've almost made it through this week.  Tomorrow is just the last sprint before that wonderful week most people call April Vacation.  I don't think I could have made it much longer.  I can tell you this: one of the main things that kept me from seriously considering dropping my job as soon as possible is the fact that if I don't, I will get paychecks through the summer.  And believe you me, I have fucking  earned  those paychecks.  Sheesh.  Went to Tony's tonight in New Britain.  I didn't want to go at first because I was in a crappy mood -- again -- but Tony is persistent, and managed to convince me with food to come visit.  Man, am I glad I did.  I brought Loki and he had his ""first"" experience outside... quotes because he WAS a barn cat for the first 4 months of his life.  But he sure hasn't been outside for a while now, and he was freaking out, trying to scramble back into the same carrier I had to almost force him into to get there.  Cats.  Heading to bed soon.  Jamming with Liz tomorrow night.  I need a vacation.  Oh wait, I've got one.  Piping hot and ready to eat.  Or something like that.  How does one eat a vacation?"
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Joshua Levinson is my new hero.  Read on, friends...     U.S. Empire wages unjust war  By Joshua Levinson - Daily Campus, University of Connecticut     I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of Tyranny.  I'm sure you've heard all the arguments. You've heard that Saddam Hussein refuses to cooperate with the United Nations. You've heard that there are purported links between the al-Qaida terrorist organization and Hussein's regime. You've heard Bush telling you that, regardless of the U.N.'s final decision, we will use aggression as necessary. So when, exactly, did America stop being a crusader of freedom and start becoming a tyrannical empire?  First of all, why is it that we're about to go to war with Iraq while North Korea recently reactivated their nuclear reactor, which is more than capable of creating nuclear weapons in a matter of months? North Korea already has a much larger, better-armed military than Iraq, with biological and chemical weapons, not to mention their admitted nuclear development program (which, I remind you, is in direct violation of their treaty with the U.S.). On top of this, reports from former political prisoners in North Korea's work camps speak of torture, genocide and even infanticide in detail.  But why should we care about North Korea, right? It's not like they've got a bunch of oil under there. Not only is this foreign policy hypocritical, almost all of the evidence I've found indicates that our own government is a far more dangerous regime than Saddam Hussein's. For instance, George W. himself has stated that any country that harbors, aids or trains terrorists is a terrorist state itself. Of course, this excludes America, home to Fort Benning, Georgia's Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHISC), known as the School of Americas (SOA) up until two years ago. The SOA is a military training facility for Latin Americans which has graduated over 60,000 soldiers and policemen.  Among the graduates: Manuel Noriaga (former Panamanian Colonel who was on the payroll of the CIA and Pentagon, as well as indicted on drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering), Byron Lima Estrada (Guatemalan Colonel convicted of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi, who helped write a report on Guatemala's D-2 Intelligent Agency, which annihilated 448 Mayan villages and killed tens of thousands of their own people), Colonel Pablo Belmar (implicated in the torture and murder of U.N. official Carmelo Soria), General Hernan Jose Guzman Rodriguez (aided Colombian death squad ""MAS"", which was responsible for at least 149 deaths), and General Hector Gramajo (created genocidal policies that included rape, murder, torture and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Guatemala).  Although the WHISC claims that all ties with the SOA have been cut, just two years ago a Colombian SOA graduate was convicted of complicity in the torture and killing of 30 citizens. After the civil war in El Salvador, after 75,000 people were killed, the U.N. Truth Commission came out with a list of the soldiers who had committed the worst atrocities: two-thirds of them were SOA graduates.  This is all just the tip of the iceberg, as the SOA Watch (http://www.soaw.org/new) points out. In fact, after immense pressure, in 1996 the government released just seven of their training manuals for the SOA, which ""recommended blackmail, torture, execution and the arrest of witnesses' relatives.""  What I'm basically saying is that the U.S. is responsible for educating and training terrorists. So don't tell me that Hussein has purported ""connections"" with the al-Qaida while we train people who go on to run death squads and annihilate thousands of innocent people every year.  For the past 10 years, we have continued air strikes on Iraq for violating U.N. sanctions, which cripple their economy on a daily basis. According to UNICEF, the U.N.'s Children's Fund, over 4,000 children are dying every month in Iraq because of sanctions imposed by the U.N. How, exactly, does killing little children qualify as disarming Saddam Hussein? Do you think Hussein's ""evil regime"" is feeling the effects in their palaces? It just reinforces their hatred for us. Why should the people of Iraq support us when we continually deny them food and medicine?  Furthermore, documents in the Defense Intelligence Agency show that the U.S., despite the Geneva Convention, intentionally destroyed Iraq's water supply, which would, of course, kill more civilians including children. Sanctions put on chemicals keep Iraqis from being able to purify their water, and because of it, innocent people die every day.  Iraqis aren't the only ones who are suffering. In Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the U.S. houses a prison that holds 620 terrorist suspects from over 40 countries.  Unfortunately for them, because we captured them during peacetime, the U.S. won't declare them prisoners of war and entitle them to the rights of the Geneva Convention.  Despite Amnesty International and other ""watchdog"" groups pressuring the government to charge them or let them go, the U.S. seemingly has no plans of doing such a thing. The prisoners' futures remains uncertain.   The more I think about it, the more ashamed I've become to call myself American. Not because of our hypocritical foreign policy, or even the atrocities that our government commits, but because when I look around, I see so many blind nationalists so prepared to wage a war they know nothing about. This war isn't about liberals or Democrats. It's not about chemical or nuclear weapons. It's not even about fundamental human rights. It's about the same thing every war is about: politics.  The really sad part is, after Bush goes ahead, attacks Iraq and overthrows Saddam Hussein, the American people are going to mindlessly re-elect him to another term so he can finish waging the war against terrorism. Maybe if we're looking for terrorism, we're looking in the wrong place."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"I don't think I can take much more of this... my throat kills, I can't sing, I can't teach effectively, and I'm a choral and general music teacher (or student teacher, anyway)... what the hell am I good for?  I'm about to call in dead and stay in my room until I get better.  If I disappear for a month or two, you'll all know why.  I can't deal with this anymore.  I can't even get in a decent breath."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"In the doldrums a bit.  Not quite the apocalypse things have been anymore, thank you very much.  I'm grateful for that.  But not quite as nice as I'd like, either.  Things are just kind of stagnating.    Teaching is such an up-and-down ride.  It's exhilarating and heartbreaking, sometimes both within the time frame of 5 minutes.  Just when you think you have something figured out, **POOF**!  You're wrong.  Figuring out who belongs to which personality is bad enough, but realizing that kids' personalities can change by the minute is sometimes enough to want to throw in the towel.    My sixth graders, as a class, are a trying bunch.  It would be easier if I could just write them off and not care at all.  But there are always some good kids in the bad bunch.  I guess that's good -- keeps me coming back for them, if nothing else.  Lauren and I are on the mend.  The trouble is that the seamstress is blind.  So, whether the mending creates a blanket, shirt, or pair of pants remains to be seen.  However, a sewn and mended SOMETHING has to be better than a torn and hewn ANYTHING, right?  I think so.  I am still at school.  4:15pm.  And I'll be here till 6pm today.  Select Chorus starts today.  I hope it turns out okay.  I don't think I can deal with another group I'd rather avoid.  Which reminds me -- I think I have more work to do.  I'm still here.  Give a call, come visit sometime.  It would be nice to see you."

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Hello, philosophical...  It's just been a good day.  I co-taught a workshop in New Hampshire for  urlLink NHMEA  with Dr. Neelly and Katrina Armando on childhood music and quality singing and a reading session for elementary and middle school.  And it was just great.  Fifty people showed up!  And they seemed to like me!  And... wow.  It's just nice to relax and reflect.    I'm a bit nervous about the next part of my life.  I'm getting interviews and trying to get a job teaching choir... all the while hoping that I'm not following the wrong path.  I have this drive to travel and see the world.  Part of me thinks I should join  urlLink Peace Corps .  Another part thinks I should just move to Southern California because the weather's so damn nice - but that is the same part that hates this weather we've had for the past several weeks.  Another part thinks that maybe teaching music overseas wouldn't be such a bad idea.  And then there's the stay-in-Connecticut-and-teach-music voice, which is the one I've been listening to lately.  I'm just not sure!  I suppose that I just need to follow whatever path is right for me, right now... and not worry quite so much about the ramifications.  Some people wouldn't agree with that, I know.  Those are the people who don't agree with my ""values"" or the ""way I live my life"".    To hell with them.    I think I'm doing quite well right now, thank you.  I've got a lot of things going for me.  And unless I've unwittingly managed to deceive countless friends and acquaintances - and MYSELF - I just might be that nice, caring, understanding person that everyone (including me) seems to think that I am.    --------  I want to see the world.  I want to be everywhere and do everything.  And I'm just me, with one set of indivisible legs and feet, capable of doing only one thing at a time.  And I stress over that as though I can change it by stressing.  --------  I tend to think that everyone I come into contact with is capable of achieving greatness.  Sometimes I even think that everyone IS greatness.  I wonder if that's good teaching philosophy... or if I'm just deluded.  Am I making any sense?  And what about all those ""stupid people"" that I hate: the ones who drive like assholes... the ones who think the world's out to get them... the ones who are out to get the world... the ones who just don't get the 'big picture'... the people who choose hate instead of love... the people who are 'devout' Christians and then can't even comprehend ""love thy neighbor"", or even more: ""love thy enemy""...  Are these people capable of greatness?  Much of government and powerful people fall into this ""stupid people"" category.  Are they really great?  Or are they just powerful fucks who got there by beating down other people just so they could be taller by standing on their carcasses?  --------  It's going to be one of those nights.  But I think, this time, it's a good thing.  Oh yes, and I'm in love.  That goes without saying, but some things bear repeating.  Hurrah for contradictory notions in the same sentence."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Quick thoughts   A few quick thoughts before I fall into bed:  VC tonight was amazing.  My stint of being in charge until June has begun, and it is going better than I ever imagined.  This is what I need to do.  I could go on forever on that, but I think that's enough for now.  Hence, I am realizing that I could be a great teacher in the public schools.  I have it in me.  But I'm not sure I really want to do that.  I don't want to learn how to be a more effective beat-downer of students so they will conform and listen and do what I want.  Somebody's got to do it, I guess.  But I shouldn't be the one to do it, because I resent them every day for it, at least the ones who cause the problem.  Some of them are amazing people.  The rest need to leave.    You know how college isn't for everyone?  Most people understand that.  Maybe all of public school should be the same way.  If you don't want to be there, fine.  Then leave.  And get the hell out of the way for the rest of us who want to learn what we're learning.    So many problems with today's schools.  And I don't want to help fix them.  I want out.  Well, time for bed.  I'm committed until June.  May as well continue making a difference to the few who care.  They deserve my best.  I just wish they (and I) could actually LEARN.

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"This week has been a drag.  Literally.  I have been struggling to get out of my own way this week.  I'm sure that it was started off by getting insufficient sleep in the beginning of the week on Monday and Tuesday nights.  But it seems to be more than that.  I think it's a nasty combination of insufficient sleep, mold growing in the carpet in my classroom, and me not eating as frequently as I should.    But is that really it?  I've been doing that all year.  But this week when I leave school I just feel like crap, like passing out, like nasty allergies... what gives?  I've tried to blog this week several times and just given up in the middle because I couldn't focus on making any kind of point.  Much worse than normal.  Wish I could figure it out.  But -- on the flip side -- there are nine and one-half days left of school.  Single digits, baby.  I can put up with just about anything for that long.

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Here it is, late on a Thursday night.  I'm finally done with ALL of my obligations for student teaching.  Tonight was the 7th grade concert at Sedgwick, and the 8th grade concert was Monday night.  All went quite well, much went better than it ever had before.  Such is the nature of a concert situation, I think - the kids always reach beyond themselves as the pressure hits.    Life's good.  I've not worked much this week.  Did a lot of reading, searched for auto insurance... I bought some cheap used books, which is proving to be a great and cost-effective way to feed my appetite for new reading material.  I fixed my computer (knock on wood) from its unexplained bouts of crashing - I think it was overheating.  A new heatsink and several new fans later, it's running much cooler with no problems thus far.  I think Lauren and I are settling out.  It's as if we're forming some unspoken, unconscious covenant that addresses both our needs and wants  - most of the time! :)  - and for the most part, we're learning how to get what we need and want without causing undue stress on the other.  We've had our ups and downs, but she's just the best.  And she's understanding, and loving.  And I can call her a poophead without fear of major retribution (read: lasting scars).  Oh, I'm in love.

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Today was a good day.  One of my students started a petition to keep general music at the middle school -- it's been cut for next year as of now.  This sixth grader is just one of the coolest people around.  And I didn't even suggest it -- it's all his idea.  How great is that?  Another student today asked for a picture of me because I'm ""the best chorus teacher we've ever had"".  Of course, I think this is one of the same students who has a crush on me (oy...) but the sentiment was still nice.  We had yearbook pictures taken in the gym first period during chorus... after which I was supposed to get the girls back on track and run what amounted to a 20-minute rehearsal.  Much to my surprise, I pulled it off.  They sound good.  Not great yet, but they're getting there.  My seventh grade class is producing some great Powerpoint presentations on rock of the 1960's.  They're really getting into it.  My sixth grade class wrote their very own blues lyrics, which they ""persuaded"" me to sing at the end of the class.  They wrote some great stuff, and we had fun.  My fifth grade class learned two new songs today, quite well, and learned a bit about Chopin as well and what a concerto is.  Last period chorus, the fifth and sixth graders from hell, was another adventure, but a productive one.  I was on fire today and a bunch of the kids didn't know what hit them.  We actually managed to be quiet before singing today, and also stand without bursting into conversation -- a huge accomplishment for this group.  Then, after school, we had a musical rehearsal where the kids finally started singing their heads off.  For once, they were really putting themselves into it.  And they sounded great.  I was sweating my balls off trying to get them to do it, but it was worth it, I think.  Today was a good day.  Fuck *people* who don't seem to think I can do a good job at this.  Fuck them all.  Today, I kicked ass.  And I was an amazing teacher."

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"""Teaching is a moral and sacred act. I think the characteristics of a good teacher begin with genuine respect for the student's mind. That respect conveys to students that they can take themselves seriously. Next to that, I think, is a real love for the young and joy in seeing them grow and develop. Next to that is a passion for the discipline, but if you lack respect for the young mind and the love of young people, you won't be able to communicate it very well. We can teach people to be good teachers up to a relatively high degree, but I think teaching is also a talent. The really great teachers have this kind of X-ray vision that allows them to look at a young person and see right into that important intersection of emotion and intellect and see how to harness that emotional energy and intellectual effort and bring it to fruition. And that is a kind of X-ray vision that can't be taught. You either have it or you don't.""   -Jil Ker Conway (author/historian), ""In Praise of Our Teachers"""

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Written today around 10am:  Standing on the brink of a precipice with no way to see beyond. The valley below is not visible, not blurred, not hazy. It's as if it never was.  A void. My future is uncertain.  And I'm about ten mouse clicks away (give or take) from hopping on the next plane. I feel an uncontrollable urge to go somewhere - anywhere - as far away as possible. Thailand sounds nice. And, for once, I don't really care to examine why. I just want to escape.  Rejoice in the madness, revel in the insanity."

JSZ5Y36,male,24,Well here we are in beautiful San Diego.  We arrived here after one long night at about 3pm yesterday.  We'll probably be here for the next couple of days staying with Ehren's aunt and uncle.  We haven't gotten a chance to do much yet but I'll write more later... we're going surfing tomorrow.  It's really nice to have had a day to just relax and do absolutely nothing...   More later..
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Thinkin'   Philosophizing about tons of stuff.  Life is good.  Vacation is much needed, though I am not sure my view has changed on what I'm taking the vacation  from .  But regardless... I guess I'll be more charged up for the final push to June.    I'm trying my damndest to take charge of my life.  I've been whining too long... even I have been getting annoyed by it.  It's been a shit of a year, and it's time I do something about it to make sure I don't let it happen again.  Bagley seems to want me to stay where I am.  I wish he could see inside my head, because I don't feel like he really knows what's going on there.  Although...  I value his opinion so much that it still makes me reconsider leaving.  This week has been great so far.  Yesterday I started writing my first song ever on the guitar.  I'm psyched.  The lyrics actually don't suck for once, and it's going well.  I don't know where my inspiration has come from, but I'm going with it.  Been hanging out with friends a LOT lately, which is awesome.  I miss them a lot.  Dan and I checked out apartments again today, reinforcing why I'm stoked to move in with him.  I think that's going to work out really well.  I think I have been drunk almost every night this week.  I love vacation.  I think it should happen more often.  Like all the time.  No, really.  I think I will start my own country based on that.  It will be called Vacationland.  Wait, that's Maine.  Well, back to the drawing board.  Ehren out."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Who am I?   This might just be more pointless than usual.  My goal is to find a point, thereby justifying this entire post.  Summer depression seems to have set in.  I feel like I have so many things that I'm supposed to be doing, and yet can't seem to convince myself to do any of them.  I feel lonely, yet I have company often.  I know myself, yet can't explain simple things I do.  I search for meaning in my life from many angles, yet never answer the questions fully or adequately.  Sometimes I think that I, myself, am the meaning of my life -- that I must find motivation within.  Other times I search for it in spirituality or ""God"" or the church.  I think that my problem is that I ask too many questions to be at ease with much.  An inquisitive nature is wonderful for finding stuff out, but it runs counteractive to the Zen-like state I crave right now.   Richard Shindell is an amazing musician.  His cd ""Courier"" is playing right now in the background, which I cannot recommend heartily enough.   I look around my new apartment and I think ""Damn, I have it made.""  I've got all sorts of stuff -- more than I know what to do with, and certainly more than I have places for.  But stuff doesn't really mean much in the end.  I have a beautiful, wonderful, compassionate, understanding, loving, and caring girlfriend in Lauren.  I have a great job that I'm fairly sure I can enjoy and do well in, but that I know is not where I can stay for a long time.  None of  these things really seems to sink in at times like this.  It's like I've got up this shell that blocks out everything -- good stuff, bad, indifferent.  It doesn't matter.  It's all crap.  But it's not crap.  And I know that too.  I think I'm scared on a lot of fronts.  I don't feel like I know myself, not substantially anyway.  Do any of us really know ourselves?  Or each other, for that matter?  Can we?  Is it even possible?  I am inclined to say YES to all of those questions.  I know that people  do   know themselves, and that people can know other people.  I wonder how those people do it.  I wonder what I'm missing sometimes... why I can't do it, I mean.  Seems like self-knowledge shouldn't be that difficult a thing to do.  Lauren walks downstairs and hangs from the beam that crosses the bottom of the stairs.  I am struck by how amazingly nonchalantly breathtaking she is.  She spins across the room with hands in the air, dancing to music nobody else hears.  She pauses at the fish tank to kiss it and commune for a moment, then decides that I might need some company and plunks herself down next to me, where she lies down and nuzzles up persistently under my elbow.  Oh, I'm in love.  Sounds like somebody knows who I am -- and what I need -- after all.  There's hope for us all.  Guess I found my point."
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Found this on Bootsnall.com... worth a read   WAG THE WORLD  3rd Night News 4th issue  You are being seduced people. We are all being actively seduced. Much like in a movie or a play when you dont know how it is going to turn out, Youre being seduced into paying attention to what is on the stage and nothing else. What was going on with the camera men, director and producers, back stage, you never even guessed. Your curiosity had you by the frontal lobes people. You were seduced. For entertainment value that is fine but what is going on now, is for our very lives. I am fairly certain that you are familiar with the term Wag the Dog. What is going on right now, right in our faces is Wag the World. Take this election coming up for example. The polls (conducted and paid for by who knows who?) say that this race is neck and neck. Too close to call, a cliff hanger and most of the public does not know how this is going to turn out. This is seductive isnt it? Curiosity asks, Who will win? Will it be Skull and Bones Bush, or Skull and Bones Kerry? With all voting machines owned by republicans and with no paper trail, I guess it would pretty much be a toss up of who comes out on top. So why do the drama?  The only reason is to deeply involve the public in a partisan conflict whos out come has no more effect than an NFL, NBA, NHL, Baseball game or NASCAR race. You understand that all those leagues are businesses dedicated to enlisting your allegiance and emotion so that you will pay attention and your dollar$ to see how it comes out. Right? And what difference does that out come produce? Unless you had Bet the farm on the game or on the season not all that much, huh? Sure was exiting though wasnt it? A close game or a close race makes people pay attention and gets us even more involved. Get out there and vote people! Be proud to participate in this great democracy where Every Vote Counts! (As long as it is for whom we, the powers that BE appointed as our stooges.) I wonder how come the New England Patriots football team has been in every Superbowl since September 11th 2001? How do you hide a conspiracy? Make it so big that no one can imagine it. Does 9/11ring a bell for anyone?  What good is having all the POWER if you dont go ahead and use it? And if you already have all of the money and natural resources of the planet what would you be hungry for? Yes the powers that be, the international corporations, insurance companies and banks do own everything including the air that you are breathing. So what do They want? They want the only stuff that you have ever really had, Your Time and Attention. All of your supposed possessions or your varied relationships you only have for a Time and then only as long as you are paying Attention to them and that includes your body. Your total Time and Attention is what They want and They are doing a bang up job of getting what They want arent they?  What is going on here are actions to divide the people to the maximum degree, by small degrees at a time, as in a seduction. You know this people, if you rush too fast in a seduction it will have to be aborted or it becomes a rape. Now rape is resisted and in the past many leaders were caught, taken out and murdered for the rape of the people and the national treasuries. In this case the treasuries are already secured so the reach is for the absolute enslavement of your Time and attention, your emotions and your passion. Really, stinkin sneaky isnt it?   Slowly at first, around 1755 or so, Power started its creepy plan. Ever since, stage by stage, there have been more and more issues brought out to shock the public to cause them to rise in outrage and to divide the public while unifying power.  Divide and Conquer, divide to the MAX for total victory. All of this is being done very methodically. Each step is taken to the degree that you the public can understand the reasoning whether you agree with the action or not you certainly can understand why they would propose such actions. If they were to do too radical a departure, the seduction would be over and the public would revolt too early, so they have to build this slowly. They have to raise your emotions and passions slowly by degree, either for or against something. What is coming you see, when you care enough, when your emotions of anger or fear have been evoked strongly enough, when your passions have been whipped into frenzy, when you are willing to kill for your beliefs, They (Republican and or Democrat corporate media puppets) will have finished their job and can kick back and enjoy the fruits of ruling a slave population on planet earth. What a Party! Can you imagine all the Power!?? They can.   I have an admission to make. For the last 15 years or so I have been a news addict. I have watched, read and or listened to all of the shit that has rolled down hill and have built some big ass calluses. Believe me you need em to sit through it all. I understand why you would not want to. Some body had to do it. Through it all there has appeared a definite pattern that is designed to slowly turn up the outrage factor. Like a toad is a warm bucket of water, we are sitting there as the heat rises to boiling and all the toadies get cooked.  Those of you who are reading this and the earlier 3rd Night News have a very special advantage. We know how all of this eventually turns out Ethics over Power and a smoother ride from the 4th Day (2005) onward. What this means is that we do not have to become seduced by the drama. Have your ever watched a movie like 4 or 5 times? What happened to the dramatic effect? It went limp didnt it?  You did get to see a lot more of went into the movie as you watched it over and over though didnt you? Like camera angles, lighting, costume details and innuendos sprinkled all over for you to discover. This is because you now know how it turns out So now with the Mayan calendar cycles we can see when and how, this is all going to turn out and the big production drama being put on for us has very little effect. In fact the performance sort of looks clownish and frankly there are some very poor actors in bit parts out there.   But the big show of the 2004 election is going to make WWWF look like the Amateur Hour. This will end up being actually physically bloody politics towards the end. Along the way the general public will be leaked the information (by various whistle blowers) that George Bush and Cheney did do 9/11. This will be used as a Kerry, last ditch campaign ploy to get out the votes against Bush. It makes sense that if they were really desperate that they would do that right? Thats very important, because this all has to be done in degrees. It has to feel natural not too sudden or the seduction is aborted. They are right now working it, enflaming every cultural, economic, religious or ethnic conflict that they can find!  They busy are turning up the heat and off the lights!  All of this is being done by the way, on the part of consciousness that it is really running this show on a very particular schedule. (The Galactic Cycle is all about discernment.) This schedule is a repeating cycle that ascends in a spiral path described by the Mayan calendar. What we know of what will probably occur in our near future, is from the past, and from historical records of what consciousness has gone through during the same energies in previous cycles.  We also know that the best two men for the job of Pres and Vise Pres are the only two Democrats that got totally ignored so far. (If you dont know who I am talking about, the media blackout worked on you) So we have Scull and Bones Kerry as the corporate appointed Democrat nominee and these two other guys who are running on the Consciousness/light & laughter platform. The latter platform is to be the dominating consciousness base of 2005 or the 4th Day, on the Mayan calendar.   How does someone get picked to be a presidential candidate? Who would the power elite be able to trust concerning the 100s of trillions of dollars that they control world wide? Not just anybody thats for sure. And not anyone who stands up for the citizens, they might spend some of that money on the people! Oh my God No! So what is the process? It starts in school, some law school or Ivy League special club type institution. It starts with an invitation offered because of your lineage, because of your connections and desire to become powerful. Favors are offered as a reward for joining these even more special clubs and secret societies. To begin with the favors involve grades, drugs, alcohol and sex. All the memberships begin with a ceremony or initiation that binds the person to secrecy. How do you do that for sure? By photographing the new member doing things sexually that would instantly ruin their lives if it was ever revealed.  Now you are in and not ever going to tell anything about the workings of the group. Later, when a member is approached by the club for a return favor, that member had better perform or he will not progress up the power ladder. These favors start small and only slightly illegal but are rewarded with lavish gifts of sex, money connections and prestige. The next favors are more involved as a test of the members resourcefulness and the strength of desire to gain money, power, and sexual escapades. Rewards of these favors lead into the area of witnessing ceremonies of taboo and torturous sex. (Regular sex orgies having lost their kick by now on the up and coming member.) Once a member desires public office or a ready made business success these rituals become a mandatory attendance. (All on film of course.) Once in the office or head of the corporation the member will be expected to personally perform the ritual torture and or killing of the victim(s). After the member has demonstrated his or her willingness to personally torture and murder on command he or she rises to the, not so short list, of leadership potential. How would you make sure that someone was willing to kill 10s of thousands or millions of persons for the sole benefit of your powerful friends? Through duly witnessed and photographed demonstrations of their total lack of regard for human suffering or loss of life. Now the member has become someone nominatable for Pres. or Prime minister of what ever country they happen to be lurking in. Dont think so? Cant happen here?  Where do 150,000 + kids disappear to each year in this country alone? And you thought it was only pretty little white girls advertised on TV that go missing? Check out what is happening in the Belgium courts right now over the pedophile sex ring charges and the numbers of suicides among government leaders and policemen all across Europe.  Have you heard of the Amber Alert Bill? Do you know how and why and what that bill does? Do you know why it was rushed through to be signed with rider bills attached? Now there is a system to alert everyone on the road of any vehicles make, color and license plate # in which everyone believes there is a stolen kid. No matter why the police want this car and driver, everyone thinks that it is a kidnapping. Welcome to the US Public Police Force, you are now deputized with the blessings of the state.  Night Clubs in your area shutting down? As a rider to the Amber Alert bill there is a law that any club owner or venue renter, be it he or she, is guilty of the possession of all the controlled substances found in the possession of patrons at their club or venue. This will stop people from gathering at any place other than Christian revival meetings, football games, stockcar races or any other corporate endorsed events. No drug checks there huh?   So, hows it going to go from how bad it is now, to how it should be in 2005? VERY QUICKLY is the answer to that question. Very quickly indeed. The storm will rise. The storm will rage and the storm will pass leaving a cleaner environment for renewed growth. During each 4th Day the newest consciousness in this case, ETHICS overcomes the previous consciousness, POWER and new foundations are laid for the new consciousness to develop along its evolutionary path toward the next evolutionary jump. The next jump being the consciousness of Conscious Co-Creation. As you are already seeing in your lives today, there are more and more synchronicities, and random telepathic experiences happening. We are stepping into our roles of Being creators right now. And in fact creating your own survival during the coming changes will be only way to survive. This is an evolution after all. Evolution is a fabulously effective tool. Look how far weve come from cellular ooze in just 820 million years. But Evolution has no mercy. This does have to be tough on a Creator, just on victims. Got it?  We know how it comes out, with light, love and laughter prevailing.  In service, Ian Xel Lungold"
JSZ5Y36,male,24,"I'm done.  I'm actually done.  I made it.  I've completed every single requirement for fulfillment of my two bachelor's degrees.  And I'll be graduating one week from tomorrow.  Today was my last day of student teaching at Sedgwick.  It's been a blast, and today was great.  Lots of cool things happened.  For starters, John Bennett, the orchestra teacher, decided to call many of his friends in other districts (left several messages to call him back, actually - it WAS in the middle of the school day) to tell them they should hire me because I'm just a great teacher.  One of the people he called (and an old friend of his) is none other than Sal Cicciarella, of Ellington High School!  How bout that.  And I thought that lead was dead.  So John wants to talk to Sal about me this weekend, and I also have in two messages to people in the Board of Education office in Ellington checking status of my application.  I'm trying to stir up as many irons as I have to give myself options for a job.    The next cool thing happened when I called the Arts office in West Hartford.  The conversation went something like this:   Me: ""Hi Debbie, this is Ehren Brown over at Sedgwick.  I'm calling to check on the status of my application for the middle school/high school choral position you have open?"" Debbie:  ""Oh, Ehren!  I'm glad you called!  I've been trying to get in touch with you.  Are you available to come in for an interview next Thursday?""   Needless to say, I was psyched.  Goes to show how being assertive and proactive can really help a guy out.  I've got an interview there on Thursday at 2:30 after I sub for Joe all day.  And the best part is that Joe is going to be one of the people who is interviewing me!  I love it...  Then, I got home to find an email from Bob McGray (principal of Lebanon Middle School) that read as follows:   Hello Ehren, Dr. Doyen enjoyed her visit with you.  We would like to have you return and be able to spend a little time with Alesia Gagnon, our band director and Department Chair, who I believe you met.  Our Director of curriculum, Bonnie Hanna (a former music teacher)  would also like to meet you.  My secretary, Debbie Saucier, will contact you on Monday to arrange a mutually convenient time.   If you have any questions feel free to call me at xxx-xxxx.  Have a great weekend. Bob McGray   So, to summarize:  I'm done with UConn.  I'm done with student teaching.  I have people making connections for me trying to get me as many interviews as they can.  My teacher's interviewing me for a position in West Hartford.  Lebanon wants me back AGAIN (making this my third trip there with one additional observation Bob did with me at Sedgwick).  And Ellington just might come through with something after all.  Life is good.  Now to get that passport..."

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"It's been a good weekend.  This morning was spent singing ""You Raise Me Up"" at church a la Josh Groban, except he's rich and I can sing better.  No, really.  I kicked ass.  I don't say that easily.  Susan was in tears and came over to give me a hug afterward.  An aside: isn't it irritating how Christians usurp culture toward their own ends?  I guarantee that ""You Raise Me Up"" was not written as an epistle to God, but rather as a love song.  And yet it's so easily turned.  They're good at stuff like that.  I wish they would just leave other peoples' culture alone and stop bastardizing what isn't theirs.  Okay, done.  My parents came down to hear me sing this morning, then took Dan and I out to Rein's for lunch.  Afterward, Dan and I came back here and I slept for two hours.  Ali came over and dinner ensued at Boston Market - 20 bucks for a 3 person meal.  Food from the gods.  Then we caught a showing of ""Troy"" and watched Brad Pitt kick some serious ass with his jump/twist/stab-you-in-the-neck move.  He had some serious badass tricks built into his character, almost enough to give Legolas a run for his money.  Almost.  You just can't beat an elf.

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Vernon Chorale as a symbol... but of what?   I walked into Vernon Center Middle School tonight at 7:30pm exactly for the weekly rehearsal of the Vernon Chorale.  Warm-ups started about ten seconds later.  The usual, nothing exotic, just unison hums and oohs and five-note scales.  And I was moved to tears.  Fortunately, I kept it under control -- what a mess THAT would have caused.  Tears?  Me?  For warm-ups?  I guess I was just struck by the music... the sound of forty voices joining their talents at one time, in one place, together for music.  I don't get that at middle school.  Too many of those kids don't give a fuck about singing at all to ever unite the group in ANYTHING, let alone music or voices or...  Why do I do it?  Would teaching high school be any different?  Would it be any different in the town I teach in?  Do I really want to put myself through this for another year?  And that begs the question:  If not teaching, then what?  What would I do?  Maybe what CAN'T I do is a better question.  I do have a lot of options that I could pursue.  I thought I could do this for a while.  But it's tearing me up.  I wonder if there's another reason that is behind this, but I can't see it.    ............  In other news, I saw Rufus Wainwright last night at Toad's Place in New Haven with Anagha.

JSZ5Y36,male,24,"Why I don't want to be a teacher   I was going to save this tirade for another time, but it needs out.  So here goes.    Our educational ""system"".  It's this noble thing, education.  Priming the young minds of today so they can become the leaders of tomorrow.  Work hard, be a good person, and life will hand you bliss on a silver platter.  It just ain't so.  To get to the core of the problem, we need to go back to why public schools -- or compulsory education, for that matter -- began in the first place.  It all goes back to child labor laws.  Until 1938, children could pretty much work any job they wanted, for as many hours as they wanted.  And they did.  Large families were in vogue.  More children meant more laborers, which equaled more money for the family and -- usually -- more food on the table.  Nobody gave this a second thought.  School was something for the rich upper class, and everyone else when they could fit it in between work.    Enter the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938.  Suddenly, there was a societal push to ""protect"" our children.  And yes, this was a new concept.  Until then, the concept of childhood as we know it simply did not exist.  Children were not coddled or protected, they were introduced into the world quite early and expected to adapt.  Life was hard.  Someone, somewhere decided this simply could not do, and that our youth needed to not be exposed to these (admittedly) severely harsh conditions of factory work and the like, as well as working the long weeks that had been common.  Children everywhere were probably grateful.  Working conditions were pretty bad, and to get out of them must have seemed like a great idea.  This raised, however, the pressing question of what to do with all these recently liberated youth --  who were now roaming the streets and getting into all sorts of mischief, as idle children are wont to do.    Somebody came up with the idea of creating schools, great centers of learning, where the children would be taught.  ""Yes, that's it!"" they must have said.  The idea was embraced.  Unfortunately, most humans suffer from a lack of vision and truly original thought.  This being the Industrial Revolution, the schools were modeled after the only system most people knew: the factory.  And thus schools were damned before they even started.   What do we teach our students?  Some say languages and sciences, others would say arts and philosophy.  The sad truth is that these disciplines -- and I use that word purposefully,  disciplines  -- are little more than vehicles to teach our children the one true task: to conform.  Oh, we make it look good.  Most of us even manage to believe otherwise.   ""Oh, my schools weren't like  that ,"" you say.  ""We were encouraged to think freely and be our own person.""    Really?  Remember elementary school?  Those early formative years?  What happened to you when you got out of line because you wanted to?  What happened when you just had to share the latest gossip during a math lesson?  Or consider this: when did you plan your own day at school?  Did you ever get to decide what you would do?  I mean, really decide, not just decide given a certain set of choices.  The choiceless choice is the teacher's best weapon against student unrest.  ""Look,"" they say.  ""You can choose what you're going to do."" Bullshit.  They've already decided for you.  They created the choices, and whatever you pick will still fit into their agenda.  It's all about control.    Perhaps you've heard it under a different name: citizenship.  To be a good citizen...  now that's certainly something I remember learning about in school.  Remember the Pledge of Allegiance?  Do you remember reciting it every day in school with everyone else in eerie unison without questioning why?  Did you ever have a Jehovah's Witness in your classroom who remained sitting during the Pledge?  Did you think he/she was different because they didn't conform?  Why are you not saying the Pledge?  How could you NOT pledge allegiance to the flag or the President or Allah or whoever?  Children are taught to follow directions and not speak out of turn.  Creative divergent thinkers, or disruptive students as teachers call them, are squashed as quickly as possible.  These are ideal traits for factory workers, who perform mundane tasks every day without question or thought.  They are not ideal for today's world.  Can you imagine a world with leaders who are truly divergent thinkers?  People who weren't afraid to try something radically different?  People who could see the bigger picture?  Maybe someone who could actually see that war begets more war and nothing else.  But I am forgetting that our children are created by the system.  A system with centuries of history that is bent on perpetuating itself.  Creating original, divergent thinkers would be counterproductive to the goal.  And so we are stuck in a cyclical paradox, unable to extricate ourselves from the loop.  I don't know how much longer I can rail against this bullshit.  Being part of this system makes me sick.  It's like the Borg.  The best I can figure is that I will either give in and become assimilated or become an El-Aurian of sorts who resists successfully but who is forever outside the world that most people know.  Open your eyes, people.  I don't care if you think it's bad or good.  But I don't think you can shoot a hole in my logic about the reality I'm describing.  If you can, please do -- I could use a better outlook."

6MHTB7C,female,47,"People As Political Props   ( urlLink Permanent link to this essay )  People frequently use other people as props.  This is most common in families - think of the way most parents dress up and show off their kids.   This is a fairly innocent use of people as props.  It does no harm to the child to dress the cute six month old baby as a Halloween pumpkin, and, meanwhile, the parents get ""Oooh isn't she cute?"" from their friends and neighbors.  This can become more malevolent over time - did little Jon Benet Ramsey really enjoy being made up, gowned, and paraded at baby beauty pagents?  We'll never know.  Or think of the way some older men acquire younger girlfriends or trophy wives.  The way some women live through their husbands and children.    There are times when people use other people for their own needs rather than letting others stand on their own.  But, increasingly, people use others as political props.   The ""props"" tend to be people who cannot stand on their own.  It tends to be done most often to women who are unable to speak for themselves.  Twenty-five years ago, it was Karen Ann Quinlan.  And, today, it's Terri Schiavo.    Terri Schiavo is being used.  She became brain dead in 1990.  Brain scans show that the portion of her brain that governs consciousness has been nonexistent for years.  It is a sick parody to photograph a brain dead person with an autonomic reflex to light and then treat her as if she was conscious.  She is being anthropomorphized the way a person talks to a dog and asks ""Oh, does Fido want a dog bicuit?"" when the dog barks.  When people are so quick to jump up and down and talk about honoring the dignity of the individual, they have robbed Terri Schiavo of any ""dignity"" she may have had.   What happened to Terri Schiavo is extemely sad, but no one can bring her back.  She'll never talk to her family, get out of bed or do anything.  She's being moved around like a puppet, and her family ought to be ashamed of themselves.  People are using Terri to reflect  their needs .  Their need for her to be alive.  She may be still breathing, but she isn't really alive.  People die, and it is fascinating to me that people who say they believe in religious teachings seem the most determined to force physical existence long after the brain had died.  Terri died in 1990.  It's a sad view, but a realistic view.  All the tube feeding in the world isn't going to bring her back.  Some day, I don't want to be a breathing husk in a hospital bed.  I signed an organ donor card in 1978 and have discussed living will issues with my husband.  Today, even though I'm middled aged and in reasonable health, I am filling out a lengthy living will.  I absolutely do not want to exist indefinitely in a kind of ""Nazgul"" state - neither living nor dead.   If I'm seriously injured, sure, use the heroic mesures if I have a chance, but don't keep the feeding tube going years after all real chances have gone.  I hope that any disabled people who may be reading this essay aren't reading this essay as an anti-disabled people piece.  If you are reading this piece, you are conscious, you are capable of reading and comprehending the world around you.  After Christopher Reeve was so tragically injured back in 1995, he was understandably devastated by his condition.  But his wife Dana turned to him and said, ""You're still you."" That acceptance made a huge difference to his acceptance of himself after his accident.   He understood precisely what happened to him.  Terri Shiavo is incapable of understanding what has happened to her.  Terri Shiavo isn't the person who collapsed in 1990.  To make Terri a symbol of all disabled people is just wrong.   Simplistic and wrong in every way.  To keep Terri breathing does not celebrate or honor life.  It means that people cannot comprehend the difference between living and breathing.  I don't want to be in a state where I'm merely breathing.  And I would hope all adults would make the same point by thinking about and signing a Living Will and giving a trusted friend or family member a durable power of attorney.

6MHTB7C,female,47,"When Will Lady Liberty Reopen?   September 11 was over two and a half years ago.  The main architectural symbol of our country's liberty, the Statue of Liberty, remains closed.  It is going to be at least another four months before the country determines enough changes have been made to it to be ""safe"" enough to enter.  I can certainly understand why the statue was closed in September of 2001, but  it's not clear why the statue has stayed closed for so long.  September 11 was over two and a half years ago.  The main legal symbol of our country's liberty, the Constitution, remains under attack by the current administration.  It's going to be at least another year before a more rational Federal government can throw out the ""Patriot"" Act.  It's going to be at least another year before a lot of people, a number of whom did nothing more than be in the wrong place at the wrong time, can fight for their freedom to return home.  I could understand why it was important to pick up any would-be terrorists.  But, as an American, the ""Patriot"" Act is contrary to our Constitution.  The single biggest attack to America since 9/11 has been from our own government.  Pity that."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Movies...   Around getting caught up with some  urlLink Noreascon 4  stuff this weekend, we went to the movies twice.  We saw  Under the Tuscan Sun  (a mostly charming movie for adults!) and  Secondhand Lions  (a mostly fun flick).  With  Tuscan Sun , we saw a bunch of previews for adult comedies, including Mike Newell's ensemble piece  Love, Actually  and the new Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson movie.  And, of course, with  Secondhand Lions , we saw the trailer for  Return of the King   Wow.  I knew what to expect.  We'd already bought the first DVD of  The Two Towers  even though we'll buy the extended edition the day it comes out.  So I'd seen the little ""pre-trailer"" for ROTK on that last month.  I'd downloaded online video people had captured of the trailer on Japanese TV the other day, and even that looked impressive.  But seeing it all on the big screen was just terrific.  I've been hanging out some at  urlLink theonering.net  over the last year, the place where LOTR fans hang out.  Today, they linked to a brilliant TTT review-parody -  the  urlLink DVD as reviewed by Gollum and Smeagol .  Go read it - amazingly enough, it seems to have been written by just your average journalist for a newspaper down in Chattanooga."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Weird Movie Connections   I've been sick since getting home.  The cold I picked up over Christmas seems to have slid into being the flu (aches, exhaustion), so I stayed home from work on Friday.  I'm actually starting to feel a little better today.  Anyway, when I get sick, I tend to watch movies, as my concentration isn't generally good enough to read books.  I'm not sure if this makes any sense or not, but as I was watching Witness yesterday, I found some weird connections between it and the Lord of the Rings movies.  True, there's the obvious connection - Viggo is in both.  He plays Moses Hochleitner, Daniel's (Alexander Gudonov) brother.  He has few lines (except for part of the ""horse with one ball"" story after the funeral and ""hello"" at the beginning of the barn-raising), is always smiling and wears a very light blue shirt.  If you want to spot him, you see him most of all in the barn-raising sequence - he's the first person Daniel introduces to John Book.  Now that's a tad tenuous, so there are more odd little connections.  There's little Lukas Haas, a fine actor a few years older than Elijah Wood.  The senstive little boy roles Lukas got in the early-mid '80s, Elijah got in the early '90s.    They even look quite a bit alike.  If you check out a current picture of him in IMDB, you'll see that Lukas still has a hobbit-like face.    If some visionary director had made LOTR in the '80s, you can see Harrison Ford would have been a natural for Strider.  Luckily, this didn't happen; while I like Harrison, and while he's a pretty good actor, I'm not sure he would have been up to it.  Finally, there's the ""stranger in a strange land"" theme, which is pretty obvious in both films."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Oops, They Got Me!    Ohhhh , the indignity of it all!   Just today at work, I complained to co-workers that no one has any good April Fools Day jokes anymore.   urlLink  The Pitt News   had a so-so April Fools Day issue.  There was nothing particularly funny on the Web.  Mebbe it was the war - no one seemed to think anything was funny.  At the end of a long day, I popped over to  urlLink The One Ring , the LOTR Movie fan Web, and my jaw just dropped when I read  urlLink this .  I dashed into my friend Laura's office.  ""We have to postpone our trip out to California next year -  Return of the King  is being delayed until next May!""  We commiserated for a few minutes - we're both dying to see  ROTK , and had decided to go to the annual Oscar party theonering.net throws.  But not now - not if  ROTK  can't even be up for any Oscars.  ""This movie's not out yet, and I'm already tired of hearing about it,"" grumbled my boss, as she passed by Laura's office.  She's a very dear person in most respects, with this one little blind spot.  I forwarded this lamentable news to my husband and daughter, then looked at the press release again.  Something about the date caught my eye...  I clicked on a link in the story and found that, yes, I'd been had!"
6MHTB7C,female,47,"On Volunteering and Not...   As I've mentioned in here once or twice, I've been having a longtime battle with insomnia.  Like lifelong.  In the past, the insomnia goes away after a few weeks or month, and I sleep fairly normally for a while.  But this time, I've been averaging about 5 hours of sleep for about 18 months.  This is further complicated by the fact that I'm in tht lovely grey area called ""perimenopause"" and I've been experiencing ridiculous mood swings for 1-2 weeks every month.  After having a lot of problems for a few months, things got worse and I started getting various types of medical help.  Sadly, I discovered that while some of these things worked some of the time, nothing worked consistently.  So I was told to do what I could do to reduce stress.  After much soul-searching, I decided the one fairly stressful area I could give up was being the Exhibits division director for Noreascon.  This was a very hard decision, but I'm not being as effective in this area as I want to be.  Further, when I get home from work, I'm usually too exhausted to do much more than do the dishes.  So, I have resigned my DHship. Deb was able to get an excellent replacement for me, Jim Hudson.  I'll stay on as a member of Jim's staff.  I'm still editing the Tenn essay GoH book.  I don't know what kind of Worldcon volunteering I'll be doing in the future.  I've asked to be a press staff person for Scotland, but haven't heard anything.  Over the next few years, I won't be as involved in Worldcon planning as I've been over the last eight years or so."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Fiction Writing Fiction   I've been fighting writers block (or not) for most of my adult life.  I've been writing fiction since I was a child.  I collected a bunch of rejection slips from various editors over the '70s, so I stopped writing.  I ""relapsed"" into writing a little in the late '80s and early '90s, got a few more rejection slips, but sold one story, "" urlLink Muse of Fire ,"" to  Midnight Zoo , a semi-prozine, back in 1993.  And then, I pretty much stopped writing fiction.  When I returned to college a few years ago, I finished my English Writing degree, and was lucky enough to have one really good English teacher (Chuck Kinder) at the end of my senior year.  He was very supportive.  But, when I was unemployed after college and had lots of time to write, I really didn't write all that much.  I submitted my best story to  Asimov's , but it seems to have gotten lost in the slush pile because I never heard back.  A few weeks ago, in the midst of lots of stress, I found myself thinking of a mainstream story I'd started during my return to college.  I've been working on it pretty steadily, and while it's going off in some directions I hadn't planned, I'm still writing.  I seem to do my best work on the bus - I actually outlined the rest of the novel over the last two days, and have written about 10,000 words over the last month.  I seem to be doing my best writing when I have no time left to be writing!  Then, today, I found a story I'd written about 10 years ago, a companion piece to ""Muse of Fire,"" has just been accepted by  urlLink Triangulation ,  a little fiction journal edited for our local SF club. Diane Turnshek says she has rejected a number of stories, and is really pleased with the ones she's accepted.   So I guess it's time to dust off that other story and resubmit it to  Asimov's ..."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Oscar 2003 Predictions and Commentary   OK, for the second time in 34 years, I'm missing part of the Oscars on Sunday.  Thank goodness for recorders!  But, it will be weird to walk in late (for the second year in a row).  I've seen most of the major movies, will note what I haven't seen and will go ahead with my predictions anyway. For the last few years, I've been hedging my bets with a ""will win (WW)"" and ""should win (SW).""  I'm an avid LOTR fan, though I liked Fellowship a little more than Two Towers, TTT is still a wonderful flick.  And it did get somewhat robbed already - it did have the best score, costuming, cinemetography, and make-up of last year.   However, in their ""infinite wisdom,""  Oscar people who apparently didn't see both movies decided that these categories were ""too similar"" to LOTR.    I'm not convinced that Peter Jackson himself was robbed, however, at least not for this year.  The acting categories have been quite strong over the last few years. There's only one mild embarassment in the bunch.  Performance by an actor in a leading role Adrien Brody in THE PIANIST (Focus Features) Nicolas Cage in ADAPTATION (Sony Pictures Releasing) (SW)  Michael Caine in THE QUIET AMERICAN (Miramax and Intermedia) (WW) Daniel Day-Lewis in GANGS OF NEW YORK (Miramax) Jack Nicholson in ABOUT SCHMIDT (New Line)  I haven't seen The Pianist, but I suspect I might be giving Adrien Brody a ""may win"" if I had.  Cage's performance was the one ""mild embarassment"" - Adaptation is a wildly erratic flick and Cage's performance is part of the problem.  Nicholson's performance in About Schmidt was certainly different but it bordered on posturing rather than performing. Michael Caine's performance in The Quiet American was quite extraordinary and very moving.  Few people have seen this movie, which was supposed to have been released in the fall of '01 but was held back as it was perceived as being ""anti-patriotic.""  The Americans, then as, unfortunately, right now, were not ""the good guys.""  I would like to see Caine win, but it will probably be Daniel Day-Lewis for his bravura performance in the flawed Gangs of New York.   Performance by an actor in a supporting role (SW,WW) Chris Cooper in ADAPTATION (Sony Pictures Releasing) (SW)Ed Harris in THE HOURS (Paramount and Miramax) Paul Newman in ROAD TO PERDITION (DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox) John C. Reilly in CHICAGO (Miramax) Christopher Walken in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (DreamWorks)  I avoid ties, but, gee, this is a really tough category.  Anyone could win here and I'd be happy (kind of like last year when Broadbent won).  Reilly was the Broadbent of this year, giving very good performances in several different movies.  Newman and Walken were also wonderful. But Cooper and Harris both went well beyond wonderful.  Harris's performance was heartbreaking and Cooper's was just plain hysterical. (As much as I would like to have seen Viggo Mortensen in this category, he was probably not quite up to the rest of the supporting actors.)   Performance by an actress in a leading role Salma Hayek in FRIDA (Miramax) Nicole Kidman in THE HOURS (Paramount and Miramax) Diane Lane in UNFAITHFUL (20th Century Fox) Julianne Moore in FAR FROM HEAVEN (Focus Features) (SW, WW) Rene Zellweger in CHICAGO (Miramax)  Another tough, tough category.  I've gone back and forth on the issue ""should Nicole win best actress for a supporting role?"" because she absolutely should have walked away with that Oscar. Her Virginia Woolf was magnificent.  I didn't see Diane Lane, but have the impression she was good.  Julianne Moore was subtly different in her two '50s housewife roles.  Salma Hayek was quite good in Frida.  But I have to go with Renee because she's grown so much as an actress over the last few years and was perfect in Chicago.   Performance by an actress in a supporting role (SW,WW) Kathy Bates in ABOUT SCHMIDT (New Line) Julianne Moore in THE HOURS (Paramount and Miramax) Queen Latifah in CHICAGO (Miramax) Meryl Streep in ADAPTATION (Sony Pictures Releasing) Catherine Zeta-Jones in CHICAGO (Miramax)  Another tough category, but I'd give the edge to Bates (and not just because of the hot tub scene).   Best animated feature film of the year ICE AGE (20th Century Fox) Chris Wedge (WW) LILO & STITCH (Buena Vista) Chris Sanders SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON (DreamWorks) Jeffrey Katzenberg (SW) SPIRITED AWAY (Buena Vista) Hayao Miyazaki TREASURE PLANET (Buena Vista) Ron Clements  Sprited Away is the best animated feature I've ever seen.  If there was any justice, it would win.  But Disney has gone out of its way to not distribute this flick, and probably isn't promoting for an Osacar, either.  Lilo & Stitch, while fun, wasn't special. Ditto Ice Age.  Treasure Planet stole ruthlessly from the artist Dean Morrissey without giving him any credit (yes, even worse than Lucas stole from Jim Gurney for some of the Alderan city scenes).  And Spirit looked dumb.  So while Spirited Away deserves to win, it probably won't. (on the other hand, I said the same about Halle Berry and Denzel Washington last year and I was wrong, so maybe...)   Achievement in costume design CHICAGO (Miramax) Colleen Atwood FRIDA (Miramax) Julie Weiss (SW,WW) GANGS OF NEW YORK (Miramax) Sandy Powell THE HOURS (Paramount and Miramax) Ann Roth THE PIANIST (Focus Features) Anna Sheppard  Achievement in art direction CHICAGO (Miramax) Art Direction: John Myhre Set Decoration: Gordon Sim FRIDA (Miramax) Art Direction: Felipe Fernandez del Paso Set Decoration: Hania Robledo (WW)GANGS OF NEW YORK (Miramax) Art Direction: Dante Ferretti Set Decoration: Francesca Lo Schiavo (SW)THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (New Line) Art Direction: Grant Major Set Decoration: Dan Hennah and Alan Lee ROAD TO PERDITION (DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox) Art Direction: Dennis Gassner Set Decoration: Nancy Haigh  These are the two Oscars that Gangs could legitimately win, and it probably will.  Frida has a slight chance because it becomes very operatic in design in places.  But TTT continues with its fascinating world building, and ought to win the art direction award.   Achievement in cinematography (WW) CHICAGO (Miramax) Dion Beebe (SW)FAR FROM HEAVEN (Focus Features) Edward Lachman GANGS OF NEW YORK (Miramax) Michael Ballhaus THE PIANIST (Focus Features) Pawel Edelman ROAD TO PERDITION (DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox) Conrad L. Hall  The photography in Far From Heaven was an amazing tribute to the Technicolor domestic flicks of the '50s and early '60s.  However, I suspect Chicago will sweep a bunch of tech and major awards, and this may be one of them.   Achievement in directing (SW, WW) CHICAGO (Miramax) Rob Marshall GANGS OF NEW YORK (Miramax) Martin Scorsese THE HOURS (Paramount and Miramax) Stephen Daldry THE PIANIST (Focus Features) Roman Polanski TALK TO HER (Sony Pictures Classics) Pedro Almodvar  Yes, Scorsese is owed.  But he keeps getting overwhelmed by a lucky first-timer.  Rob Marshall probably can't loose.  Gangs is too flawed, the Hours and the Pianist too dark and Almodovar too non-English.  Marshall may be the only lock, though I sometimes wonder if Polanski might win for the career he almost had.

I hate war movies, and nearly 1/3rd of the movie is one long battle scene that I can't take my eyes off of.  But Chicago will probably win.   Achievement in makeup FRIDA (Miramax) John Jackson and Beatrice De Alba THE TIME MACHINE (DreamWorks and Warner Bros.) John M. Elliott, Jr. and Barbara Lorenz  No Award.  The make-up in Time Machine sucked and while it was certainly good in Frida, it was too subtle to be particularly award-worthy.  Oh, right, these are the Oscars.  Give something to Frida!  Achievement in music written for motion pictures (Original score) CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (DreamWorks) John Williams FAR FROM HEAVEN (Focus Features) Elmer Bernstein FRIDA (Miramax) Elliot Goldenthal (SW, WW) THE HOURS (Paramount and Miramax) Philip Glass ROAD TO PERDITION (DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox) Thomas Newman  The nominated music was pretty unmemorable last year, but since Howard Shore wasn't nominated, probably Philip Glass should win for his interesting score.

I liked Chicago, it was fun, well-cast and it was great to see a real musical on the big screen again (I don't think Moulin Rouge quite counted).

6MHTB7C,female,47,"A Letter to the Editor that Wasn't Published   Back in early March, Jim wrote a very good letter to the  Pittsburgh Post Gazette  on the history of US-France relations.  Unfortunately, at about the same time, the PG wound up printing a very similar letter with even more historical tidbits.  However, since Jim's was still a good letter, here it is:       Our Congress has done a number of silly things over the years, but some of their actions in the last week have been so childish that they make many of us feel ashamed of them.  Changing the name of French Fries and French Toast in the cafeteria to Freedom Fries/Toast was a childish waste of time (especially given all the important things they should be addressing).  And the latest move by one representative to pay to bring home the remains of WWII soldiers is both silly and insulting.  The claim that, by not agreeing with us on this issue, the French somehow don't appreciate the sacrifices of our soldiers in WWII makes no sense. It also seems to imply that those of us in this country who don't agree with President's Iraq policy somehow don't appreciate the actions of our soldiers in WWII.  This is absolute nonsense. This is a different war, with different circumstances, and supporting one doesn't mean that you have to somehow support the other. Nor do other countries -- including allies -- have to agree with us on every issue.  Despite Mr. Bush's statements, those who aren't for us in every issue aren't somehow enemies (and can in fact still be friends)  Also, all those folks who are jumping on France over this issue need be reminded that, while France owes us a debt of gratitude for what we did for them in WWI and WWII, we owe them a debt of gratitude for our verry independence.  Without France's backing, we'd have never broken free from Britain in the Revolutionary War.  (Yet of course 10 years later, when a new French government was involved in a very different war, we (wisely and rightly) did not back them and did not go to war at their side.)  (Jim Mann, early March 2003)"
6MHTB7C,female,47,"We're up in Boston, attending a planning meeting for Noreascon IV.  During the Exhibits meeting, we came up with another rough draft on Hall C design:     Jim and I had a fabulous dinner out at  urlLink Locke-Ober  last night, to celebrate our 27th anniversary.  When I mentioned that to my mother, she said she'd had memorable swordfish there over 50 years ago.  I can report that the swordfish is still quite memorable.  Tonight, we joined friends for a dinner at a Persian place,  urlLink Lala Rokh  in Beacon Hill.  Another great dinner (and not nearly so expensive as Lock-Ober)."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Today, I'm Ashamed to Be an American...  I find the unilateral actions of our government, particularly under the Bush administration, to be an embarassment.  But today's decision to renounce obligations to the World court goes beyond the embarassment I've felt over the last 18 months.  I'm genuinely ashamed.  How can we encourage renegade nations to listen to world sanctions when we won't?  This could lead to isolationism during a time in world history when isolationism is particularly dangerous.  I wish President Bush and his team would come to their collective senses, but I do not see it happening any time soon.  Oh, and I've just found out that this president does not have a public E-mail address.  E-mail to bush@whitehouse.gov bounces, and when you visit the Web site, the contact page does not include an E-mail address.  This is particularly interesting when you consider that, over the fall, many people were praising what a vital link to the public E-mail was when everyone was afraid of traditional snail in the wake of the anthrax panic."

Recently, I've been overly obsessive about politics in my blog.  In real life, while I am somewhat obsessive about politics these days, it's not all I think about or write about.

6MHTB7C,female,47,"On Living in a ""Safe"" Suburb   We live on a busy street in a nice suburb of Pittsburgh.  We moved here in 1993 because we were looking for an area with an excellent school system, close to town, with a house we could afford.  We really weren't all that concerned with ""safety"" issues per se.  We lock doors out of habit no matter where we've lived, and aside from petty theft from a pair of break-ins, have been lucky to not been victims of real crime.   Over the last few years, major crime has seeped into our suburb.  In April 2000, a guy in a nearby neighborhood went on a shooting spree.  His first victim was his neighbor, a Jewish woman.  He drove to the next town and started shooting Indian people at a grocery.  He shot-out the windows of two synagogues.  He murdered a man in a Chinese restaurant, and finally shot a black karate instructor.  When he was done, five people had been murdered, one man was left paralyzed from the neck down.  I wasn't very surprised, in some ways, because folks in Pennsylvania love their guns and there's a fairly ugly current of racism among some people.  In fairness to my home, some folks in the town have started to deal with diversity issues and are at least talking about them.  More recently, though, the pace of murders has quickened.  Two young men whom my daughter went to high school with, ""allegedly"" killed another man in what, ""allegedly,"" was a drug deal gone wrong.  While this murder did not happen in our town, it ""allegedly"" involved people who do.  A few weeks ago, a young man murdered his girlfriend.  We don't need the ""allegedlys"" in this case - he killed himself before the police could arrest him.  Just last night, a policeman was shot during a domestic disbute.  While the policeman was shot in the chest, he was wearing a bullet-proof vest and is expected to recover.  This level of violence in a ""safe"" suburb is depressing.  I suppose it's just a reminder that nowhere is safe.  It doesn't mean we should panic and crawl in our homes and never emerged - it just means we need to be vigilant everywhere."

6MHTB7C,female,47,"I'd never seen either version of The Manchurian Candidate. Until tonight.  Throughout the movie, all I could think was:       Angela Lansbury is really Dick Cheney  (Mrs. Islen)      James Gregory is really George W. Bush (Senator Islen)  I hope I don't need to explain why!  The 1962 edition is a surprisingly sophisticated movie.  Other than To Kill a Mockingbird, I always felt that most movies made before about 1967 were quite simple.  But the original Manchurian Candidate is a movie fighting both McCarthyism (""I have before me a list of 254 Communists..."") and Nixon (notice the fop-sweat when Harvey and Sinatra got nervous?).  It's a surprisingly good movie, and I regret not having seen it before.  It's probably too late, but I urge anyone planning to see the 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate to see the 1962 version first.  Remember, this movie was shot about two years before Kennedy was assasinated, and only seven years after the McCarthy hearings were considered more dangerous than Communism itself."

6MHTB7C,female,47,"Finally, Return of the King   We went to see Trilogy Tuesday last week, seeing two extended edition LOTR movies followed by the premiere of ROTK.     Line for Trilogy Tuesday in Pittsburgh  There were already about 200 people in line before we got there, so we wound up on the floor but in the center.  While, at first we hated the seats, they turned out to be fortuitous.  Before the movie started, we realized the folks sitting in front of us were people we'd known back in college, from the old Western Pennsylvania Science Fiction Association (WPSFA)     Lori and Tom Lane  It was neat to catch up with them after all this time.  Back to the movies, the extended editions both looked phenomenal on the big screen.      The Audience Just Before The Return of the King (remember, just about everyone in there had been in the theater for over 10 hours...)  But, after a long day of movie watching, my brain was completely fried by the time ROTK finally started at just after 10.  While the movie looked absolutely phenomenal, I was having a terrible time related to the characters.  And the movie seemed structurally very off.  So I got a little snarky in my online comments on the movie.  However...  I did go see the movie again at a time when I'd had a little more sleep and hadn't been watching movies all day.  That made an enormous difference.  Instead of focusing on the problems (which exist but are fairly small by comparison), I got even more caught up by the sheer audaciousness of the undertaking.  Minis Tirith is one of the most remarkble combinations of set/bigature/special effect that I have ever seen.   The Nazgul attacking Minis Tirith have a huge ""gosh wow"" factor, reminiscent of the asteroid sequence from The Empire Strikes Back or the scene of the Mother Ship flying over Devil's Tower in Close Encounters.  We have been watching a classic unfold over the last two years.  Despite the spectacle, the human story is rarely overshadowed.  The whole cast (except for John Noble as Denethor, but the problems with Denethor weren't all his fault) give one of the finest ensemble performances ever.  Ian McKellan, Billy Boyd, Viggo Mortenson, Sean Astin and Elijah Wood deserve special commendation as ""first among equals,"" but no one really steals the show.  The movies would not have worked had the casting not been as perfect as the special effects. It's instructive to go back into the  urlLink casting archives in TheOneRing.Net  and the casting discussions in  urlLink AintItCoolNews  to read some of the jaw-dropping rumors that went around.  Keanu Reeves as Aragorn?  Uma Thurman as Eowyn?  The mind boggles.    There are a few continuity and editing problems in the movie.  The whole Pyre of Denethor sequence is just badly handled, and the cuts between Eowyn and the Witch King confrontation and the arrival of Aragorn and company are very distracting.  And the endings could have been shortened slightly.  Still, the movies are just a phenomenal achievement, and I'm delighted that Peter Jackson et. al. have pulled it off."

6MHTB7C,female,47,"April 15:   My First ""Official"" Weblog  I went to a political event tonight, ""in honor"" of tax day.  It was supposed to be something of an environmetalist's nightmere on how our taxes, especially our state taxes, are being spent.   That was fine, but some of the ""entertainment"" was on the clueless side.  One group decided that doing a three minute rant on Palestinians as victims was an appropriate way to educate us about environmental affairs.  At least two people walked out.  Instead of applauding or booing at the end, I said, ""That was really poor judgement on your parts.""  There's plenty of blame to go around in the Middle East.  I'm not a Sharon fan, and I think he and Isreal have behaved badly, particularly of late.  But to portray the Palestinians as the only victims means you can ignore the hundreds of people murdered in terrorist attacks recently.  Ironically, I heard a brief ray of hope for Isreali-Palestinian relations just this morning.  There's a hospital in Israel (in Jerusalem, I think - it may be called Hadassah) that treats all people injured by acts of terrorism or war.

6MHTB7C,female,47,"I'm Going to the Oscars!   Well, Almost...   Before I became a Hugo or Nebula fan, I was (and am) an Oscar fan.  Despite the fact I have wildly mixed feelings about popular awards (don't get me started on Oscar failures, like  Titanic  or  The Last Emporer ),  I have been a devoted follower of Oscar politics and the awards for many years.  I can't completely blame my Dad on this, but he bought a copy of a book that had photos from Oscar winners when it was first published in the mid-'60s.  I almost memorized that book; whenever I saw that an Oscar-winner was to be on TV, I made a point of watching it.  I thought going to Hollywood at Oscar time would be a way cool thing.  But I'm just a movie fan - would it be worth it?  About two years ago, I heard that Lord of the Rings fans threw themselves an Oscar party.  In Hollywood.  What a way cool idea.  So, being an ardent Tolkein and Jackson fan, I started hanging out more frequently on  urlLink The One Ring.Net , where I adopted the pseudo-Tolkeinish name of ""JRandomRohirrim.""  Due to being both early and persistent, I got tickets to Trilogy Tuesday (just two days away now!) and to the TORN Oscar Party!  The TORN Oscar Party sold out about 15 minutes after the tickets went on sale, so I know how lucky I was to buy tickets for my co-worker Laura and me.  So over the next ten weeks, I'll get to do two very movie fannish and geeky things with Lord of the Rings fans.  I already have a fabulous dress for the Oscar party (I wore it last year to the Nebulas and will probably bring it to Worldcon next year) and plan to take loads of photos while I'm there.  Even if  Return of the King  doesn't win every Oscar it deserves (it already has a clear lock on Best Special Effects), it'll be really neat to share Oscar night with 700 psyched LOTR fen.  And the site of this Oscar party is about two blocks from the Kodak Theater, where the Oscars will be held - close enough for an early Sunday morning stroll and some more pictures.

6MHTB7C,female,47,"Reclaiming Another ""F"" Word...   During the '80s, a word many of us used proudly in the '70s practically became practically a swear in the mouths of right-wing extremists.   So non-right wing extremists often stopped using the word.  Or some people apologized for using it.  No, Peter Jackson, that ""f"" word isn't ""fantasy"" -- it's the word ""feminist.""  I've been an ardent feminist since before I even knew there was such a word.  In the early '60s, when I was just in kindergarten, I just felt that girls and boys were treated differently.  It probably didn't help that I was hardly a typical '60s little girl - I was pretty argumentative, got low marks on ""following directions,"" had dreadful printing and liked to read.  Despite these ""impediments,"" I generally got along pretty well with my teachers because they saw I was bright and liked to learn.  Feminists, to a point, have been pushed back into various closets over the last 15 years or so.  The first closet was to stop using the word as a positive self-identifier.  The second closet was to pretend that feminism isn't important.  The 2000 election and its aftermath should demonstrate that feminism is very important.  Under ""pro-life"" people like George Bush, tens of thousands of poor women around the world have died or been maimed by back alley abortions or bad birth control since family ""planning"" agencies are restricted about talking about these issues if they received money from the US government.  Hundreds of thousands of poor women have died from childbirth (more than did previously) because our government thinks appeasing the ""religious right"" is more important than passing out condoms.  I'm a feminist, and I'm going to be one of several hundred thousand feminists to rally in favor of family planning, both in the US and around the world in Washington on April 25.  The global gag order has got to stop.  The only way it's going to stop is to elect John Kerry."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"An Athlete Who Was an Actual Role Model - Pat Tillman   While I have mixed feelings about our government's promotion and conduct of the war in Iraq, I think most of us who'd rather not see our military over there don't believe in condemning the people who've chosen to serve.  And so, I find the death of Pat Tillman particularly sad.    Until the Viet Nam War, it wasn't that uncommon for public figures to join the military.  Look at the hundreds of athletes, actors and musicians who fought for their country in World War II.  You can't say the same about recent wars.  The rich and the famous avoid military service because it's a volunteer military and they don't ""have"" to go.  Despite this, both Tillman and his brother chose to go into the Army to become Rangers.  Pat Tillman gave up a multi-million dollar football contract to go fight for his country.  Even more extraordinary - he graduated from college summa cum laude in three and a half years.  How many professional athletes can you name who not only graduated from college but graduated with honors?  I hope we remember Pat Tillman.  I don't think we're going to see other young and famous and rich men go to war."

6MHTB7C,female,47,"The video was only recorded by Pittsburgh's Channel 4. Scott Baker is Channel 4's correspondent on site in Boston.   It's unclear if Scott Baker was with the camera operator. Scott Baker is rumored to be quite conservative.  He's the ex-husband of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's outspokenly conservative columnist Ruth Ann Dailey (and the current husband of a recent ex-Miss America).    The Tribune-Review is a notoriously pro-Bush paper.  Given their manner of ""reporting"" (constant Kerry-bashing, et.c.) Teresa Heinz Kerry is likely not happy with the paper.  Both Scott Baker and the WTAE camera operator must know what the Tribune-Review's editorial editor, Colin McNickle, looks like.  Heinz Kerry might not have known what Colin McNickle looks like, but she'd surely know his name.  It's possible that Scott Baker had the camera operator ""keep rolling"" when he saw McNickle start to question Heinz Kerry, or arranged for the columnist to be there.   I started wondering about this this morning.  During the afternoon news, Scott Baker, who's normally pretty reserved while reading the news, was almost gleeful as he recounted the ""Shove It"" incident, nearly 2 days after it happened.  As the main reporter at the Democratic National Convention for WTAE, he didn't mention any of last night's speeches one time during the 5pm news.  Baker's behavior is reinforcing my notion that he could have helped arrange the incident.   Another Possibility:   It later occurred to me that maybe Heinz Kerry herself wanted the incident on camera.  When a TV camera is as close to you as it was to her on Sunday, you know it's recording (the lights make this really obvious).  So when she learned that Colin McNickle had been talking to her, she went back and made a point of saying what she did in front of the camera.  That way, a ""shove off"" could not become a ""fuck off"" or something worse because it  had  been recorded in front of witnesses."

The movie threw out both history and the Bible, and used the writings of a 19th century German mystic as its screenplay, presenting this one view as ""fact.""

6MHTB7C,female,47,"Thursday morning, I left for Massachusetts.  I've done that drive solo a number of times.  It takes about 10 hours, and when the weather is nice, it's a pleasant drive.  I like listening to books on tape, so I finished up listening to Stephen King's  Bag of Bones .  It's a fairly pedestrian ""small town has a secret and they're all in on it"" sort of horror story, but there's a pair of love stories involving the protagonist that are really very sweet.  Friday, my parents and I drove up to Vermont to attend my uncle's funeral.  Uncle Winslow had lived in Montpelier most of his adult life, having spent his career working for the state.  As Montpelier is the smallest state capital, and the church was all of about five blocks from the state office buildings, the church was completely full of old friends and co-workers.  I want to give kudos to my cousins Anne and Mardie, who gave a very moving talk about their father, and to the minister who had the intelligence to admit that he didn't know Uncle Winslow, but gave a great eulogy anyway (the minister had just come to the church a few months before, my uncle had been in Texas part of the time, then moved in with Anne a few months before he died).  I really love the recent funeral tradition of displaying photos at the reception.  I saw a family photo I'd loved as a child and hadn't seen in nearly 30 years:       Trask Family, Rochester, VT, Circa 1930: (more or less clockwise)  John Crawford (Sr.), John Crawford (Jr.), George, Bill, Nellie, Winslow and Caroline Trask    Between my brother's wedding last fall and my uncle's funeral, I remet many cousins I hadn't seen in  years.  I hadn't seen Mardie, Alan or Pam since my wedding, almost 27 years ago.  It was one of those odd timing things - a bunch of my cousins got married when I was living in Pennsylvania or Ohio and had no money to travel.  Some of the aunts and uncles (Alan's parents, Anne and Mardie's mother) died at times when work was quite insane and I just couldn't get away.  So it was good to reconnect with them, even if the situation wasn't ideal.  After the funeral, I went up to Burlington and visited Anne and Mardie.  Spending a night in Burlington was a little odd - I spent a few nights there in February, 1957 as I was born in Burlington but I don't think I spent a night there since then.       Anne Forcier, Mardie Sorensen, Laurie Mann, April 30, 2004    We spent a long time up on the widow's walk, watching the sun set over Lake Champlain.  I enjoyed meeting Anne's in-laws, the Forciers.  The next morning, I took my mother's cousin Alice Bassett, out to breakfast.  She's probably the relative I'm most like - she's very politically and musically active.  She's at least 78 and still sings in no fewer than three groups.  She was a state legislator for a few years, and used to commute to Montpelier with Howard Dean in his pick-up truck!  The drive back to Pittsburgh was a little trickier.  I'd had a migraine overnight, so I was very tired.  It was cloudy and windy taking the Charlotte ferry across Lake Champlain.  There wasn't much traffic or many cops on 87 going south through New York, but I did have to stop briefly when a border patrol road block (some two hours south of the Canadian border) was checking cars for illegal aliens.  I have mixed feelings about that sort of operation, honestly, but I got through quickly and continued on my way home.  While I made a few brief stops, I drove for over 12 solid hours.  While Burlington, Vermont is a little further west than West Boylston, Massachusetts, it's somewhat further north.   So that was the longest solo drive I'd ever done."

And he's unlikely to resign.  This whole Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal is reeking more of Watergate than Viet Nam these days.  Remember when Colin Powell was an honest man?  I used to have a lot of respect for him.  I read and enjoyed his autobiography.  But his public behavior over the last few months does nothing but demonstrate that loyalty to Bush and Cheney is much more important to him than loyalty to the Constitution or the American public. Such behavior is no surprise from Rice or Wolfowitz or other folks of that ilk.  But Colin Powell?  I considered voting for him for President in 2000.  Now, I wouldn't vote for him for dog catcher.    Those of us who have expressed outrage over the whole Iraqi prisoner scandal do so because we believe in the US Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the UN  and the Geneva Convention.  In short, we have much higher standards for the behavior of our military and our government than our government does.  We citizens  must  have higher standards and we must vote out Bush this November.  Yes, of course the Berg murder is even more troubling than the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal.  There's an awful lot of disgusting behavior all over the world - in Israel, in Palestine, in Afghanistan, in the Sudan, in parts of the Phillipines, in Saudi Arabia, in Iran and in Iraq.  But when atrocities are committed by Americans, supported by our government and paid by American tax dollars, as an American citizen, I am all the more outraged.  I'm also really annoyed by a pro-Bush PAC using the attack on the WTC as the opening of their ad.  The spokesman in the ad says he lost a child in 9/11 and he trusts Bush to do the right thing.  Invading uninvolved countries, killing and abusing their citizens, trampling the Constitution with the ""Patriot Act"" is ""the right thing?""

Adam Troy Castro titled a bleak message at 9:34 in sff.discuss.obituaries with ""Not Again""  Terrorism, I thought.  Oh shit.  Then I read the message.  ""It's beginning to look like we've lost the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia...""  Shit!  I grabbed the channel changer and immediately switched to NBC.  And cried for about 10 minutes.  I have been a huge fan of spaceflight.  I don't remember the Shepard or Grissom flights, but Glenn flew just after my fifth birthday and I remember that vividly.  Space travel is an act of supreme confidence in the future - it meant we were living in the future.    I find any death related to the space program to be doubly-heartbreaking. It's sad when any person dies in the course of their work; but every death related to space travel seems to drive a nail in the coffin of NASA.  Life has risks.  I just hope we don't mothball the program for another two and a half years due to this tragedy.  Astronauts know that it's risky.  Most Americans know that it's risky.  That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.  If everyone was so risk-averse, we'd still be little monkeys living on a beach in Africa."
6MHTB7C,female,47,"Two Girls Who Didn't Die   With so much bad news about unlucky girls, I thought I'd share two stories about lucky girls.  The first one is 7-year-old Erica Pratt.  You've probably heard of her.  She was the little girl snatched late Monday night in Philadelphia.  She was tied up and thrown in a basement.  The kidnappers chose to wrap her in  duct tape, which the girl was able to chew through. She escaped by breaking a window and calling for help.  The second one is 18-year-old Megan Stone.   You probably haven't heard of her.   A star high school athlete, she developed a virus a few weeks  ago that attacked her heart.  After a couple of days,  she was on the list for a possible heart transplant,  it looked like her heart would be so badly damanged.  But almost as rapidly as she got the virus, she got over it and walked out of the hospital with her original heart back.  I haven't met Erica (though I'd love to give her  a high-five for a job well done), but I do have a tenuous connection to Megan -  her father was a good friend of Jim's while they were growing up.  Jim plans to drop Blaine a note.  Well done!"

6MHTB7C,female,47,"I volunteered to work at the Greensburg Kerry rally.  But unlike the July 6 Edwards announcement rally, where I felt like I was being more useful, I really didn't wind up doing all that much in Greensburg.   I did help pass out some signs.  However, the volunteer coordinator had us pass out about half the signs so early that they were complete soggy messes by the time the candidates arrived.  However...  I did wind up extremely close to the stage, so I got some photos like these:     John Kerry in Greensburg, PA, 7/31/04     Teresa Heinz Kerry, John Kerry, Elizabeth Edwards, John Edwards  Yes, Ben Affleck was there, and he spoke briefly.  The teenagers behind us particularly wanted to see him.     Teresa Heinz Kerry, Ben Affleck, Cate Edwards, Elizabeth Edwards (back to camera), Andre Heinz (white shirt), Chris Heinz  The speeches were fine, but we'd heard most of them before - John and John's speeches were both ""Democratic Convention Lite Speeches.""  Teresa and Elizabeth both seemed to speak a little more off the cuff.  You tend to remember the unscripted moments a little more. A member of the audience fainted in the rain and med-student Vanessa Kerry left the stage and followed a Secret Service agent into the crowd to lend a hand.  And when some AIDS activists displayed some mini-banners and briefly started yelling, Kerry gave them a few moments, then worked some brief discussion of AIDS policy into his speech.  And how are the Republicans treating their rally audiences?   urlLink Seeking Cheney Tickets?  Sign a Loyalty Oath.   This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard.  Yes, if you want tickets to Democratic rally, the office usually collects your name and adddress.  They don't require you to swear to vote for the Kerry/Edwards ticket.  Heck, a rational candidate wants to reach out to people who might be uncertain,  not  try to scare them away!  Before the rally, we grouped off into teams.  I worked crowd control and signs with these other women:     Kerry, Deb, me, Jill and Terry, Before it Got Too Rainy...     The Up-front Sign Team, Nearly Two Soggy Hours Later...

6MHTB7C,female,47,"Walk to Rivendell - Eowyn's Challenge   I may not have noted it here, but I had a check-up in March that included the report that I have really high cholesterol.  How high?  Don't ask - really bad all the way around, especially the triglycerides.  So my doctor said I could go right on a cholesterol-lowering drug, or I could try the diet and exercise route for a while.  I thought I'd go the diet and exercise route.  During the first six weeks, I ate extremely well (lots more fruit than usual), went to the gym pretty regularly and walked about 1.5 miles per day (I'm walking to the trolley now rather than take the bus that stops down the block).  I lost about 12 pounds.  In mid-late April, I developed a nasty sinus infection and started to slack off.  I walked every day, and avoided things like candy and cheese (these are some of my favorite foods and they can really add to your triglycerides).  In May, assorted stressful things happened and I started showing signs of yet another episode of gastritis/irritable bowel.  I started eating ginger snaps and mint chocolate ice cream, both of which are very soothing during periods of stress, but not good for dieting.  Also, we had company, ate out a lot and went to many family parties.  Despite all these things, I managed to loose about 2 pounds, and the stomach problems pretty much went away.  This week, I found kind of a cute online support system for people trying to loose weight.  It's called ""Walk to Rivendell.""  Some folks have broken down the LOTR books and estimated that it's something like 485 miles from Hobbiton to Rivendell.  We want to see if we can walk that many miles between March and mid-December (the opening of Return of the King).  I estimate I've walked about 125 miles since mid-March, meaning I've walked the distance between  urlLink Hobbiton and the Great East Road  (near Bree).  So Friday I have another blood test, and I'll get the results next week.  I'll find out if my triglycerides are headed in the right direction, or if I'll need to take a cholesterol-lowering drug.  In any case, I'm working to keep my activity level up and my food intake down."

6MHTB7C,female,47,"He's Probably Dead:  Osama bin Laden   Osama bin Laden hasn't been seen publically since last fall, and he wasn't looking too good at the time.  Remember, he was only 44 but was reported to have had severe  kidney disease on top  of living in a war zone for a few months.  And now, this:        urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020910/80/d9bt2.html   Osama wasn't like Mullah Omar - he didn't completely shun cameras.  He'd give a speech every once in a while or demonstrate a rocket launcher in front of video cameras.  The fact that he didn't give this self-congratulatory speech on video means he's probably dead.  The fact that he has not been reliably photographed since last fall, and isn't showing up on a recent video tape during this first anniversary of 9/11, means he's not around to worry about anymore.  But whether it's Osama or some fellow-traveler, his contention that history has been changed is nonsense. While his people did murder about 3,000 people in cold blood and ruin a few blocks of downtown Manhattan and part of the Pentagon, let's examine whose history  has changed in the last year, shall we?     Americans, Europeans, et.c.:  Few lifestyle changes;             more unemployment, some extra lines at             the airport, more focus on terrorism     Afghanistan:  Taliban out, something less onerous in;             al Qaeda's movements greatly restricted             to caves and remote countryside (or underground).  As the crash of Flight 93 demonstrated, Americans  woke out of their terrorism stupor pretty fast.  I think the best way to spend tomorrow is to try to acknowledge the hit we took without wallowing in the terror of the day.  Living in terror means the terrorists win. I plan to go to work.  I don't believe all terrorists are gone, nor do I believe that we'll never have another terrorist attack.  But, as I  said last December, I believe we're more likely to have small-scale terrorist acts, not large flying bombs."

In fact, this summer, the humidity has been below 50% quite often, which has actually made not having a/c in my car a little bit more bearable.

3NJL67K,female,35,"SIMPLE PLEASURES   About four years ago, a friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for my birthday to get a manicure & pedicure.  (His wife's suggestion -- she said he couldn't go wrong with that gift -- so I guess I should thank her, huh).  I lost the certficate, found it, then lost it again until it resurfaced a few weeks ago.  Tuesday, I was going to the mall to exchange something, and I realized that the gift certificate said Nails Beautiful was in the  same  mall... so I thought, ""why not?""    Turns out Nails Beautiful moved out of the mall some time ago, but the sweet little old ladies at the information booth told me it was just around the corner in the same building that houses Bally's.  I pressed on.  I found Bally's and finally, Nails Beautiful.    I walked in, and since it was about 2:45 in the afternoon, the place was empty.  I quickly explained the story of the gift certificate and the lady in charge said, (with thick Vietnamese accent) that she'd honor the gift certificate, but I'd have to kick in the price difference.  Apparently, the prices have gone up slightly.  No big deal.   I've never had a professional manicure or pedicure before... let alone a manicure with a SPA.  Lynn was in charge of my feet, and a woman who never introduced herself was in charge of my hands.   Conversation was minimal, because Lynn's English wasn't that strong and Miss No Name was content to just work on the hands and converse with Lynn in Vietnamese.  Lynn did ask, over the course of the 45 minutes it took to complete the work on hands & feet, what my name was, and she told me hers.  When Miss No Name walked away, she slipped me her card and told me that they worked on commission (hint: if I go back next time set up appointment with her).  She was very nice.  I absolutely loved the spa and I  love  to have my feet rubbed.  I managed to tell Lynn, without offending or scaring her, that one of my toes was broken and to try to work around it (yes, the toe I ""stubbed"" on Christmas Eve still hurts, especially when touched).  She did a wonderful job, and she massaged both feet, calves, and all my toes (except stubby) and exfoliated my feet as well -- all before she even worked on my toenails.   Miss No Name massaged my hands, my forearms and my fingers.  I was nearly asleep when Lynn accidentally touched my broken toe.  I managed a smile and then Miss No Name started on my cuticles.    You know, I've always believed I've taken care of my nails (toes & hands) adequately... and I would have believed that until I saw how much work these women had to do to get my hands in the condition they are now.  Lynn painted my toenails an orange color and Miss No Name put a light misty white color on my fingernails.  I wasn't too sure about putting polish on my fingernails, because I type, and I use my hands to file, etc.  Usually, whenever I paint my nails, the fingernails are ruined by the end of the day.  That's why I smooth my fingernails, but rarely paint them.  Miss No Name didn't seem like she'd be satisfied unless polish was applied, so I let her.  It was pretty until I scratched my thumbnail while getting gas about an hour later.  Oh, well.  It doesn't look that bad, and my nails are still nice and smooth.  When I left there, I went to get my hair trimmed (with the rest of my Christmas money -- woo hoo) and he cut it  really  short... but I flipped it up in the back this morning, and it wasn't so bad.  So, I guess I really did have a day of pampering after all.  I never do that, either... maybe I should do it more.  I did decide that once I get a full time job, if the budget allows, I'd like to go visit Lynn and Miss No Name at least once a month.  I guess it's because when I left there, my feet felt lighter than air, and I just  love, love, love  to have my feet rubbed!  It's one of the most relaxing things ever.  I never thought I'd like to do anything that girly, but hey, it's never to late for a change of heart."

I hope to pick up more work for a week or two, but will not hold my breath.  I'm just thankful for the extra week.

3NJL67K,female,35,"Yesterday an article ran in the local newspaper:   urlLink Number of Protestants is Falling    In this article, it is claimed that for the first time in U. S. History, the population will be less than 50% Protestant.     One reason for the national decline, Smith said, is a failure to keep youths and young adults within the Protestant fold.  From the '70s through the early '90s, Protestant churches retained 90 percent of young people, but that dropped to 83 percent after 1993, he said.   Another reason: Once-nominal Protestants are more open to stating that they are no longer affiliated with any denomination, he said. In the survey, the number of people saying they had no religion grew from 9 percent in 1993 to 14 percent in 2002.  And, some people who once identified themselves as Protestant now call themselves ""Christian,"" which would put them in the survey's growing ""other"" category. Latter-day Saints, Muslims and Eastern religions are also in the ""other"" category, which grew from 3 percent in 1993 to 7 percent in 2002.    Today, I was talking with two ladies (both who are old enough to be my mother) about this article and the fact that, after attending a Baptist church for nearly 10 years, I knew next to nothing about its history or doctrine.  In fact, I can quote you much more about the history and doctrine of the Methodist Church (which I grew up in) and the Church of God (Anderson, IN, where I went to college).    These ladies, both lifelong Southern Baptists, informed me that when they were kids, they learned the history of their denomination, the names and structure of the denomination present day and they learned the doctrine as well.  That's not the case any more.  Their opinion was, ""the church as a whole has gone to the  feel good, self-esteem  doctrine, which you can't really sink your teeth into.""  I chose my words carefully, but let them know I agreed with them wholeheartedly -- this is why I do not attend a Baptist church anymore.  After the last 3 1/2 years of turmoil my life has been twisted through, when it all came down to it, it was the liturgy and doctrines of my youth that stabilized me -- they were something I could sink my teeth into.    I, in fact, had a similar conversation with my roommate about three weeks ago, and I had shared some of this with one of the clergy at the church I'm currently attending.  By the way, the foundations of faith are taught there and if you want to become a member, you attend those classes.  It's not that they think you're unintelligent, they just want you to know what you're getting yourself into should you choose to be confirmed into that church.  Before you are confirmed, you will know that church's doctrine and it's history is readily available to you as well.  You will not ask a historical question in that church and get an answer like, ""Uh...I'm sure it's recorded in a book somewhere.""  I'm not knocking Baptists.  It's really an inter-denominational problem, this lack of knowledge about the heritage -- both of their own denomination's history and the history of the Church in general.  And, believe it or not, this lack of knowledge of church and Church history is deteriorating the quality of the legacy we leave behind.  Unfortunately, what we're leaving behind is a legacy of ""Uh..."" and ""but don't you feel good about yourself?""  Learning about the faith of our fathers can help us in many ways.  First of all, even if they've been dead over 200 years, knowing that they faced many of the temptations and problems that we do today can give us hope that our faith -- and the Church -- can endure.  Second, knowing WHY your denomination sings certain songs, reads certain books, names buildings and colleges after certain people, can help shape your faith and understanding as well.  The article quotes another problem plaguing the church in general:     ""Regular participation in a church is not as central as it once was, even if you are a believer,"" said Jack Marcum of the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.  ""It is much more individualized spirituality than it may have been in the past.""    Regular participation in church... do you know how many kids and families I see at soccer games (baseball, etc) on Sunday morning?  There's nothing wrong with soccer, but with parents working later into the day, and the time demands reducing the number of coaches, many families are choosing the weekend leagues as an alternative.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with soccer, it's just that once you stop going to church to do something you really enjoy, it's extremely difficult to get motivated to get back into the swing of things.  Also, you are teaching your kids that soccer is more important than fellowship.  Chew on that one for a while.  As far as individualized spirituality is concerned, well, I call it ala carte spirituality... taking what you like and what fits your lifestyle from different sources and calling it your own.  Granted, there may never be a denomination or doctrine that you truly agree with every single part of it 100%, but there should be a denomination that reflects the majority of what you believe -- and if you never find out what they believe... you really are leaving yourself wide open for a lot of instability in the future, because God will shake you to your foundations at least once in your life.  I know this to be true, and the fall hurts.  A lot.  The Bible says we should be prepared to give an answer.  1 Peter 3:15 -- But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect...   How can you give an answer if you don't know what you believe?  It's extremely difficult to formulate an opinion if you don't know what the choices are.  If your denomination doesn't teach you what  it  believes and has believed for hundreds or thousands of years, what does that tell you?  How can you know that your denomination has suddenly gone theologically whacko if you never knew what the church originally thought and set out to do?  How can you teach your children what you don't know yourself?  They'll need to know a lot more than how to feel good about themselves, and if that's all we pass onto them, the Church as a whole is in bigger trouble than anyone will ever want to admit.  I encourage you to find out what you believe.  You'll be amazed and how that stabilizes your spiritual equilibrium, and you'll be amazed that you will be prepared to give an answer."

3NJL67K,female,35,"THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS   Today, I went to the museum (it's free on Thursdays) to see paintings and art by James Rosenquist.  Here's a little blurb about him:   An internationally recognized artist since his emergence on the New York art scene in the early 1960s, James Rosenquist (born 1933) was a leading player in the American Pop movement. He began painting as a commercial billboard painter in the Midwest. Rosenquist developed his own brand of the ""new realist"" style by fragmenting, combining, and juxtaposing images from advertising onto large-scale canvases. Through this technique, Rosenquist has created complex, enigmatic narrative and abstract paintings.   You can see some of his paintings at  www.mfah.org . Click on  current exhibition .  (We also viewed some cool ornamental gold pieces and tribal headdresses from all over the world).    Rosenquist's style is sort of psychadelic Picasso and really isn't my cup of tea, but next month's exhibition has paintings by Claude Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Salvador Dali... so I'm all over that one.  I had fun, though.  It was cool in the museum and very quiet and I tried to imagine what was going on in Rosenquist's head... I mean, about half of the paintings I saw featured lipstick... so that led me to interesting thoughts.  I'm not sure it was Amy's cup of tea, either, but hey, we were cultural for an hour and a half for  free  and that's worth something.  Next week on the day I'm not working, I'm thinking about going for a walk at the zoo.  The zoo costs $2, and without children, I can actually spend time at each exhibit and even read about the animals.  If I go early enough, I should be able to avoid heat stroke.  :)"

Last night, during the Super Bowl update on Channel 11, there was a ""Celeb Sighting Ticker"" running across the bottom of the screen.

The funniest one?   Gary Berghoff .  Yes, Gary Berghoff.  Remember Radar on M*A*S*H?  Has he really done  anything  since then?  lol... but he's been sighted in and around Houston.

3NJL67K,female,35,"I DIDN'T WIN, BUT AT LEAST I BOUGHT A TICKET   ""God, I've prayed and prayed to win the lottery.  Why haven't I won?""  ""Because, my dear sweet  idiot  child, you didn't buy the ticket.""  Last weekend, Jene' and I walked down to the convenience store and bought lottery tickets.  Please don't get all righteous on me, this is was my first time, I did it for fun and it only cost me a dollar.  Besides, with my addictive personality, I can only gamble when I have accountabilty.  Jene' was with me and Jene' will be with me if I ever decide to do it again.  (That kooky Jene'... what a stumbling block!  -- Just kidding!)  Heck, I matched ONE number, so that was thrilling.  Tells you the state of my life when I can get a kick out of matching one number that yields nothing in return.  :p    Even buying just one ticket I can see how people can end up spending WAY too much money on this.  The rush of paying a small amount to gain a big amount must be a big draw, otherwise last weekend's lottery wouldn't have been worth over $40 million.  Jene' usually spends about $10 a year and makes about $12, so she comes out ahead and she has fun.  I know people, though, who ""invest"" hundreds of dollars at the odds of a million to one that they'll win a big payout.  I call this an unwise investment.  Chances are, the lottery is not your answer.   I do, however, hear many people say ""when I win the lottery,"" oh, how their problems will disappear.  No more debt, no more worries about how they will pay for Junior's college, no more worries about what will happen when their husband dies... And yet, one in a million wins... (and he only wins if he buys the ticket first).  I'm thinking this logic is flawed.  I've been gainfully unemployed for over three years, and during that time, I didn't buy a lottery ticket until Saturday.  My addictive tendencies aside, the reason I haven't played the lotto is because I know that such a financial windfall is not likely to happen to me, and I can't wait for lighting to strike before I release myself from debt or plan for the future.  Granted, I'm still in debt, and I have no savings... but it's been a tough 3 1/2 years struggling to make ends meet.  Despite the most erratic of schedules and earnings, each month, the money has been there for my most basic bills.     Would it be  nice  to win the lottery?  I won't lie -- YES IT WOULD BE NICE.  I've often thought of what I would do with a cash payout of $20 mil or so.  Do I wait around to do all those things  until  I win the lottery?  No.  That would be such a waste of time.  Do I think it's wrong to play the lotto?  Only if the money spent on chances could have fed your starving child or paid your light bill.  If it's ""extra money"" and not excessive, then why not?  I just can't be one of those people who waits around for something to happen to solve all their problems rather than being the solution to their own problem.   I can still say that and laugh as I live in the stressed out arena of looking for a full time job.  Day after day, my life has worked out without matching six numbers and a power ball."

My second car... was a 1988 red Chevy Cavalier that I named  Cephas .  Cephas is Greek for Peter/which means Rock.  I was in my  I just graduated from a Christian college and I know a bunch of cool Greek biblical words and I'm so cool  phase.

Well, I still have one part time job, Monday & Friday at the switchboard at First Baptist, but that will barely cover my rent.  The other part time job that filled in the rest of my work week ended April 1st (no foolin') because of budget cuts.  The department I worked for just doesn't have it in the budget for part time work any more.  The rest of the church is cutting corners on everything, so I think my tenure there is about to come to an end.    The only reason I'm sad about this is that I had a vacation planned in June.  My first vacation in 7 years -- a week on the beach on South Padre' Island.  After the stress of the last three years, I was really looking forward to it.

3NJL67K,female,35,"BLAME IT ON THE RAIN... OR LACK THEREOF...   Tonight, it  finally  rained on the southeast coast of Texas... everywhere but Houston.  It rained (monsooned) in the counties north, east and west of Houston, but not  in  Houston. My car used to be a nice berry color, but now my car classifies as  dusky fawn  or  dusty beige metallic .  I'm in the ""Why bother to wash it?"" phase.  After all, I do work next to the freeway, so every day, my car gets a fresh coat of dusky fawn and dusty beige metallic residue, in addition to the lovely pollen, ash, and other pollutants that the Houston smog has to offer.  Granted, when Houston does receive it's weekly 4 to 5 dibble dops of rain, or I accidentally park my car next to a hidden sprinkler, the drops make the dusky fawn look like it's been shot in about four places, but better that than washing the car only to have the satisfaction of seeing it dustless/clean for approximately 5 hours.    The salvage guy came and towed away Jene's car, Sheila (you'll have to ask her), on Friday.  Sheila was declared officially ""totaled,"" and Jene' will receive compensation for Sheila tomorrow, which she will deposit into a car fund (after she buys a bus pass).  Fortunately, Houston has an adequate public tansportation system and she works about a mile from home.  Church is a quick bus ride down Westheimer.  Wal-Mart, more than one grocery store, and Sam's are all within a reasonable walking distance for Jene'.  I also still have transportation (that without a/c resembles more of a sauna with wheels and a radio of which the volume cannot be adjusted...).  Jene' is not one to whine or mope, so she waved goodbye to Sheila and now my dusky fawn car takes up our two spaces so Sheila's spot doesn't look so empty.  I will fast forward in this story (after Sheila's departure) or rewind (it's all about perspective, isn't it?) to Saturday night in San Angelo, where Jene's nephew, Josh, graduated from high school.  I had wondered how the entire family was going to be able to attend, let alone sit together, but I was assured that since the ceremony was outdoors that would be possible.  OUTDOORS?!  Affirmative.  Outdoors... at 8 p.m. in West Texas, where, though it was still in the 80's, the humidity is low enough that the air wasn't that bothersome.  Over 700 calm and surprisingly well-behaved seniors sat on the far side of the field... a sea of blue that grew exponentially larger as the time approached 8 p.m.    My own graduation (in 1987) featured over 460 people in rented dorky silver and maroon gowns and it took almost four hours.  Girls wore the caps on the back of their heads, perpendicular to the floor, to make room for their big tidal wave bangs.  JoEllen sang as the graduation band played Night Ranger's  Goodbye .   Several other songs were sung and more than one speech was made.  Graduates received a Bible of their choice and when the prayer was uttered, it was definitely to the one true God and nobody had a problem with that.  At one point early on in the ceremony, a prayer was uttered that began with a vague ""Holy One,"" and continued with a list of vague spiritual references and a general sense of, well,  vagueness  that led me and several people in my general vacinity to whisper, ""Does anybody know who she's praying to?""  I shook my head.  The trouble with vagueness in this case is that though the prayer is uttered upward with good, inclusive and tolerant intentions, the prayer falls quickly to the ground, and the thud that follows sounds like the door to heaven slamming shut in disgust.  I think God was pretty clear when He told Moses to pass it on to the rest of us, ""You shall have no other gods before me.""   I'm not going to preach on this, but this instance was a reality check.  I now live in a world where God isn't at the top of the list anymore... though He's still on the list, He's getting shuffled down the list in the name of tolerance, inclusiveness, and good intentions.  I suppose this move allows the Christians then to also pray, but one wonders which is better -- an all-inclusive, vague prayer, or none at all?  Of course, if a Christian complains, she's hateful and intolerant and her house gets egged.  If a Buddist complains, his brother gets to lead his own prayer/meditation the next year when he graduates.  Ok...I'm going to get off my soapbox now.  Just chew on it.  As I was saying, we were sitting in the bleachers high above the football field on a warm, dry night.  I was sitting in between Jean (Jene's mother) and Julia (Jene's sister, who is my age).  Julia's husband, Jeff, recently returned from duty in the Persian Gulf, sat on the end of the row with Grant, their 3 month old son.  I could list all the other members of the McClellan/Speciale clan that had gathered to watch Josh graduate, but I need to keep this a small blog if I can (ha ha).  Just trust me, Josh was well represented in the stands.    At my graduation, families were asked not to scream, applaud or anything else until everyone's name had been called.  My graduation was in a gymnasium and the screaming would have meant extra pauses between 460 plus names and graduation would have taken 5 hours... in an open football stadium... well, those noisy airhorns and cowbells were ringing and blasting all over the place, including in poor little Grant's ears (while I was holding him).  He did not take too kindly to the blasts.  I did not take kindly to the blasts on his behalf, but as we've established in previous blogs, I'm learning that it's not about me, so I passed Grant down to Jene' who was further down from the inconsiderate blast-er and I let the blast-er live until his graduation.    This graduation lasted under two hours.  I was amazed.  Several faculty members teamed up to recite over 700 names.  Some kids danced as they crossed the stage, one kid did a flip, and two sign language interpreters signed each and every one of those names... and it was over in under two hours.  We even got out of the parking lot with relative ease and were home in minutes.  I had to keep reminding myself I wasn't in Houston and we didn't have to wait fifteen minutes to get to the street and then another half hour to clear traffic and then home -- all to go five miles.  No, we were far away from Houston and I rather enjoyed the pace, thank you very much.  The next day, Jene' and I got back into the Toyota Camry to drive home, and we arrived after 10 p.m.  Somewhere in the weekend, Jene' found a Big Lots and more dishes, all the while escorted by her PARKING ANGELS.  Apparently, when Sheila left, the parking angels did not.  I still don't have parking angels unless Jene' is in the car...  ...but I digress... and now it's time for some sleep..."
3NJL67K,female,35,"SUNSHINE AND RAISINS   Let me just say that we've had beautiful weather here the past week.  Temps in the low 80's, low humidity, temps around 60 at night, lots of sun... wonderful fall weather for Houston.    Yesterday, I decided to go for a walk and sit out in the sun for a half hour or so.  Our apartment complex is surrounded by condos.  In the middle of these condos is a nice little park that, during the day, is mostly filled with old ladies walking their ""dogs"" (any canine that weighs less than 10 pounds and has a higher pitched bark than a toddler imitating them... I don't consider dogs).  I have gone to this park several times over the past two years and have never been bothered, nor bothered anyone else.  So, much to my surprise, I was approached by an old lady (hereafter called, ""The Raisin,"") wearing dark sunglasses and an attitude on her wrinkled face.  She was accompanied by a ""dog,"" who quite frankly looked too skittish to bark.  The Raisin looked at me and said, ""I haven't seen you around here, do you live here?""  I replied, no, that I lived in the apartment complex across the street.  She immediately frowned further than she already had been and said, ""you're trespassing, so you need to leave  now .""  She hastily explained to me about the signs I ignored (there are a couple of signs about no solicitation and no trespassing, but my roommate and I walk through this complex a lot -- it's off the street and safer -- and like I said, I've used that park bench many times) and then she told me that I should leave immediately or she would call the police.  I said, ""okay, ma'am,"" (see, I was nice) and got up and walked home.  The Raisin followed me to the street and made sure I walked out of the complex.  Nice lady.  Now, granted, technically, she was right.  I didn't live there, so technically, I was trespassing.  There are no gates on this community, so it's not like it's totally private and the security officer has waved at me a time or two, so I didn't think I was hurting anybody.  The thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that for two years any other time I've been there, most of the old ladies stopped by, said hi, introduced me to their ""dogs"" and walked off.  Many other times I have been the only person in the park.  I have never bothered anyone, made loud noise, or disturbed anyone with loud music.  I am not dangerous looking by any means.  I don't wear offensive clothing.  My presence was not disturbing to anyone I'd met in previous encounters.  I really believe this Raisin just wanted to be mean.  That's what bothers me.  I felt sorry for her, though.  She smiled at me, a gloating smile, like she'd done something powerful or meaningful, but all she'd done is be mean.  And while I didn't necessarily need her meanness yesterday, I don't need her bench.  I can go somewhere else to sit outdoors (albeit farther away) but she still has to live with her meanness and need for power.  I hope she's happy, having thrown me out of her park, but I doubt that happiness or satisfaction lasts."
3NJL67K,female,35,"SHAES GREAT AUSTIN ADVENTURE PART ONE   Helpful terms and definitions:   parking angels  - It doesnt matter where we go, what time of day it is, or how far away we go, 9 times out of 10, Jene will find a good parking spot.  Good, as in within the first five spaces away from the front door.  ***************************************************  Its the first day of Spring, and on the way to Austin, we see many fields of Texas wild flowers (bluebonnets, Indian paintbrushes, etc) that line Highway 71.   Jene suggests that if its still daylight when we go back to Houston I should have my picture taken with them.  We get to Austin around 11:40 a.m.  Jene is driving and we are on our way to Congress St to find a place to park within walking distance to the State Capitol.    Jene calls her sister, Joy, wife of Texas newest Railroad Commissioner, Victor, whose swearing in we are in Austin to attend.  Joy is at Jenes aunts house in Austin getting ready for the ceremony.  We have some lamps in our car for Joy, and it is decided it would be easier to drop off the lamps now, rather than after the ceremony, so we go to Jenes aunts house.    Joy, who does not normally care to wear makeup (she last wore makeup on her wedding day 18 years ago), meets us outside for the lamp exchange.  She has applied makeup and her face is too dry and she knows it doesnt look good.  She also knows Jene will be the honest one who will tell her it looks bad and also tell her how to fix it. She asks Jene how it looks and Jene says, You look about 10 years older, and Joy actually looks relieved.  So should I wash it off?  Jene answers, Yes, and I know how we can make it look better.  Jene and Joy go upstairs to mix her foundation with moisturizer (Jene is like Heloise with attitude) while I say hello to other relatives downstairs. 	 Joy and Victor have three daughters.  Laura, who is 15 and very beautiful, is also an accomplished guitar player, singer and songwriter.  Christina (Nina as she is called by her little sister) is 11 and hides none of her emotions.  You know exactly how Christina feels all the time.  She has a very expressive face and outgoing nature.  Grace is 2   and is a real handful.  She evidently has developed a fear of going places recently.  While Joy is getting her makeup fixed upstairs by Jene/Heloise, Christina is trying to convince Grace to finish her lunch.  Graces clothes have not been changed and her curly hair is sticking out in every direction.  It is after noon by this time and the ceremony begins at 1:30.  Grace sees me and says, I dont want to go!  Everyone else is trying to convince her were not really going anywhere, everyone is just dressing up for fun.   Grace then starts this tearful, frustrated exchange with Christina.  	Nina!  Mommy! 	Christina picks up Grace to take her upstairs. 	Nina!  Eat! 	Christina rolls her eyes in disgust, backs up and puts Grace back in her chair. 	Nina!  Mommy! 	Nina!  Eat! 	This happens at least three more times, and finally, Christina puts Grace back into her chair and says, eat, then well go see Mommy. 	I dont want to go! 	Laura, the teenager, has come downstairs.  She crosses her rams, looks at her baby sister and says, Grace, youre going whether you like it or not. 	I dont want to go!  I retreat upstairs to see how the make over is going.  Jene and I soon leave the house and to resume our search for a parking space near the capitol.   Jene is silently praying for parking angels (see above) as we drive up Congress St.  After a fruitless search, we turn onto the street in front of the capitol and see a few odd war protest signs.  Im all for everybody being entitled to express their opinion, but please, for Petes sake, at least make your signs and yourself appear somewhat intelligent.  We decide to follow the signs to the parking garage.  Jene drives a couple of blocks and says, I dont see the signs anymore, so Im turning.  As she is turning, I see the sign up the street, so we go to round the block to get back to the parking garage.  On our way back to the main street... a parking spot appears.  It is the second space from the street that runs directly in front of the capitol.  Jene smiles and thanks her parking angels as she runs across the street to get change for the parking meter.    Jene and I make our way up to the capitol building (not as long of a walk as I had anticipated - thanks parking angels), go through the metal detector and stand in the rotunda and wait to see signs of the rest of her family.  We find a cousin and go upstairs to the senate chambers.    This episode will continue in Part 2 of  Shaes Great Austin Adventure!"

3NJL67K,female,35,"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLOG...    There is a kind of doctrinaire aspect sometimes to being a Christian that the message is more important than the ways you go about doing it. And you always suspect that theres not the same level of art as in people who actually are people of faith who also practice fiction. I think Jesus would have wanted us to be good writers as well and pay attention to our craft as well as tell a meaningful story.      Ron Hansen, on problem with 'Christian' fiction, DSS Interview February 7th, 2003    I have pondered this quote for a few days. It struck a chord in me.  One of the reasons I backed off from working in the Christian music industry (now don't flood me with ""you're a blasphemer"" comments... hear me out), was the lack of anything original being produced.  In the early 90's, besides Jars of Clay and DC Talk, most Christian music was a copy of something that had already been produced outside of the Christian subculture.  I suppose only diehard musicians/music lovers, poets and painters really pay attention to originality or quality of the music and art that surrounds them.  Many people accept a quality of art that is way, way subpar.  Christ was not a copy, he was the original.  He was fresh, new, controversial, anti-legalistic, and (gasp)  cutting edge .   I think that should be the model we follow as Christians when we create.     Sometimes, this means leaving the Christian ""label"" behind.  Did Christ label everything in his parables as Christian?  Did he talk about the  Christian  sower who sowed his  Christian  seed in the  secular  thorn bushes?  No.  He spoke of everyday things, even things we would not consider holy.  He did not distinguish between sacred or secular because to him, everything was sacred, because he made it.  It's his creation that has corrupted the rest of his creation.   Think about it this way:   When you have leaky plumbing in your house, do you search for a Christian plumber?  No, you want the  best  plumber - the one that is going to get the leak stopped once and for all.  When you want the best steak in town, do you look for a Christian steak house?  No, you go to the place that has the best reputation for making the best steak.    I know many kids (and adults) that love music, art and literature, who do not turn down the Christian music aisle to get the best, most creative, freshest, cutting-edge music.  They do not turn to the Christian fiction section when they want something exciting and challenging to read and they do not shop in the T-shirt section at the local Christian Book Store to buy the latest fashions (after all, most Christian T-shirts are Christianized copies of T-shirts already produced elsewhere).  I know many Christians who see this as a huge problem, as well they should.  They, however, see the problem as these kids wandered outside their Christian subculture and have been tainted.  I see it as these kids wandered outside their Christian subculture and were  freed.   These kids will grow up, eager to make their art, music, literature, and even clothes and plumbing cutting edge.  They will make art relevant to those Christians are supposed to be trying to reach, instead of creating art, music and literature to discuss amongst themselves.  Unfortunately, many Christians will try to label them as secular, blasphemers, backsliders, and heretics and totally miss the point.  Don't get me wrong.  I do listen to Christian music sometimes.  Much of it over the years has encouraged me, uplifted me, brought me closer to God and made me feel better.  Very little of it, however, has satisfied the musician in me, the artist in me, or the poet in me. Very little of it has challenged me, either.  That is why so many people find it boring and turn elsewhere to be challenged and satisfied.   It's also hard to relate to those outside the Christian subculture if your creative diet is labeled 100% Christian.    Think of it... how many times have you been talking to a non-Christian, trying to tell him what your music sounds like and you always have to compare it to a group or artist outside the Christian subculture anyway so it's  relevant to them?    ""Well, this group is really cool.  They sound like the Backstreet Boys.""  Exactly.  The group you are speaking of were made as an ""alternative"" to and  in the image of  the Backstreet Boys, which isn't necessarily bad in itself, it's just not fresh.   Fresh lasts longer .  Something that is a copy is already going stale and the original will last much longer than the copy.  Something -- anything -- that is labeled Christian should not leave you wanting, longing, unsatisfied.  The thing that bugs me is that most things labeled Christian leave me wanting, longing and unsatisfied.    I know many Christians who do excellent work.  David is an auto mechanic and he is one of the best around.  I do not recommend him, however, because David happens to be a Christian.  I recommend him because he is a great mechanic (and because he's a Christian, I know he will treat them honestly and with respect).  My friend Angie is a great photographer.  I would recommend her to anybody if they wanted creative, meaningful pictures.  Angie is very creative and gifted and I would recommend her over and over again.  The fact that Angie is also a Christian is just the icing on the cake and I know someday her art and her creativity will open up doors for her to share her faith with others.  My friend Jene' is a great designer and I would also recommend her in a heartbeat.  She is also a Christian.  My friend Jamie is an artist and has had her work displayed on the cover of published work.  I would also recommend her.  She is also a Christian.  I would not, however, recommend any of these people because they are Christians.  I would recommend them  because they do excellent work .    One too many times I have recommended a Christian friend to do a job and they did the job very, very poorly (and some under the excuse of, ""but at least I'm a Christian"").  They expected the Christian label to be enough.    It isn't.    Personally, I know that when I meet someone as a writer, more doors open for me to share the gospel than if I meet someone as a Christian writer.   Funny how that works.   My challenge today is this:   Christians should be the model, the example, the template -- not the copy.  The art, music, plumbing, photography, whatever it is... should be so good that people want to study it, use it, discuss it, and copy it - regardless of it's spiritual implications.  To do this, I believe, Christians need to think, work, act, play, and fix pipes outside the Christian subculture so that someone who is not a Christian actually sees, hears, reads, and uses what Christians produce.  If the art, (etc) is good enough, it will meet a need, whether it's emotional, physical, mental  or  spiritual.  I believe this is where the door opens for discussion -- and this is where Christians have the opportunity to impact the world  around  them.    I think about this -- all of this -- as I write and create.  I hope that my art will impact those around me and be relevant to those who wouldn't necessarily shop at a Christian Bookstore.  I don't want to be on the Christian Fiction shelf at any bookstore.  I want people besides Christians to read my book(s).  I am not writing for those who already know Christ.  I am writing more for those that don't and if what I do or create is meaningful and challenging to a Christian, that's definitely a bonus, but not my goal.    Ok... that's my rant for the day.  It's been on my mind for a few days.  It stems from a conversation with other Christians who don't understand why I went back and re-wrote my book to be more raw and edgy and real.  I tried to explain that life is, even for the Christian, raw and edgy and real.  They were offended.  I was more determined than ever to be the original... the template.  I may not get there on my first try, but I will eventually.  I'm not afraid to try.   I had a great Teacher."
3NJL67K,female,35,"FIREWORKS...   Tonight, I was here at home not feeling the greatest, my roommate was still asleep... and it rained ALL DAY in Houston... so I didn't go out to watch any fireworks.  Not wanting to offer my body up as a mosquito feast, I had pretty much decided earlier today during the monsoon to forego the fireworks and stay home.  It got to be 9 p.m. and I heard several ""booms,"" (of the legal variety of fireworks -- for it is  illegal  to shoot off the kind of fireworks you buy along the roadside within the city limits) and they sounded fairly close.  The booms persisted, and finally, at 9:15 I stepped outside to see if I could see where they were coming from.  (I'm watching some fireworks on TV now... with the Boston Pops Orchestra, I think).    A four year old and her mother (whose Jamaican/island accent I just loved), all the while swatting mosquitoes, pointed them out for me.  I could see 3/4 of the full fireworks above the rooftops of the condo complex just north of my apartment (also between the trees).  I enjoyed about ten minutes worth of fireworks, and then they ceased.  I could hear others to the south of me, but I couldn't see them, and the four year old and her mother had retreated to their apartment and I didn't have a bra or shoes on and decided I'd better head inside myself.  I've counted three mosquito bites so far.    Fireworks displays in Houston are very impressive.  Fireworks are usually shot off at several places in town.  Two years ago, Jene' and I drove around and saw four separate displays without ever leaving the mosquito-free air-conditioned van we had borrowed from a friend.  (Last year, we were both sick -- and tired).  Fireworks also kick off the Christmas season the day after Thanksgiving.  Those fireworks are set to Christmas music and it's usually cool enough outside to actually have to wear a jacket so it almost feels like Christmas (though one year we wore shorts).  Now, I'm usually in West Texas for Thanksgiving and the 10 nieces and nephews Jene' has usually are enough fireworks themselves and I don't miss seeing fireworks at Thanksgiving anymore.  I  love  fireworks, though, and when I don't get to see them at some point during the year, I feel very sad.  I guess it's because I have so many good memories tied up in fireworks.  When I was a kid, the  Salamonie Festival  (Warren, IN) ran during the weekend of July 4th, and it still does.   My best friends would get to go to the festival with me, and we'd join my cousins and we'd take our bikes with us and ride all day, taking breaks to swim in my cousins' pond and cool off, then back into ""town"" (which was just a few blocks) to meet the parental units and get more cash, check in, and then we'd split to go eat dinner BY OURSELVES.  Yes, those were good times...times when you could let your kids run wild in the streets of small town America and not worry.  Later, in junior high, we'd go to Tricia's house to take a break, and also to my cousins to swim in the pond.  We'd still ride bikes, and had front row seats at the parade when we weren't in it (it's called a  PURDUE  float, people, and when your aunt and uncle have a van that has a horn that plays the  PURDUE  fight song, you decorate it, and you walk beside it in your  PURDUE  t-shirts and all of a sudden, you're in a parade with a float with an  official number  and everything).  We'd go to the waterball fights, the bed races, the canoe races, and the variety show (which now features a great number of my cousins and their children these days).  Ultimately, however, we'd all end up at the ballpark on the 4th to watch fireworks.    Granted... Warren fireworks were not as impressive as some displays I've seen since I've moved to Houston, but the amount of fireworks you saw in Warren was in direct proportion to how many people donated some money to buy them... and that is still probably the case today (and they were shot off by volunteer firemen).  I can't tell you, though, how often I am watching fireworks in other parts of the world, and I am transported back to Warren and the fireworks at the ballpark.   I'd name everybody I enjoyed that experience with but I'm sure I'll forget someone (and if you're that someone, please comment and I'll add you...), but my friends Tina and Tricia were there, along with Kristy, Brandon, Andy, Joe, and as many other people from school we could round up.   I usually had custody of my little brother, Danny, too (3 1/2 years younger).  We'd put our blankets out on the grass by the ball diamond, then we'd take turns visiting the concession stand and get the usual ballpark fare... orange push-ups, cokes, popcorn, lollies (sweetarts on a stick), and Bazooka bubble gum.  Then, as it would get dark, we'd lay back and stare at the sky until the fireworks were over.  My friends were my sanctuary, and sometimes, my salvation, so meeting up with so many of them in the middle of summer break was more important than you can imagine.  I could relax, I felt safe, and I'd get enough of an injection of hope that I could make it until school started again.  I always laughed with this group of maniacs, and the fireworks ""Ooh...ahh... oh!"" contests were some of my favorite times.  (Also, sharing a blanket with so many guys...one of whom I had a crush on... without my parents being anywhere too close to where I was... well, though nothing ever happened there, it was still good for the soul...lol).  But I digress...  I did defect a couple of times (in high school and after college) to the Huntington fireworks 11 miles up highway 5, but they just didn't have the same atmosphere.  I don't know when I'll ever get back to Warren on July 4th, but it's a time and place that holds a special place in my heart.  I will always think of that time in my life and my friends whenever I see fireworks.     Yes, those were great, great times.  Happy fourth everybody!"
3NJL67K,female,35,"A GIVING LEGACY   My roommate is  amazing .  Jene' does so much against incredible adversity... and yet she would be the first to say, ""that's life.""  I could list her adversities, but they are not important to the story.  We all have our adversity.  Granted, she has more adversity than most people I know, but she lives in such a way that most people forget what she's up against, and that's how Jene' wants it.    The important part of her story is what she does  in spite of  her adversities.  Take today for example.  Jene' volunteers for  Lifehouse , an organization that helps young, unwed mothers.  Jene' (a nurse) volunteers as a birthing coach for these teenage girls.  Jene' took over the holiday weekend shift because the volunteer on duty had a family emergency.  While I slept, Jene' left and one baby was delivered.  She came home, slept about an hour and in her delirium had a dream that I had eloped and left her a note on my bed and did not say who I was eloping with (since I am not dating, I don't know who that would be either).  I just had to throw that in... and I claim it as prophecy.  Anyway, I heard her leave again right around 10 a.m.  This particular 15 year old had gone into labor 2 months early.  By the time it was all said and done and the doctors had done everything they could, Jene' ended up holding the baby boy until he quit breathing.    To be honest with you, I don't know if I could have done what she did without completely falling to pieces.  She came home, very tired, and tearfully relayed the story to me.  I cried, too, knowing how much she had to be hurting physically, emotionally and not to put too fine a point on it, spiritually.  There are some things on this earth that I'll never be able to wrap my brain around, and I know this was one of those moments for both of us, but especially Jene'.    Hopefully, she's sleeping now, resting up to go back to work tomorrow.    I realized today why Jene' can give so much, and why some people like me have difficulty with even simple ways to give.  Jene's ""give"" tank has been filled constantly since she was born.  She was told there wasn't anything she couldn't do by parents who not only believed that, but embodied that belief in everything they did themselves.  Jene' was taught life skills, coping skills, loving skills and  giving  skills by the people who brought her into this world.  They prepared her for life by preparing her to give back, and I realized today my give tank level is horrendously low.  One reason is because I have given a tremendous amount, but the problem is, I haven't stopped to figure out how to refill it.  I have also realized that the way I learned to give is in total detriment to self, a martyr style of service -- that was my model.  I also was never taught how to receive, but that's another blog.    I will not turn this into a pity party.  I don't feel sorry for myself, I've simply had this epiphany.  I used to compare myself with Jene' a lot in this area of giving and wondered how she could do so much, and now I know why.  The deficiency in my give tank isn't an excuse not to serve, but it brings some things into focus for me.  I realize why some people get burned out.  Sometimes, it's a balance issue, when some people don't rest or give back to themselves or an avoidance issue -- busy-ness rather than facing issues in their own lives. At other times, people who were raised in the martyr style of giving wear themselves out and never discover the joy of giving and therefore burn out easily.   I now know why, however, that some balanced, healthy people get burned out.  Their give tanks either were never full to begin with or they emptied their tanks without knowing how to refill them.   I'm not saying Jene' never gets tired or burns out, but she knows how to refill her give tank and she knows how to rest.  She was not born with this quality, she  learned/absorbed  these skills from two people I am also proud to call family -- her parents.    Do I throw up my hands and say, ""it's too late!""  No.  It's never to late to learn giving skills and fill up a give tank.  The best way to learn is to surround yourself with people who have these skills and give of them freely, watch, learn, and then DO WHAT THEY DO.  It's a proven pattern of learning in other areas of life.  It seems silly, doesn't it?   Learning  how to give?  Giving should be as natural as breathing, right?  Trouble is, most people are centered inward, and giving is always centered outward.  Not only is our nature centered inward, if we are not taught or shown how to give, then we won't.  It's that simple.   Jene' has blessed others because she continues her family's legacy of giving.  If I ignore this opportunity to learn and fill my give tank (and all other tanks for that matter), I'd be a fool, (and I don't suffer fools gladly).  With God, there are no accidents --of timing, placement, proximity or otherwise -- it's just sometimes I walk around with my eyes closed and my ears plugged.  And heaven help the person whose give tank overflows... what a waste.  I don't see that happening in Jene's family --  ever .    Sleep well, Jene'."
3NJL67K,female,35,"CRASH! BANG! BOOM!   ... was what I heard and witnessed as a silver Saturn hit my roommate's car last night.  I was following her in my car (we had met somewhere and I was following her home).  I won't bore you with all the details, but she was turning right onto an eight lane street (4 each way).  I was watching her turn... a habit I have had for nearly 15 years, because my little brother was notorious in high school for hitting people from behind because he saw them start to turn, then rear ended them because they stopped and he was already looking at oncoming traffic for his opportunity to peel out... I mean,  turn .  So, I got into the habit of watching and waiting until the person in front of me is gone before I take my turn.   Anyway, after Jene' had completed the turn and was fully in the lane and a good car length or so down the street, a woman hit her from the lane next to her on her driver's side.   The bang was so loud, and I saw Jene's driver's side get hit and then she got knocked up on the sidewalk and came to a very abrupt halt.  I didn't know if her car had been hit in the door or fender and my entire body tensed up (I have sympathy whiplash, lol) because I thought she had been hit mortally (I know,  drama, drama, drama ).  Then, as I turned into the parking lot next to the sidewalk where Jene's car had come to a stop, she got out of her car so I could see she was okay.  I started breathing again.   Jene's front left fender was smashed and the other car's front right headlight and hood was damaged.  At the angle the damage suggested, the woman entered the lane Jene' had already occupied.  Jene' said the woman's silver Saturn was not in her lane when she turned.  I believe her.  I did not see that part.  I was watching my roommate turn as per my habit and it would be very awkward to run into the back of your roommate's car because you weren't paying attention... so whenever I am following her I pay extra special attention.   Here's where the story turns UGLY.  I knew when the woman got out of her car Jene' was hosed... silver Saturn woman was tall, thin, blonde and had big  u know what's .  Jene' asked her (she's a nurse, she has to) if she was injured, and the girl said, ""so you are saying this is your fault!"" which told me she already knew she was wrong (there are other juicy details, but I will not post them...).  Her version, however, stated that she was in the far lane and Jene' was pulling out and she hit her  while Jene' was turning  and that she ""tried to get out of the way as best she could."" Ahem...the damage (and even if I hadn't been there to see that Jene' had already completed her turn and was already down the street over a car length) said otherwise.     Silver Saturn woman called the cops at 5:30, about fifteen minutes into exchanging policy numbers and phoning insurance companies and after Jene' wouldn't admit fault.  Jene' and I hadn't really discussed what happened, I asked her if she was okay and I told her that I didn't see where the silver Saturn had been, I just saw where it ended up and what it did to Jene'.  Then I went and sat in the shade by my car and since I felt left out of the phone call marathon, I called Amy and told her what happened and to have my small group pray and then I called Elizabeth, who laughs at me when I'm stressed and talking and venting and her laugh makes me laugh...  We waited over an hour for Houston's finest.  The silver Saturn woman kept saying that she was behind Jene' and tried to get out of the way but couldn't get stopped.  Get out of the way?   Well, I decided that since I had my camera with me I should use it, so I handed it to Jene' and let  her  take pics.  :p The silver Saturn woman got back into her car, put up her windows and got on the phone again.  About twenty minutes later, a man about her age (she was in her mid twenties) shows up with a camera, which I thought was funny.  If she uses those pics, they could work against her...   Houston's finest show up at 6:38 p.m.  Two nice,  young  officers.  Jene' and I looked at each other.  We knew how this was going to go. Though both of us are well endowed (lol) we are not tall, (well Jene' isn't) and neither one of us is a skinnie minnie.  To make it an even better experience than it already was, they even ticketed Jene', because the girl's statement was that she hit Jene' as Jene' was turning and  the law says that if you are leaving a stop sign or light and are involved in a wreck  (they also said that all four lanes have to be clear before you pull out, according to the law, to not get ticketed if a wreck happens)  you get a ticket .    If there's one thing I've learned from Jene', it's that no matter how much you are being hosed in any given situation, sometimes it's better to keep your sarcastic mouth shut, so I did (esp. when the hose-er has a badge and a car with pretty lights on top).   It was quite obvious to me that the police did not believe me.  Yes, I am Jene's roommate and yes, she's my best friend, but what they don't realize is that Jene' does not lie... not about her age, her hair color, her weight, ANYTHING.  Jene' told me that all she wanted me to say was what I saw, which is what I intended from the beginning anyway.  I cannot lie creatively under pressure anyway (lol... just kidding) and the truth is the best route, because you can remember the truth, but it's always tough to keep your lies straight.  Silver Saturn woman will learn, even if not an outcome of this situation, that the truth will set you free.     Policeman A took my statement, and as the ONLY witness, it struck me as odd that he listened to me for less than thirty seconds and didn't write anything down.  Then Policeman B (a trainee who was taking orders from A) took my license number and he wrote down one sentence, that I said that the turn had been completed and she was more than a car length down the street.  Then, A & B explain that they are giving Jene' a ticket and yes, she's getting shafted, but that's what the law says, blah, blah, blah. Again, I keep my sarcastic mouth shut and count to ten.  Jene' handles herself as she always does... calmly, with deep breaths and a look of resolution on her face.  I knew this would not be handled on the street but later with the insurance people.    Ah, the lovely insurance people.  I have nothing but good things to say about Geico... Jene's company.  They were nice, thorough and explained everything quite nicely.  Now, Progressive, who represented the silver Saturn woman tried to twist every word I said.  The man treated me like a dumb woman. In a very patronizing tone he said, when I told him I was watching my roommate turn... ""Are you sure?  Because we all know NOBODY watches a car turn, they pull up and are looking the other way to see when  they  can turn.""  I said no and repeated myself and he sighed.  Hey, what can I say, I'm unusual.  And then, to make my testimony more convincing, when he asked me what kind of police showed up (what kind of question is that?) ...I was tired, and I hadn't eaten and this guy was ON MY LAST NERVE so I asked Jene', ""It was HPD, right, not Metro..."" and she looked like she didn't hear me and I laughed and said, ""No, it was the one's in the blue car, so it was HPD."" They have me on tape saying this. Yeah.  So I sound like a  dumb  roommate to top it all off.   Oh, the joys of car wrecks...And what does my roommate have to say about all this?  ""That's life.""  I was more angry on her behalf at the injustice of it all, but like she said, if she's not upset then I can't be...lol... and as Mary Ann said today, ""there's no grace in that.""  All day people asked me what I thought God was trying to teach  her  (I could detail the calamities of last three years for both of us and we could both legally change our names to JOB, but Jene' more than me).   I told Jene' that it's all my fault (kidding) because it's what God's trying to teach  me  that  I'm  not getting... because, obviously she's getting it (""that's life"").  I'm calmer tonight.  If I had blogged last night there would have been a gratuitous use of some words and way too much drama... but I realized today that Jene' has the right idea.  Again this goes back to her parenting, (read previous blog).   She's found so many silver linings today (even after the ins. adjuster declared her car totalled, and her car being an older, she will get NOTHING for it -- thus leaving her car-less) that she could  forge a ring .  Nobody got hurt, her car is just a thing, I kept my sarcastic mouth shut, etc...  Things happen.  We may never know why bad things happen to good people...again... and again...and again... but they do.  What can you do?  Like Jene' often tells me when I'm mid-rant --  why waste energy over something you have no control over and cannot change?   In mid rant... I have to stop and admit to myself she's right and not finish my beautifully sarcastic and witty rant.  UGH.   Is God sovereign or isn't He?  Is God in control or isn't He?  Can God provide or can't He?   Now, before you draw a halo over Jene's picture... she's not dancing around the apartment (she's too sore anyway) rejoicing over her loss.  She's not calling people and telling them in a joyful tone, ""Praise the Lord!  Guess what!  Today the  funniest  thing happened... this tall, perky blonde girl hit me and her story doesn't match up and my car is totalled... and I'm  so happy  that I don't have a car anymore and between the two of us the car with air conditioning is now gone and I'm so happy!! WOO HOO!!""  No, she's not happy, but, as she just told me, ""The old lady just can't waste any time on this.""  And (blankety blank), she's right.   So, I'll end with that and give you a few helpful hints about what to do in case of/or to prevent/or to prepare for an accident...        *     First and foremost, always  watch the car in front of you  turn to make sure they are out of your way.  It's just smart driving.  Just ask my brother.      *     Put a  disposable camera  in your glove box for such a time as this... or in case you see Elvis pumping gas off Hwy 36 at 3 a.m.      *     If you are in an accident and you don't look like a runway model but the person who hit you  does ,  prepare to be hosed .  Just know it's going to happen.  Be calm.  Fight another day.  If you look like a runway model -- praise God and don't use your looks to be deceitful.  Remember, the truth will set you free and you need to know this because one day you won't look like a runway model and you need to know how to act when that time comes... because even if you aren't ready to admit your hoochie days are over  but everyone else can plainly see they are , it won't matter what you think.      *      The car really is  just a THING  .  I was driving a buddy's car (about a year and a half ago) and a sixteen year old kid hit me, and promptly admitted it to his insurance company (then I spent fifteen minutes on the phone with his mother trying to convince her he was indeed okay).  I called my buddy to tell him about his car and I expected at least a little anger, blame,  something  (from past experience with others) and all he said was, ""Are you okay? As long as you're okay, that's all I care about.  The car doesn't matter.""  Though I should have trusted my friend's character and known he would have reacted that way, that response really taught me something.  Jene's actions over the past two day only reinforced that it's just a car.        *      It's not about me.  It's not about Jene'.  It's about God...  and she's been able to say, ""Well, I'm just going to trust God,"" and be a light to an insurance agent.  FOCUS.   Jene' is renting a car to drive to West Texas tomorrow... and I'll keep you posted.  If life lessons keep happening at this rate and I actually keep paying attention... I might have to check and see if my soul has stretch marks.  (Yeah, I'm wondering how one goes about that, too)."
3NJL67K,female,35,"FROM  WARDROBE MALFUNCTION  TO ""COSTUME REVEAL""   Janet's apology (as issued on mtv.com today):     One day after Janet Jackson's shocking Super Bowl halftime performance, the singer took responsibility for the breast-baring incident and said she never intended the stunt to go as far as it did.

While ""offline"" I read a couple thousand pages of the Harry Potter series and I started a new book called,  Girl Finds God , by Lauren F. Winner.  I will blog more about that book as soon as I finish it.  So far, it's been a great read.    Thought to Ponder:    On the way home, I meandered through back streets to avoid long waits at traffic lights... and though it may be a slightly longer route to get home, at least I am in motion the whole time, and therefore, the journey itself doesn't  seem  to take as long.   I laughed as I realized I do this, then thought, ""Why can't I seem to do that in other areas of my life?  Why can't I stay in motion?""  A thing to make you say, ""hmm...""  Jene' is off to Republican headquarters to watch the election results trickle in for today's primary.  For the first time in my life I got to vote for someone I know and not only that, I know he's the best man for the job (it's so rare to be able to depart from  the lesser of two evils  voting).  He is also an ornery man (it's always the quiet ones) who likes to grab people's feet during scary orc sections of  Lord of the Rings .  Anyway,  I will update you on Victor's progress for his re-election bid for Railroad Commissioner of Texas.  Jene' had planned to be in Austin with Victor & family to watch the election results, but she had a job interview today (HOORAY) and couldn't make it out of town.  As for me, I got turned down for another position at another church, but they sent me a nice rejection  letter , and it was personalized and did not say, ""Dear Applicant.""  I am working, however, every day this month, which will produce two healthy paychecks in a row.  WOO HOO!  I can't tell you the last time that happened... well, yes I can... this time last year.   Other interesting tidbits since I blogged last:   - I cooked meat this evening and I do not smell like the meat I cooked.  Bonus.  (last week I had to shower after the  Great Bacon Incident II )  - I had a craving last week for Maneschewitz matza bread, though I'm not Jewish and matza is not a regular part of my diet.  I'm a different combination of ""ish.""  Amish... Scotish... Irish... and other ""ishes.""  Not sure what that means, but I will probably pick up a box the next time I pass the kosher section at  Kroger's .  - I learned the cash register system at the bookstore (where I've picked up the extra days) in about 10 minutes and even though the little scanner/barcode reader thingy didn't work most of the time, I did quite well.  Kudos to me.  I guess all that playing with my toy cash register when I was little paid off.  - I have not yet seen Mel Gibson's  The Passion of the Christ .  It's not that I don't want to, but I wanted to wait another week or two so I can go to the theater and weep -- and not in front of 400 people.  It's still tough to get a ticket to this movie in Houston.  From what I've read and from the reactions of people I know, Christian and non-Christian, this is a worthwhile movie on which to spend your money.  - Sunday, I went to Mickey D's to try to win a million dollars, but alas, I wasn't the chosen one for their contest.  Sad, but true.    - I finally received my Hershey's T-shirt (the one I won January 1st - the good omen T-shirt).  It's a long-sleeved, white T-shirt, with a Hershey bar on the front.  Underneath the Hershey bar, it says, ""Sharing is Overrated.""  Now that I've received the shirt, let the good omens turn into good results!  That's all I can think of right now... I'll most likely blog again soon.  Did you miss me?"
3NJL67K,female,35,"SOMEDAY, I'LL LIVE IN A HOUSE   Today is one of those days I covet.  I covet my neighbor's house...  literally .    I live in a fairly quiet neighborhood in an older townhome.  My neighbors are career people and mostly quiet.  If a newbie moves in and disturbs the peace (say, drives in every weekend at 4 a.m. with his stereo on full blast and wakes us  all  up, or has a party with sustained, extrememly loud noise for over an hour), I know one to five of these neighbors will introduce themselves to the newbie and explain the rules.   DO NOT DISTURB .  If someone is too noisy in this complex, they don't last for too long.  Occasionally, however, someone moves in and decides the rules do not apply to  him .    Let me clarify.  It's one thing to be able to hear someone else's music... faintly in the distance.  It's not so disturbing.  It's an entirely different issue when I am inside my apartment and I can not only hear the WORDS of the song clearly, but FEEL the music as well.  I do not appreciate the latter.  It started at 10:30 a.m. when my windows began to vibrate.  I turned on my TV, but had trouble hearing over the thumping music.  By noon, I was more than slightly aggrivated as I was trying to eat my cereal with ""Let's Talk About Sex, Baby"" assaulting my ears.  I'd had enough.  I walked out the front door and, usually, the perpetrator is someone who is vacuuming/washing their car with the doors wide open (who obviously don't understand about accoustics or manners).  This time, the parking lot was clear.  The music was so loud, however, that it made my head throb.  I looked down toward the pool area and could see a group down there, so I called the office.  I asked her, very sweetly, when their pool party would be over and she asked, ""What pool party?""  I explained about the annoyance, and she said I was not the first person to complain and she'd paged the ""courtesy officer,"" to come take care of it.  (apparently, she must have been the phone service that the complex uses when they are out on property or something, read on).    That was at 12:15 p.m.  It is now 1:40 p.m. and the noise hasn't stopped.  I'm about to call again.  (My guess it's an apartment near the pool and someone set their stereo speakers in the window to enjoy music poolside.  I've seen it at other complexes).  When you live in a house, you can play your stereo however loudly you like, and nobody cares.  Your neighbor can do the same, and for the most part, unless there's an open window, you can't hear his music either.  Everybody wins.  This is one of many reasons I would love to live in a house.  In an apartment complex, however, people feel  entitled  to act as if they live in a house.  They give no mind to who's sleep/reading/work, they are disturbing, they feel entitled to enjoy  their  music with the bass boost up to full volume -- whenever they feel like it.   EXAMPLES:   I once lived in an apartment complex that housed young singles, newlyweds and college students.   One floor down and two apartments over... a guy had one of those alarms that get louder if they aren't shut off and they run for a full two hours.  The alarm would go off on the weekends (he didn't sleep at home on the weekends) at 5:45 a.m. and blast for  two  hours, disturbing up to twenty people in the surrounding apartments.  After coming home Mondays to a door full of nasty notes, he made an effort to turn off his alarm when he went out Friday nights.  Another time, same complex, the guy next door had a hot date over and turned his stereo on so loud (so they could hear it in the shower, he said), the bass vibrations knocked a picture off my wall (that barely missed my head when it fell).  I went over and pounded on the door (with the broken picture in my hand) and finally, he came to the door and I held up the picture and told him to turn it down.  His brow creased, as if to say, ""Wow, I didn't think it was that loud.""  The four people who had lined up behind me to complain (including the girl from  across  the hall) seemed to reinforce my point.  Yeah, right.  And yet another time, in the same complex, the guys downstairs had guitars... with amps.  On the night I was trying to make flight plans at 1 a.m. to get home to see my dying brother, I couldn't even have a conversation on the phone until after I called the ""courtesy officer"" to come make them shut up.  Forget about trying to sleep in my apartment on weekends.   Apartment dwellers pay attention  -- until you live in your  own  house, with your own four walls that are separate and detached from your neighbor's walls... and you no longer share a floor/ceiling with someone -- you are  not  entitled to share your love of Eminem with all those who live around you, and especially not at 4 a.m.  I'm sorry, you have your rights, blah, blah, blah, but not in an apartment complex.  In apartment living, you must learn to be CONSIDERATE and to SHARE space with up to a thousand other people.  Don't be arrogant enough to think that the lady next door with the infant son, or the elderly couple across the hall love to  feel  your music.  They don't.  If want to have your ""musical freedom"" that badly... save your money and buy a house.  In the meantime, play nice with others,  please .  Okay... that's my rant.  Someday, I will live in a house, but until then...   And, it's 2:45 and I just called the office again, but this time, the apartment worker on the phone said, ""yes!  We are having a pool party in appreciation of our residents!""  I told her I appreciated that, but asked when it would end.  She seemed confused, but said 4 p.m.  We'll have peace and quiet at 4 p.m.  This resident didn't appreciate their pool party, and the other people walking around in the parking lot trying to see where the noise was coming from didn't either.  I'm hoping this will be the last DJ'd pool party."
3NJL67K,female,35,"HARRY IS  MINE ...   (No Spoilers...other than those already mentioned in the newspaper)  Jene' finished  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  at  5:30 a.m. Sunday morning .  I told you she wouldn't sleep until she was finished.  After she woke up, she handed Harry over to me and I started reading...some time around 1:00 p.m.  At midnight I made myself stop, and I only got to  page 459 .    Today, I arrived at the Post Office (Rich Hill Station) at 4:55 p.m. to rescue my copy of Harry Potter. There were about twenty people in line ahead of me.  I knew this would take a while.  I have a great respect for the Postal System, but this particular post office is full of grumpy women (The Grump Sisters) who obviously do not enjoy their jobs (except for the little woman on the end who always seems to have a smile on her face and a kind word to say) and they make sure none of the customers enjoy their visit to the post office.  I never go to this post office because of these people and because the stamp machines take your money and you can never get a refund to save your life.  I will go  out of my way  to go to another post office.    Side note:  I always feel a little sorry for the Grump Sisters until they are rude to me.  I feel sorry for anyone that hates their jobs that much that it makes them miserable, and I know they probably couldn't get hired anywhere else with their attitudes, but for goodness' sake, find something you like to do that will make you happy!  (but I digress...)  After twenty minutes in line, it was my turn.  I kept thinking, ""God, please let me get the little woman on the end,"" but I got the Big Sister Grump.  Since it was already 5:15 and there were still about eight people behind me, she practically ripped the package ticket out of my hand.  She rolled her eyes when she saw it was from Amazon.com.  She came back and handed me my package and I was FREE!  I left, went back out into the 100 degree heat (110 heat index) and drove home through idiot hour (I mean rush hour).  Though I live a mile from the post office, this was nearly deadly, as someone in the turn lane decided he needed to be in my lane instead (no signal, either).    And now (deep breath) I have some reading to do..."
3NJL67K,female,35,"CLAUDETTE NO MORE   Claudette's eye was headed straight toward the Galveston area until about 10 p.m. last night, when the high pressure system north of us (that was supposed to show up a day or two ago) finally showed up and shoved her straight west to Port O'Connor and the Matagorda Bay.  Claudette became a hurricane shortly after midnight, packing winds of up to 85 mph (near the eye) by the time she made landfall.  Rain and wind from Claudette rolled into town in the wee hours this morning -- while I was still in bed.  The electricity blinked off a time or two, but then everything was fine.  Of course, people all over town lost power, including SBC -- our DSL provider.  Therefore, it is after 8 p.m. in the evening, and I am just now online for the first time today.  Fortunately, I could watch the hurricane coverage on our local channel, and one of  the  most notable hurricane specialists in the world, Dr. Neil Frank, is a meteorologist for CBS here in Houston.  MUCH better coverage than the Weather Channel, who merely yawned and updated the hurricane coverage for about 15 minutes per hour.    There are a few branches down here and there, and, as I said, some were without power for a good portion of the day, but for the most part, Houston is far enough inland that the hurricane was a non issue by the time I woke up at 7:30.  I never did lose satellite coverage (our dish is on a pole in a bucket of concrete because our apartment complex won't let us attach it to anything) and though it rained all day, most of Houston's streets drained well.  So, Claudette wasn't nearly as bad as her witch sister Allison.  We are breathing a sigh of relief here.  In Galveston and Kemah, the storm surge washed away a good portion of all the beaches.  In Texas, the state of Texas owns all property between the vegetation line and the water, so many homes have now found themselves on the other side of the line.  That should play out nicely.  In Port O'Connor and Palacios, the damage was pretty extensive (the dorms of the camp where the middle schoolers go no longer exists), but I don't think anybody was killed.  Of course, the networks had lots of coverage of the IDIOTS who stayed to ""wait it out,"" and the IDIOT TOURISTS who purposely took their kids down to the seawall to get their pictures taken with the stormy seas behind them.  They don't get my vote for parents of the year.  All in all, though, Claudette is finished here.  She is the first hurricane to hit the Texas coast in 13 years, so we're hoping we're safe for at least a decade..."
3NJL67K,female,35,"AH, A GOOD FRIDAY...  It's nearly three o'clock in the afternoon and I'm  still in my PJ's .  Even though I am not getting paid for this day off, I am really enjoying myself.  I'm reading an assortment of things, blogs, my Artist's Way book (if I could ever just get my morning pages done, maybe this writer's block would go away), and I'm catching up on correspondence -- the old fashioned kind -- you know, the kind that involves ink, paper, stamps and envelopes.  Writing letters to people over 90 is rewarding.  My Great Aunt is now 95.  She offers such a great perspective on life, and though her daugher has to write her letters for her now, I get great encouragement from her.  She was one of the first Christians on my mom's side of the family.  She was also one of the first rebels of the faith I ever knew.  She and my grandmother (her sister) were a riot when they were in their 20's.  I love reminiscing with her though she's in Indiana and I'm in Texas.  Yes, I will have to blog about Aunt Edna soon.  Jene' and I are going out for some TexMex food tonight.  Chuy's... yum.  I have the world's most frugal and generous roommate (she buys me dinner frequently).  She gets the most bang for her buck on all of her big purchases (the most recent being a printer) and she saves up the money in advance.  I admire her patience and commitment to staying out of debt.  My debt has been a shackle to me as I have tried to serve God (and compared to most people, I am  way  below the average with the amount of my debt).  It's hard to work for struggling ministries when you have bills.  I encourage everyone I can (especially the college students I have the joy to know at church) to avoid credit cards and debt at all costs.  They are free to leave all they know behind and go to China, Belize, the Sudan -- anywhere -- because they are not tied to paying bills like I am.  Someday, I will get back to that point.  Meanwhile, I work, I keep trying to finish that novel, and I blog.  On a good note, I am working every day next week, but I should be finished with the one job by then.  Then, back to the drawing board.  I am grateful, though, for God's provision thus far.  After all, I've been gainfully  semi-unemployed  (see definition on April 8th) for three years now and I've yet to starve or be homeless.    I must get some writing done before I go to Chuy's... so I will blog later.  Have a good weekend, and remember the reason we all had the day off today."

3NJL67K,female,35,"""SHARON, I THINK THERE'S A FROG IN OUR KITCHEN.""   That's how my roommie greeted me around 11 o'clock this morning.  We had a small monsoon that started around 10:30 and usually, a sustained downpour like that makes a nice puddle in our kitchen beneath the window, but does not usually bring friends into the kitchen.   My head is pounding this morning, as it is raining and also spring in Southeast Texas.  This means everything outdoors is coated with a light yellow powder (pollen) and allergy sufferers like me are miserable.  This is one of the reasons why, at 10:30, I was still in bed when the rain started.    After the frog announcement, I fumble around for my glasses so that I can accurately verify if there's a frog in our kitchen.  I am asked to go downstairs as the backup in the Frog Relocation Program.  Jene' says Q-bert (this is the name chosen for the frog) is her friend, meaning, that Q-bert will eat mosquitoes outside of our apartment, and therefore, deserves to live.  I agree and once downstairs, I verify that indeed, we have a frog on our window sill.    Q-bert looks as if he just lost his tadpole tail this week.  He is that froggy brownish green color and looks to be about an inch and a half long.  Q-bert appears to be not a tadpole, not yet a frog (sorry for the Britney reference).  He looks up at us as if to say, ""there's just too much water out there, can I stay in here with you?"" but Jene' has already grabbed an empty small butter plastic butter dish (or was it a lemon chill cup?) and a paper towel and slowly eases Q-bert into it.  She releases him outside and eventually (we know because we checked) he hops away.  Yes, that was the excitement of our morning.  We have both taken applicable meds and are feeling much better... well, I am, but Jene' is still a little dizzy.  This means I will drive to the movie later and then we'll stop by Sam's to restock on goodies since I am working every day this month and have a slight surplus of cash (which will allow for necessities like toilet paper).    Roommie has now blogged about Q-bert as well.  Need to go check that out!"

3NJL67K,female,35,"HERE COMES CLAUDETTE    You know, I have a great respect for technology and science, but I have to laugh at the predictions that Tropical Storm Claudette would ""absolutely make an abrupt turn westward,"" and make landfall on the border between Texas and Mexico.  ""Don't worry, Houston,"" they said.  ""You won't even know Claudette was here,"" they assured.  Well, I'll give them a little credit, Claudette  did  turn west as predicted...  then she thumbed her nose at the entire world of meteorology and said, ""I'll show you and your (bleepin') computers!""  Claudette then turned back east... then west, as if to tease... then north... then northwest... then she stalled, gained momentum, looked about 200 miles north of South Padre' Island, and said, ""Ooh, let's go play there!""  The eye is now predicted to make landfall in Matagorda Bay, about 82 miles southwest of Houston (if that's what Claudette decides to do.  After all, she could just be playing with us).    Claudette's eye will most likely not pass over Houston, nor will we get much wind and damage from this storm.  Houston is on the east side of this tropical storm (that wants to be a small Category 1 hurricane so bad it can taste it) -- the side of the storm that nets all the RAIN.  The hurricane expert was just asked, ""People in Houston are nervous... should they be?""  He skirted around the issue and wouldn't commit, only saying that it will be windy and rainy right now.   Ah,  you might sigh,  that can't be all that bad, can't it?   Um... yes it can... and hurricane expert knows this, which is why he won't commit on how bad it will be  because...    Let me introduce you to  Tropical Storm Allison  (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001allison.html#FIG5) who wreaked havoc in Houston for about ten days in early June, 2001.  Allison was a supposedly a relatively harmless tropical storm, and it was supposed to sweep through, bring a little rain, knock down a tree or two, and be gone.  If only Allison had been that kind.    Allison attacked on a Tuesday, flooded a good portion of southern Houston (including my friend Ginger's parent's house), left and came back that Friday... (flooding Ginger's parent's house again) dumping up to 38 inches of rain in East Houston and 20 inches downtown for the week... but a big bucket of that rain came in less than 24 hours.   I was in my apartment (on the third floor) that Friday night, watching the radar and wondering how bad things would get.  I have never heard it rain so hard.  (Ginger, who was on her way back from helping her parents carry all their valuables to the second floor of their house, was caught on the freeway in traffic, which had no place to go because all the access roads and low parts of the freeway were under water.  She and her dog, Chloe, spent the night in the car).    Anyway, It was about 10 p.m. when it started raining so hard I couldn't hear my TV at full volume over the torrential downpour, so I went to bed.  At 3:45 a.m., I awoke to people running down the hallways, cussing, screaming, and more than a dozen car alarms.  I sleepily pulled on a flannel shirt over my pj's and stumbled out into the hallway.  My neighbor, was on the phone with her son, crying.  I walked to the end of the hall and looked down.  Every car on the first floor of the parking garage was under water, which was why the car alarms were going off.  It was odd, hearing all those alarms and seeing the headlights blinking under the muddy water.  My car, thankfully, was on the second floor, nice and dry.  I felt sorry for the lady in the next building who had just bought her PT Cruiser.   I met several of my neighbors that night,  most lamenting parking on the first floor.    The oddest thing about Allison was that several people I knew who lived on the West side of town... got about 1-5"" of rain and they had no flooding at all.  The closer into town you got, the higher the rain total.  People lost everything they owned, and it took months to clean up.  Mosquitoes, a usual problem in Houston, were so thick after this that you couldn't be outside very long, even with repellent sprayed everywhere.  I was proud of how the city banded together to help each other, too.  All in all, it was a horrorific experience, though.  Not something I want to go through again.  Now back to Claudette.  Today at work, several people were talking nervously, wondering if we are going to get flooded again.  Granted, in 2001, it was one of the wettest springs ever, and the water had nowhere to go, and this year, though it's rained nearly every day for 40 days, we are still in a deficit and it would take quite a bit of rain to flood like Allison again.    And... the reason I laugh at the technology is... this is nature for goodness sake!  A  storm...  an entity with a mind of its own that has just made a joke of the hurricane experts...again.  Granted, in the past five years, the hurricane gurus have been fairly accurate about strike possibilities, etc., but this time, Claudette giggled, did her own thing, and is about to flex her muscles on the western Gulf coast.    I'll keep you posted!  Don't worry, if you live on the Gulf Coast, you  always  have water and food stored for such a time as this... if indeed it becomes such a time as this..."
3NJL67K,female,35,"PIECES OF METAL IN TIRE NOT A GOOD SIGN   I noticed it last night.  Shiny, menacing, small... protruding from my right front tire.  A sharp spike embedded in the rubber like a nail through my heart.  I don't know if it's Murphy's Law, the law that says, ""Oh yeah, she has no money, let's get her!"" or just one of those days.  UGH.  When I purchased these tires at Discount Tire almost three years ago, I bought the little ""free replacement"" guarantee with those tires.  Remembering this gave me new life this morning.  I'm still not sure if I'll be able to afford the flu shot tomorrow, but I'm closer now than I was when I discovered that long, shiny, metal intruder on my tire.  I drove down to Discount Tire (slowly and carefully, I might add) and made it without incident.  I went to the counter and told the guy, ""I have a right front tire going down.  It's got a nail in it, I think.  When you're finished, can you put the two best tires in front?""  The guy blinks at me, like he didn't understand the words coming out of my mouth.  I realized that he probably thinks all women are dumb about things like this, and in sounding intelligent, I confused him.  I turned on my blonde and said, ""Sir, there's a little silver thingy in my tire on the passenger's side and I think there's air leaking out of it.  Can you fix it?""  I tried to resist twisting my hair around my finger and tilting my head, but I couldn't.  If I'd been chewing gum, I promise you I would have smacked it loudly and made that dumb blonde noise when I was finished.  As I stopped talking the light in the guy's eyes came on and he nodded and asked if I had purchased the tires there.  Sheesh.  My friend Lee Ann from Tulsa and I used to go into the auto section of say, Wal-Mart and announce our presence.  ""Blondes in automotive!"" and Lee Ann, who does the dumb blonde noise perfectly, would add that and a giggle at the end.  Lee Ann probably knows more about cars than I do, but we just loved to see how many guys would come running toward us to ""help"" us after we'd made our announcement.  It was too funny.  I try not to get offended by a man's assumptions that I don't know anything about ""his"" world.  I just keep quiet until he assumptions his way into a corner, and then says something like, ""a foul ball is when the batter hits the ball on the other side of that chalky white line,"" or ""a pair of pliers is that tool that's pointy at the end.""  He then sits back and smiles, thinking he's done his part by informing me of how much he knows about manly things --  thus leaving himself wide open for me to openly mock him.  (In the Southern way, of course -- the way a Southern woman mocks someone and they don't know it for hours, or perhaps  ever ).  After his assumption is in a sling, I simply make a truthful, consise statement showing that my other  x  chromosome, perhaps, is a little short, thus resembling, but not imitating, a  y,  or that I, perhaps, might (gasp) understand what he's been talking about, or what's going on in the game.   I've found that men  ass ume that most women know nothing about:  a) cars b) sports c) barbecue (like cooking outdoors makes it  different ) d) everything else   except   those tasks that require an apron, a stove, or sewing machine... and they'll give us credit for having the knowledge of how to take care of those screaming, needy entities that emerged from our wombs  If you're a man, and you're reading this and you're a little miffed at my blatant ""anti y-chromer"" overtones, I ask you to remember how outraged, angry and small you feel right now... the next time you assume anything about what a particular woman does or doesn't know.  And if you're  really  nice and treat me like the intelligent princess I am, when you ask me for my phone number, I might give you my real one and not the number to the prayer line at church.  The Cubs just blew a three run lead.  I have to go now.  Hopefully, they'll get it together and I can put my sackcloth and ashes away."

Now I'm tuning in to see if the  Dallas Cowboys  even show up (though they are playing the Vick-less Falcons, so they have a chance).    I might add that the  Indianapolis Colts  also won today, though, from all reports I've read, they almost forgot to show up.

3NJL67K,female,35,"BEING A CELEBRITY    Let me insert this disclaimer here...   I am not telling anyone how to live their lives or condemning them if they don't share my beliefs.  I am merely stating my opinion.  I've learned that the world does not have to agree with me... and agreeing to disagree helps me sleep at night.  I don't have to be right all the time and sometimes, I'm not even sure I am anyway.  In fact, think of this as my point of view from this side of the fence.   Yesterday, the world was shaken to the core by the confession of Britney Spears -- ""Well, even though I said I was going to wait until I got married, well, no, I'm really not a virgin anymore.""  You can read about it here:  ( http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1473676/20030708/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true  or at any other major news wire service).  I tell you, I did not see this coming!  (insert sarcastic laugh here).  After all, Britney coyly made the declaration several years ago that though she dressed like she wanted some action, she was going to remain a virgin until she said, ""I do,"" and people all over the country applauded her stance.  I didn't hold my breath.  The abstinence stance of a few pop stars in the late nineties was the ""in"" thing because this country, in a desperate attempt to get teens to consider the consequences of unsafe sex, gave these pop icons a lot of  press  for these statements.  Britney wanted to advertise her goods but she didn't want people to talk about her as if she were a slut, so this declaration, obviously, kept Britney walking the tightrope as she maneuvered through pop stardom with a high profile boyfriend.  Before we stone her, I do have to say this.  Though she put herself up on that pedestal, very few people can accomplish what she said she was trying to do:  wait.    I do know, though, that it's not impossible to wait.   I'm a 34 year-old virgin.  I have friends who are virgins and friends who aren't.  I don't look at them and judge them or refer to them as, ""this is *name* my non-virgin friend.""  It just doesn't work that way.  There's enough room in my heart for people who are different than I am, for people who look at life differently than I do.   If I didn't, my life would feel pretty shallow.  But I digress...  My roommate gives sex talks to sixth graders and introduces herself as ""Texas' Oldest Living Virgin.""  Kids are just astounded that a woman can be 42 years old, not have sex and be totally and completely normal (Jene' would laugh at the ""normal"" part).  Because of all of the commercials, TV programs and movies that bombard them with the notion that sex is cool, kids think virgins are weird and must never think about sex in order to remain that way.  Let me be the first to tell you, this is not true.  Virgins date.  Virgins kiss.  Virgins think about sex.  Virgins are sexy.  They just choose to wait to have sex until marriage.    Some people wait because of a commitment to God.  Some wait because they are afraid of disease.  Some wait because they  know  that if anybody on the planet can get pregnant the first time they have sex... it would be them and they know they aren't ready to be parents just yet.  (Jene' volunteers as a birthing coach for pregnant teens and you would be amazed at how many 14-16 year olds said it was their first time or said, sadly, ""but he said he loved me"").   Some were violated as children and have huge issues with the opposite sex and they need to get that figured out first.  Some wait because they have older, wiser men and women preach at them and others like some friends of mine who absolutely regret not waiting and beg them to not follow in their footsteps. Regardless of the underlying belief to commit to this challenge, many people wait and wait successfully (they just don't get their names put in the paper).    All that to say, I think some say they would wait because it's been the cool thing to say the past decade.  They align themselves with the abstinence movement and the headlines follow.  The fifteen minutes of fame turns into twenty.  To stretch that to twenty five minutes... they come out and say, well, nobody on earth could really do that anyway... and so on.  When I worked in PR the saying was, ""Any press is good press.""  I beg to differ (and I'm sure Kobe would too).  Being a celebrity is about keeping your name out there, visible, on the tip of every tongue that waggles.  Since Britney is not even on the back burner any more, I don't doubt that her most recent declaration is an attempt to rekindle whatever is left of her career.   How sad to be at the end of your career at 21, struggling, clawing, doing anything to hang on to what you  had  instead of saying, ""Okay, that was great, now let's do something new,"" and reinventing yourself.   She's lived a quarter of her life and made more money than I will in a lifetime and she doesn't know what to do with herself now.    Unless Britney gets a grip, she will follow a long line of former stars that will use anything to keep their names in the spotlight.  The following are a few tried and true tactics that will add a few minutes to her window of fame.  (Note: some people actually go through the following legitimately with no intention to capitalize on it, but I'm not talking about  those  people).         a)  ""I've found God/become a Christian.""   The Christian subculture will pick this up, tattoo that label on the star's forehead, and extend a career quite a bit... if you like being trapped inside a box.  Of course, you see a few people actually make this declaration and  mean  it, in which case, they usually fade out of the spotlight because they realize the fame is actually sucking the life out of them and they can put their talents to good use -- like helping people.    (good example of that:  Bono)  b)  ""I've moved on from God to (fill in blank of mysticism, guru or combination of religion that suits my purposes).""   Again, the Christian subculture will give them tons of press as they crucify the star and the mainstream culture will embrace them temporarily because they've ""come back to the fold.""    c)  ""I've had a drug problem since kindergarten.""   Rehab is  so  chic right now.  People can identify with the triumph of overcoming an addiction.  I've been sober 9 years on July 22nd and had I known that rehab was so chic, I would have gone so I could write about it and sell some books, get my name in the headlines... oh, wait, I'm unimportant in Hollywood, so it wouldn't have done me any good anyway.    d)  Newsflash:  *Big Shot* has nervous breakdown .  The nervous breakdown can be played for a ton of sympathy and can be followed up with a triumphant return to the biz with a mediocre movie or CD.  e)  My Ex Just Got Married and it Broke My Heart .  ""But, we're still best friends, we still write songs together and our children will go to the same Montessori school and also be best friends.""  People eat that stuff up.  f)  ""So what my girlfriend/boyfriend is 20 years older/younger than me!  We're in love!""   A good looking couple, with a tie-in to a movie, CD, or well timed scandal, can milk this for a good six weeks then renew interest during the stormy breakup and milk that for a week or two.  and last, but not least...  g)  *former child star* caught stealing Powerpuff Girls stickers from Target :  This is a good one.  First there's the public disbelief that their little precious could do something that stupid.  Then,  there's the  trial  and the community service in the children's shelter downtown.  This publicity could last for months.  That's my rant for today... I so need a job!"
3NJL67K,female,35,"""WARDROBE MALFUNCTIONS"" AND OTHER LAME EXCUSES   Even people who didn't tune in to the Super Bowl  at all  knew what happened by the time I got to work today.  If the whole purpose of the classless stunt pulled by Janet and Justin (J & J) was to get some publicity and get people talking about them, it worked.  Most of what I heard today, even from people I know who are hard to shock, were stunned silent after the halftime show ended last night, and it wasn't just J & J's fault.  The lyrics to every song included sexual references, but because we have become such a visual nation, I think that increased the shock when Janet's sleazy dancers appeared and then the  wardrobe malfunction  happened.    The FCC is now involved  urlLink   and what maybe started as a classless, tasteless stunt is going to cost someone big bucks.  I think it should start with the performers, but given we live in a society where accused (innocent until proven guilty) rapists, murders, abusers and pedophiles --   who just happen to be professional athletes or celebrities   -- roam free (because they have the money from their celebrity) and even continue to play and perform, I doubt much happens to J & J but a momentary public shunning and maybe some embarrassment.   I think Viacom (who owns CBS and MTV) is going to get a huge fine... but that's about it.  When Janet's new CD comes out, will people buy it?  Yes.  As memorable as the  wardrobe malfunction  was, the public's memory is so short, so forgiving, so willing to look the other way, even when a woman's breast is bared in an attempt to shock 100 million people (that included many children).  Besides, it's easier to forget about it because that's what the majority will do... the high road, the right thing, is always tougher and is always represented by the minority.  Morals just aren't cool.  Nipple shields and  wardrobe malfunctions  are.    Janet's new single was  coincidentally  shipped to radio stations this weekend.  Her name was mentioned millions of times today -- more press than she's received in years.  The only way to stop this behavior among celebs is to not buy their product when they act like their brains were sucked out of their heads... but that doesn't happen.  If people stopped buying Madonna and Britney's ""music"" after their recent stunt, then the next time an opportunity to prove their lack of morals and class presented itself, they might (okay, that's a stretch, I know) think twice.    This will not be the end of Janet's career, or Justin's.  They will rise back to the top faster than you can say Dixie Chicks."

4WC42EO,male,16,"Happy Breakie  Yippee!!! It's finally the weekends, and plus! there won't be school next Monday. But the sad thing is that there is still homework. Oh well, but I'm still thankful for the break. I hadn't had my diarhoea rounds today, so I hope that this time, it's really recovering. And band practice was ok. I'm glad cause we weren't scolded by the conductor, and it was a bit more enjoyable. And yeah!!! I'll be playing Eflat Clarinet all the way for Speech Day! So cool. Just hope the teacher-in-charge doesn't criticise the band again. Tomorrow's the first Outdoor BS I'll be attending. So exciting. Anyway, for me, spiritual life is picking up, emotional life is up, physical life is better(I just recovered from illness), and school life, for the mean time is still easy to cope. Really thank God. I kinda realised how people(or at least me) always only feel as though they are learning from God, or feel that God is graceful and can safe them when in trouble. However, when life is peaceful, I sometimes feel that life is boring, God is not so active anymore, we start to put away God's goodness after a while, and take everything for granted, then, we get into trouble and start the whole cycle again. It shows how each of us choose to acknowledge God and His goodness at different times. But actually, we should always give thanks to God whatever the circumstances. And to remember that He is good, and He is there. I'm working on it. Anyway, my entire life is basically about God's goodness, it's just whether I notice it. God is so good, always good."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Lots of sleep in the day  Well, today was nothing much. After I last entered here, I just slept and slept till 4.30pm, when I quickly woke up to prepare sonds for Sunday. Still haven't prepare songs and stuff for tomorrow. Guess maybe I'll do it tomorrow. So excited about this Saturday. Just messaged Min and Jie a bit. Then went to Kent Ridge Guild House with my family. Just went there and bathe then eat dinner only la. Ok...what a boring day. At least I got lots of rest.Ok...hope I'll be back here tomorrow again."
4WC42EO,male,16,"The trouble is not with love, but humans...  I thought love was painful. Love was troublesome. How true... but all these only because I did not understand true love. True love is like God's love. Agape, sacrificial love. People changed love into a kind of self-centered-ness. They call it ""falling in love"", which is just a desire to be loved. But agape is different. True love is self-less. Which happens to be the opposite. So if you think ""love"" is painful, maybe true love is wonderful. God is love, we need God. Today,I just went to school to practice the school and national anthem in the new school. I remember the last time I went there was like still only two storeys. Now it's already almost completed. And seven storeys high!!! Haven't got the school feel yet. Then went home very early(kinda found a way to go home) And slacked around. Somehow ended up sleeping till 3pm. Then woke up, and tidied up my room a bit. Nothing much, except my conversation with my jie about love. Just talked about alot of stuff. I felt confused la. All the feelings and stuff. But I can only hang on. I can't run away cos it's in me. I just have to let God take charge I guess. Tomorrow's first day of school at the new school. So exciting. But it's only cleaning up. Maybe I'll go East Coast some time. Ok...quite a boring day. Thanks jie for being my best friend too! hehe..."

4WC42EO,male,16,"New Age  Recently, I just kinda caught up in new age classics, or otherwise known technically as classical crossovers. Well, I think it's really kinda cool. Some examples would be 'Bond' and 'The Planets'. I think they are much more 'cooler' then those boy bands and stuff. They just 'class'! (I can't say that they rock) Oh well, maybe I can now find my type of music.  Talking about new age, I was watching the International Inter-Varsity Chinese Debates. And there were these Sweden and some other European University debating on whether 'Man should be encouraged to be the breadwinner of the family, while women be homemakers.' And a main point that kepy coming up was the difference between the old society or the modern society, in other words, the new age. And in relation to this, my sister (Jasmine) said that I must know how to wash dishes cause girls don't know how to these days and they won't fancy guys that can't wash dishes (whatever *rolls eyes*). What's the world coming to?!?! As much as I believe that men shouldn't look for wifes to be their maids, women shouldn't look for men to be homemakers! It's like hiring a lifetime servant with courtship, roses and that XX carat diamond ring!!! Come on, no matter how much society has changed, the fact that marriage is more than mere distinction of roles remains the same. Marriage is about feeling and life commitment, not slavery of servant-hood. Oh...I don't bother. People are just creating more problems for themselves. Humans just have to put every role or job or anything on a scale. Bad is no longer just not good. But rather, they are just like numbers representing a scale of measurement. Comparison is a way of priding  ourselves.  Ok...I got pricked by seven gigantic cactus needles. I had to pull 3 out and 1 is still stucked. This is official declaration that the most dreaded plant to me is...*drum rolls*...CACTUS!!! (Mr Cactus goes on stage) Mr. Cactus says, 'Firstly, I would like to thank Yonghan, who got pricked by my needles, without whom, I wouldn't be where I am today... ...'  Today is my sister's (Rosemary, I have 4 sisters) birthday, so hope she's had a happy day, apart from the person who approached her concerning the survey. hehe.  Ok...I'm going now.

4WC42EO,male,16,"Letting my inner child out.  Ok. My inner child is 16 year old. (By the way, I'm 15 actually.) So I'm supposed to be quite realistic and I'm who I am suppose to be. Well, I hope I am. Cause I just realised that I'm pretty much not having all the fun that I should be having.  It's been quite boring these days. Not that I have nothing to do, but I really just feel like getting out of the house and hangout. Though the fact, is that there won't be anyone to hangout with. Only strange thing that everybody else is probably at home thinking about the  smae thing. Either way, Singapore is so small! Where can I go? At least there's YF tomorrow. So I can like take the chance to get out of the house a little. Only problem, that I now realise that I only have 8 days to prepare something to be done next Saturday! Arrr!!! Oh no...I'm really not in the mood to sit down and think these days. In fact, I think I'm trying hard not to be so indoors all the time. Why can't I be like really out going. Think that would be much more fun. OK...hope my old school friends would call up soon and decide on a day to hangout. (not to forget that it had better be on my free day, I haven't managed to join them for any since we left primary school)  Tried bowling a few days ago. Kinda cool. Although I lost the second game terribly with only 56 points. But I guess it's like that if you don't really play the game. Maybe I can go play bowling sometime again. (though my hand still hurts from the previous game) So, my class won third placing Inter-class Basketball Tournament. And guess what, I was in the team, when I didn't even touch the ball. Cause I lent my  PE attire to someone, so I didn't play. But who cares, at least I get a medal. *hehe*  Recently, I noticed too, that there are so many of my friends about my age with all the MSN nicks about love and stuff like that. Example: 'Loving you...it make me happy.'  and 'cos the way I feel when we're together, I know that's the way, I'll always feel for you...' Even my little sister typed something about love used to being everything. Thus, my hypothesis is that this is common in adolescents! (oops...I just declared it upon myself too.) But it's just real I mean, although someone already said it before I did, I never thought it would be so real. But it can be sweet, especially scenarios on TV. Wait...what am I saying! Well, you see, it's real. I mean it gets into me too.*blushes* Oh well, who cares...it'll be over...right? *hmm...*  Cool, this is getting a bit more sixteen year old. Make things sound so much interesting. I remembered this song sung by Mandy Moore called '17'. If only I had enough talent to write my own called '15 turning 16' But don't think I would be able to. I even gave up guitar without really trying.I have little perseverance. Maybe I should just stick with my clarinet. Then one day, I shall start a music revolution with classical crossovers to more pop, and maybe even rock!*haha* Impossible at my current pace.  Ok...I should go. I've got lots to do.

Talking to Emilia and all...hehe...band enthusiast! Somemore she's a clarinetist too. Everytime I talk to her, I start to feel enthu about band too...cos she always is. hehe...And then we had dinner at Sky Garden, Followed by a sharing from Lincoln. It was very much a good reminder and evaluation of ourselves la. Then we were talking bout being Christian students la. And then, I remembered about Jamie Sullivan from ""A Walk to Remember"". She is a Christian. And what meant most in her life was her faith. And she was never afraid to show it. Even at the expense of her popularity, or in her case, more of being normal.(what the rest of the teens thought la) And I think she's a really good example, although she's fiction.

They purposely made themselves late i think. So I reached school at 8.01am. I was 1/2 hour late lor...sighz...thank goodness like nobody ws interested in catching me. So no detention..yeah!!! Then basically school was all slack. Didn't even have a single period of proper lessons. Then school ended at 12.05pm. Then joined some YFers at East Coast Macs for lunch. Cool huh? It's my school neighbourhood now! Okok..gotta go. I think I should pass my time to my sister instead. Ok, will be back tomorrow."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Crazy time at Orchard Guild House  I didn't enter last night, cause I only reached home at like 11.30 pm. Cause we were at Orchard Guild House!!! But I think I'll start from the beginning of the day first. It's Sunday, so as usual, I would go to church with my siblings. And the message was on 1 Thessalonians. I like speaker (but i don't remember his name) , he spoke in our church before. Since then I already like his messages,a really interesting and funny speaker, and there's still things to learn too. Then he was talking about marriage and sex. Which is what I'm reading in my book now. But really impressed, cause it's a difficult topic to handle and I thot no speaker will address it as clearly as he did. But he didn't spend much time on though, but still impressed. Then after Sunday School, had sub-comm prayer. Our sharing always so crappy one. As in just a group of funny people la...But I missed Music Ministry meeting la. But at least, I got to learn a bit more about piano from Junwen. I have like so many teachers. But it's exciting la...to be able to play.  After that, we ate lunch at Cineleisure with a whole group of YFers. Then we played pool at the rainbow room in Orchard Guild House, while some studied. Of course many were tempted...haha. But we had fun la...even just crapping around and talking. I even managed to get to know more about baptism from Randy. I'm really thinking about it la. But I'm still praying. Maybe I'll go for it end of this year. Then we somehow ended up watching X-men together. Then some of the sisters (even my own sister) got so interested. But Min Er was the hyper one. She even chose the X-men she wanted to be. hehe...then she ended up with Lady Deathstrike. But X-men really cool la. It's until 9.30pm, then we went for dinner at KFC. That's how I reached home so late. At least I didn't get scolded by my parents. Then today, I went to school without finishing my homework. Then stayed back after school with Nat for a while. I'm glad we're getting closer now la. And my father fetched me home. And to my surprised, he asked me what computer game I wanted. Ended up with Lord of the Rings la. But don't think I should play it now. So now I'm home early. Glad that I'm able to catch up with Yen a bit through MSN. Ok...very tired from all the typing. Hope I'll be back tomorrow again."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Migraine...  Argh...I'm kinda getting a relapse of migraine these days, and it seems so long term now, and I get it so often. Just hope it'll go off. And I'm feeling really tired too. No idea why. Guess it's just the exams. Somehow, I really miss the 'happy-go-lucky' attitude.  I'm kinda like alone these days, haven't been catching up with anybody. So also don't tell people much about what's happening. And I'm getting too lazy to share my life with people already. Anyway, sometimes it just feels good to lead your own life. But guess that's kinda selfish though. But the good side of these now, is that I'm growing with God. So basically the only person I really share with is God. It really does give me the 'always here for me' feeling. I guess we can never be more secured than in Christ. We might not notice, but in our hearts, I believe that many of us depend on God. I remember reading in 'The Notebook' by Nicholas Sparks about how the girl, Allie, told the guy about how he was the only thing constant in her life. I guess that's what God is to me, someone who is always constant.  I'm starting to feel more for my school ministry already. We haven't been doing much recently, so I really hope that we would grow as a group. But it's hard especially when we're all from different denominations with different beliefs, so we kinda have different beliefs, or rather similar ones that are of different extreme-ness.  Oh ya...talking about other people just now, I'm glad I've been keeping in touch with Emilia since she left. It's like so cool! And we're sharing thru email la. So at least there's someone else I can talk to.  I've been trying to be perfect these days, and obviously I'm horrible at it. But guess that's true for any human. But I guess we should all just make the effort to be Christ-like. Not just better moraled people, but Christ-like(anybody can practice good morals).  I just realised that I usually don't have someone to talk to in church. Cos I was like just walking around this morning and felt so bored. Maybe it's just that I don't really have a fixed group of people to hang around. (haha...like Yongquan) But even with my own peers, there aren't much to talk about and if I ask about their lives, it just feels odd. I wonder how people start conversations so easily. I guess I don't talk well, even though I talk alot actually. But usaully end feeling interupting other people. Sian...maybe it's a chance for me to be in solitude. Besides that, I only talk to other people about work or something that is service related. Just hope it's not because I'm totally preoccupied with work.  There's this hymn we sung today. It came right after I was thinking about how little I loved God. Then just felt so bad and guilty. Then I started to get the 'am I a professing christian' feeling. But the hymn has this part that talks about how we realise our insignificant love for God, but yet we'll continue to love Him more and more. It's hymn 141 and here it goes:  It is a thing most wonderful, Almost too wonderful to be, That God's own Son should come from heaven And die to save a child like me.  And yet I know that it is true: He came to this poor world below, And wept and toiled and mourned and died, Only because He loved us so.  I cannot tell how He could love A child so weak and full of sin; His love must be most wonderful, If He could die my love to win.  But even could I see Him die, I could but see a little part Of that great love, which, like a fire, Is always burning in His heart.  It is most wonderful to know His love for me so free and sure; But 'tis more wonderful to see My love for Him so faint and poor.  And yet I want to love Thee, Lord: Oh, light the flame within my heart, And I will love Thee more and more Until I see Thee as Thou art!  William Walsham How, 1823-97"
4WC42EO,male,16,"Burdensome Sunday  For some reason, I always feel very burdened and stress on Sunday. It's like it always bring back some unhappy memories, it's like the opposite. Shouldn't I be feeling peace. Maybe the fact that the next day is school and I haven't finished my homework bothers a bit too. But I only hope that I would have peace from the Lord, and I know that he's ready to give it to me. I just have to accept it.  Anyway, Friday was just a crazily busy day. With no free time at all, driving you till you have no energy. But the thought that it's Saturday the next day, and I'll be at YF is always refreshing. Saturday, I had band practice. And as usual, the fourth week in a row, I had make up lessons. So once again, (to my pleasure) I missed band practice again...hehe. Well, after that I went to Burger King to meet Corlissa and Yap Min, well, they were late, including Annabelle, whom I wasn't expecting. Then we went to Cold Storage to get the stuff for the progamme and for the refreshments, which turned out to be tons of chips. Well, at least we had mayo crabsticks on biscuits. I like the games during the workshop, although I already did them during the training, it was definitely different with so much more people. And there were new things to learn too. Although the Student Peer Group didn't talk much. As usual, the day ends with Captain's Ball followed by dinner at Heartland Mall. Today, I was to lead songs again(note:  just lead the day before at YF). But it's really nice to be a service to God. And I have to remember that I'm His unworthy servant too. I sang ""You are so faithful"" just now. It really brings back fond memories as well as sad ones. But I think I have to remind myself that I have chosen to let things go. I don't know what I'm suppose to mean by writing this here, but I hope the person who knows what I mean will not take it to heart. Sorry to that person. I guess even still, the song still has it's meaning. Thank God for being faithful. Anyway, I came homw to watch ""Fellowship of the Ring"" a second time today. It's really a touching great show. OK...gotta go and finish my work. Especially Chemistry, while Mr Wong still has good impression of me. Gotta be a Student for Christ!!!"
4WC42EO,male,16,"Am I really that emotional???  Everyday in class, there'll be sometime in class when I look out of the window and just ponder about stuff. What stuff? I also don't know. But Darrel who sits beside me would always just say that I'm a sentimental person, just because I look out of the window and write letters in class. He's like always trying to find out what I'm thinking about. But I haven't told him anything though. Thanks anyway for your concern Darrel. (although he doesn't visit my blog.) So I'm some emotional person. Well, they say I am. But if I am that super-sensitive a person, wouldn't life be devastating? Maybe I am, but I think there's always another personality to cover things up. But I enjoy life. Maybe not so much this year. Always bring me back to realise myself in my adolescent years, where changes takes place. I don't know how I'll change, but my life is God's I will remember. Well,  today was kinda ok. It's just the same everyday. But today I didn't finish my work so I had to worry, which turned out to be waste of my energy, cause non of the teachers went through the homewrok. Then, I got back my English Comprehension. Argh...I got 12/25. I hate the new 'O' level format. It's like only 10 people in my class passed. This is crazy. Guess I just have to learn to get used to the new marking scheme. I can't wait for History lessons to start again. But I guess it'll be a long time before we start, since they'll be little lessons next week due to the moving of school. But that's exciting too. Either way, History is still my favourite subject. Well, Geography is ok...just that there's occasional ""boring spells"". Today's temperature is 36.86 degree celsius. I wanna go home!!! I need to be 37.60 and above to go home. But I guess I should be thankful for my good health. OK...I'll be back tomorrow!!!"

But we missed our stop and went on the expressway where it only stopped nearing Changi Airport. But we thought we could cross the road to take us back to school, only to find out that none of the buses bring us back. So we thought we would just get into any bus and get closer to school first. But turned out that before we could get even close to school, the bus turned into an expressway that brought us to Woodlands via Pasir Ris. And we took taxi back from Seleter Camp.  Well, just wanted to fill up this entry I accidentally created. Oh well."

4WC42EO,male,16,"Losing myself in myself  OK...my spiritual walk hasn't been great lately. It's always fluctuating. If only I can be constantly reminded of God. Sigh...I just don't know what to say about it. I mean, now, my life is just so bland, without all the peace and joy and all. I guess, I'm just spending too much time thinking about myself...and burying myself in activities that attend to my own interest. I even try to seek attention at times...sigh...(I associate myself with seeker not for this reason) I'm self-centered...Music Ministry was into that Others-centered thingy over lunch. I guess it'll be just so great if we never got distracted by our own desires. But because of this, I guess all the more we are dependant on God. Either way, it's best to be God-centered.  Holidays have started. But I wouldn't expect this holidays to be a great one. There's so much homework and band practices. Even if I don't do my work and just enjoy, I won't be able to totally lift that burden. Anyway, I don't have many plans for my holidays. It's like there isn't really anything I want to do, and there's no one to go out with. I just want to spend time with certain people. People I love so dearly and mean so much to me. It's like it is just the presence that matters.  I saw Melissa and Michelle praying together yesterday, and I was like telling Jiashu that it's so sweet. And he told me that I could do that too. And I'm just totally shocked. If I'm not wrong, I only prayed once with one of my sisters personally. At least that's all I remembered. And it was when I accepted Christ into my life. Sigh...just realised that my family so rarely spend time together.  I don't know how to end this entry. Maybe I'll just leave it hanging."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Argh...today started with me waking up with a pain in my wrist, and it still hurts now as I press on the keyboard. Probably due to my terrible sleeping position and getting my hand squashed under my body. Oh well, hope it heals soon. Either that, long enough for me to miss my performance on 6th December. I don't wanna perform without being able to practise.  YF for today was Bible Study and Student Ministry Time. The video did by Student Life Sub-commitee (the one I'm in) was quite funny. But turned out that some parts were able to impact certain people. And I did round up. Was quite nervous, but not that nervous actually for someone doing it the first time. Hope it was fine. After all, it's God's message and I didn't want to deliver it poorly. Maybe I would post it here sometime, so those who couldn't catch my words can read it for themselves.  I kind of miss people. Although I see this people rather often, but it just feels like you haven't really met them. Like you don't really talk with them and stuff. Well, my life kinda just surrounds going about doing things now. I think I'm happy. At least I'm less moody these days, not that I am often. But I do feel love and patient sometime. And it's great. It's great to do chores and feel happy about it. I guess a very delightful form of service is help. Being helpful and simple and makes you feel really light-hearted.  Oh well, I should go now. Should catch some sleep before some of the interesting happenings to take place the next day."

But it everything was ok. Except that Mrs Bala accused me of copying...T.T argh...nevermind. Bascially, sectionals was super duper crappy. We weren't even practicing. We were just playing for fun. Haiz...can't we just get serious. I got a chance to walk around city area alone today for nothing. I felt free suddenly. Like I was able to forget all my worries. Then I was waiting for the bus at Marina. I just thought, how great would it be to just go walk about alone in a park and just think abou stuff. Then I was thinking of getting some friends along to go to Sentosa and enjoy ourselves during the holidays. Then after that can stay over at someone's house also. cool...probably my old friends from primary school. Really miss them. Either way, I'm hoping to get away from stuff. I really look forward to that... I also don't really no what to say. But I have to admit I have alot of plans now. I really hope to enjoy and to forget all the worries I have now.

4WC42EO,male,16,"My life is in constant motion. Falling away, and the next moment coming back together. Then fall away again...like air particles moving at high speeds in random motions. And right now, I just feel that I'm losing control of my own life. But that's no problem, cause most of the time I would be able to gather it back. But there are just certain things I wish to address.  As many who know me would know that I just camp back from the Youth Retreat. And to be honest, despite the many changed lives and people, and people who thoroughly enjoyed and learned from the camp, my experience was a totally different one. It was probably one of the worst camps I've ever been to. Not in terms of planning or the work done by the commitee, but rather my role during the camp as group leader, and the discouragement I get so often.  It started out with that terribly barren population of my group (this is no offence to my ex-group members), which already removed half my heart for excitement during the camp. Then the next day, I got really fed up, cause it's so hard to be a friend to people and at the same time a group leader. I was angry with people, but more with myself. And all the 'like here like there' thingy (my sister refers to it this way) really destroys my day. To be honest, I think that adolescent 'love' is probably pure infatuation and selfish foolishness, I know that by saying this, I offended like 99.99% of my close friends (that's if I ever had any), but I don't care, cause that's what I think. I'm not talking this in a bias viewpoint. In fact, I didn't say this because I just had a rejection from someone I really 'like', but instead, it's quite the opposite.  I shall now officially leave the topic of camp. And now, I have a confession to make. A big one. One that's probably an invitation to a one to one personal time with almost everyone who reads this entry. Here goes...For this past year, I've had two mutual crushes. Don't mind me using the word. I don't believe in adolescent 'love' anymore, although I should have thought better than to believe in something so 'fairy tale' in the first place. One lasted  10 months and another a week. And just a moment ago, I felt terrible and guilty and was faced with the: 'She needs you more from both people.' You know, at this point of time, you just want the whole world to tell you that you're a sinful scumbag who is heartless and deserves all condemnation possible. That would have made me feel better. Instead, every single person I talked to said I did the right thing and at least I was honest and all. Oh...brother... But now, I've made up my mind and I'm telling myself that I'm never going to like another girl (I'll just perish all thoughts concerning anything like it) for 5 years. That'll help. It's not that hard after having made the same mistake with two different people. Disclaimer: This two people are great people, but my heart is now hardened and I shall not let them take any romantic position in my life which I feel is hardly possible even if I allow them to, since adolescent 'love' is just a lie that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. *quote*love or not love, true love, such a thing is too early to be possible for us.*unquote*  I don't understand why people fall out with people. You know, like why can't the whole world be friends? I know the problem is sin. But everyone things that it's the other person. Partly, I mean totally, that's due to sin too. But people just tend to be selfish, don't they? I often feel that the young people (around my age) are separated into two factions. There's a group that is the 'in' group. Supposedly better looking and the more well dressed and fun people to be with, and the more quiet, if not less popular people that only just want to have friends. (forgive me...) This are just my thoughts, nobody said they are or were true. Ok...this is out of point. I think I just wanna express my unhappines.  I was at the Music Camp Concert on Sunday night. And looking at the kids, I realised that innocence is so precious, and is something that should be well treasure. With innocence, all you want is fun and be happy. As someone said, 'You just like this person *full stop*' 'Love' would be ten times more fun, and also, in case of self conciousness, it is practically non-existent. I mean I went just where a Batman costume and walk about the street without worry about being laughed at if only I still there much of innocence. It'll be silly to say that I am not innocent at all, cause if you say that you are, you're probably too innocent. But I do feel that I'm innocent, but still not enough to be the inner child inside of me, which I would like to deny that is 16 years old.  Ok...last of all. I still love God and He has control over my life. After all this, all the more so. I've sort out my thoughts, my life is God, that's my decision. Soli Deo Gloria!"

But either way, i thought it would be a good way of reflecting for me. For now, I just feel like sitting on the couch doing nothing. It's like life's boring. I think that's the reason. Recently, I'm beginning to get into my own dream world once again. In this world, anything is possible, as long as you believe. Sounds like Matrix huh??? Well, it's just fantasy. Well, don't get me wrong, it's not infatuation. It's just that, for example, I can imagine being an X-men. Cool huh...imagine you could fly...whoa...yeah...it's just in the mind. But as long as it works in driving away boredom. So what's the problem with me??? What do I want? Maybe I just miss people. Maybe I just want to get into some exciting event to serve God.( I certainly hope I'm not serving myself that way.) But now, I seem all trapped and tied down by my books. Homework's piling up. But that doesn't bother me. (hehe...I'm gifted...in last minute work.) I think what I need now is sometime with God to reflect. A wondeful scenario is seeing myself in an air-conditioned room, with the sun's rays shining into the room. Giving warmth..feels like God's radiance. Just cosy. Then, with my journal in front of me, along with God's work, and preferably a book(Christian Literature). That'll be great. Some cake...Apple Strudel??? With Ice Lemon Tea would be so wonderful. And the whole place added with a touch of worship tunes. Wow!!! That would be awesome!!! But the only time I could do that is during the holidays. And without my parents home.(they'll probably scold me for switching on the air-conditioner. But something like that later would be satisfying enough, anyway, what could be compared to the very presence of our Father in heaven. =) I got my chance of gazing out of the window, and have the wind hitting onto my face. It's always so refreshing, and perfect for some reflection. But today, I longed for something. I'm not sure what...but I must remember that God is still my greatest desire. Well, today I had a great deal of time to do ""nothing"" since the teacher wasn't here, giving the class 4 free periods. But thank God, I needed that to finish my homework. Gave Darrel my blog address. So greetings to you!!! If he ever decides to drop by. Ok...time to go off to finish my work..so I can look forward to a great night tonight.

4WC42EO,male,16,"Just reached home about 45 minutes ago. School life is rather traumatising. Even now, as I sit down here typing, I have 350 more pages of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' to finish. If I was like a few of my friends, it wouldn't be a problem. But in my case, it'll be quite a feat to finish this book by tomorrow. But no point putting myself through such anxiety. What is a small percentage of CA marks compared to my physical, emotional and mental distress? (Basically stress.) So, in any case, I've decided to take it easy. After all, my life isn't about, my expectations and me writing my biography with complete control of the story line. So I'll just let go and let God take control. What difference does it make if I go to SAJC with 14 points (that's if I am able to), instead of getting to a top 5 JC. Even in thinking logically, getting to SRJC doesn't mean I can't get to University. How much more do I have to convince myself since such a reason really does make sense to me? Furthermore, God doesn't look at grades. Will God love me less for not getting below 10 points for 'O' level? No way!If my God is as of such particular a person about worldy merits, what need would I have of him? Do I need another person to act as school teachers, employers, etc.? For the wisdom of men is foolishness to God.  This question I've been pondering about. What is blind faith? Is that such a thing at all?  Is it better to trace His hand with great certainty? Or to trust His heart with great faith?"

4WC42EO,male,16,"It's Christmas. Just 6 more days to the new year, 2004. Where all would start anew.  Looks like I hit the hot topics this week. And my previous entry was probably a must read special edition for many people. So much so that people actually gather and read it together. Pretty amusing, I would have to say. But not many understood fully how I felt when I typed everything on that day. I thank this person, because this person truly understands me. (Besides God.)  Hmm...to be honest it's pretty cool to be the main thing in conversations, but at the same time, I really dread being the center of attraction. So will everybody out there just pretend I didn't say anything? I'm trying to get on with my life here you know. It's like having a paparazzi following you day in, day out.  I wish I could be much more innocent. Like little children. And that's just what I plan to work on. To abide by the will of God, with innocence like a child's. Having an inner child of 1 year old isn't exactly a right thing you know. Some how, I think I foresaw my life now when I was only 6. Because that year, the thing I dreaded most, was to grow up. I didn't want to grow up.  ""Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."" -Matthew 18: 3-4- (English Standard Version)  Second thing. I want to be a whitelighter to others in the new year. Not in the sense of physically being able to orb everywhere and appear when the call, but I want to be a guardian to people. Which I always failed to be. Because I am never sensitive enough. I cannot care enough. It probably just wasn't in my character. But people, just let me get on with life and be a guardian angel to my friends.  I need to learn about love. It is something which is so hard to grasp, yet so powerful. All I want is to love like God loves us.

How true...indeed there are many times and moments we should really cherish. Moments that are once in a lifetime, even moments when we go through hardship, the ""downs"" in our lives. Now, I stand in this point in my life. There are times I miss. My primary school days, my time seating alone by the window, the happy times I spend with my friends. But I can't go back now. These will only remain as memories. I see now that I must cherish them. I see them in photographs, as records in my journal. What wonder in journalling. The beautiful moments and climax(s) in my life. All in black and white, refreshing my memory. What gift...a journal... I'll be moving school soon. The moments I spent there. I cherish them. I know I'll miss them. And I wrote it down as poem, hoping to recall bits and pieces of memory in the future. When I move to the new school, I guess I'll have to find my own special corner somewhere. Maybe at East Coast. Indeed, it's exciting, but the place that has been a second home for the past two years will be gone soon, no doubt that'll be times when I miss the school now. I'm alone at home now. I'm bored. But I had reflection. And I love it. I miss my friends. But I know that every moment should be cherished, for each is special in its own way."

I think it's kinda cool, cause after that I went to the food centre opposite with my friends. It feels so carefree. Then was talking to Miss Koh about the shortage of Clarinets. But she said that we would have to share, cause the school really can't buy more. So we were trying to think of a way to solve the problem. But left quite late la, cause had to settle the problem of the condemned instruments with the sec 1s. Then today, was just another boring day, felt so tired in class, so I decided to write a letter to Yap Min during Physics lesson...hehe...then was like reading my book la. Then after school, I went down to the band room again. I was like just standing there, looking at the people choosing the instruments for auction. Then just left la. haiz...so bored. I kinda miss my jie. Was hoping to go Subway study with her, but realised that she had Theory lessons today. Oh well, so came home quickly, and here I am entering in my blog. This few days I've been just thinking of writing an article for YF life. Especially after such an eventful period. I really learnt alot, and wished to share to my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Oh well, I better get going there's work and preparation of songs to be done."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Argh...12.36!!!!  There was PE lesson today! Argh...got tested for 2.4 km run and got 12.36 timing! deprove by 37seconds!!! aiya...must train already. Then had this muscle ache all over me, which was a total hindrance in the run. Then after that, we played floorball...yippee!!! But I'm on the losing team again. =( Nevermind la, i had fun anyway.  Shuts...didn't write my journal last night again...I think I enter here more even. At least I did my Quiet Time. Oh ya...was glad to hear from Yen. Hope she's doing fine. Then had my practise after school today.Wah...practise for 1hour, was so bored by the same old piece that I just decided to play something else...like canon!!! Tried to play until my fingers all ache. And made a decision...that is to learn piano. I've always wanted to learn it. It's the nicest instrument I think. And after that, I'll learn guitar! Then I'll know three instruments! Whoa! That's what I call music maker!!!hehe...ok...better go. But before I go, to all my brothers and sisters out there, persevere in faith!!!=)"
4WC42EO,male,16,"Picking myself up  I'm abnormal. But everybody is. I have by weaknesses, but so do everybody else. I'm normal after all.  I'm really grateful for today really. Feeling really happy. I guess it's been really silly of me to thing of my inferiority and stuff. From now on, I want to pick myself up and live life to the fullest. Was just thinking about the past year yesterday, and realised how silly somethings were. Maybe I've learned alot this year. Oh well, must learn to be like my favourite fictional character, Jamie Sullivan. To really delight in God."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Mid-year Review    The first half of the year has been very different from years before. Many things change. It's almost like I suddenly grew up. Well, I took up commitments like Student Life Sub-Comm, which I'm pleased to serve in as it has been my area of interest for service. I've been staying in Music Ministry. Somehow, I've learnt alot being there and also at the same time, build relationships with fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. My greatest regret is my failure to fulfill my commitments at the SPG coordinatoor for the Lower Secondary, really hope I can do something about it this next half of the year.   Spiritually, I've gone thru many trials and testings. Though my faith is not exactly strong enough to move mountains, but I am glad that by God's grace, there's still some longing for Him. I've considered baptism. I'm thinking thru it now still. Once I settled all my commitments to God, as in what my relationship with Him means, I'll take the dip and ""ceremonially"" take up my cross.   I've been in love, everyone has I believed, probably even a 10 year old girl. But it all depends on how you define love. I do not know whether it's what you'll call true love, but I know that it means something to me. At least it thought me something. But memories stay. But I believe they'll be more of help than hindrance.   Academically, I've never been better. With my 16 points for Mid-year results, I guess my hard work has paid off. Nil Sine Labore.   There are many things I learnt in this first half of the year, things I hope will build me with good character and help me to live a life for God."
4WC42EO,male,16,"Living in Fear  Everybody have their own fears. Some fears I have would be, heights, having a crush(I'm serious!), my 'variably tempered' conductor, being late...the list goes on. But many of these fears mean nothing. They are but a mental barrier, and have nothing to do with physical factors. In other words, fears are totally unnecessary. Today, I had a rehearsal for my school Speech Day. I was to play the E flat Clarinet which was to me, like playing solo.(Cause I'm the only one playing that instrument, and highly audible. But I was fearful, nervous and all anxious. I tried to be soft to avoid attention. But instead, I attracted more attention on me. But on the second time, I decided to give it all out. Still there are mistakes, but it was really much better. But then, after that I felt so bad about my mistakes that I went to apologise. And he said I was ok!!! How often we worry for nothing. The more we worry, the worst things get. The Band was so pressured my the school's expectation of the Gold. They were afraid, so they had an 'enforced' attitude to the judging. But the more they tried to do well for everything, the worst they got. It's like how we never do well when in fear. So I guess we should just overcome these mental barriers and release out fullest potential of our abilities. Do not consider your fears, but be confident to prove yourself and not undermine youself.Do not let a one time experience result in generalization. But still, fear God! Fear as in reverence."

4WC42EO,male,16,"I'm so blessed!!!  Well, for some reason I feel so blessed this CA. Maybe it's cause today I had my Chinese Paper, and likely I'll be getting another A!!!Yeah!!! Then only 16 people passed Chemistry, Mr Wong said( he didn't want to let us know the marks yet.) But fortunately, I was one of the 16 who passed!!! Praise the Lord! I'm so blessed! Actually, I'm always blessed by God. OK, enough boasting about my results. hehe... Last night, about my bill, I was surprised that nobody scolded me at all. Really thankful. Then didn't felt stressed about my paper today at all...so just kept watching TV...and managed to catch Smallville. Then there was this scene of Cloe deleting pictures of Clark and herself on the computer. haiz...somehow reminded me of myself sometime back...haiz...shouldn't talk about it. Ya, but seriously, it's quite a nice, reflective show. So can I borrow Dustin's Smallville VCD please??? hehe...Ya, missed season one. Then I came home early today again, but not to study actually, cause my sisters and ZQ were watching Harry Potter. So once again, I was distracted. But I think I'll study later. And come to think of it, I have tons of E.math homework...haiz...and tomorrow's Physics paper. After all the good tidings, I'm finally going to fail one subject. Today, decided to start reading my book again. Talking about friendship with sisters-in-Christ in this chapter. Then he said, a friendship is when two people move towards a common goal. Then start to think what common goal I have with some of the sisters. And concluded, what he said was not necessarily true, cause my jie and me don't really have common goal what (well, maybe just that I don't know) and not like we're in love or something. So I have my own stand. Yeah...so what is friendship? hmm...ok...I'll go think about it. But any opinions, do tell me k? Send to my email: han48seeker@hotmail.com  Today, was very a very tiring day, probably cause I stayed up to watch Smallville last night...hehe...but yippee!!! I can go play basketball tomorrow night, cause it's Labour Day on Thursday! Feel like watching a movie. Matrix Reloaded will be out soon, so should I watch both X-men 2 and Matrix Reloaded??? Hmm...OK...don't care...see first la. OK gotta go finish my homework on Simlar Triangles(crap topic!)"

K772SGJ,female,23,"Given the recent frenzy of recent blogging recently, I thought I might capitalise on my most recent blog with another - not least to try to dispel this scurrilous claim that I am unconscious more than I am not.  I will first provide you with some intersting facts that Dan and I have gleaned over the course of our time in Oz.  1. The moon is not as it should be. It has been hung just more than a little Irish in the night sky. Sometimes it is not there at all. Perhaps it is a lazy fat moon.  2. The weather is a fickle beast in the Winter. Bastard clouds.  3. Most Australians like pies. In fact there are many pie shops selling many pies in many varieties. So far I have eaten six pies. I like pies.  4. Without exception, all buskers in Australia possess less skill at creating music than would be reasonably be expected from a dead man.  5. Beer comes in many sizes of glass. With baffling names that are probably derived from some obscure Aboriginal system of weights and measures. I think perhaps they used the boongperial system.   More will come I'm sure. If only I can stay awake long enough to tell you about them.  Today I saw a man on the beach engaged in what I can only assume was an attempt to engage in autofellatio. Dan told me he found that: ""quite a sexually arousing image.""  Why is Nonnie abusing solvents?  Have any dead animals been located in my bedroom?  Steelez - when does fresher's week start?

K772SGJ,female,23,"Maiden Blog.  Messrs Strachan and Hersheson! You threw down the gauntlet...issued me with an edict...I am expected to generate a dazzling literary creation, against which my worthiness in joining your exclusive bloggers circle would be judged. Alas, due to extenuating circumstances (namely whoring myself on the mean and gritty streets of Newcastle Upon Tyne, trying to find gainful employment, and the general malaise and exhaustion that results from such activities) - you will read no such creation today. However, I do feel that as I was the one who pointed out to Mr Hersheson the quote that graces the title page of your worthy weblog, I should be allowed some leeway. AND, perusal of blog archives have left me with more pressing matters to attend to.  Brother Hellyer, you no longer have to stand alone in your fight against genre-isation! Yes, breathe a sigh of relief, as I too abhor this filthy practice that festers in the hotbed of categorisation that is 12 Claremont Street. Insidious ritual it is, and I commend your valour and bravery for not giving in to the 'other side'. The world is not neat and ordered, so nor should our music be! Stand strong, soldier, you now have an ANZAC on your side! (and yes, Josh, I do realise I am not both an Australian AND a New Zealander, but allow me some poetic license, please)... And if anyone can actually articulate to me exactly what trip-hop is, I'll........I'll be impressed, and perhaps buy you a present.  Daniel, may I enquire as to what a pikey is?

And also thinking that saying 'G'day Cobber!' to me is the height of wit and hilarity. It's not. 6. Incorrect grammar and spelling 7. Celery 8. Women wearing tights with open toe-d shoes. There is no circumstance where this is acceptable. 9. Insincerity 10. The Olsen twins...Mary Kate and Ashley. Grrr (did you guys get that sitcom over here? 'Full House'?)...  I'll end with a question...how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood???"

K772SGJ,female,23,"John Steels job hunting diary.  Day 2.  After the disappointment of finding that I have no CV on day one of the hunt, I decided to take a more hands on approach.  After confidently showering in the good house, eating somebody else's food and rolling a snout I left for Newcastle town centre with an air of pre-pubescent trepidation.  First stop, The Trent House (incorporating World HQ, two birds with one stone I hear you whisper).  Alas and alack; ""not taking on till September mate, come back then"" was the repost of the barman (whom I suspect was 'good with colours').  Undaunted I traveled further into town. Old Orleans; ""nothing at the moment mate"", fuck you then didn't want to work in your shite themed bar anyway.  Huxters; ""just drop in a CV"", that's a maybe then, if only I had a CV.  Apathy took me.  To ask in every bar in town would be a fruitless task, I needed a new plan.  It would be called Plan B and would not be great.  To the Uni Job Shop!  Now, you'd think that the job centre of one Britain's leading bastions of academia would have some jobs fit for an avid 'work wanter' like myself.  You would be mistaken.  Shit pay, worse hours and crap jobs (back to EST EST EST? Yeah, 4 quid an hour and no tips, do me a favour!).  Plan B lay in tatters around my sullen feet, and yet in this hour of desperation I was suddenly touched by inspiration.  What was I doing looking for a shite job anyway?  Jordan was right, I should use my Degree to my advantage and seek the job of my dreams, a job that pays well and one in which I feel happy.  So to the interweb to apply for some 'proper' jobs.

K772SGJ,female,23,"Hey there Tombo.  Your smash sounds simply unfathomable, I can't believe you lost (I blame Kitty).  E-mail me a pizza when you get the time, seafood special please.  As for Sperm Whales, well heres the facts:     The sperm whale was named for the valuable spermaceti oil (wax) that this whale produces in the spermaceti organ (located in its head).     The Sperm Whale has the largest brain of any animal on the planet but still has trouble doing even the simplest sums.  Infact if you were to ask a Sperm Whale the answer to the sum 3+2 he/she would probably get it wrong.     Sperm Whales produce large amounts of Ambergries (spelling probably wrong), a substance similar to cholesterol which was once favoured as a very expensive perfume.     Sperm Whales have short legs but, when on land, can run very fast.  After his 1990 Olympic Games 100 metres victory it was claimed that Linford Christie was infact a Sperm Whale in a Human costume.  These reports were confirmed when swimmers off Brighton beach spotted Christie capture and devour a Giant Squid under the West Pier, and then leg it.     If a Sperm Whale was to actually sperm on a human female she probably wouldn't get pregnant, but the risk of STD's would be massive.  To prevent this from happening several former Japanese whaling ships now patrol the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans distributing enormous rubber johnnies from modified harpoon guns called 'Blubber-Blob-lobbers'.      Sperm Whales are generally good lads, but you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of one.  Marine biologist Grenville Tweed had worked with the species for 7 years and thought he knew them inside out, but in 1986 he was to learn a lesson he wouldn't soon forget.  When Tweed electronically tagged a 70 foot Sperm Whale in order to determine feeding patterns in the mating season he accidentally touched the whales lower dorsal fin.  In a jealous rage the tagged whales boyfriend, a 85 foot bull called Kaiko, headbutted Tweed out of his boat and threatened to ""come after his family"".  Tweed hasn't been back to sea since.     That's all i know about Sperm Whales.     p.s.  Jamie is turning this blog into a den of captalism."

K772SGJ,female,23,"I do in fact agree with my good friend Dr J, 1.79 for the coldest winter in the history is very reasonable. Sadly it also makes me wish that we had the heating on for a bit longer, maybe paid 5.79 each for a slightly more pleasant winter. Just dangling a carrot........  And while I'm here and blogging away to my little ""morning off"" heart's content, I wish to blog an audible ""nay"" against the motion to swap phone bad for phone portable. My reasons are four-fold:  1. Phone Portable, in its broken-backed and loose aerial state of affairs is also damn ugleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, thus making a swap for a device considered to be marginally less, shall we say easy on the eye, a little pointless.  2. Phone Portable, as implied in the name, is a portable phone. This has consequences similar to those demonstrated by the disappearance of the TV remote in the recent past. Need I remind you of the suspicions directed at a certain person and her ass.  3. Further to point 3 above, the nature of Phone Portable will also create problems with battery power levels not being consistent with long distance conversation.  4. My final point is that Phone Portable has for a long time now not been carrying out its duties as a phone despite being plugged in. The reasons behind this are that it doesn't ring and the reception is poo. Thus it would not be a good move to put it in the lounge.   I therefore propose that Phone Crack Den Landing, a truly aesthetically pleasing device, be moved to the lounge, Phone Bad be moved to the middle landing and Phone Portable be removed from the Telecommunications Gene Pool.

K772SGJ,female,23,"I shall express my interest and excitement about a trip to see the Lynch. Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. And a couple more wooooos just for good measure. As for flights, I live neither close to London nor to Edinburgh so I don't really care. As for visas, I believe you are correct, we will need a visa even as British citizens. Bloody yanks, don't trust anyone these days.  The bus from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City was hell. The living end you might say. And someone stank of fried chicken. I blame the fat kid. We are both tired and getting close to killing the pesky cyclo-taxi drivers for their relentless hassle.

My search for a job on 'tinterweb has thus far heralded no success and my disillusionment with post university life grows ever stronger.  All the graduate jobs are in business and shit like that.  Oh woe is me, is this to be my lot in life?  A faceless 'suit', a wretched winnit in the arse cress of the capitalist system.  NAY!

A fully grown whale, despite its size, is not a dangerous animal and feeds only on small plankton and stray swimmers.  Unlike its cousin, the shark, what feeds on small swimmers and stray plankton.  Pinocchio was eaten by a whale but escaped by tickling its sneeze reflex with his absurd wooden nose forcing the whale to sneeze him and his mates (Gepetto and Jiminy Cricket) to relative safety.  More whale knowledge will follow."

K772SGJ,female,23,"Hi, I am impressed with all the bloddy blogging that is going on. i believe jordan will soon emerge from the jungle and blog... its just a feeling i have.  I went to Inverness today and i really had forgotten what a shitty city it is, i think i had foolishly romanticised it in my head as a quaint Scottish retreat. Its full of neds and goths (not even the nice kind) and it rains all the bloomin time.  and the shops are Rubbish (capital letter justified).  mmm  any way i have a question for all those who have been to ITALY.  where should i stay as in hostel wise? any reccomendations of things to do as well.  am planning rome florence... switzerland etc. so yeah where should i stay? thankyou all.  Parky and Josh (i cant blog it hurts my little fingers): ARe you getting pinstripe suits? i hope so, get them matching in blue, you'll look mcCool on the street.

K772SGJ,female,23,"There appears to have been a frenzy of blogging in spite of Jamie's and my reticence. I don't know if I like this...  Josh, your PADI cards are on their way to Cairns via International Signed For Service. Of course, I had to swipe them both through my natal cleft (for you non-medics: that sweet sulcus that lies betwixt the buttocks commonly known as the asscrack) as punishment for your ineptitude in publishing the same blog twice. Nice to talk to you though.  Tom, I'm glad you're still enjoying Chile. Chileans are renowned for their pingpong skills. They made me leave the country because I was crap. Also, have you seen Kitty naked yet?  Steelez, you've authored some inspired blogs, relating in particular to whale sperm (which almost vindicates you for being a parasite on our good home). However, your expositions are devoid of facts. You see, whales produce 400 gallons of sperm when they ejaculate. This is not surprising since they have 22lb testicles. However, when Daddy and Mummy Whale are busy burping the ol' worm in the mole hole, 350 gallons of semen miss the target (despite Daddy's 16 foot penis). So, all you travellers: DON'T DRINK SEAWATER ( you now know why it's salty). Also, Steelez, find a job.  Kitty, has Tom seen you a poto pelado yet?   Jamie, I fear Twiggy and Steelez are right. For those of you who haven't noticed, you can now find banners for Thomas Pink and Laz-E-Boy chairs on this blog. What used to be a free forum has now been converted into a twisted marketplace in which Jamie the capitalist running dog profits every time an unwitting proletarian clicks on the banner (and signs up and purchases a fine TP shirt). Jamie, the historical dialectic will ensure that your counter-revolutionary interests will be beaten down by the hammer and the sickle of justice...I'd quote some Marx and Trotsky at you but there's this lovely Prince of Wales check shirt that would go perfectly with my new easy chair..."

In this article i will discuss a novel mechanism for addressing these points with my opinion: (if any fucker picks me up on my spelling i will bar-b-q their head)  1. What about raw chicken. this is surely worse, it can kill a man at fifty paces and has been known to be an unfortunate consequence of the ""drive for dry chicken"" - which incidently seems to have acompanied the drive for eastern goodness in our house - hmmm 2. Pasta is bad in the sink i agree, in fact, am considering an action group HASM housegood against sink ming to counter this 3. see point 2 4. not bad as sticking a needle in your eye bad but still uncalled for. tapioca is chicken diarroeha  5. well as a student who never arrives on time i cant comment without serious hypocrisy. i hate them too. 6. mmm remote control. but i dont mind losing stuff too much cos if i loose it it is generally lost. not like Josh ""where are my keys - they're in your hands"" Hersheson 7. Pikeys do smell but i'd like to point out that chinese people also annoy me coming over here with their stir in sauces. oh HOW conveeeenient. 8. uh hu i hear you brother 9. the skin to skin itch debate. oh how satisfying oh how inappropriate 10. well i love busted but hate girls forever or whatever they are called.

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"So why such a freak, I am?  (I think I better practice more of my Yoda...)   Had another one of those nights but not with 'Johnny' this time, but rather a friend who shall remain anonymous just so I do not get anyone in any trouble,  especially myself .  It was simply raw, rough, steamy material.  The sort you'd find at your 3 a.m. hotel ppv channel.  How do I know this?  C'mon, I've been an adult for a rather long time... and everyone's got to see one of those at least once in life.  I guess our way of saying, ""I ain't doing it wrong after all.""  I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling for a while, the blinking of computer lights drawing a nice greenish shine into it.  I realized that I had lost track of time.  My eyes had been tired and although sleepy, I had not wanted to wake up my hubby by getting into bed, so I simply decided to take a nap on the futon.  I remember thinking about what I had to do for one of my projects and then... there I was, screaming and squirming with glee.  There was no point, no introductory play of events, simply images, clips.  And it was me... I know myself.  Now, the fact that I was with my friend does not bother me much.  I find him cute... heh... actually he's rather sexy.  I just like to talk or surround myself with this sort of people... the type I just want to pound upon and force into submission while they whisper my name with that manly voice of theirs... or the wickedly flirtatious gal that I just want to coo and please until they lose themselves in my ministrations.  Dream or not, that is what I seek.  And that is what I find.  But...  why?    I live a normal life.  Normal to everyday standards - I study, I work, I make money, I waste money, I am of my home, I am of my husband... I laugh, I cry, I eat, I sleep, I bathe... and the more mundane parts of the day.    I do not feel overly disillusioned.  Marriage is good, normal.  We are better halves and understand one another for the most part.  Arguments are good too.  The stubborn kind in which we glare at one another only to end up cracking up about it minutes later.  Life is good...  so then...  why?     What is wrong with my putrid mind?"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Today I drove to work again and after closing, the hubby stopped by, talked with my mom while I closed, and then we each both got in our cars and drove back home. I had parked in the back so I had to go around a block and at the intersection I saw my husband in his car.  He had a green and I a red, so as he crossed he grinned and mocked me that I had to wait.  I poked my tongue out at him.  About 15 mins later I arrived home and he was waiting with his car on the side so that I would park my car first.  I drove inside while my husband parked behind.  I was singing along my Palominos CD and by the time I got out, husband was already waiting for me on the driveway.     Husband: You look so beautiful driving your big car.   I: eh?   Husband: Women look so beautiful driving.   I: ~_~ *gee... spoil the good comment by throwing other women into the mix. heh!*   Husband: But you are the most beautiful of all women.   I: You are lucky. *I joked*   Husband: Yes, yes I am.   Then inside the house we turned on the TV and started watching a little wrestling and he said if I wanted to eat some tuna.  He doesn't make it like me (I just add a dab of mayo and eat it raw).  He adds spices and onion and veggies and you name it... just mouth watering.  Well after I finished chopping veggies (because he insists that I do the chopping since I am the best vegetable chopper that he has ever seen) he began to do all the cooking.  I started drying dishes.   Husband: I can cook like this all the time.  I'll just buy canned meats and prepare them. Easier and it will last longer, unlike what we have in the fridge.  You just cut up onions and stuff and I can do all the cooking everyday.   I: Okay.  *That's usually what we do anyway...*   Husband:  As long as I am cooking for you, I really enjoy it.   I: *I smile while continuing to wash and dry dishes*   Husband: *gets closer and gives me a kiss on the cheek*   * giggles *"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,Spanish or Italian  urlLink What Language Are You?      So does this mean I am a stereotypical Hot and Sexy Latina?
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Woke up rather early for a Saturday - 6 am.  It probably had to do with the fact that I kept waking up in the middle of the night to puke because of what I ate Friday night. I just had waaay too much pop corn and then the food at the restaurant was a little heavy for 10:30 at night - Shrimp kaboob, grilled salmon, and spicy crab cakes with cole slaw, etc, etc.   Yes, it was the over eating... we've agreed that the  urlLink test  came out Negative (although, I am still waiting for final proof *crosses fingers*).      My hubby can't keep asleep unless I am next to him so he followed me to the living room and setup the dial up on the laptop (he'd reformatted and re-installed everything while I was reading the previous night) and I started checking posts at my favorite  urlLink group .  Not much had been going on so I started doing the laundry while hubby vacuumed.  Then I washed some dishes that had been in the sink since last monday (nothing ecky, just glasses and plates with cake crumbs... we don't do much cooking in this house) while hubby mopped.  ^_^ We have a nice system.  He does one thing, I do another.  Then we both sit down and watch TV.  We feel hungry we both get up - one does the chopping while the other cooks - neat neat neat.   I started getting ready at about noon and then we drove to Harlingen (city about 30 mins away) to have some breakfast at the Jerusalem Cafe.  Had ourselves a couple of Gyros baskets... not really Israeli food (I think it's Greek), but good nonetheless; they are thin pita bread with lamb slices and vegetables on them that you can roll up to a nice thick burrito ^_^.    Then we went to play some pool and a couple of games of bowling.  Hubby whooped my butt. *Mumble-mumble* darn cricket players and their accuracy.  By this time it was close to 5 pm and we made our way to my mom and dad's home to feed the pup.  They went out for the weekend so when they do that we are left with the task of feeding our dog. Yes Our doggie.  We got her from the pound several months back but since we moved to our new home (and still can't afford a fence) we can't keep her - strict leash laws.... heh... So anyway, we walked and played a little and came across this neighbor's lamb. Funny lamb.  It was tied up and when we would pass by the area the lamb would start  baaa-ah-ah-ahhhh ing. My husband and Leche (her name is spanish for milk) would get close to the fence and the lamb would run away.  Then they would turn their backs and the lamb would come back and be all tough, then they would turn to see it again and the lamb would run and hide once more. hehehe. They did this for about 8 rounds.  I was like... Don't temp the hubby little lamb... we just had one of your friends for breakfast. HAHAHAH   Ahhhh. Okay.  Then shopping for the week's food (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA As IF we'll be cooking!).  That's right, we got our bottle of grapefruit, bag of chips, 6 bottles of mineral water (we eat out so much that trust me, you want to have that and some anti-acid always handy) and um... shampoo.  Then drove out to find a beauty salon - we badly needed haircuts.  Husband changed his look and I got an appointment for Tuesday.  Then we went back to shopping.     Got him a nice little electric guitar with it's amp.  I expect no more complains about the price of my lipsticks for a while. heh heh heh. ^_~"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"… or 5th of May, the Battle of Puebla.  Several of you may have heard about this day… a day celebrated by most Mexican and Mexican descendants (and friends that tag along).  Contrary to what people may believe, Cinco de Mayo does not  celebrate Mexico’s Independence from Spain.  Not at all.  Cinco de Mayo marks a day in Mexican history when a small group of soldiers, armed with rudimentary weapons (compared to the high-tech stuff used in the mid 1800s) overcame a much larger French army in the small city of Puebla in 1862. That day has ever since been remembered as the day that Mexico began the overthrow of foreign rule in its lands.       It is also my daddy’s birthday. ^_^   *skips off to get ready for the special dinner*"

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Whoa! Now that’s an action movie!  The trailers and commercials say “They should have left him alone.” And I say: Thank goodness they didn’t!!!  The movie rules!  It has a good length, and you do not wish it were any shorter. It moves at a fast pace with unexpected happenings around most all corners.  Special effects are normal as are the fight scenes… but what makes it very good is that they are … pretty real.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne does his kick-butt amnesiac super-CIA agent role in which he does nothing out of the ordinary… well… for a CIA Super agent that he is.         Matt Damon as Jason Bourne    The movie is shot in India, Germany, Russia, and USA. Chase scenes are sweet, with such nice camera angles that you believe you are at the passenger’s seat… ohhh yeahhhh I could feel my eyes popping out every time there was a 360-degree spin.  Some people may get a little confused, a little nauseous – just as if you were in the chase yourself. ^_^ The main chase is so good that pretty much it is at the same level as the chase scenes from  urlLink Gone In 60 Seconds  or  urlLink The Italian Job  (mini coupers are soooo cute).               And if car crashing scenes aren’t your thing… then do it for this guy: ^_~ You will see this young actor in movies such as  urlLink The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King . He played Eomer, the Rohan Warrior… you know, Eowyn’s brother… (she kills the most powerful of the Undead Evil Kings in the 3rd movie because   She’s No Man  ).                 Wow Looks different, no?              Karl Urban as Kirlill;     Go watch  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy . GO GO!"

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Mom was released today!  Doc came over to see her again at around 8:30 am and said all was aaa-okay!  Said that she was super healthy, in good shape and that all the nurses said that all she did was walk around over and over and over.  Yeah, you would think she didn't have a 6-inch slice on her abdomen!    Gaw, that's when we see how much her training helps her.  Have I ever mentioned that mom is a half-marathon runner?  Gaw, she runs 3-5 miles daily, and that's for mere training.    ^_^   We left the hospital at around noon.  I stayed with her at the house until hubby got out from work.  I made sure to clean her house and all so that she could be comfortable."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Mom underwent surgery. Hubby and I arrived before 5am to meet with my parents and sister. They arrived a little after 5am.  Mom was taken into her private room right away and dad stayed with her. Around 6:00 she was taken in for surgery. It was a C-section to remove a cyst the size of a 5-month-old fetus.  Her cut was made vertically, as opposed to the less noticeable horizontal.    Shucks, now she can't wear bikinis at the beach no more.   Bummer.     Well, it all went great.  She got out of surgery at around 10 something. She was under the effect of the anesthesia and could barely talk.  She said her tongue felt so thick and heavy.  It sounded like that as well.  Her face was so swollen, as were her hands and legs.  She fell asleep pretty quickly and we left the room to allow her some rest.  My sister and I headed to mom's house and watched a movie while we waited for my husband to get out of work so he could take me home.  Got home at 6pm, took a 2-hour nap, and then showered and we headed to the hospital.  Dad and my sis were just waiting for me to take over.  I spent the night with her at the room.  It was a tiring day and night.  Every hour we would awake; nurses had to check up on her and I would then give her massages on her feet, legs and at times on her back. Being lying on her back really began to cause her pain.  No need to walk her to the rest room yet - she had a tube that would take care of that for her.  Looked painful, though. >_"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Well, I am officially a housewife again... oops, I mean 'homemaker' (is that the politically correct version for maid?)  I get to continue working on my projects since I really only need a compy and a net connection for that, so it's good.  But I also get to take on the trivial jobs of the house.  I guess I have to manage after all I won't be making any real money, unlike hubby.  Hmmm, I may have less stress than he since now I can actually get up at 9 and work in my undies if I like... plus I won't have to deal with all sort of wandering people either.  So as long as I have stuff to do I won't get all depressed as I did my first year of staying at home.  I will cross my fingers."

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Mexico defeats Ecuador 2-1 and for the first time passes to the next round without a single defeat and 1st of it's group.   GROUP B - POINTS  Mexico - 7 Argentina - 6 Uruguay - 4 Ecuador - 0  The game overall was okay.  It was almost one-sided and seemed easy.  By the first half Mexico had already scored 2 goals and the game was going down in pace.  Goal 1 was a giveaway because the ref counted a penalty against Ecuador when it truly wasn't one (not like I'm complaining... :d gave Mexico the advantage.)  The 2nd goal cam on minute 42, near the end of the first half, Mexican player Bofo completely gets rid of the men tracking him, nobody guarded him, gets the pass and strikes with a right leg slamming that ball into the net.  Ecuador's goal came on minute 26, it was a nice two-man play, finished with a head shot, there was nothing for Mexican goalie to do, it was a very well executed goal.  Mexico's play could have been a little more aggressive, while Ecuador's could be said that it was the best they played in the entire cup.  Now on to the next round... We either play Paraguay or Chile, I'm not too sure..."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Hubby dropped me off at mom's early today.  I was reading 'Bloody Bones' by Laurell K. Hamilton (Anita Blake Series) until I heard my mom and sis waking up.  We ate cereal and watched soaps for a bit and then I started cleaning the house.  The usual stuff: dishes, vacuuming, washing toilets, sinks, clothes, no mopping today... mom didn't have pine sol and I didn't want to use soapy water. I was afraid that I wouldn't rinse it out completely fromt he floors, especially the bathrooms, and that she may slip.  Sis took care of the lunch.  She made rice, beef with veggies, and then more veggies. yum yum.  More dishes.  Well, we took mom shopping after that. She now has pine sol... well, Fabuloso, a Mexican brand for floor cleaner. It smells great and is what I use at my own house. ^_^  I use it for everything, floors, commodes, sinks, tubs, the kitty's litter box, man it's great, economic, and the bottle lasts for month and months.  I gotta love Mexican products.  Got back to her house, watched a movie, Hubby and Dad got back home and then Hubby and I left.  He took me to eat at a Mexican restaurant and then I went to the beauty salon to get a haircut.  hehehe... can you say 80s punk rocker?  It's SPIKEY!!!"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"The hubby and I took a nap after having dinner.  I made something very quick - just some ravioli soup (from a can) and then scrambled eggs with ground beef. Nothing fancy... It's Friday and I have very little stuff in the fridge by Fridays.  I either have meats but no extras like veggies or bread and drinks, or all the extras but no main dish meat. * shrugs *  So the nap, the nap... I guess it was like 3 hours long, I am not sure. I slept awkward and woke up with this neck pain so I just lay there, feeling uncomfortable and stiff, but with images in my mind of the small dream I had.  I do not dream about him much, but this time I did.  So I raised my hand while he sat next to me on the bed and I stay with my hand outstretched for what seemed the longest time and he never gets it.  I had to make this noise for him to look at me.  I have my hand out to him and he just stares at it until I tell him to hold it, which he does but in some sort of 'whatever' way.    I begin to tell him that I dreamt with him... and he talks about being hungry.  I kept talking to him and describing my dream - it was short and simple, in which we were in a strange home's backyard and he was cooking something on a grill; I remember watching him as I leaned with my shoulder against a glass sliding door; we talked about something while he teased the carbon, but I cannot remember the words.  Well, I did not get to tell him all of this.  He suddenly gets up as I begin telling him the dream and walks out of the room.  He came back some minutes later and I told him my whole body hurt - it was weight lifting training today and O really stressed my muscles.  He didn't really say much.  I was hoping maybe he would sit next to me and at least rub my shoulder or anything.  I know, perhaps if I wanted that I should have told him... but... why can't he just do it from himself once in a while?  When he says his whatever aches I try to hold him, rub his aching muscle - whether he lets me or not is a different story; he does not like to be touched much.  But just because he does not like to be touched it does not meat I do not like it either.   I wished I didn't have to spell out everything to him - it gets frustrating.   Well, there I was telling him how my body hurt and again, he just leaves... I heard some rattling around of pots and such at the kitchen so I figured he was making something to eat which is fine with me, as long as he is careful when he does his cooking... But as it is imaginable, he was not.  He made some barbecue chicken wings and left the doors open, stinking the entire house of an aroma a do not like much.  I am not a bbq-smell fan. My whole bedroom stinks of it now... my clothes, my freshly washed sheets.    He should be more careful... this I tell him.  This I do not keep and hope that he will someday just get it.  I tell him.  ""Be careful with how you do things because I clean this house everyday; just be considerate.""  It sticks to him for a few days... then he takes it for granted again."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"""Psychologists in Canada have finally proved what women have long suspected - men really are irrational enough to risk entire kingdoms to catch sight of a beautiful face.   Biologists have long known that animals prefer immediate rewards to greater ones in the future. This process, known as ""discounting the future"", is found in humans too and is fundamental to many economic models.  ... Margo Wilson and Martin Daly of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada decided to investigate discounting behaviour and see if it varied with sexual mood.  Male students, when shown pictures of pretty women, were more likely to opt for short-term economic gain than wait for a better reward in the future.  ...Wilson and Daly found that male students shown the pictures of averagely attractive women showed exponential discounting of the future value of the reward. This indicated that they had made a rational decision. When male students were shown pictures of pretty women, they discounted the future value of the reward in an ""irrational"" way - they would opt for the smaller amount of money available the next day rather than wait for a much bigger reward.  Women, by contrast, made equally rational decisions whether they had been shown pictures of handsome men or those of average attractiveness.""    ""We have not elucidated the psychological mechanisms mediating our results,"" says Margo Wilson. ""But we hypothesise that viewing pictures of pretty women was mildly arousing, activating neural mechanisms associated with cues of sexual opportunity.""  Tommaso Pizzari, an evolutionary biologist at Leeds University, offers another possible explanation: ""If there's the prospect of getting a very attractive partner it may pay a man to take more risks than if an average partner was available.""   He told New Scientist: ""If this is a response to sexual selection then you would expect men who are less attractive to take more risks. If you have many attractive potential partners then it does not pay to take risks. If you are less attractive, with few potential partners, then it pays to take risks.""   Source: NewScientist.com  ... Moral of the story: Stick to average-looking guys."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I am not actually going to post here what I dreamt ( if you really want to know, contact me and I'll decide ).  It had to do with my husband going out with 2 exclassmates of mine (from different schools), then my husband and I talking about the meeting, and finally my going out for coffee with those same exclassmates.  Very strange.  Hmm, maybe I should just start a Dream log.  Hmmm.   Anyway, I got to wake up late this Friday because my husband had the day off. We got up and went to the store after 1 pm and were only there for a few hours.  Mainly we wanted to see if my sister would want to go to the movies with us for the release of The Alamo.  She did not for work related reasons.  So we left and caught the early show at 3:50 p.m.  Alright movie with a lot of history and various anecdotes.  Not for kids simply because they may find it boring.  I doubt young ones may care much about the history of Texas.  What my husband and I enjoyed most was the debate that occurred after we left the theater. We both had our different opinions on why things happened the way they did and most importantly what Would happen if Texas decided to get it's independence from the U.S.A.    I happen to be a Texan supporter while he remains a USA follower.  heh..."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Morning went pretty good; the hubby washed the car, I cleaned the house, we watched a soccer game on TV and so on.  Then suddenly, I was angry out of nothing.  The cat started getting very anxious and doing mischief and I was just sitting on one side of the sofa, waiting for the slightest thing to jump out screaming.  I am not even sure how things happened but husband took one of his drumsticks and began to wave it around playfully but I was already in a bad mood and I took the other and I slammed it against his leg because I didn't feel like playing.  He let out an 'ouch' and looked at me frowning. He began to say something but stopped himself, shook his head and turned to look at the TV.  We didn't say anything to each other for a while and then I went to the kitchen to dry dishes.  The cat followed me right away and began to cry out so that I would give her something to eat.  I didn't and she just kept at it until I found myself screaming at her so that she'd shut up.  The cat just looked at me for a few seconds and then resumed her whining.  I proceeded to ignore her.  In one of those I walked close to her to get the dishes in the pantry and she bit me.  She started to run away immediately, because she is not dumb... she knows biting is wrong, but I was pretty fast (anger makes me jumpy and fast) and I bent down, put my hand over her back and gave her like 4 slaps on her butt while I kept telling her that I was in no mood and to get the hell away from me.  I let her go and she ran to the window and just sat there looking outside.  My husband didn't say anything, and I stayed in the kitchen defrosting meat.  When I went out I went to open the window for the cat... I was feeling guilty.  Yes, she was a bad kitty but I was already angry to begin with so I was just waiting for anything to reprimand I guess.  As soon as hubby saw me he began to tell me to leave the baby alone and to never slap her butt again. I told him she had bit me and he said that it was because I had bothered her first.  I repeated myself and he said the same thing again.    I just turned around and got in the kitchen area and just started cooking.  I felt like pasta so I began chopping and measuring ingredients to make a simple meatloaf.  I put it in the oven, washed the dishes I had used and went inside the bedroom looking for my purse, which I didn't find.  Husband began to make his way along the hall and I hurried into my study and locked myself in.  I didn't feel like talking.  He asked something about food but I did not answer.  I spent 30-some minutes reading web comics and then got out to check on the meatloaf.  I took it out from the oven, poured tomato, garlic and oregano sauce on it and put it back inside the oven.  I placed some water to boil.  I noticed a BK bag with 3 burgers and fries... I guess he went out while I was in the study. He had already fed Chiquita too.  I went back into the study.  I got out like 15 minutes later and he got up from the couch to talk.  I just moved into the kitchen and took out the meatloaf and placed it in a wood table to cool down.  I don't even remember what he was saying, I was busy preparing the pasta, but he left back tot he living room after he felt ignored for enough time.  It was done in like 5 minutes and after draining it I put it in plates and mixed it with a little butter, oregano and garlic powder and accompanied it with a slice of meatloaf.  I took it to him and he asked where mine was... He always asks that and I often tell him that I only have 2 hands and that I can only bring his plate and utensils, not both.  This time I was too edgy and I yelled at him.  And by the manner I did it one would have thought that he had told me he didn't like meatloaf or something.  I prepared my plate and took it to the table.  He walked over with his a bit after, saying he didn't like to eat without me.  We talked a little more and he told me France had won it's match against England.  When we were done he took the plates and washed them. I sat to watch some TV and shortly after I went to the study again.  Chiquita followed me in and I shoved her out of the room telling her I was still angry and I didn't want her in the room.  The other day I found many of my cables chewed up.    He went into the study several minutes later and just lay down on the couch there and fell asleep.  I woke him up about an hour later and made out.  We watched a movie on TV at seven and things are fine again.  What the hell was all about today then?  I can't even remember why I got so grouchy.  I know it was my fault; I started it... but why?"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Spent most of today inside the office at mom's store.  I really wanted to keep moving with the project I am working on.  My husband went with me and we were both working on the site's code.  We were supposed to finish this site then end of March, but the client seems to be more interested in the e-commerce are of the site (which is not wrong, of course) than giving us the actual information that he wishes to have on the site.  So I send him templates and he tells me ""Where's the text?""  Well... Perhaps if instead of having  me  make his calls to the banks and merchants he would make them himself I wouldn't spend 4 hrs a day on hold by the operators.  At some point I just stopped working on the project altogether.  He kept changing opinions on the site's content and asked my opinion on what type of marketing material he should use to promote the site.  Yes, I can recommend some things, but I am not going to be proofreading his letters.  I give him links of the service providers that I have been in contact with the past and that is all... It is not my fault if they do not offer what he has in mind. And just for kicks, I actually researched for a provider that offers just what he needs and did not find one yet.  I am not saying that there isn't one out there... Oh.. There IS.  But those are more likely custom made gateways and accounts for big companies like Toyota or WalMart, etc., etc., who pay thousands upon thousands to a complete team of programmers.  I do not think he can afford that at the moment, so I find him the alternatives... If he doesn't like them, then there is nothing I can do.  I won't program that for him because to put it simply, he'd have to hire me for a year and not with hourly wages.  Well, Z and I decided that the longer we wait for him to give us information, the more stuff he would ask us to keep adding or researching (outside of the original quote, by the way).  What started with a 200 page, database driven project has expanded to 400 with over 1500 dynamically created extra pages (and let's not talk about images just yet).  Dynamic... So no big deal... If we didn't have to capture the text data for those 1500+ pages ourselves.  He's supposed to give us that... But all he does is give us links and tell us to look in those.  We did that in the beginning, but it ended up that we would not exactly capture what he wanted on his site, so we told him... You give it to us.  Makes it so much simpler, that way we are not guessing at what he wants or not.  Plus, we do not get involved in copyright issues.  If the client gives me stuff, then I am to assume he got permission to use that information or he wrote it himself.  Well... Now let's hope I do not have to move my deadline again."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Yes.  Friday went alright. Work slow, did nothing but bum around browsing sites and chatting to online buddies.  I should have been working on a project but... I just didn't feel like it.   The hubby took me to the movies and we watched Master and Commander.  Kinda late, eh?  Well you see, we rate our movies the following way:     I'll defenitely pay 10 bucks to see that one on premier night!  Yeah, it will be worth 6 bucks for the matinee show!  I can't wait for it to get to the dollar movies!  We can wait for it to come out on pay-per view  Hmmm, I'll rent it some day.  Maybe when it's on the regular movie channel  I'll probably change the channel when it gets to public TV    Master and Commander fell under the #3 category.  Those are the movies that we feel are going to be entertaining but not to the point that we will spend 20 bucks to see it, nor 12 bucks for the matinee show at the 'new' theater.  So we wait for it to come out at the dollar movies ($1.50 all day and $2.00 weekend nights).  Most movies are at the expensive theater (the one inside the mall) for about 1 or 2 weeks and then they are sent to the dollar movies.  The more popular ones (ex., LOTR, Matrix, Harry Potter, etc etc) can stay at the big movies for up to 6 months sometimes, so we just wait and watch all others that Do make it there after a week ^_^.   Alright, so then we made our way to have some dinner at Benningams (the movie wasn't too great... got a little slow in the middle for my taste, but 3 bucks well spent.) and paid for overpriced food that was excused dut to the nice environment - live band made it kinda difficult to hear what we were saying but, hey, it's cool.   Got home... mhmhmhmmhmmmmm read a little, watched TV and that's that."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Special days like today's deserve a little special food.  And so I went out to eat with my husband and ordered a nice plate of shrimp, crab, and lobster while he got the yummy platter of fried seafoods.  Of course we ordered appetizers and refreshments.  It all came out to a flat 50 with the tip included - not bad.  Of course, we couldn't help but comment how much more less it would have been at our countries, but that was just table talk.  If we really think about it, for us to go to our countries to eat seafood would cost at least 3,000 each (well, that's to eat at my place... at his, the 3,000 covers only the one-way ticket). So we chatted, debated, and enjoyed our overly priced food (and rightfully priced as such!).  We filled to our tummies' content.   ^_^  and all was good.  Oh by the way - Beware of the  Swen ... It may be out to get you...  I'll comment my experiences with it tomorrow."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I just found some photographs of some time ago... 2 years ago or something - I am extremely bad at doing the whole photo album and scrapbooking thing - and I got this knot on my throat.  Darn, have I let myself go to waste.  I am obese and old now... in a mere 2 years...  I blame it on the medication and stupid birth control pills (treatment for ovarian cysts), but that's not the cause... sure, I gained a lack of sleep (I was only able to sleep for like 3 hrs per night, and not all in one go) and as a result I would go watch late night TV and eat, but I also have not done anything to try to at least maintain my weight in order.  I completely stopped going to the gym, perhaps because the gym was 45 minutes away but mainly because I am not a gym person.  I am an outdoors gal.  Give me soccer games on rainy days, kicks to my knees, scraped elbows, and a slammed ball to my chest.  But still, even though I enjoy that so much, I have not pressed my husband to do something like that with me.  I just simply remain at home, eating, eating, eating.  Energy levels are at an all-time low.  I stopped taking the medication (the lack of sleep was driving me crazy and angry) and I have pain from time-to-time but heck, I rather sleep and not have to go vomit every night.  So I sleep more now, the problem is... I sleep too much and I still feel like it is not enough.  I go to bed at 10:30pm maybe slightly later if there is something good on TV, and then by 7:30am I still can't get up.  So even if I go to bed at midnight I still get more than 7 hrs but that is not cutting it.  Aren't adults supposed to be fine with at least 6 hours of sleep?  Only children need 8 or more hours!  Last weekend, Saturday night, I went to bed at 10:09pm and woke up Sunday at 2:00.... PM!  16 Frickin' Hours!  And I was still groggy.  So now I am a Fat, Lazy woman.  What's next?  Fat, Lazy, and Psychotic?  Hmmm... maybe.  Now someone tell me...  How do I troubleshoot that?!"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I was all by my lonesome today. Looooooong boring day, but I actually did quite a bit.  Finally troubleshooted that piece of code. ^_^  Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  After thinkering with the database and the code something got fixed  heh... yeah. that's how programmers fix problems.   And well, it seems like I am getting dragged to the doc tomorrow.  Mother had to make an appointment for me last week and everyone has been keeping tabs on the date, time, place, and everything. ~_~ Sheesh.  So I haven't had my monthly like in 7 weeks. Big Deal!  I remember once I actually went without it for 3 months, and several other times when I had it twice in the same month.  I am just like that.  But I guess... I might as well get the pressure, cholesterol, blood, and all those other tests done as well.   >_"

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I saw a most beautiful boy today.  He sat at a table across from me... sideways.  He was hunching over a blue plastic bowl, eyes gazing at a slice of cooked green pepper that he had pulled out of the soup with his plastic fork.  He seemed bored, worried, sad?  Made me wonder what he had on his mind. Could anyone help?  Did he need a friend?  I was engrossed with the scene, admiring the straight nose, defined jaw, and the small brown eyes that continued to peer into the bowl.  For the first time in my life I wished I could draw... really, really draw so that I could forever hold the image of this young, pretty man. So that he would never age, never die.  His large hand took the bowl and thin fingers helped tilt it to his lips, thinned and tanned.  Another boy came over and they exchanged words while turning to look at one of the windows.  The pretty one quickly finished his meal, covered his Tupperware and then got up, following his 'friend' to somewhere... I just didn't think it right to continue to stare as if to make it any more obvious.  And unfortunately, I was not able to get a glimpse at his name tag...  *sigh*  My pocket will suffer from now on.     Burger King, you now have a new daily customer."

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"The guilt feeling?  I know, I know, there are just so many different guilty feelings.  Well here goes: One of my friends was going through some rough moments; everyday things as they appear to me, but since I am not the one living them I am not overly stressed about it, of course.  Well, in the couple of years that we've talked to each other I know he has a quick temper.  He gets stressed, he begins to cuss and get angry, and most of the time (as it happens to many of us) he lets it all out on whoever he is talking to - lately it has been me.  * shrugs *  But things go by quickly.  He gets serious, I get serious. He gets upset, I keep on being my unattached self (heck, he's my friend, I shouldn't get tremendously pissed at him, right?).  He begins to cuss and threatening to leave our conversation, I tell him to go ahead and good night.  One or two days later, things are back to normal; the happy happy people that we are.  But then... he or I say something that we would generally consider a stupid, non-funny joke (but a joke nonetheless) and the skies turn dark and the machines overload and there we are… tense at each other once more.  It used to happen once in a blue moon... but now it is every single time we get on line and talk to one another. >_  Why do I feel guilty even though he is the one to start the fault? ( It is hardly ever my fault.  I am just so great. Riiight. )  I guess... it's just... that he is a friend.  And perhaps I should be a little more lenient with friends, a little more sensitive even.  That, plus I get the feeling that he may not be coming online to at least talk because he may still be upset at anything. Of course it could be that he simply has not had the time but...    It makes one wonder..."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"1 lb of shrimp (with or without tails, that's up to you)  2 cans of tomato sauce (8 oz each)  4-5 cups of water  1/2 onion, chopped  1 carrot (or 2 :D) sliced  2 medium potatoes chopped into cubes  2 tablespoons of oregano (separated, 1 tbsp, 1 tbsp)  1 tablespoon of garlic powder  1 tablespoon of olive oil  *Chipotle sauce (optional, but if you use it it will really give it a nice kick)  No salt necessary, but if you like it, go ahead.    *You find Chipotle sauce in the foreign food section of your supermarket.  I use  Del Monte . FYI: Generally, Chipotle sauce (blended chipotle) is less hot than whole Chipotle chile 'in' sauce.       Heat the olive oil. While the oil is getting ready, wash the shrimp.  Throw one small bit of onion into the oil. Just one. If the onion sizzels then it means the oil is hot enough to cook the onion. Put all the onion in, careful not to splash (or you may burn yourself).  Cook onion until it is glazed (becomes transparent) but not brownish.  If it starts to get brownish from the edges (burnt), lower the heat and make sure you move around the onion with a cooking spoon.  When onion is ready, add in the 2 cans of tomato sauce followed by 4-5 cups of water.  Add the chipotle chili (this one is hot, so make sure you can handle it), if you feel it may need more you can ad it in later, you do’t want to throw in a can of hot sauce because then it may end up being too hot to taste.  Stir the tomato sauce, water and chile and then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of oregano and the 1 tablespoon of garlic powder over the broth.  Cover the pot and let it simmer.  Once the broth begins to boil throw in the shrimp. Cover once more and let it begin to boil.  Check on it from time to time while you chop the potatoes and carrots.  You may add more water if you feel the soup is getting too thick, but that depends on how you like your soups – thick or watery. ^_~  Again, when the soup begins to boil, add in the carrots and five minutes later add the potatoes.  Sprinkle the last remaining oregano over the soup.  You can taste the soup and if it is not spicy enough you can add more chipotle.  The soup will be ready when you are able to easily split a piece of potato with the spoon.  Turn off the burners and let it cool down slightly.    Serve warm with a side of Spanish rice (or white, whichever) and a slice of bread.    Mmmmmm-mmmmm!"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"The day started pretty well.  I got a surprise call from a friend ( :X :X :X :X :X  ).  He had said he'd call last night once he got home but I waited and waited AND waited ALLLL night long but no call (hehe. Just messing with ya. ^_~  I went to bed at midnight as always).  So I figured something came up and such.  Well, whoa surprise! He gives me a call in the morning in my cel. ^_^  SP (I wouldn't want anyone reading this to suddenly be stalking him!) and I have known each other for over 2 years now, but only online (yes, I am a big geek.  Call me a Webbie) and it feels great to finally add the voice (and a very nice voice at that) to the face and mind.  * sigh * But days that start happy don't always finish happy happy.  Another one of my friends who was quite excited about recent news had a miscarriage.  Never having been pregnant myself (and since even the slightest scare about it drives chills down my spine) I cannot know how she possibly feels. However, I do know that she is a young, smart lady and that the next time, she will not be just 'nicely surprised' and that she will plan from day one so that she is extremely healthy and ready, for the coming of the new life.  Keep strong my friend, things happen for a reason and although these were unfortunate news, you and your husband's strength at this time will be rewarded more than double in the future."

EVTTDOZ,female,36,">_  The next game I watched was Argentina and Ecuador.  >_  So yeah, we’re waiting for the Saturday game, Mex-Argentina, and Ecuador-Uruguay.  Then it will be Mex-Ecuador, which should (BIG SHOULD) be the easy game.  Ecuador, while not the greatest in technicality has very physically powerful players.  Tall, fast, rough.  Finally, Argentina-Uruguay.  This is definitely the Death group of the cup, Group B.  As my sister says: The final will be played this Saturday: Argentina-Mexico.  Argentina will go out to get Mex and Mex will go out to kill Argentina or they won’t make it to the next level.  We are really hoping to see these 2 play again in the Final.  ^_^ Mex should win it.  Anyway, Paraguay plays against Costa Rica tomorrow and afterwards Brasil-Chile… uff. Nice nice nice games – I hope.  Sometimes we the fans get such disappointments.  The players come to these cups, wanting to take care of themselves too much.  They don’t want to run fast, kick far, or slide hard.  And yes, while we do not wish to see them get injured and then completely miss them on the bigger cup (the World Cup) we don’t want to watch mediocre football either."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"My dog (the one at my parents') was getting out of the property and going to the neighbor's yard to steal goose eggs.  In one of those, my sister picked up from her one of these eggs and after checking it for a while against the light (these things are HUGE! Like 2 tennis balls put together) she noticed a little dark circle inside.  She browsed the net and researched on the development cycle of the geese and decided to give a try at hatching the egg.  This was about 5 weeks ago.  Yesterday morning she gave my mom and I a call and said that the egg was cracking and that something that looked like a little foot was beginning to stick out.  We were pretty excited  but she said that it was early.  Apparently a goose egg needs 6 weeks to hatch... So we thought that perhaps the mother goose had been hatching the egg for 1 or 2 weeks before our dog stole it.  Well we were all happy and my sis went out to buy some chicken food (goose, chicken... What's the difference right?) and said she'd be close by just in case the thingy needed help getting out.  Later at night, around 8 pm, she gave me a call because she couldn't find mom.  I noticed a little accent in her tone.  She said that while she was doing stuff around the house she heard a crack in the kitchen.  She ran inside because she thought it was about time and the goose was trying to get out, but she was met by this ugly, rotten smell!  She checked the egg and noticed a long crack and something whitish coming out from it.  She wasn't sure if that was normal or not... Babies come out all dirty so... maybe birds do too.  Well, since it was already cracked she tried to open it up a bit and more liquid (this time grayish yellow) came out.  She said it smelled really bad and that she saw a little red something in it.  After fully opening the egg she could see the goose, but it just wasn't complete.  She seemed sad and asked if perhaps she should have left it crack alone. That maybe she had killed it when she opened it... :(    I told her not to worry. That her baby had probably died a while back.  It is like those dogs one finds along the road after a couple of days of being hit - they get bloated with gases.  So probably the goose had died a while back and the shell could no longer contain the fumes that had formed in there.  She ended up agreeing with me, but still was sad about it since she had spent so much time taking care of it.  She bought the lamp; measured the temperature; turned it as the notes online said; even had a calendar of what the goose was supposed to look like each day... I wonder what went wrong.  * sigh *  She was so excited about it... but it just wasn't meant to be."

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"My husband left for New York at 5:45am, but things would have been less stressful in the morning had we woken up at 3:20 as originally intended.    We have one of those alarm clocks that can have different times set for weekends and weekdays.  He generally plays around with the times, depending on how tired he is. Most of the time he changes the times by 10 or 15 minutes.  Well, last night he changed the settings for 3:20am and before going to bed he asked me to check it.  I turned it on and saw the 3:20, no pm next to it, so I told him it was fine.  It was a little before midnight and I told him I was not sleepy, that perhaps he should just let me stay awake and then after I dropped him off the next day at around 4 that I would come back and sleep all the way through.  He insisted, ‘I cannot sleep without you’, etc, etc so I turned in.  I remember stirring up and kicking the covers aside and I pushed him a little while doing it.  The next thing I hear is “oh no! Shit!”, so I pick up my head and I ask, “What’s the matter?!” , “It’s FIVE!”  I checked the clock; the alarm was set at 3:20… but for Sunday.  Darn. We’re talking… Five am… plane leaves at 5:45, gates close at around 5:30-something and we’re about 20 minutes away, driving fast... and the truth is that we didn’t really wake up at five - it was like 9 after.  I pulled up jeans and a blouse while he was running around tucking in his toiletries (he was supposed to wake up early enough to take a shower and then pack those bath items).  Well, we got out the driveway and the car clock said 5:22.    I dug my nails onto the seat all the way to the airport.  He was going over 80 in the city, cursing at every single driver that dared to go the actual speed limit.  Finally we got there 3 minutes after 30.  He took out his bags and ran inside.  I began to circle around thinking that there would be the probability that the airport people would not let him in, since he still needed to get boarding pass, check in the luggage, and then get the whole checkup thingy at the gates… plus the lady on the speakers was announcing that gates to flight 2728 were ‘now closed.’  I went around the front once more and he was coming out, I thought they had refused him so I was already taking out my wallet to make some sort of last minute changes to the ticket and hopefully get him a seat aboard the next earliest plane.    Nope. He just needed the cel phone.  I handed it to him by the window and he shouted a hasty “I love you!” while I shouted back, “Yes, yes! Go!” and he ran back inside.  I parked, just in case.  At 5:56am I left back for home…   Husband called me at 7:20am from Houston.  I was waiting for that call since 7am.  Things went okay and he was going to the next gate.  He said that here in Brownsville, gate check still made him wait longer before boarding… They made him take off his shoes, belt, went through the entire luggage, phone, PDA, and his documents.  He was laughing as he told me, the stress already gone.  I reminded him to please find a bathroom and to at least wash his face when he had time.    Oh man… I had bought him this really nice shirt to wear today so that his parents wouldn’t see him all crappy… Darn, the first thing he got was the shirt that he had used at work yesterday.  ~_~  Now they’re gonna say I don’t take care of him…  which I don’t, actually… but still… that’s not for the in-laws to know."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"So I woke up late today - 8:41 am. I figured I could sleep late since my doc's appointment wasn't until 10 am. I take my shower, dry my hair, put on my lotions and powders, get dressed, clean the kitty litter, feed Chiquita (my kitty), put on the make-up and make my way out to the car.  It was 9:53 am., the doc's office is about 5 mins away driving moderate to fast.  I turn on the car and... ~_~ Husband left me the one without gas. >_  Heh. But like I said... 5 minutes away - I could make it.  Passed several turtle-drivers and then hunted down for a place to park and made my way to his office. This is the first time I talk to this doctor; my mom liked him so she told me to give him a try. Generally I do not like to get checkups very often - I dislike the cold-meat treatment.  Yes, I know doctors are supposed to be unattached and not very friendly (wouldn't want to get a lawsuit from some lady that thinks he got a little Too friendly, right?) but C'mon!  Don't just poke me and then write stuff down without ever telling me what it is that you are doing!  I did not go to med school and while a lump here or there may be a very common thing in your line of work, it is Not For Me.  Tell me that it is nothing.  Tell me that you will push me here, probe me there.  Tell me that I should eat more vegetables... Tell me anything.  Well that said and done.  I was surprised that I was walked to the inside rooms as soon as I walked in.  The nurse was chatty and measured and weighed me. I have lost  7 pounds ! Woo-hoo Go Me!  Then took me to another room where she asked me standard questions - pregnancies, abortions, last ""."", heart-lung-pressure-diabetic conditions, and why I was there.  She asked me to wait a moment and that the doctor would come right over. Okay so here I am thinking 'In this place they put you in quickly so that one doesn’t complain and THEN we do the waiting inside.  Nope, I was wrong, and gladly so.  The Dr. came in soon after and sat down to have a nice long talk with me.  Asked me things about my past medical history, any concerns I had, etc, etc.  It was nice.  Then he asked me to change into the paper thingies and stepped out.  No small paper shirts here... these were long, paper, but at least long.  I wore the ‘robe’, which went down to my knees and actually went all around my body.  Then I sat on the table and placed the other paper (like half a sheet) over my lap.  Several minutes later he knocked again and stepped in with the nurse.  Standard procedure, push and touch then probe and poke. ~_~  It hurt.  It always hurts.  He told me that it was best to check well rather than having to get to an operation room later. ""Or don't you think, Renata?""  ""Sure it is... but I gotta be honest. *wince* I didn't even want to come here in the first place.""  ""Haha.  Yes, I understand. *push-push*""  I screamed. Well, 'I yelped' was more like it.  It hurt!  But at least he was talking the whole time and explaining what he was doing and what he was finding.  So after all was done I get dressed and the nurse takes a blood sample.  She told me she should get results by tomorrow so I could call her around 3 pm.  Groovy, that's quick.  I got to the store at 12 noon.  Not bad."

A border company that houses 3500+ employees, so it’s gotta be borderly-like.  No database programming… unless I want to be mean. But I don’t, so I’ll keep it at simple HTML and stuff."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I haven't been feeling all that well.  Started early this week.  I've been getting nausea and I don't really feel like eating much.  Sounds like a pregnancy, but it would be rather weird if it truly was one.  Anyway, I waited for a couple of days - nearing my 'days' - but nothing so I finally decided to just start by buying a home pregnancy test.   The test says you need two lines to assume a woman is pregnant, and this is visible after 1 minute of performing the test.  Non pregnant is 1 line and this is accurate (99.9%) after 3 minutes.  Dang, I gotta tell you... I cried!  After waiting for like half a minute I looked at the test's windows and they were like pinkish, both of them.  I felt tears just about to burst, and not from happiness.   Don't get me wrong, children are wonderful and I have a nice marriage and comfortable life but I am just not ready.  I've never really seen myself as mom material... may explain more about this some other time, maybe someone will help me troubleshoot that. Anyway,  I know what some of you are thinking 'Why didn't you take precautions?'  Well we do.  We are careful and clean too.  But things are never 100% sure.   Soooooo... 3 mins after, 1 line and another pinkish square.  The husband and I checked and rechecked - I should add he was all excited, although we are not planning for kids for a while... must be every man's dream or something, to pass on the genes.  Seems like the pinkish is normal on the windows, so just one line. *crosses fingers*     I will just wait for the monthly and then I'll schedule my regular appt with a doc (a new one since we've moved and my Women's Clinic is too far now) to make sure."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Didn't go out. Browsed the web, chatted, posted under some threads... Found my phone and noticed that i had several missed calls and about 4 voice messages -  Ooops .  Several of our friends were having a barbecue at their parents' and wanted us to go over to share some cabrito (goat). That was for Saturday...  oops again .  Since we spent the entire day out on Saturday, the husband told me to leave the purse inside the car, under the seat so no calls for me that day.  I felt really bad... I hope our friends don't think we just didn't want to return their calls.  I did give them a call as soon as I heard the messages... but still can't help but feel guilty.   We mostly finished 'cleaning' the house and then watched a couple of movie rentals, Body Count (so-so) and Hard Rain (pretty good! Kept me into it the whole hours).  My parents stopped by and gave the hubby a set of drums.  Woo-hoo neighbor complaints here they come!  My dad taught me some basics to reading guitar music while my hubby set up the drums and played around with them a bit.   Overall it was a lazy Sunday, as it usually is.  We made kitchuri (a combination of rice and lentils) which resulted in my burning of the left hand.  Silly me, I should have known to pull out the oven rack before sticking my hand in to take out the pot. Now I have my wrist and the area where the thumb joins the hand all burnt and puffy.   * sigh * I miss my Mutt.  My pretty, wonderful, young, little one.   He is a teen friend from New Zealand whom I just love dearly.  I don't plan on having children of my own, but if the hubby ever convinces me, I sure would hope they turned out to be like this little boy.  We were so close for over a year... and then I started doing volunteer work at a local elementary and our times just wouldn't be coordinated anymore.  I was not able to talk to him as much as I would and now that I have my new job with my mom, which allows me to be online for the entire day, he just... doesn't say hi anymore.     I have talked to him in occassions but it just isn't the same anymore.  The talks just seem to be dry and then they hang to the point that he just leaves without even saying goodbye, something he just would never do before.  There was never enough rushing going on in his or my end.  There was always just enough time for him to say, 'I love you, Aunty.'  I guess there is no more time now."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I jut realized that my pseudo-coding sucks.       Pseudo-code for a category listing... notice the donkeys...    If I were working with a big team, my notes woudl be all typed up and I would have comments on why I write what I do, etc, but since I only work with my hubby... well, let's just say that for the most part, we know what we are trying to say (even if we don't know what the other is writing').  Been a pretty good day. Slept plenty, ate sandwiches, finish beautifying one piece of code, wrote tons with my buddies!  Been a good day, good day indeed.  Well, nothing much to say really except...  WOOO HOOOOOOOO!  Mexico won 10-0 against Dominica!   Although, by goal 7 I was really wishing the other team scored at least once!   Okay, okay these are late news... Mexico played Dominica on Sunday at the Alamodome ni Austin, Texas.  Mexico won.  This ensure their ticket to the World Cup that will be held at Germany in 2006. ^_^  So it's all good!"
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I e-mailed everyone I had to e-mail and I won't be checking e-mails or handle any projects for the whole week.  Today we spent most of the morning at the docs.  Mom will have surgery tomorrow and she is having last minute checkups on pressure and heart condition.  She is in top shape, but it's necessary.  She seemed a little nervous but it's normal.  She has never liked to go under the knife, or rather, under anesthesia.  She says that it was terrifying to be somewhere and then blink and suddenly awake at a bed, all patched up."
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"I must be.  Or maybe I am just the typical woman with subconcious wants and frequent irrational dreams of which one blushes and squirms in the morning.  But what if it isn't typical, however?  Several days ago:   I was backstage, the pounding music and flashing of lights driving the entire crowd crazy as our 'heroes' continued to make what for us will be an impossible of times with no end.  I was pacing about, waiting for them to finish their number... not really sure why.  Finally, everything was over and we headed to the locker area of the arena to 'chill' and party.  Everyone was now nice and clean from the sweat of his or her activities and things were alright.  But not for me.  I was upset for some reason and so I left the room, laughs and indecipherable chatting going on incessantly behind me.  Gaw I was upset.  And the more laugh I heard, the worse it got.  Then it hit me... I needed a little attention for me.  So at the top of the stairs I did what seemed most reasonable at the time.  I gave a few steps down, skipped them actually, and then I shouted.  It was a short, high-pitched scream.  I was sure that it would not be heard with all the clamor going on inside the party room, or that it may just be mistaken for some other laughter.  Oh but surprise, someone did hear.  John C came from the end of the hall, apparently he wasn't inside the other room, may have gone out to... erm... for whatever reason, he didn't explain.  Well, I was at the bottom step, sitting all distressed and rubbing my ankle (left, right... it doesn't matter now, I just was).    ""Yo girl,"" he punched my arm jokingly. It wasn't at all harsh according to him but sometimes men just cannot measure much about their strength.  I leaned to the left, pushed by his 'playfulness.'  It did not hurt, not at all, but I did feel it.  I frowned and began to move slightly so that he could either walk by or sit next to me... I was aiming at the latter.  He did none, instead he took my hand and yanked me to my feet before picking me up in his arms.  He was not wearing a shirt and as I placed my hand on his chest to steady myself (no... really) I was quite amazed that his skin was actually pretty soft over all that muscle.  Smooth too... he probably doesn't shave.  I bet he went under the laser.  I've gone through the procedure and after the first week skin is super soft, too bad it's so expensive...  John C kept walking away from the stair, the noise. He had this muck grin on his face and I asked what he found so very amusing.  I had just 'fallen' at the stairs.  ""Sure you did. That's why I am going to have a look at it."" and he turned his body around (still carrying me) and used his back to open up a door, somewhat careful not to knock me around the door frame.  I was then set on a table.  My hands moved to the hem of my dress.  I wore one of my favorite dresses, which unfortunately I have not used in a very long time... but for this event it seemed that I was.  It is a sweet baby blue color with tiny flower patterns, princess cut with neck and decent cleavage, nothing that shows anything at all... a typical V-neck with folds.  It is somewhat short; however.  It is 4 inches or so from the knee and when I sit it goes up to about 7.  So I fumbled a little and tucked it in the best I could under my legs so that it wouldn't ride up too much.  I do that every time I sit.  Most girls do.  No use.  His movement was deft and soon his mouth was pressed against mine.  It was quick, eager and soon we were engrossed on ourselves.  I do not know when or how, but my dress was untied and next thing I knew I was on my lacey undergarments while his hand rubbed my neck and moved to caress between my breasts...   So strange.  I was not the least excited.  Perplexed at such a thing yes, especially since I do not find him all that attractive, somewhat funny yes since he has quick wit.  *sigh* I was just watching all this unfold and is as if I had been sitting saying ""oh whoopee do dah...  Next please ..."""
EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Some clients just do not appreciate the work that I do.  If they have a problem with my work then perhaps they should stop asking me to help them out.  One of these clients claims that ""Nobody down here knows how to type! Not even you.""   Excuse me?     A while back I typed some document for him and yes, although I proofread, sometimes I miss things - that is why I ask all of my clients to read and reread and reread their work before getting stuff printed.  Well, this was one letter and he made one measly copy of it (and it wasn't like a 50-page report either, it was about 2 pages only... he just doesn't know how to use a computer).  Well, he sat down with me, read it and said ""okay make me a copy.""    I did not make any typos, except that I wrote down something for other.  A swap of letters.  Well, I do not claim to be the best typer in the world... nor am I great at spelling or grammar, but that's why a client is responsible for checking their things.  If they find anything amiss, I gladly change it. No problemo - my mistake.  Well, we are talking 20 cents for the fricken copy and then my typing time (made him a favor and did not charge him a full hour even though he kept me busy for almost a whole one because the man isn't even capable of scrolling a page), so it was a total of like $3.20 (I should have charged 12.20, how nice am I?).  The next day he came back and told me about the swapped letters. No problem, I pulled out the saved document and made him another print - no charge (20 cents, no biggie right?).  Well... it has been about 2 months since that incident and he had never brought it up until today.  I was like.. WTF!  Well here comes the why:   I made a small site for him. Nothing big, he went for the basics because he did not want to pay much.  That was my mistake... I should not come to compromises with anyone regarding my work.  If they can't pay then I should not give them my time.  But * sighs * business is starting and we aren't doing that great so I said... why not?  A few extra bucks are better than none at all. His site had been up and operational since last December.  He is usually out of town and he had come on the 24 near closing time and asked me to please, please hurry and put 'something' because he wanted to have his site up and running that same day.  So I spoiled my Xmas working on his project.  It is March now... the End of March now so free updates have pretty much expired - I give 1 to 3 months of updates on pages depending on what type of site I make; his qualified for a month.  A week ago he walked into the store and asked me if I could give him a few minutes to make some changes to his site.  I said I could not on that day because I was very, very busy, but if he came another day (preferably scheduled) that it would be no problem.  He said it was nothing big just wanted to give me what to do, etc.  Apparently he needed it done 'pronto.'  I said, ""Alright, but it still cannot be done today.  But whenever we do sit down to talk about it then I can go ahead and take down all information and pass you the bill.  Or you can just write it down and I will get to it as soon as I finish what I am doing at the moment.""  Well, he got stuck on the word 'bill.'  Asked how much it would be and I simply said $75.  His eyes popped out.  ""$75 dollars?!  It is just a little change!""  ""Well, yes. That is my monthly fee for updates on existing pages.""  ""But I just need you to take stuff out and add some small paragraphs.  $75 dollars for that?!""  ""It is a monthly fee, not a fee per change.""  ""it's too much.""  ""I do not think you appreciate what I am doing here, Sir.  I spent 6 years in schools for this.""  That's right... Bachelors and a Master degree.  This guy is a truck driver, he gets paid $1000 a month for just sitting on his butt driving the thing.  I know this because he told me.  And he's crying for $75 a month?!  That's about 2.50 a day! HELLOOOOO!  ""No, no. forget it. Leave things as they are."" and he left.    That was then. Today he walks in at around noon and asks if I could give him a few minutes at around 3:30 - he needed to talk about the site.  I said, ""3:30, sure.  I should be done with this machine by then.""  I was troubleshooting a machine at the time.  He did not show until 5:54... We close at 6 p.m.  So I took my notebook and stepped out to check his site and take notes on changes.  He said he needed some changes, minor ones, and that if I could give him credit and he'd pay me later because he couldn't pay right now for the change. ""No problem.  Like I explained last week, this fee is monthly.""  ""Oh, you are going to charge me every month?""  ""No, just when you need it.  If you don't make any changes in three months then no problem.""  ""Ohhh! Okay then.""  so he gave me all changes, etc., etc. and then asked, ""Can I trust that you will make this changes correctly?""  Hmmm... what?  I looked down at my notebook and began to read my notes to him, while scrolled through pages to pinpoint where those changes were to occur.    ""No, no. I mean, can I trust that you won't make mistakes?""  ""Well I will do what you told me.  If it is not written here then I will not do it.  Make sure you give me everything you need done.""  ""Well, I am saying because last time you did that typo on that letter, remember?""  ""Oh. Ohhhh! Okay, yes I remember.  Well, I always do ask that you proof read everything.""   ""But I am leaving today so I won't be able to do it.""  heh... last time he didn't do it either and he wasn't leaving town just yet.  ""Nobody down here knows how to type! Not even you.""  O_o  I  laughed , ""Everyone makes mistakes.""  ""Well yes you are right.  I guess you are one of the best down here but you aren't perfect.""  That's right. I am not... I've never claimed to be; therefore my policy, which I give to all my clients before they ask me to do anything for them.  We are not responsible for misprints.  We make proofs before printing or going on the web.  A client is responsible for checking them. If they approve it, we run it.  That time with the letter, he pinpointed the typo and I corrected it.  Like I said, we had not run like 200 copies of it, we only made 1... which was replaced with the corrected one immediately.  ""Are you going to work on this right now?""    I looked at the system clock - 6:13 p.m.  ""Not likely.  I need to backup computers and close the store.""  Perhaps if he had actually shown up to the appointment at THREE-THIRTY as we had agreed I would have been nice enough to do as much as possible during the remainder of the day... but he did not.  Plus my dad does the accounting for the day as soon as he gets there (generally at 5:30) and he uses my office for that.  ""This weekend then?""  ""I do not come on the weekends."" I was going to say unless I have something unfinished... but he would have said his stuff was unfinished. But there is no way I would go to the office just to work on his site.  He isn't even paying me right now plus I have other sites... projects that have scheduled before his.  ""I will do it as soon as I finish other things in my schedule.""  ""When then?""  ""Don't worry. It will be done next week.""  ""But when?  Monday?"" his tone was getting loud.  Geessssh.  ""As soon as I can get to it, but won't go over next week.""    ""Make it quick. I sent several letters out the other day and they will be arriving soon so I don't want people to see the site info as it is now.""  Well hello! Maybe he should have given me the notes  Before  he sent out those letters.  ""Now remember, I have priority here. I was your first client!""  I was upset now. ""Um... no you were not.""  ""Yes I was.""  ""No. You were not.  I have had clients with me for years already.  Your changes will be done when I can squeeze them in."" Even if he had been my first client, right now he is not my Only client.  Others have given me work to do on their sites before this so this one has to wait its turn.  ""Oh, okay.""  I guess he finally got the fact that the world does not revolve around him and that I am not just sitting, waiting to see what gets stuck up his butt.  He got up, got some packages he had waiting for him and left.  ...I am not talking to him about projects unless he makes appointments and keeps them."

EVTTDOZ,female,36,"Dear Friend,   sounds a bit generic infomercial to me, but alright...    This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met.  I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium .As you  read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone  will die someday.    Ahum, well if you don't know me really you could not be contacting me any other way. Now get to the point!    My name is HAKEEM SADIQ, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I  have been diagnosed with prostate and  esophageal Cancer that was discovered  very late  due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has  defiled  all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live  according to medical  experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really  cared for  anyone not even myself but  my business.   Boo hoo... that must suck.   Though I am very rich, I was never  generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my  business as that  was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know  that  there is more to life than just wanting to   have or make all the money in the world.   ... and that's why you got the cancers...   I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I  would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my  time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one  of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some  charity organizations in the U.A.E,  London and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members  of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have  there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to  themselves.   Well, family needs money too. Isn't it good to give money to people you know and love as opposed to total strangers who won't give a damn where the money came from?   Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the  huge cash deposit that I have with Financial Firm Abroad .I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let  them know that it is I HAKEEM  SADIQ  that is making this generous donation.   So you don't trust family members... but you trust Me, a total stranger. Riiight okay.    I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my  time to come.   I didn't know doctors allowed laptops inside rooms, but even if they did... ever heard of wire-transfers?  I know you're using the Internet, otherwise I would not have gotten the e-mail.

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"The key to being ""conservative"" is reluctance to change long-established cultural, social, and political norms.  Conservative resistance to change is not based on some irrational, homophobic, money-grubbing fear of things and people different from ourselves.  The resistance to change is based on reason--namely, an understanding that things are the way they are for a purpose.  Modern social institutions are the result of centuries of trial and error which have developed patterns of living that produce efficient, ordered societies largely composed of happy and productive individuals and families.     These traditions reflect an acquired recognition that life and happiness are better achieved through institutions that support liberty, community, and family.  These are the foundations of prosperity and peace in the western commercial states.  Partly on this understanding, Jefferson wrote, ""Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes.""  Just so, centuries of valuable human experience should not be rejected lightly.  Homosexual behavior is dangerous.  The average homosexual has had multiple partners and few stable monogamous relationships.  The homosexual lifestyle is self-destructive and leads to disease, drug abuse, and depression.  I have not read any studies about the effects on children of being raised in gay homes, but it is my hunch that the mountain of evidence that children are much more likely to grow to be well-ordered, productive adults if raised in two-parent homes did not consider gay two-parent homes.  To throw away such an institution just to ease the consciences of a few individuals incapable of a modicum of self-control is foolish.  I have news for homosexual activists: social recognition of your lifestyle will not assuage your guilt.    Constitutionally, I believe only state legislatures are authorized to decide the question.  Neither federal courts, Congress, nor sister-state courts should decide whether a state must recognize or allow gay marriage.  Only the people of the states themselves can decide.  Nevertheless, to the extent that I believe the courts will co-opt  the decision for themselves, I support the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment  as a way to protect the states and marriage from runaway courts.    Next post, I'll let you know how I  really  feel. ;-)   Update:   I believe that some things are important enough to our national societal health that they should be made a part of national policy.  There is nothing unconstitutional about a properly ratified constitutional amendment, whether it seemingly restricts personal liberty or not (BTW, all laws restrict liberty).

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"I have a couple of blog-length (that is, relatively short) essays brewing in my head that I'll post soon, but I think I'll just make this an introduction post.  Many thanks to Phil for sharing his blog with Matt and I!  First, (note the absence of ""firstly"": someone who knows who she is spent a lot of time coaching me on the irrelevance of the ""ly"") my name is Anthony Williams.  I am a 2002 graduate of Hillsdale College, majoring in history and minoring in German.  My history specialty is the early American republic and constitutional issues.  The rest of my interests range from Harry Potter to Russia to the ancients, to system administration, networking, gaming, and in my spare time, woodcarving.    I had, and still do have, my own personal blog, as linked up there in the right-hand column.  For reasons that are of little interest, I had to secure my Livejournal, as Phil said.  But I still enjoy thinking about political things, writing my thoughts out, and posting them for public review.  So, I suggested to Phil and Matt that we collaborate on a group blog; all were amenable, and the easiest solution was to modify Toyah into a multi-author blog.  Besides, Phil already had a cool name, one that wasn't likely to be taken by anyone else.  It was big news last week when John Kerry chose John Edwards to be his running mate.  Well, actually, it was kind-of-big-news.  I admit I was surprised a little: I didn't think Kerry would pick someone so unlike himself, someone who could easily end up overshadowing him (I refuse to make lame jokes about their respective heights).  My impression of Kerry is a weak man; not a bad man, but one who is easily controlled by stronger characters.  He is credited with some courageous actions in Vietnam, to be sure, but we need someone who is strong and courageous now, not who was strong and courageous in 1968.  And his recent record does not impress me as a courageous or strong record.  Furthermore, to be blunt, John Kerry is boring.  He doesn't have a charismatic voice or tone of speaking, and doesn't frequently smile (but, to give him his due, he does have a nice smile when he does).  So, by contrast to John Edwards, he's quite gray, while Edwards is colorful.  I haven't personally heard Edwards speak, but I hear he does well, and he certainly sounds cheerful, and likes to smile.  Presidents aren't elected on their smile alone, or so we hope, but a successful candidate has to be able to connect to the people.  I think the Kerry campaign is hoping that Edwards will be able to help Kerry out in that regard.  It may work, but I don't think it'll matter.  I don't ever recall voting for a vice-president myself, nor ever speaking with someone who had.  People always vote for the man at the top of the ticket.    I wonder though, if this is good for John Edwards?  Does anyone remember Dukasis' running mate?  Where is Dan Quayle, today?  Who ran with Bob Dole?  Could Al Gore get elected in Tennessee today, I wonder?  If the challenger doesn't get elected, the vice president candidate is forgotten even more than the challenger is.  That might be good: maybe Dukasis' VP was able to resume his own political career (though, I'm guessing it hasn't been very spectacular).  But if anything ""bad"" emerges during the campaign, the VP will be stained too, if not as badly as the president-candidate himself.  Likewise, even if the president-candidate is elected, the VP must run, later, with the shadow of the President over him, a problem that Al Gore had in 2000.  Of course, if the President is popular, the VP could ride into office on his coattails, as George Bush the first did.  But it seems to me that, politically, it's rather dangerous to run for Vice-President.  If I were John Edwards, I'd have declined."

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Blandus Rex asked, after my last post on Leviitcus and Jeremiah,   ""[Do] Christians (true decendants of Abraham) [have a responsibility] to fear God's judgement on their lands if they do not strive to obey His (at least Moral/Ethical) law?"" or ""Is there some scripture honoring belief by Christians that could say, ""Hey look at how serious God was about these kinds of things for the people-group He had a special relationship with. If He was that serious with his chosen people, how much more serious will He be on 'all the nations?' America had better repent!""   I see this as two questions, requiring two answers.  Christians do claim to be the spiritual heirs of ancient Israel, thus whatever God said to the ancient Israelites is certainly applicable to modern Christians, though modified by the New Testament covenant and by the modern situation (the fact that, as I pointed out earlier, there is no covenantal relationship between God and country anymore).  Certainly God's dealings with ancient Israel are instructive in understanding God.  Knowing how He reacts to those who hold His laws in contempt should make Christians that much more careful and serious about their commitment to the cause of Christ.  For the relationship between modern nations like America and God, however, I think the parallel is not to ancient Israel but to the ancient pagan lands around Israel.  What is important is not that Moab, Philistia, Edom, etc. were pagan, but that they were nations which God had not made a specific covenant with.  God did judge each of these nations, just as He did Israel and Judah, but not on the same standard.  If I recall my minor prophets correctly, He condemned Moab not so much for worshipping Molech, but for worshipping Molech with infant sacrifice.  The other scripture which is instructive on this point to me is God's comment to Abraham, that He would give Canaan to Abraham's descendants, but not yet, because the iniquity of the Ammonite was not yet complete.  I read that to mean that God did hold the Ammonites to a standard, but not to a covenantal standard.  I think He judged the Ammonites on the standard of Romans 1: natural law, the things that everyone naturally knows is right and wrong.  The Ammonites were wicked, to be sure, but it would require 400 more years before God was ready to destroy them.  So, yes, God does judge nations.  Christians can work to influence their fellow citizens to act in ways that don't antagonize God.  And certainly, Christians can draw lessons from God's dealings with ancient people, including the Israelites.  However, I think Christians have two loyalties.  The first is to God, and thus the first and most important question to a Christian is: God was serious with His chosen people in ancient times---am I being serious before Him?  The second loyalty is to their country.  I care deeply about my country, very very deeply.  But on another level, it's only a temporary thing.  I'll be here for at most another 60 or 70 years, and it isn't likely that anything I do will greatly influence my people one way or another.  When I'm dead, America will continue on, although hopefully I'll have done more good than harm.  Given that, though, what I do for God is much more important than what I do, or even worry about, for America."

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"From Jim Dunnigan on the  urlLink Strategy Page :  June 29, 2004: Iraqi terrorists released a video showing them killing a captive American soldier by shooting him in the head. The terrorists have learned that the beheading routine is counterproductive and even offends many of their own supporters. The terrorists are probably also debating their suicide bombing campaign, which has killed over a hundred Iraqis in the past week. Perhaps the al Qaeda leadership is also pondering their long string of failures over the last decade or so. The fact of the matter is that al Qaeda, and their predecessor, the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt, have turned Arab populations against them whenever they practiced their terror tactics ""at home."" Moreover, when al Qaeda was in control of the government, as they were in Afghanistan, they quickly became hated by the average Afghan. Al Qaeda was most popular in Arab countries when it was not operating in any Arab countries, but instead concentrating on attacks on Western targets. But the war on terror has forced al Qaeda back to its homelands, and concentrated them in Iraq. There, al Qaeda is becoming as hated as it already is in the West. This hatred led to the Moslem Brotherhood's defeat, and expulsion from Egypt over a decade ago. The same thing is happening again in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Recent surveys have shown support for bin Laden and al Qaeda shrink dramatically in Saudi Arabia (from 96 percent in late 2001, to less than a quarter of that currently.) It's easy to admire terrorists from a distance, rather more difficult when they are terrorizing you. Iraq is rapidly becoming al Qaeda's graveyard."

Not all of the left is crazy, and not all of the left wants to f*** Bush, but enough of it seems to have taken leave of it's senses that I tend to tune them out.  The problem is not limited to the left: there's more than a few on the far right who despise Bush almost as violently as the Michael Moore left.

I'm a long way from a true-blue, cheering Bush supporter.  He did disappoint me with a lot of his domestic policies.  I'm not sure what to think about Iraq: I would like to believe that America's leaders made the best decision they could, based on what they knew at the time, and I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt: necessarily incomplete information  will  sometimes lead to bad decisions.  It is also possible that the president and his people exaggerated their case in an effort to get support.

Kohlberg argued that such ethical autonomy should be the goal of human existence-even though in this stage humans are in some ways the most selfish, virtually inventing a world, totally apart from God.   I'd propose instead of Kohlberg's six or seven stages just three. First comes the glory stage, the I'm-the-center-of-the-world thinking within which we attempt to glorify ourselves. Next comes the glory, glory stage, when we strive to promote not only ourselves but a collective entity as well: perhaps a nation, perhaps a business, perhaps Communism. Our goal, however, should be to move by grace to the highest stage, where we act to bring glory, glory, glory to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

A couple of problems:     "" there's no clear objection in the Bible to lesbianism ""  -- Uh-uh.  urlLink Romans 1:26 .  Important to note that gay and lesbian activity is listed right along side lots of other sins indicative of we who ""worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator"" (Rom 1:25).  This list includes such zingers as greed, envy, arrogance, gossiping, and disobedience to parents, to name a few.     "" And in polite society, conservative Christians -- especially Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses -- are among the last groups it's still acceptable to mock. ""  -- Well, getting warmer, that is if LDS and JWs  really were  Christians. There are a few fundamental differences between LDS/JWs and Christians, namely the nature of God, the nature of man, and the relation between the two.  Doesn't a man like this at least have an editor or someone who knows the difference?  Sadly, probably not.     "" But there's no clear objection in the Bible to lesbianism at all. And since some fundamentalists have argued that AIDS is God's punishment for gay men, it's worth noting that lesbians are at less risk of AIDS than straight women. So if God is smiting gay men for their sin, is he rewarding lesbians for their holiness? ""  -- interesting argument, if this is really what most Christians believe.  To be fair, many do.    On the other hand:     Liberals often protest that they would have nothing against conservative Christians if they were not led by hypocritical blowhards who try to impose their Ten Commandments plaques, sexual mores and creationism on society. But that's a crude stereotype, and it ignores the Christian right's accomplishments. Polls show that evangelical Christians are more likely to contribute to charities that help the needy, and in horror spots in Africa Catholics and other Christians are the bulwark of the health care system.  Good. And: It's always easy to point out the intolerance of others. What's harder is to practice inclusiveness oneself.

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"I'm back from a few weeks of work and travel and ready to make totally random comments on issues about which I should spend much more time thinking before I opine. But, the beauty of blogging is that we get to open our random and developing thoughts to comment by others so that we can adjust and fine-tune them. So here it goes: Here's my impression of the place of third parties, and the Libertarian Party in particular, in the American political system.  The major American parties are essentially coalition parties that form before an election, rather than, as in our European counterparts, after an election. The truth of this can be observed in the fact that members of single factions within a party, such as the libertarians or evangelical Christians in the Republican Party, or the environmentalists or civil libertarians in the Democratic Party, persistently wail that the rest of the party has lost its backbone, gives in to its opponents, has sold its soul to the Devil, and simply no longer looks like them. As in all coalitions, party coalitions share several transcendent themes, such as limited government or progressive government. But these themes themselves are bifurcated and shift in emphasis depending on the cultural and political climate of the day. Libertarian members of the Republican Party enjoyed a prominent position in the years leading up to and including the Reagan Administration because of the problems created by the post-New Deal boom in government. In recent times, the so-called neocons have dominated in a climate of terrorism and national security. Both sides share many common beliefs, but not so much that they dont still maintain their separate affinities and identities.  This is where third parties come in. First, third parties surface when, while in the governing coalition, they feel dissatisfied with the way their coalition is running things. Examples on point: the Libertarian Party arose during the big-spending Nixon administration; Ross Perots Libertarian-leaning Reform Party during George H.W. Bushs centrist administration; and Ralph Nader and the Green Party during centrist Bill Clintons administration. In each instance, the effect of the defection was to weaken the governing coalition and hand control of government to the opposing coalition party, the proverbial heads you lose, tails you lose, as the switch had the effect of handing government from a potential ally to a clear enemy.  The Libertarian party, however, is an odd duck. In truth, though the LPs free-market, anti-welfare state principles find more in common with the Republicans, their general anything-goes, absolute liberty presumptions also attract a number of left-leaning civil libertarians to their ranks. These folks, once convinced that the LP does not match their Republican brethren in repugnant religious zeal, find in the LP a group of agnostic and pro-marihuana hippies they can easily identify with.  So, what effect the formation and growth of the Libertarian Party? Overall, the presence of an active LP lessens the influence of libertarian thought in either party, and correspondingly, lessens their influence in government. This statement, however, deserves some explanation. First, there are relatively few consistent Libertarian (big L) voters out there, and even fewer Libertarian candidates. The Libertarians loss of influence, therefore, does not happen at the polls. The real loss is in terms of the libertarian (little l) politicos. These are the folks who would (and in past administrations, did) actively work for Republican (and Democratic) officials or governments, but have instead thrown their lot in with a separate Libertarian third party where their influence in government is nil. Instead of working for reforms from within the fortress, where many were quite successful in the past, they have tried to storm the ramparts from outside, and all without the benefits of a coalition.  The result of a separate Libertarian Party therefore is to go from having some libertarian influence in government by operating within one of the coalition parties, to having no influence. The LPers may feel better about themselves, but theyll wind up with worse, not better government (at least from their perspective).  There is a final chapter to this story. Often following the third-party split and fall of the ruling coalition, both the newly-defeated coalition party and the prodigal third-party re-form to defeat the common enemy. From the perspective of the third party, they have won by forcing the coalition in their direction. The cycle, of course, usually repeats because the ruling coalition must have 51% to win. In the Libertarian Party phenomenon, however, the advent of a LP coalition that includes a left-leaning faction could permanently dampen the LPs chances of rejoining a ruling coalition, as the new commitment by leftists will permanently lock the Libertarian Party out of any ruling coalition.  To recap, by not participating in the major coalition parties, libertarians have significantly lessened their influence in government. If the libertarians feel perpetually left out of the Republican Party, they only have the Libertarian Party to blame."

The colonial migrations to the New World can be divided into four rough time periods, groups of people, and geographical entities, consisting of:    East Anglians to Massachusetts (1629-41): The English Puritans    South England to Virginia (1642-75): The Cavaliers   North Midlands to the Delaware Valley (1675-1725): The Friends      Borderlands to the Backcountry (1717-1775): The Borderers     Fischer then goes into each folkway in great deal, examining each in their everyday life: life-ways, death-ways, building-ways, election-ways, church-ways, child-rearing ways, sex-ways, language-ways, farming-ways, and all sorts of other cultural ""norms"" for each culture. He found that in each American colonial experience, the traditions which became dominant for an American region could be traced to a specific part of Britain. The Appalachian people of the United States, for example, share an enormous number of traditions with their Scots-English borderer ancestors, one of which is a tendency to violence and extreme distrust of strangers. Large parts of backcountry Carolina spoke Gaelic as late as the 1900's, in fact.  I was fascinated in how I could see myself, and my own personal tendencies, fit right into the cultural ""norms"" and ""ways"" that Fischer identified. My family is from the West, from eastern Oregon, but almost of all of my ancestors immigrated from Kentucky or Tennessee. Other branches of the family came from Virginia, although where in Virginia I'm not quite sure. Possibly there is a distant connection to the Lees, so not all my ancestors were of the ""backcountry"" folkways, but---from what I know of my family---most of them were. That makes sense, when I think about which of the four folkways I most closely identify with. It's the backcountry way. I'm hardly quick to violence, nor do I live in a log cabin, but in most cases I prefer direct action, violent if necessary, over diplomacy or negotiation. I can negotiate when I have to, but it always goes against the grain. Also like the backcountry, I prefer plainness, and in general care very little about niceties of custom and ""proper"" ways of doing things. Perhaps most importantly, I have a very strong stubborn and independent streak, tending sometimes to contrarianism, which would be recognizable to anyone familiar with Andrew Jackson or John C. Calhoun.  Back to  Albion's Seed , Fischer concluded with a brief summary of U.S. electoral results as interpreted regionally, and argued that, though none of the regions has maintained itself in any sort of a pure way, and though some regions (such as New England) now have harldy anyone left of their original British stock, still the regions maintain much of their original tint, and over the course of American history, the regions have tended to vote consistently, with just the ocassional aberration like FDR in 1932, Eisenhower in 1952, or Reagan in 1980.  Fischer's final words on the regions of America:   Regional diversity has created a dynamic tension within a single republican ssytem. It has also fostered at least four different ideas of liberty with a common cultural frame.  These four ideas are not European, though they derive from there.  They are: 1) The Puritan idea of ordered freedom 2) The cavalier idea of hegemonic freedom 3) The Quaker idea of reciprocal freedom 4) The backcountry idea of natural freedom  Each of these four freedom ways still preserves its seperate existence in the United States. The most important fact about American liberty is that is has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even contrary traditions in creative tension with one another. This diversity of libertarian ideas has created a culture of freedom which is more open and exapnsive than any unitary tradition alone could possibly be.   There are many explanations for why America is what it is, and all of them have some part of the truth. Fischer's work is an invaluable aid to anyone seeking to understand what made the United States."

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Several years ago, Phil came home from his introductory economics class and told me that he now knew that voting did not matter.  I blinked: was he serious?  He explained that, given the millions of votes cast, no one individual vote matters.  I later took the same class myself, and had to admit the point made sense.  But Ive never been entirely comfortable with it, and I dont think its merely because I want to believe that my vote matters, although I do.  My suspicion is that the answer is both no and yes.  Anytime there are at least three voters involved, two of those votes wont matter.  The only vote that matters is the third vote, the one that breaks the tie.  The other two voters, especially if they always oppose each other, might as well not bother voting at all, and give up their voting power to the third party, since it is that party which always decides things anyway.  Thereafter, the third party, now the only voter, decides everything, and can even do things the other two dont want to do.  So, the other two votes do matter, acting as an invisible check on the tiebreaker.  Lets try another example.  Suppose Tom is a pilot in the RAF in World War II, during the Blitz.  There are hundreds of German bombers flying to attack Britain: it does not matter how many he shoots down, most of them will get through.  At most, if he is extremely good and extremely lucky, he might shoot down three or four bombers.  It is not in his individual best interest to fly the missions.  He has a good chance of getting shot down himself, or killed; he will not stop the bombers, and he will not save his hometown, or any other British town, from being bombed.  His vote does not matter.  If all the pilots follow this logic, none of them will fly, the Luftwaffe will destroy the RAF, the Wehrmacht will invade England, and all of the pilots will be sent to Stalag Luft 3.  So, it is not in their self-interest for no one to fly.  Actually, the best outcome for any RAF pilot is that he himself not fly, but everyone else does.  If everyone understands this, it would lead to the absurd situation of every pilot encouraging every other pilot to fly, while excusing himself (this is where the sergeant says, Enough B.S. boys, time to turn in.  Anyone not on the flight line at 5am will be on latrine duty for a week!).  The individual actions do not matter, but the aggregate actions do matter, making the individual actions matter.  Or does it?  Much more to follow, but please contribute comments.  Im working this out as I go"

There is no way he did not know the rules about handling sensitive information, and I simply cannot imagine that someone who had been in his position of responsibility would become so sloppy and careless to accidentally remove secret papers and then accidentally dispose of them.  It's possible, to be sure.  But it so stretches the realm of credibility that I find it an extremely dubious story, though I suppose it's a better defense than saying he removed them on purpose.

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Ralph Nader spoke at the law school  urlLink yesterday , and, of course, I was there to lend support.  He was in town organizing folks to collect signatures to get his name on the Texas ballot.  Nader's speech focused on condemning corporations.  Specifically he criticized law schools for their focus on corporate law and lack of concern for public interest law and issues.  Mostly your typical Marxist-Socialist rodomontade;   Corporations bad, universal healthcare good.  Nader is certainly not troubled by the prospect of drawing votes from Kerry.  He sees politics, as he sees life, as a fight between the corporations and the people.  In his view, both Rs and Ds are in the pockets of the unaccountable corporations and will remain so as long as corporations are allowed to fund campaigns.  Essentially, there is no significant difference between Republicans and Democrats so he cares little if he helps Bush to win.  In this view, Nader has much in common with the libertarians, who, by the way, were also present, asking folks to sign a petition to get their candidate on the ballot (whoever their candidate is).     Interestingly, this is the second time since declaring his candidacy that Nader has spoken at UT.  I guess since his goal is to get the highest percentage of nationwide votes he can (and therefore receive federal money the next time around) he is focusing on getting on the ballots in the biggest states Bush will certainly win. No matter how many votes Nader draws from Kerry, Bush will win all of Texas' electors.  Nader's is a good strategy if your goal is to win 5% of the popular vote and not the overall election. (BTW, over 10% of Austin voters voted for Nader in the 2000 election.)  Nader received this week's   Federalist  ""Alpha Jackass"" Award  for this quote:   ""We are dealing here with a basically unstable president. ... We are dealing with a messianic militarist. A messianic militarist, under our constitutional structure, is an unstable officeholder. Talk about separation of church and state: It is not separated at all in Bush's brain, and this is extremely disturbing.""   --Ralph Nader, responding to Bush's statement in Bob Woodward's book that he prayed ""for the strength to do the Lord's will"" when committing the nation to go to war in Iraq."

Joseph Ellis's   American Sphinx: The character of Thomas Jefferson   was very well done.  Ellis had established himself with me as a lucid and entertaining writer in  Founding Brothers  (published after  Sphinx ) and does not disappoint in his biography of the best-known of the founding fathers--other than Washington and, if you are a Jay-Walking All Star, Abe Lincoln.  Ellis's primary subjects are TJ's abilities to hold several seemingly contradictory beliefs at once, and to profess very strong ideals while often violating those ideals when confronted with reality.  Jefferson was a master at self-deception, a trait that, when mixed with his very strong ""republican"" or limited government beliefs, make him, I think, the quintessential Libertarian.  Though every party claims Jefferson as their own (after all, FDR built the Jefferson Memorial as the Democrat counter-weight to the Republican Lincoln Memorial), his multi-faceted personality and often self-contradictory beliefs provide a little for everyone, making him an ideal addition to the American Pantheon, and a subject worthy of Ellis's skill."
2IWJ4SX,male,24,"I just saw a free screening of the new quasi-independent release,   Napoleon Dynamite  .  The show connected with and brought back many memories from a unique part of my adolescence; it took me back to my four years in Colorado.  From 1988-1992 I lived in Southern Colorado's San Luis Valley, a 60-mile wide valley home to the headwaters of the Rio Grande, numerous potato farms, the Great Sand Dunes National Monument, and the surrounding Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountain ranges.  I lived in Colorado from my 4th through 7th grades, right at the height of Trapper-Keepers, Casio watches, and various 80's bands.  I rode the bus to school.  I wore space-shoe-looking snow boots.  I rode my bike everywhere.  My closest friend was an outcast from south of the border (Texas).  I had crushes on girls who thought I was a geek.  I was a geek, and I did not fit in.  Oh, and I loved Ninjas.  All of the above describe the life of Napoleon Dynamite, a social misfit living in rural Idaho with his Grandma and 30-year-old unemployed brother.  NApoleon struggles for accepptance, makes some new friends, and relives the late 80s/early 90s lingo perfectly (""You guys are retarded!"").

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Typically, the talk at this point in an election cycle surrounds the Challenger's (Kerry's) pick for VP.  This time around, however, it appears the Bush ticket could steal a little of Kerry's thunder with talk about replacing Cheney's spot on the ticket.  Cheney is seen more and more as a liability rather than an asset, what with Haliburton, Cheney's support for the now disgraced Chalabi, and his overall role in the war in Iraq.  Another consideration is 2008.  Cheney will probably not be a contender to replace Bush and selecting a new runningmate would help insure a contest when Hillary makes her move.  So, who to replace Cheney?  The top choices are probably Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and George Pataki, and in that order.  None of these men are true Republicans, and to choose one of them would signal the end of the Reagan Era of the Republican party.  Nevertheless, their name recognition and, for Pataki and Giuliani, the potential to put NY in play, make them hard to pass up.   urlLink James Gannon  posits that former Sen.

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"If youve ever been around Christians---of any stripe---much, as I have, then youve probably heard your fair share of doom-and-gloom predictions.  They generally follow the pattern of God disapproves of X, America participates/tolerates/approves of X, therefore Gods wrath is sure to fall upon us.  Abortion, gay rights and/or marriage, divorce, and immorality in general are favorite topics.  I hear these sorts of comments especially when studying a book like Jeremiah, which is after all full of those kinds of prophecies.  However, now that Ive recognized the parallels between Jeremiah and Lamentations---parallels that I dont think are accidental---Im reconsidering whether the doom-and-gloom predictions by Christians are warranted.  To be sure, God does  disapprove  of homosexuality, divorce, immorality, and the killing of the unborn.  But its not logically valid to apply the same lessons from Israelite history to American history, though perhaps the principles still apply.  God made a specific covenant with the Israelites, a large part of which is set out in Leviticus.  He promised them that He would do certain things for them, such as bless them and protect them from their enemies, if they would do certain things for Him, such as keep His commandments.  He further promised that, if they did not, certain consequences would follow, becoming progressively more severe the less they repented.  The prophets are documentation that the promises of Leviticus came true, pretty much exactly as God had promised.  By the end of Jeremiah, only a very small, poor, desperate band of people were left in Canaan, the promised land.  All the rest had been killed or dragged off to Babylon.  By contrast, there is no such covenant between God and America.  It is true that most of the founders of America were Christian, but Im not sure that fact, in itself, is any more significant than that they were also mostly of British stock.  From both traditions---Christian and British---they drew inspirations for designing their new nation-state.  But there is certainly no covenant relationship between God and Americans, as there was between God and the Israelites.    In my opinion, that means that the usual doom-and-gloom predictions by Christians are a bit off base.  It may well be that approval of homosexuality is a bad thing for this country, or any other country, and that approval will lead to bad consequences.  But we Christians must be careful and judicious in our use of the scripture, and not make it fit where it doesnt fit.  There are plenty of reasons to oppose homosexuality, divorce, immorality, and the killing of the unborn, but claiming that Gods judgment will fall on us as it did the ancient Israelites is putting words in Gods mouth."
2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Way back at the beginning of the year, I was challenged to read the Bible through. That's something I've done before, but not in a while. So I took up the challenge, the plan being to alternate books between the Old and New Testaments. I've often pondered why God arranged the beginning of the Bible as He did...one interesting book (Genesis) followed by about four of the most boring books in the entire Bible. Surely more than a few interested people have given up Bible-reading in despair, caught in the biblical Valley of Death?    I just finished Leviticus, which in my opinion is the most boring of all the boring Bible books. However, the reading was not without benefit. I've also been studying Jeremiah on Sunday mornings, and I happened on some intriguing connections between them.    Leviticus is the third book of the Pentateuch, and sets out most of the Law for the Israelites. Most of its chapters deal with ceremonial rituals and laws of personal relationship, along with health and sanitary rules, rules of warfare, and so on. For instance, the conditions for leprosy are spelled out exactly in Leviticus 13. If a man finds a bright white spot on his body, he must show it to the priest. If the hair has turned white and the mark appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy, but if it appears otherwise, the priest shall isolate the man for up to 14 days, after which if the mark doesn't fit the definition of leprosy, the man shall be declared clean. If there is a boil on the skin, and the boil is white or reddish-white, the priest shall look at it...     It must've been exciting, to be a priest back in the old days. That is not, however, my point. At the end of Leviticus, in chapter 26, God tells them what will happen if they disobey Him and do not repent. Among other things, He promises that enemies will attack them and they will not be able to defend themselves. He promises that food will be short, and that indeed they will be forced to cannibalism of their own children. He assures them that, should they yet be unrepentant, He will scatter them abroad, and make their land desolate.     Now, to Jeremiah. Jeremiah was written a good many centuries after the giving of the Law. By the time the prophet Jeremiah wrote his book, Israel had been a nation for several hundred years, had split into two, and had (both parts) sunk deep into idolatry, with only ocassional lip-service to Yahweh God. And so God sent Jeremiah, along with many other prophets, to warn them to repent. Although by the time that Jeremiah was speaking, the chance for repentance had passed. He promised his listeners that the promises of God from Leviticus were about to come true.    What struck me, reading Leviticus, was how closely the pre-Exilic and Exilic writings parallel what Leviticus promised, among them Jeremiah. God promised that the people---as a nation---would be destroyed, and they were. He said they'd be scattered among the nations, and they were. He said the land would enjoy its sabbath rest (they were supposed to let the fields rest every seven years, which they never did), and it did (because there was no one, or few people, left to farm it). God made specific promises of what would happen, conditional on other things happening (the Israelites' constant, unrepenting sin), and those things did in fact happen.    I'm trying to avoid posting very long entries, a common occurrence given that I am somewhat long-winded. So I shall post part two of this tomorrow, which is a consideration of the parallels, if any, between ancient Israel and America."

2IWJ4SX,male,24,"This is the description of a seminar I am registering to take next fall entitled  Constitutional Design .

Happily he incorporates secession into this class.  Though this prof. is fairly liberal, he is very thoughtful and measured in his observations and recommendations.

Accordingly, this is actually a study in current events.   Course Description:   This seminar will look at various issues that arise when one tries to design a constitution from scratch (rather than interpret one that is already in being). One might begin with the question of  who gets to design a constitution in the first place , and with what legitimacy. And  how is the handiwork of the constitutional designers turned into a ""real"" constitution, i.e., accepted as the basic framework ? This raises the question of ratification procedures. Of course most of the attention will be focused on classic issues, most of them structural: What should the election system look like, and why? Parliamentary or presidential system?   What should the judiciary look like [currently very important!]  (e.g., life tenure, appointment process, control over docket, etc.)?  Under what circumstances is  federalism  a desirable constitutional system , with what ramifications? (E.g., should the constitution mention the possibility of secession?) Should there be an explicit ""Bill of Rights"" and, if so, what form should it take? Should a constitution include ""positive"" welfare rights? Should a constitution countenance its own ""suspension"" during a time of emergency? We will look at a variety of constitutions from around the world, including the newly drafted Iraqi constitution, as well as political science and law review literature relevant to the issues raised. [emphasis added] So, if I find that I have squandered my legal education on a buch of pie-in-the-sky theory courses and can't find a real job, at least when selling the product of my  urlLink fine liberal arts education , I'll always be able to respond:  ""Do you want a constitution with that?"""
2IWJ4SX,male,24,"A secular world that ratifies homosexual marriage would provide a legal foundation that would open the floodgates to civil litigation against religious leaders, institutions and worshipers. In such an environment, churches might be sued for declining to provide their sanctuaries for gay marriages, for example. Ministers could be sued for hate speech for giving a sermon on moral behavior. Churches that protest homosexual unions could face revocation of their tax exemption status. The delicate balance between church and state . . . is teetering on a high ledge at this moment. It's ironic that those who oppose churches' involvement in state concerns nonetheless have no compunction when it comes to the state dictating what churches can do. Even nonreligious folk should be concerned. Either we believe in separation of church and state or we don't, but you can't have it both ways. The July 12 debate is really a discussion about 'cloture' -- the process by which the Senate puts a time limit on filibuster, thereby allowing a bill to be voted on. In this case, 60 senators have to vote in favor of cloture for the Federal Marriage Amendment, defining marriage as between one man and one woman, to go to the floor for a full vote. Many senators prefer to delay voting rather than make their position public before the November election. But advocates for the amendment predict that November may be too late, that if President George W. Bush loses re-election, the amendment will be dead and marriage as we know it will be history.  --Kathleen Parker"
2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Missouri citizens just passed a state constitutional amendment forbidding gay marriage (federalism at work) and, according to the blog  urlLink ScrappleFace , judges are vying for the opportunity to be the first to strike it down.  Life as a tyrant must be nice!"
2IWJ4SX,male,24,"Here is the Hatch alternative to the currently popular Allard/Musgrave FMA: ""Civil marriage shall be defined in each state by the legislature or the citizens thereof. Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to require that marriage or its benefits be extended to any other union than that of a man and a woman.""   This language will most certainly be the alternative that most Dems and squeamish Reps will turn to.  While I like the idea of federalism and state sovereignty on issues that pertain to the family, I also believe the Union was conceived in the first place in order to achieve a degree of uniformity on issues where divergence among the fifty states' laws would work more ill than good.  Imagine the effect of 50 differing definitions of marriage in our highly mobile society.  Those that are married would be discouraged from relocating to other locales for fear their marriage would not receive legal protection, and those couples considering marriage could choose to forgo marriage altogether.  Also, the ill effects of further diluting the fundamental unit of society, the family, would certainly not be confined to those states that choose to recognize same-sex marriage; the impact would be nation-wide.  If any law is deserving of national uniformity, this is it.  (I note that though presently all states do define their own marriages, the overall definition is uniform.  What we are facing is a vast incongruence in the definition, the like of which we have not seen since the days of the southern bans on interracial marriage.)  I favor the Allard/Musgrave FMA as a way to achieve uniformity on an issue where I believe uniformity--and especially uniformity in accordance with what is best for society--is necessary.  To me, gays don't want recognition of same-sex marriage so they can show their partner how much they love them, or whatever.  No, they just want popular approval for their sinful lifestyle.  I don't think we should give it to them.  If you still aren't sure why law should only recognize the traditional definition of marriage, see Prof. J. Budziszewski  urlLink here ."

THWVU51,male,25,"Well it is Sunday.  Or at least it was.  It is after midnight so I guess that makes it Monday.  Regardless, it is Sunday so we can all guess what kind of mood I'm in.  You'd think I would be able to get over this whole ""life is pointless"" thing by now.  How did I ever end up this way?  If poor self-image and depression were strictly the result of environment then I probably wouldn't be in this state.  I  think it really comes down to letting go.  Letting go of negative thoughts, memories, traits and images.  That's easier said than done of course.  But I still let things that happened when I was 3 years old bother me.  You know, I kick and I scratch and I fight everyday to take some semblence of positivity away.  And yet at the end of the week it is inevitably lost to some unknown force that seems hell bent on ruining me.  Then again, perhaps it is not so unknown.  I would dare say it's me.  It has always been me sabotaging my own efforts to improve and progress.  I also don't understand why I always make entries like this one.  Yeesh.  You'd think I could write something light hearted and fancy free for once.  I am capable of that with some effort.  When did this become a tome to my self-loathing???  Time to go to bed, hopefully to not ponder any further questions of major severity.  Wishful thinking I imagine."
THWVU51,male,25,"Wow I can't believe I haven't written anything all week.  I suppose I should be changing the date and time on these as it seems it is never correct.  For example it is now Thursday Oct. 16, 2003 at 4:00am, I'm sure it'll say something different after I finish posting.  I cannot sleep.  I do not know why I cannot sleep, but I couldn't even settle my mind or body for more than a minute whilst attempting to sleep so I thought perhaps I would come on here type something out then try it again.  Type what out I'm not entirely sure.  My night at work just plain sucked.  There's no good reason for that it just did, the last part of it anyway.  I have been letting that bother me, among other things.  As I constantly do, I allow past events to bother me...making up hypothetical ""if I had done this"" situations in my head thinking about past events that I can't possibly go back and change.  And even if I could the likelihood of them happening the same way again are very good.  I have met someone that I believe intrigues me.  Whether or not this person is interested in me even for friendship is uncertain.  However there is something interesting to me about a person who pays no attention to politics and doesn't watch The Simpsons.  I never said this intrigue was a good thing.  But maybe it is, who knows...it seems that once again my old arch nemesis Time will be the deciding factor.  Damn you Time, you've won again!!!  If time is of the essence.  Then wouldn't the present be of the convalesance (can't spell that word)??"
THWVU51,male,25,"Have you ever recieved news and for some reason didn't react the way you believed you should have.  It's an odd feeling isn't it.  I was told something today which I suppose I should be angry about but I'm not.  I'm not sure how I'm feeling about it.  So yeah...unfortunately my mood from the weekend has kept me from many things so far this week.  In fact I have done absolutely nothing with my vacation time so far.  In fact I have barely even left the house save for the occasional jaunt out to the deck.  It seems like any control I had over my thoughts or direction has flown away....and I'm waiting for Charleton Heston to show up and shoot it down for me.  Is he even still alive?  The old bastard.  I hate not knowing what to do.  I hate that I've never had any goals.  I hate that I don't know what makes me happy.  Haha...well it seems I've gone back to the ole whining about my mental problems.  It's the old stand by when there's nothing else to talk about since I've shut myself indoors all week.  Which I'm sure is a metaphor for how I handle life...shutting in, never going out...getting carpal tunnel from sitting at the computer too long.  Well, scratch the last one.

""Yeah and now I'm runnin' down this camp town drive, with your laughter in my head, and I'll have to block it out some how to survive.  Cause those dreams a dre dead, and I'm alive""   That's from a very very good Jackson Browne song called ""I'm Alive""...taken out of context that sounds really depressing eh.  Of course I think I have the camp town drive part wrong I'm not sure what kind of drive he says he's going down.  Rest assured that drive is correct though.  I mean, really probably the most depressing song for me to hear is Duncan Sheik's ""Reasons for Living"" which is a song that I usually only listen to if I feel an overwhelming need to cry...and please keep in mind that crying can be cathartic is doesn't have to be a bad thing.  ""Even my wonder, even my fear.  Only amount to a couple of tears.  There is a rythm, it's near and it's far and it goes to the heart of us.  It's already in you, it's already there.

THWVU51,male,25,"I have have taken that right turn at Albequerque    I can't spell that word for the life of me, and I don't care.  I was thinking tonight about how I got here.  I mean to this time in my life.  I wonder if in some alternate universe I made all the right decisions and am living happily, without despair.  And hopefully with Elijah Wood.  If indeed the theory is true that all things that can happen do happen.  Which if you really put some though into that means that in some other realities I am probably dead, in others I am living and happy, maybe in others I'm still closeted and engaged to a woman.

THWVU51,male,25,"I would like to start this blog by pointing out that my friend Laura is not nearly as bad a speller as she appeared to be in the comment she left after my last entry.  In fact she is intelligent, beautiful, and all other nice things you could ever say about one person.  Having said that however, let me add this special note to her: ""Seriously were you drunk or something when you wrote that???  I think we need to have an intervention.""  Ahem...so yes...I have invented a few terms in my day.  Wait, did I talk about ""Queek"" already???  I can't remember if I did.  That is the term referring to a queer geek of course.  Which thusly is a term I can use to refer to myself.    So it was just Sunday, and I'm not in an utterly terrible mood.  Although I was a while ago, and there's no telling how I'll feel when I go to bed and the sound of my brain kicks in.  Damn brain.  I believe that my own thoughts drive me nuts, but if I tried to share these thoughts, or if someone were reading my mind all they would hear is ""AFLAC!!"" I'm not actually sure what that joke implies or if it's even funny.  Well I tried at least.  I think it's about time I went to bed.  It's another week.  More potential for change.

THWVU51,male,25,"Wow I honestly hadn't realised how long it has been since I've posted anything.  The crying remark is now funny due to something that happened earlier today.

Well anyways my Christmas spirit is about as good as it gets despite my current financial problems.  I can't do any shopping until the 18th, and probably will need to finish on the 24th.  My January rent is going to be sooooo late, but I am also moving out of that apartment at the end of January.  Yes I gave my notice, so now another thing I will have to decide is what to do with myself come that time.  These things will probably be discussed at the parents tomorrow.  Ah, it has been a very bad day.  Things aren't so bad at the moment.  But the day won't be over for another 90 minutes or so, so anything can happen I guess."
THWVU51,male,25,"I have been playing around with the features on this thing.  Here's hoping I didn't somehow wipe out my whole history.  Mind you would that really be any big loss.  It's not like I'm changing the world here.  The argument that this provides some form of catharsis for me is also a rather specious one.  I'm not even sure what I want to write about.  This week does not seem to be going my way, for whatever reason.  Mind you my state of mind is akin to a porcelain vaise on a thin table in the middle of a huge party.  ie; it's very precarious.  Prescription drugs or no, I still seem to be tottering between positive lucidity and my always popular frigid dark of complacency.  Hmmm I like that...frigid dark of complacency.  I'm goint to remember that one.  I'm at a loss right now.  Ummm...well I finally finished my handwritten journal.  It took me long enough.  It was started in November 2000 for chrissake, but I took a few long lay offs from it.  Still it's interesting to read back on some of that stuff.  Now I just need to fill up the other 3, or is it 4 books i have waiting in the wings.  Mind you, I can still remember the emotions around many of those entries.  Any entry involving say...the name Trevor tends to make me very angry.  Entries involving Christmas tend to brighten my perspective.  The end of a year entries make me feel hopeless.  The really old entries cause me to reminiss (sp?).  It's odd how for some reason I want to be locked back into the time of living in the crack house.  For those of you who don't know, the crack house was just the run down place that was my first apartment.  I do miss those days.  I even have CD's that remind me specifically of that time in my life.  It's not that I'm living in the past per say.  More like I am not willing to let go of that time, those people, and those experiences.  I guess that's pretty pathetic.  Pathetic might be a bit harsh.  But as we all know I don't really give myself breaks.  Especially since I don't deserve them.  Ho ho ho I'm not in a good frame of mind right now.  That means it's time for bed."

According to their personality test I am a Mastermind(Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker).  I am 48% sexy, which is giving me credit I think.  And I will have sex with 28 people in my life.  I'm curious as to what their definition of ""sex"" is.  Because the number of partners I have had varies depending on that....and I very much doubt I would have ""sex"" with 28 people in my life.

THWVU51,male,25,"Let's play a little game shall we?  I have been making tallies of a couple of different things over the past few days at work.  Your job will be to guess the acromym for what I have been observing.  I am not giving any hints right now.  However you can ask for one through email, or post a message.  However you must ask it in a form such as ""are any of the words not english?"" or something to that affect.  It's sort of a Front Page challenge thing.  The first 2 days I only did the 1st group the OGG.  So here are the stats.  Fri. shift: 4pm-12 OGG=17  Sat. shift: 11-5 OGG=34  Mon. shift 3-12 OGG=30                 GLB=61  Wed. shift 630am-12 OGG=1                     GLB=14  Thurs. shift 10-5 OGG=15                   GLB=32  Now I will say this much; The two groups can potentially relate, and the may be counted in more than one category.  Meaning that when I tally something as an OGG, I may also tally it as a GLB although that's only happened a couple times.  Notice that the time of day also has an affect on the stats, and that Saturdays number of OGG's was highest.  So...guess the acromym, play along, it'll be fun :) For me at least.

THWVU51,male,25,"It's always funny how the strangest things upset you.  Unfortunately of late, in the past couple of days anyway, I have been more open to negative thoughts than I have been.  This is not a good thing.  The last thing I need is to get depressed before Christmas, since I usually have alot of trouble getting through the season without feeling sad that Christmas is over, or feeling trepidations over the pointless year to come.  It is also funny to realise what a tenuous hold you have on things.  I probably could have gone to bed happy tonight, but I saw one thing and now happiness will not occur until the bliss of sleep has taken me.  Oh how I hate my waking hours.  I don't even think falling in love could cure that (no, I am not falling in love that's just an example).  And yet I am aware of many things.  The joy that I have been feeling can remain if I stay positive and follow the course of treatment.  I also realise that if I fail this time at ridding myself of such negative thoughts and emotions, I probably won't get another shot at it.  I will never be able to articulate exactly what it's like in my head.  I don't think I would want to either.  Nobody needs to know that stuff.

And then I go to foolish things such as get taken in by sweet words from someone who has about as much relevant things to say as Colin Powell.  Why oh why???  I should know better than that, I can see right through the language and I knew what he wanted.  He just wanted company, and he still does.  Not relationship company he just wants someone to cuddle with.  Which is fine, everyone wants companionship and everyone expresses that in there own way.  Now personally, I like to be able to have a conversation with the other person.  That's just me.  And then my weakness kicked in...because I am lonely...and so long story short (pardon the pun) I have officially seen an 8.5 inch penis.  Please tell me Signa that you did not give this URL to Mom and Dad.  That would be quite traumatising.  So as usual, I am now who knows how far behind in school.  And I don't seem to care much.  There is so much red tape and politics going on with the school paper that I just want to let it die.  It's not really worth it, I'm not even sure what I am going to writing in it this year.  The co-editor has suggested that maybe I should do something about depression...write what you know as it were.  And that's probably not a bad idea.

Or Johnny Depp and uber-hottie Orlando Bloom in Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl.  As long as it's good summer fare I care not.  I am hardly expecting a cinematic masterpiece.  I mean hey, a movie like Demolition Man is only made once in a lifetime.  How that got shut out at the Oscars I have no idea.  Speaking of terrible movies.

THWVU51,male,25,"As Nat said, ""this blog is far too self-depricating"".  Well that it is my friends.  Which never seems to be my intention, but does always seem to be the result.  So is this one going to be different?  Not as far as I know.  But we'll see how it ends shall we?  One of the reasons I guess I have been so slack when it comes to unpacking is as follows;  I don't like to be reminded of what my life is.  Or for that matter who I am.  I don't like to be reminded of my uselessness.  Even though I go to bed every night and tell myself I am useless regardless.  So I know, if I feel I am unaccomplished I should go out and do somethign about it.  Well, things are not that easy.  Or maybe they are.  It's not like I have tried anything.  I realise this Blog tends to get more personal than I ever meant it to be.  I suppose that's because I have a hard time talking about this stuff with even my best friends face to face.  Not that I necessarily want to.  But at least this way if you want to know the inner workings of my mind you may occasionally catch a glimpse.  It's hardly Babylon I know.  If only the things that other people saw in me were actually there.  What a person that would make me.  But nobody can live life in ""if only's"".  ""If Only's"" are basically regrets.  But also, in a way, we all need to have our regrets.  Do I ever make any sense???  Am I even capable of making sense???  Can I ever use less than three question marks???"
THWVU51,male,25,"You know it's a week since the last entry and although there were lots of ups in the past week I am right back to where I was.  It is an inevitability of being me I guess, I'll always come full circle, especially where the circles origin is negative feeling.  I'm not making any sense.  Sometimes I get the feeling that I never do, my way of thinking doesn't seem to fit within the reality of the world that we actually exist in.  Not to mention the people who inhabit said world.  I care but I don't.  I'm not sure whether to think of it as apathy, or as a form of hypocrisy.  I want to be better, to get better.  But I am either unwilling or incapable of making necessary changes.  Malaise forever.  I went to bed last night at...hmmm...I'd say 3:30am, although didn't fall asleep until 5 at least.  And despite getting up for a couple bathroom breaks, and missing 2 appointments in the process I stayed in bed until 6pm.  Really I didn't even want to get up then.  I didn't feel bad or anything until after this...That's the problem.  I hate it when I stay in bed all day, but I still don't get up.  And negative feelings are an unavoidable result of this.  It's the same as when I have a one night stand, or brief relationship, I know I'm going to feel guilty afterward but I do it anyway.  Do I really hate myself that much?  I guess I would have to say I do.  Although I'm not sure what I did to deserve the hatred.  Maybe it's more things I haven't done, or that I should have done.  A lot of my self-deprecation is to keep people at a distance.  It doesn't work most of the time, it just makes people more interested in me.  At least it roots out all the shallow people.  Right now there are three people who are interested in me in some way.  Two are in the navy, one of whom is out at sea the other who is French-Canadian.  The other is a cute Taiwanese student at Acadia.  Now as of right now, I am not interested in any of these people.  I'm not even sure if I want to be friends with any of them.  Two of them seem a little needy, and the other one seems like a whore.  Two I would have problems communicating with, and two likely lack the kind of intelligence I require in a person.  Such is that situation.  We'll see how it plays out I guess.  I still miss ""fellow"".  He still isn't talking to me, but I guess it's really showing me what kind of person he is.

It's my own fault I feel so inadequate compared to other people; That I feel so unworthy.  It is this attitude that I need to change, because I'll never be happy unless I figure out a way to do it.    Sometimes perhaps I place too much emphasis on the feeling I get when I look into someones eyes.  However I really do believe that in most cases I can tell if there's a connection with a person through eye contact, coupled of course with some other factors.  I don't know what on earth I'm talking about, or what I even want to say.  God I just wish I could get my head together.  I just wish I could be the person, be the things that, at least in an alternate universe I am capable of being.  I know I've got potential.  But potential is nothing.  Potential doesn't bring happiness."
THWVU51,male,25,"Get this people I was actually in bed tonight before 1am.  And I don't work tomorrow until 4pm.  That's a rather odd thing to happen.  Of course now it's 1:45am and I have come in here to write and entry on ye ole blog.  Aside from it being Sunday, which seems to be my main update day.  I suppose I was prompted by a couple of things I was reading in bed.  I was reading my book ""Disturbance"" by Jaimie O'Neill, who also wrote ""At Swim, Two Boys"" which I can't possibly rave about enough.  The other was a letter I came accross on a day where I actually unpacked a little.  I found it a while ago but haven't bothered to read it.  I know what it says.  I suppose I didn't want to read it due to how utterly complimentary toward me it is.  And as we know I am not a huge fan of a compliment directed at me.  The letter I recieved last year as a result of the writing I did for the school paper at MSVU.  Sure the guy is probably a crack-pot.  That certainly remains my opinion.  Especially considering his high praise for someone whose grammar skills are  elementary school level at best.  However at the heart of it is the real question.  Am I a good writer??  Aside from my poor grammar of course.  Could I become a good writer??  What would I write about??  What is my voice??  My cat Agatha just spontaneously looked up at me and now wants pets.  I often wonder about animals and the way they read me.  Especially after a certain incident with my now deceased cat Spooky that happened a few years back.  Animals just seem to have that sense.  Truly amazing if you think about it.  Anyhow I have lost focus on this.  I am not sure if any of the questions above are meant as anything besides rhetorical.  But if you feel like answering I'll listen.   urlLink   That's me...although perhaps I will take up this offer to try out the google mail.  Tell me if I should do that too."
THWVU51,male,25,"First things first.  How did I ever live without the song ""Shiny Disco Balls""???  I simply can't imagine life without it now.  I haven't felt this way since ""Finally"" by Cece Peniston. Has anyone ever noticed that she has penis in her last name??  Anyways....so yeah the past 24 hours have been a ride that would rival any rollercoaster.  Highs and lows, loops and spirals.  Anxiety, fun, contentment, anger, frustration, calm, serenity, rage....it's all been there and more.  Why??  I guess I'm just getting my hopes up, because something felt right.  But I shouldn't be too optimistic.  In fact in my experience it never pays for me to be optimistic because the feeling gets destroyed so easily.  For example I can even predict this behavior.  I said to my boss this morning, ""I'm in a great mood, do you want to place a bet on what's gonna ruin it??"".  Something always happens to ruin my good mood somehow...Today I made such an ignorant mistake and it's eating me up inside but I can't put it out of my mind.  Some of my co-workers have been trying to figure out what annoys me.  And if they ever read this site I'm about to give it away.    I HATE MAKING MISTAKES!!!!  Even small ones, I can't stand it.  Especially at work because I know my job so well, it shouldn't matter if I don't sleep at all the night before a shift I shouldn't make stupid mistakes.  But I do, and it's annoying.  Fucking hell!!  I'm gonna head for a nap."
THWVU51,male,25,"Speaking of DVD's, why is the stuff I want so damned expensive.  I mean, hello, the Star Trek series dvd's are like $150 per season.  Plus I would love to get all of the Dr. Who stuff.  I need to find a way to make some money.  It's a shame I know nothing about html programming, otherwise I could just start a crummy porn site and get cash from silly horny people who buy memberships without thinking with the upper brain.  Hmmm that's got me thinking.  There is much to do.  Or actually not do, but I'm trying to make you think I am doing it.  I suppose I'm ruining it by telling you.  Oh well."
THWVU51,male,25,"So I'm listening to a cheesy song.  Well that's what I'm doing now.  Before I was reading the great book I got for Christmas; 'At Swim, Two Boys' by Jaimie O'Neill.  It's a hard read for me, not just because there seem to be so many words that I don't understand.  But moreso on my own psyche it's pretty difficult.  If the end of the book isn't what I'm hoping it will be I'll be very upset.  And the other main thing that bothers me, is that the book is so romantic and beautiful, and it makes me realise that I have never experienced anything of the sort in my life.  And I really don't expect I ever will.  Now if I were to play the blame game, I would probably place my wish to fall in love and have a great romance on my friend Natalie.  Sorry, N-Babe...I'm not saying this is a bad thing but I wonder sometimes if I would actually be bothered by loves abscence if it weren't for the queen of romance herself.  As I have alluded to before I consider myself to be a big ole puzzle.  The big piece in the middle that is missing is my love and my soulmate, and everything will fall into place around that if only I could find it.  And yet, it doesn't seem like it will fit perfectly even if I do find it.  On top of this stuff a customer called me ugly today.  On top of that I made a couple of judgement errors Friday night, so now I am left desperately trying to hold onto any remnant of positive mood.  As anyone knows nothing quite bothers me like making a mistake.  Ugly??  Imagine that, eh.  I mean, I think I'm unattractive, but ugly my be a tad harsh.  Certainly if you go more than skin deep I might be construed as being ugly.  Mind you in that sense I could also be construed as being beautiful.  I am nothing if not empathetic, I try my best and sometimes how much I care for others can affect me negatively.  In case any of you wonder why I don't show my empathy much that would be why.  But when it comes to myself I don't allow much 'self-pathy'.  I'm not sure if there is a word for empathy of the self.  I don't give myself a break.  I care very little for myself and my value.  In fact I value myself alot less than I am sure most of you would begin to think I do.  So you ask the question, am I depressed?  I would say no.  This is the way I live my life, constantly in this purgatorey of mood, I am neither here nor there but I am more likely to fall then to ascend.  So it goes."
THWVU51,male,25,"I am so weak, once again succumbing to that which will bring inevitable misery.  What am I thinking??  Why??  If I know what it will do to me why do it??  The last thing I need at the moment is stupid things like this.  I'm missing classes, not getting organised...I'm gonna be so screwed by the end of the month.    My visit to the clinic at the Abbey Lane is on the 26th...which I have been thinking all this time is a Monday, but it's actually a Friday which means I had better get the time off work in the morning, otherwise I'll probably be working...and I can't afford to miss any work.  And I certainly can't afford to miss this appointment.  Ah well it should work out.  Anyhow I had best go off to bed.  I must get sleep so I can get up and make up for the jack and shit that I did today.  Indeed I need to make up for alot of things, and not just lost time."
THWVU51,male,25,"Let's see now, what time is it?  Ah yes, 4:42pm, and I have been out of bed now for about, well 42 minutes.  I have got to do something about these destructive sleeping habits.  Of course I say that, but I'm not actually going to so I suppose it's a moot point.  It is not like there's anything terribly interesting going on at night.  I usually just sit at the computer, hang out in the chat room, surf around.  Not very exciting stuff.  I really should hang out in the tv room and watch Conan, I haven't watched him in a long time.  I need to finish getting ready so I can go meet up with Laura.  I feel bad because I am not in the mood to spend time outside, and that's what she wants to do.  If it were cloudy and dank I'd be all for it.  I'm not one of those people who gets all cheerful and empowered over the sunshine and warmth.  As usual I am the opposite.  I don't like being outside under the sun and the blue sky anymore, because it is beautiful, and I am not."
THWVU51,male,25,"Thank you everyone for your outcries of support.  But as I believe I wrote(I'm too lazy to go check) I did not write that blog because I was looking for support or sympathy.  Regardless thank you for showing you care.  But let it go, I was in a pretty horrid mood that night.  I suppose I still am, and yes I am afflicted with this condition and have yet to find a way to cure it or aleviate it.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up.  Because I know that if I stop trying to make myself better...sometime down the road, I won't be around.  That's not meant to sounds grim but it's the truth.  So anyways....yeah...don't stop caring, but I'll be fine."
THWVU51,male,25,"I still have no power.  But I'm sure it'll be coming soon.  And yes once again I could allude to the fact that not having power can be taken in more than one way...but once again let us go for the literal sense.    I cast a magic spell to allow myself this brief time to update my blog.  Indeed I am a powerful sorceror, conjuror if you will.  They call me Granger the master of Gray Magic.  At least they do in my head.  Damn I just realised that I need a number that I left at the apartment...I also have no phone service...and I should probably call and confirm the appointment that I have on Monday...oops...oh well there's still time.  Anyhow gotta go for now...yes yes...but I'll be back....yesss precious....I'll be back."
THWVU51,male,25,"Are you happy my friend, who's name starts with a D, ends with an S and has alla in the middle?  That means nothing it's late and I don't know what I'm talking about.  Are you sure I'm not Fugly??"
THWVU51,male,25,"It has occurred to me over the past couple of days that I love music.  This is hardly an epiphany, but it is funny how I don't listen to much music when I'm feeling down.  A special friend of mine who happens to be named after a city in the fine state of Texas made a CD for me which helped remind me of that.  I am currently listening to a CD of my own ecclectic taste...and It's putting a smile on my face.  So the next step is to try to make a CD for this friend of mine.  Turnabout is fairplay after all.  I finally had the talk with the parents about leaving school.  They weren't upset at all, except when I alluded to things I'm sure they didn't want to hear about.  So I didn't continue that line of the conversation.  Really I don't think my parents have to hear all about my inner pain to be able to feel compassion for me.  Indeed the last thing a parent wants to hear is that one of their children hates being alive, and has wanted to die for a long time.  And thusly I will not say these words to them.  But rather just make sure that they understand that the inner workings of my mind are not all smiles and sunshine.  But of course they only want me to get better, and they support my decision to leave school for the time being.  And obviously support my getting help, and also wish to help any way they possibly can.  I am blessed to have the family I have, I truly am, and I know it's what keeps me here.  So I have pretty much decided that I have a major crush on this guy that I met.  The problem is that I haven't heard tell of him in a week and I am starting to become paranoid.  This is the problem that comes hand in hand with feeling better.  When I am depressed I don't mind being alone at all.  However when I emerge from that I really want to find someone...then the question becomes ""do I actually like this guy, or am I just desperate.""  I honestly don't know.  I want to find that out, but I can't do that if he's avoiding me or not interested in talking to me anymore.  I am very confused by this current situation, and bothered as well.  I mean, I want to see him and talk to him so much I even went to NRG briefly on Friday night hoping he would be there...and for those of you who know me....You know what a big deal that is!!  Haha, I'm being such a silly boy...it's pathetic, but cute and funny at the same time so I guess all I can do is smile and try not to focus on it too much."
THWVU51,male,25,"And for the record, I don't give a rat's ass about my spelling and grammar mistakes.  This isn't a forum where that is really necessary.  I'll fuckin' screw up my sentences all I damn well please.  And that ain't not bad.  I ain't not a dorkus, and so on."
THWVU51,male,25,"Well tonight was speed dating.  As you may recall that was supposed to happen back in April but didn't due to lack of interested parties.  This time around there were enough people signed up, but very few came.  Five to be precise.  So needless to say it didn't go ahead, but I did sit with these people and talked for a few hours.  I had a good time.  Plus the goal was accomplished; That being the going out and meeting strangers in a public setting.  Take that social anxiety!!  Although my somewhat lack of social skill did allow me to make a fool of myself a couple times.  Or so I believe.  I didn't mean to talk as much, or as openly about myself as I did.  Oh well I can't take it back so there's no point dwelling on that.  I also won a coupon for a free brunch at Vortex.  I believe I will enjoy that.  There is a display of art there by Trevor VanDen...ummm....spelling this wrong but here goes....VanDeneiyden...I don't think I'm even close.  Very interesting pictures, some including hot boys, and one including  ""fellow"" as he is referred to in this blog.  For those who don't know ""fellow"" is the last person I dated for any amount of time, and I am still left with some unresolved feelings over the whole situation.  The picture makes me smile.  I wish it didn't but it does.  I was always smiling when I looked at him.  Oh well.  So now I end up dating yet another nice guy who doesn't seem to give a shit about me.  But not in a bad way.  More of just an impartial way, as though, it's good that I'm there.  But it wouldn't make a lot of difference if I weren't.  My priorities are all wrong I know.  I don't know why I feel this need to be in a relationship.  Or why I seem to think it is the link in the chain of my life that is keeping everything from coming together.  Wow that metaphor was terrible.  The one thing I have always wanted is to stay up all night talking to someone...just talking...perhaps walking on the waterfront when it's later, and quiet.  I've never really done that with anyone.  Well I walked along the waterfront with that professor from SMU that time, but there was no relationship like intent there.  But i have definately never stayed up all night talking to a guy about life, or even generic things like music or movies or what have you.  I don't want to work tomorrow.  And I have this rather strange pain in my right pectoral area...I'm not sure what's causing it.  Perhaps it will flare up and I'll have to go home early.  I'm not sure why I'm hoping for such a selfish thing.  I suppose because it's much more likely that I will be injured and sent home from work then something more selfless, like world peace.  World peace???  Talk about pipe dreams.  Alright enough rambling for now.  I guess I am trying to make up for a lack of updates with a long entry.  Well if you read it, then good for you.  Your attention span is much higher than mine."
THWVU51,male,25,"I guess it was time for a change.  That's the kind of thing I have been telling myself for a long time.  Time for a change.  ""Farewell to the Old me"", as they say...or at least my favourite singer/songwriter Dar Williams says in a song of the same name from most recent CD, ""The Beauty of The Rain"".  Now I praddle on.  My ex was in twon on Friday night and dragged me out to NRG.  It's not that I had a bad time, but if I'm not dancing I get really uncomfortable, and since there was nothing at all played that Iwanted to dance to I was left to be uncomfortable.  That not withstanding my ex prancing around like he was the Queen of Siam.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  But thanks to Dallas who allowed me to keep from freaking out and being utterly miserable while I was there.  There were some other friends of mine there but they were drunk, so it's not quite the same as when they are sober and can relate to me.  Plus they were tickling me, which as everyone knows ticks me off.  So I actually put my friend Woody in an arm bar breifly.  That was amusing, he was quite surprised that I did it actually.  But hey, as much as my inferiority complex argues otherwise...I am full of surprises.  Or maybe it's full of shit, one of those two anyways."
THWVU51,male,25,"I am supposed to go to lunch with my friend Michelle today...Well it's technically Sunday at 2:55am...Later today.  I mean, I will go to lunch with her I forget when she said she was going to call though so I'll have to get up and get ready around noon.  No sleeping in for me, plus I have to come home to put the ham in the oven.  Some of few are probably snickering at that.  Get your minds out of the gutter you perverts!!!  Someone wrote to me; ""Happy VD Dane"".  To which I reply, ""Happy Venerial Disease what the hell kind of friend are you?  You know I'm very sensitive about my STD's.""  I know it's a bad joke.  I don't have any STD's for the record.  I don't know what I want to write about.  I am surprisingly stunned by something I was watching on TV.  And despite the obvious social message it is delivering I think I was more affected by how useless the teenage girl was.  I mean, she enters into a competition where you have to kill the other contestants but she does jack shit besides get beaten to death by an old man.  Jeez.  Pathetic.  And yet very disturbing because her family and boyfriend watched it happen.  It was called ""Series 7"" or something to that affect.  Anyways interesting....I also caught the tale end of John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars"".  That was much less interesting.  So...""Fellow"" has reappeared on my MSN list.  I suppose he's expecting me to be all excited and message away.  I don't think I'll do that.  Don't get me wrong, I do really want to talk to him and everything.  But I want to know if he actually wants to talk to me.  The only vibe I ever got from him was that he was using me for something and didn't really give a shit about me.  And the fact that he would ignore me over so small a thing really points to him just needing any excuse to remove me from his life.  As if moving to another province wouldn't do it??  Anyways...I the I am going to go listen to ABBA or something.  Ain't got nothin' better to do until the morning comes."
THWVU51,male,25,"Some one explain to me what the hell just happened.  I was innocently searching for jobs, when all of a sudded the life was sucked out of me.  I have been in a good mood.  But it has floated away, as though it was only a vestige that had briefly taken refuge within my mind.  I need to get a new job, or a second job.  But what am I going to get.  I am not qualified for anything really, and potential employers don't look at how capable you are to do a certain job.  I like that sentence because at least it implies I do believe I am capable of something.  I try so hard to be able to help others through their insecurities.  It's hard for me to do it, having plenty of my own to deal with.  But that gives me a good insight on what other people have to work with.  Which is why I can safely tell people to pull their heads out of their asses and smell the fresh air.  Guess what folks??  You've got talents.  How unfortunate for you that you can't live in this dream world where you are useless, and going nowhere.  That world doesn't exist.  You live in the real world.  Where if you wanted to accomplish something, you have the tools to do it.  But of course, you'll never believe what I say.  You'll just continue to make small obstacles into gigantic life movement blocking structures of complacency.  And I know what you're thinking...I'm a big fucking ass hypocrite for saying all this shit about others and not myself.  Well guess what??  I love my friends and family...but they don't see the things that are lacking in me.  And there are many many things.  I don't possess the life skills to go far, not right now anyway.  I have no skills to get another job that is better than what I have.  And even if I did, I likely don't have the dedication to do it.  I don't want any of you to think you are being singled out here.  Over the past few days I have had similar conversations with at least 4 people.  With talk of ""lack of accomplishment"" etc.  Well what you define as accomplishment and what others may see you have accomplished are two different things.  Personally I feel that anyone I know who has fallen in love, regardless of whether they fell out of it has accomplished a great deal.  It is certainly more than I have done.  To me the idea of making over 20,000 dollars a year is a pipe dream.  I'll always say that I don't want to argue about who has the worst issues.  I am working on mine, and I feel that if you have similar issues you need to work on them.  The sooner the better, hopefully before you get to the point where I am.  Which is essentially my last ditch effort to save myself.  Well i think I have gone on long enough and not really done much except possibly offend some friends.  Which is never my intention.  Nor do I wish to make them think they can't talk to me about these things.  You really can.  I am a good friend, or at least I try to be.  It's about the only thing that I do try to do well."
THWVU51,male,25,"I for some reason want to cry.  There's no reason for it whatsoever but I'm almost thinking it's necessary.  Just for the sake of purging.  I've really been doing a number on myself the past few months with my diet.  I eat crap and now I'm paying for it.  I feel like crap.  It's so hard for me to get out of bed.  And there are so many things I need to be changing.  The most painful thing is that I know this, and yet nothing has changed.  What's up with that.  One of the main things I don't like about me, is the rather large schism between knowledge and action.  If I know I need to change certain things than you would think that I could easily change them.  But I don't work that way.  So on the other hand American Thanksgiving is this week, the day that usually marks the beginning of the Christmas season.  At least it does in my eyes.  Specials should start airing around December 1st.  Not like it makes a huge difference because I have them all on tape anyway, but still I like to watch them when they air.  The quality of picture is better off of the TV than off of a tape made a couple years ago.  Third paragraph.  I want to have a relationship with this person.  I realise it has been a little over a week and I am looking to far ahead.  However he is talking about moving home in January until April, May, or June.  I personally don't like this prospect.  And am admittedly disheartened at the thought.  But I would wait, and I would hop on a bus to go visit.  I say this now of course.  There are at least 36 days until January and many things can change.  But then again, there are 6 hours until 8am, and many things can change."
THWVU51,male,25,"I lost a blog in here somewhere.  Well that is to say the last one I wrote seems to have disappeared.  I'm sure it was my fault but it still upsets me.  So I went to see Return of The King tonight.  It was great, I could nitpick about the story changes forever but I don't because it works anyway.  As most people know I find Elijah Wood to be super duper attractive.  But really there is a more existential reason for my like of him.  Don't get me wrong, I find him sexy, I respect his acting ability, and enjoy his personality in interviews.  But it's those eyes of his.  I look in his eyes and I can see my salvation, not as in my salvation is Elijah Wood.  Moreso that they are windows into wonder.  I feel when I look that somewhere I can shake my burdens, where all is well and I am happy.  I know it sounds strange.  That's because it is.  But the feeling always fades when those big blue pools aren't there to gaze into.  The clouds move in and it's impossible to see clearly again.  Man I hope he doesn't read this, I'm making myself sound like a big ole freak.  How very un-Christmasy I feel right now.  How very lost I am.  I guess you could say I feel like the sword that was broken, and I am waiting for the Elves to reforge me.  But alas, since Elves aren't real, I suppose I will remain shattered."
THWVU51,male,25,"My final night in this apartment.  This is the first place outside of my parents house of course where I actually made it to the one year mark.  I must say I am feeling oddly emotional about the whole thing.  I have never been one to revel in the idea of hard physical labour either.  I hate moving.  In fact I already hurt my back because stupid me, yet again(I've done this everytime I moved), put almost all my cd's in one box(which is 200 something) then tried to lift really fast.  So that didn't work out so well, and now my back hurts.  Well what can you say besides I am an idiot.  And before anyone gets all excited: If you ever come visit me remember that I have rather eclectic taste in music and my collection if you can call it that deserves to be made fun of.  Although don't make fun of it to my face or I will hurt you.  My apologies but moving makes me violent.  Just be happy that I am moving into my own place away from my roommates and their swords and fighting sticks.  I do however have a baseball bat, tennis racket, and a Darth Maul double edged lightsabre.  Why yes I am a big geek, thank you for noticing.  I also found out today that my new computer has arrived...hooray...although my hookups for phone, net, and cable aren't until Aug. 7.  But I will do my best to get to the internet where I can, most likely at the home of my loving parents.  My eldest sister went to the ""I love SARS"" concert.  At least that's what she called it...because of course if it weren't for SARS the event never would have happened.  Hence the I love SARS.  But I digress.  I'm hardly jealous, I mean if I wanted to see a bunch of old men try to be young I'd....well I'd something anyway.  It was like the geriatric empowerment sessions or something.  ACDC???  The Rolling Stones??  The Guess Who??  Blue Rodeo??  Sass Jordan??  Who let these people out of the home??  Really they should be sitting in a chair eating honey mush, not playing music for the Gen X croud.    As you can tell I am going to miss my internet for the next little while so I am ranting on majorly to make up for it.  But all good things must come to an end, and I must rest up for my move, and final cleaning.  Well there will always be the memories, oh yes, I'll always have those."
THWVU51,male,25,"Dammed Fry, I can't teach.  I'm a Professor.  That about sums up the University experience right there doesn't it?  Don't get me wrong.  I have had some very good professors, but, I have also had a couple that have no business in a job that pays well over 70,000.  If you want to know why tuition is so high why don't you take a look at what your school is spending money on and quit looking for money the Government not only doesn't have, but realistically doesn't need to be giving to schools in the first place.  Say what, you say.  Government gives money to universities more as a courtesy.  The Government knows that this is where the next batch of workers come from and we want a well educated work force not only for domestic reasons but also to improve ourselves on the world stage.  Every university in Canada is in effect, a private organization.  And thusly, should not technically be given public money.  Obviously for the greater good they are given money, which is fine.  But I really think that if you want tuition costs to freeze or go down there is nothing the Government can do to help.  They have enough things to poor money into.  You know like sponsorship and things.  I'll make that point now before anyone gets all high and mighty on me.  And another thing.  What's the big fucking deal about that??  This is hardly the first time that tax payer money has been used for inappropriate things.  I'm willing to bed that almost every Government since Confederation has lost money somewhere.  Are we going to collect from the corpse of Sir Wilfrid Laurier?  Probably not.  A Government is a large institution.  All the more reason why it should be downsized.  Hello Senator *glock glock*...See you in hell you rich do nothing bastard.  How do you like that for downsizing???  Again, please don't get me wrong.  I am upset about this.  But this is part of what living in a Capitalist society is...Business will always be grabbing at the pockets of government, and sometimes they're going to get something.  I find it hard to be outraged.  I would rather have my Government misuse 150 million dollars, then misuse billions.  You know what I'm talking about.  *Cough cough* war in Iraq *cough cough*.  Well that's enough ranting...And I didn't even talk about anything personal.  Not that there's much to say.  I mean...Considering how pathetic I view myself to be, no wonder nobody ever gives credence to my opinions.  As true as they may be."
THWVU51,male,25,"The thought just occured to me that perhaps I really do need to move home.  I have no doubt that things will start to turn around soon anyway.  But perhaps adding that safety net of ever present unconditional love will aid the process.  Of course there are many things which would have to take place.  I would have to inform my landlord of course.  I am not bound to a lease here, but they were kind enough to give me this apartment, and I am not out to betray that trust/kindness.  But on the other hand, perhaps I need to start being a little more selfish, and deciding what will make my life better.  Then of course, Mom and Dad would have to say yes.  And it is fair to say that most of my stuff would have to go into storage, and I would be happy to pay for that in place of the rent I am paying here.  It was just a thought I had.  In fact I have it alot.  Part of me just doesn't want to admit that my old psychologist was right.  That I am better off at home.  It is true that I hate being in the environment where people do things for me.  But I also hate being in the environment where I have all the control, it is because of that that I have spent the past 72 hours holed up in here fearing to go outside and to have to face people.  Aside from getting horribly unhealthy food I have stayed in, slept the long days, ate the awful meals, frustrated at my inability to stop myself, and yet pleased that I am succeeding in my own destruction.  Are there two me's, I sometimes think to myself.  Are there more?  What is it like to have more than one personality?  Must they both manifest in ways that are obvious to other people?  I'm not a psychology student.  I have no idea.  When you sit alone at 4am thinking these things, there must be something truly wrong with you.  I live out every day hoping that that one event will happen, that one thing that will change everything for me.  Of course life doesn't work that way.  Epiphany's are hard to come by, especially for those who seem to not want to have one.  Paradox, you say?  Well perhaps, although likely not in the truest meaning of the word.  But since I don't know the truest meaning of the word I can use it in this way.  So I call myself a paradox, either because I believe it to be true or because I think the word sounds cool.  One of the two.  The first thing that any counsellor or psychologist or what have you will ask you is ""How long have you felt this way?""  To which I answer always.  Or at least as long as I have memory, but it has been getting worse as I get older.  The follow up question is usually ""Why do you think you feel this way?""  To which I respond I don't know.  Because I truly don't know.  I hardly have the right to be this way, nothing particularly tragic has ever happened to me.  I don't know how I became this way, and I don't know why, and if I did know why...why on earth would I be seeking counselling trying to find the answer to that question.  More inane ramblings.  I'm trying to figure out if I should just stay up all night or should go to sleep and set my alarm early as though I were just going for a nap.  The problem there is that I know what will happen if I go to sleep.  I will set my alarm, and it will wake me up, and I will simply get up and turn it off and crawl back to bed, after having reset it for the time I need to be up to go to work.  And it will go off again, and I will turn it off, and I will rest my eyes, and low and behold I'll wake up with only 20 minutes to get to work on time.  That is what happens.  I am so predictable.  My eyes feel tired but that might be only from looking at this screen.  I slept for a very long time yesterday.  And there are things I need to do, and if I try to sleep, I'll end up doing none of them."
THWVU51,male,25,"It's about time I posted something isn't it?  I don't really have anything to say.  I've finished reading the Harry Potter books.  So now I, like millions of others, must wait until the next one comes out.  I met someone knew tonight.  Someone from online obviously.  Had a good time blah blah blah.  I don't put much hope into anything coming out of it.  He's too attractive for me and I think he knows it.  Plus I made myself sound like a total dumbass, which is something I tend to do when I meet people who are of equal if not superior intelligence.  So he's got brains and he's got looks, he'll make someone very happy and maybe we'll be friends or something.  Who knows what the future holds?  I really don't know what to write.  I never intend to make entries about my negative feelings.  But it seems that as soon as I sit down to write and entry I'm completely flooded with negative thoughts.  All the things that happen to me in the run of the day and at the end I always feel the same.  Now this would be a good thing of course if I went to bed happy and satisfied.  But that's not the case, and I can't see it ever becoming so.  Ooooh I got home in time to catch Harvey Birdman and Aqua Teen Hunger Force....jesss!!!!"
THWVU51,male,25,Ooops...I meant to put my email address in the last post.   joes_mon@hotmail.com  there ya go.
THWVU51,male,25,"Ah I see how this works.  *Sigh* I am about as computer savvy as a blind lemur, and am equally as likely to jump off cliffs.  So yes what an exciting day.  I went to my parents house as I do on most Sundays, to visit and make use of the free laundry facilities.  My parents are renovating the house and it's coming along nicely.  I ended up moving furniture, which was completely unexpected, and has led me to the epiphany that I had better hit the gym before I move into my new apartment at the end of the month.  My roommates are packing, it's all so very exciting really....I mean it....it's just soooo exciting.  Of course I am aware that I had better start packing lest I leave it to the last minute and break all my stuff.  Of which there is very little.  Does anyone else think that Paul Martin needs to have an anvil dropped on his head?  I know that just comes out of nowhere, but I mean seriously, the guy can't be trusted.  You don't trust someone who is rich to handle your money, they tend not to have a great sense of fiscal responsibility.  Not that I do.  I mean, I eat out more that I sleep it seems so I guess I'm not one to talk.  Stupid bickering roomies...Man, I am going to revell in my own place.  I love these two but they drive me nuts.  If I am ever in a relationship and I act like that someone kill me in an absolutely horrible fashion.  Perhaps force me to listen to Avril Lavigne while forcing me to watch wrestling.  That's a pretty horrible way to go.  OK, I've actually disturbed myself.  Oh well, I will go vomit now and then I'll come up with a plan to write something more intelligent."
THWVU51,male,25,Why did Fox cancel 'Futurama'.  Those morons!  Season two DVD set in stores now.
THWVU51,male,25,"Is it wrong to enjoy a movie that is thoroughly awful??  Well although that's a rhetorical question, if it did have an answer it is certainly no.  If it were wrong to be entertained by bad movies, I would have a very small movie collection.  Actually I do have a small movie collection but that's beside the point.   So yes, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, terrible.  It is based on a graphic novel.  Which, for those of you who are unaware, is like a big comic book.  Anyway the graphic novel is actually British in origin.  But as we all know, American audiences tend not to understand anything British, either by choice or by genetics.  So in they bring the allegedly attractive Shane West as Tom Sawyer.  And aside from one good joke at the expense of the American character, it just takes away from the dynamic of the GC.  In fact the GC is actually incredibly light on action.  But I don't consider it worth writing a review of, you can go see it or not.  I think it has something to offer, whether it's a good or bad thing would be up to the viewer.  Just keep your expectations low.  Bottom line, Sean Connery still rocks, even though he hasn't made a good movie in 20 years."
THWVU51,male,25,"I don't actually know what the word firmament means.  It is simply the title of a song by Dar Williams.  I suppose I should look it up before using it to describe something, but I don't own a dictionary, so I guess I'm stuck.  And I don't think that saying ""man that guys ass if firmament"" is correct usage.  This being my first post I suppose I should write something of myself.  So that way if anyone was actually reading this they could follow along comfortably and understand what on earth I am talking about.  First things first:  If you are going to follow this site keep in mind I have no life so you will likely be able to look in every couple of weeks and not miss anything.  But I suppose you never know perhaps ranting over the internet will become my new favourite passtime.  My name is Dane, I am 23, I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I was born and raised here etc.  I am gay, I likes men etc.  Perhaps I'll discuss that later who knows.  I like sports, I like movies where things get blown up, ditto for video games.  I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series because nothing is more cathartic than hacking hundreds of people to death.  I am manic-depressive, but I get by.  I am currently a student at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax.  I wrote for the school paper ""Jargon"" this past year focusing on being editor of a section on 'Sexuality'.  This coming year I will be co-editor of the paper and will continue to write about sex and sexuality as it is something I am interested in.  Moreso academically than in practice, honestly.  I don't enjoy sex all that much and don't tell me it's because I've never been with anyone good because believe me that's not the case.  Oh and I should mention that my grammar sucks.  Taking two and a half years off school tends to weaken some of those skills.  But hopefully in time it'll all come back to me and my nightmare of red marks all over my essays will end.  Damn comma splices, I hate them so much.  So anyhow.  I am a huge fan of The Simpsons.  Indeed I love cartoons, especially Saturday morning cartoons from the 80's, and many of the modern sitcom animated shows.  Everyone write to MTV to make sure the produce another season of ""Clone High"".  That's a great great show.  Well that's me in a nutshell I guess.  There'll be more to tell I'm sure, and all of it as equally boring as this."
THWVU51,male,25,"I suppose you're all wondering where I got the name for this blog.  Well perhaps not but I'll tell you anyhow.  One day while feeling disallusioned, as I am apt to do, I made up a second hotmail address because I was going to use it for junk mail and such.  That never did happen and I'm sure that account has closed.  During this time I was a student at St. Mary's University in Halifax, which is essentially the capital of the generic.  I have never been anywhere that I felt more left out than while attending SMU.  And since is seemed as though my uniqueness was something to be ashamed of I tried to remain a cog in the gritty machine.  This of course did alot more harm than good for me.  Now I have had a theory for a number of years of: ""Unique in mind, not in body.""  That is not to say that I look down upon people who take it upon themselves to look different on the outside.  Far from it.  My belief is simply that for me, I can be very a unique person who thinks differently from the majority and still look like an unassuming dork.  Who needs crazy piercings and tattoos when you have thought?    I still often feel as though the 'majority rulez' as I don't seem to fit in anywhere.  And indeed I guess I can say that I subscribe to the theory that sheep go to heaven and goats go to hell.  Goats being people who are different.  Bla bla bla...it's also a great song by the band Cake.  Do I believe the majority always rulez??  No.  However with all the pressure in our society for people to ""fit in"", it can certainly be a big factor in peoples lives."
THWVU51,male,25,"I feel funny.  Likely owing to the fact that I have yet to eat today.  My parents always ask me whether or not I have eaten.  As though I am not eating or something.  I eat plenty, and plenty of the wrong food while I'm at it.  If they are wondering if I'm eating then all one would have to do is look at me as I leave the bathroom after my shower with the towel on.  Then you can see how utterly 'jiggle-rific' I have become.  There's yet another term that I have made up.  I shall add it to the Dane dictionary.  I believe I am up to a whole page now.  So this week I have been on vacation.  I was also supposed to be on vacation this week however I agreed to work on Tuesday and Wednesday because they needed people.  I had forgotten that Tuesday was my birthday, but I'm off at 4 so it really makes no difference.  Usually there's a big birthday dinner.  That's what my parents do for us kids...take us out to dinner.  We don't give presents in my family, just cards and dinner.  I like this arrangement.  I am a much bigger fan of food than I am of sweaters that don't fit properly.  This year however I really don't want to have anything.  Mind you I'm pretty sure I feel this way every year, and my parents usually get me to do it anyway.  This year I probably could have convinced them not to do anything...However my cousin whose birthday is August 12th is in town and so the families want to have a one night two birthday thing, and I can't very well say no to that.  If you're wondering why I don't want to celebrate my birthday I'll run down as many reasons as I can.  Although my head is sort of swimming with lack of sustinence I can try.  I don't like getting older of course, that's everyone's generic reason.  Another year lacking accomplishment, lacking improvement, lacking my self you could even say.  I also hate people spending money on me.  I don't feel deserving of it.  Not when the money could go to much better use on either themselves or some charity.  This past year in particular is nothing to celebrate.  The only thing I can really take from it is that I'm still alive.  That is a good thing, that I'm still alive.  However that seems to be all I ever take from any year.  I can never find solace in the fact that I am living.  I have never learned to create my own happiness, and it seems so improbable that I ever will.  So when it comes this time of year it seems that no matter what the coming year will always seem draped in utter futility."
THWVU51,male,25,"I have so much to do, and so much time to do it in.  So why is it I'm not doing any of it?  Rhetorical questions are fun my friends.  True dat, as some may say.  Am I unhappy?  No.  Comtemplative would probably be the best description.  I'm like a little boy, cowering in a corner.  Partly fearing my imminant failure, and slightly fearing any possible success.  OOoohhh rhetorical nonsense...anyhow don't misunderstand this brief entry, it's just a couple of sentences with no real meaning.  I want to add more but I should go to bed, and I ain't not making the sense anyways."
THWVU51,male,25,"I guess my last Blog was censored.  I can't say I blame them due to the rather large amount of swearing that I did.  I apologise to the webmasters for that.  And apology...How Canadian of me.  So yeah I don't know what to say.  I feel like I should be dumping alot of stuff on this site, and yet I can't seem to do so.  I'm more empathetic than apathetic of late, I really care what's going on in other people's lives.  As things don't seem to be going to badly for me.  Although I have realised that I have screwed up a could of things big time, and once I come down from my high I am bound to punish myself for it.  But I digress.  For those of you who don't know, I guess I'm dating someone.  The reason I say I guess it because I find it hard to believe he wants to go out with me.  I mean, to me anyway...he seems at least superficially to be way out of my league.  Although time may teach me otherwise.  I do really like him, and I really hope this one goes somewhere.  I haven't met too many people (at least not in a romantic sense) who make me smile when I simply think of them.  Weird eh??  I don't really remember what it's like to be enamoured, it really only happened once before, and I am far removed from that feeling.  But anyways I shouldn't really talk about it much.  Because things are just starting out and things could change very quickly, very quickly indeed."
THWVU51,male,25,"Our weaknesses are as much a part of us as our strengths.  We all have the ability to be fragile as glass, and yet solid as granite.  I am just realising that my last post is gone.  I wonder why that is?  There are few updates to give of course.  I officially am the heaviest I have ever been.  Will this prompt me to change the way I eat and live my life?  Probably not.  It really should, but it won't.  I have finally started talking to ""fellow"" again.  I am looking for jobs.  Wish me luck, because my unqualified ass is going to need it.  I have met a couple of interesting people.  But it's not like that interaction makes me feel any better about things or myself.  And it's not like I am meeting people who even live in the same city as me.  My friend Jay moved to Toronto this past Friday.  Good for him is all I can say, and I wish him the best of luck.  He has joined both the gay soccer, and basketball leagues there.  You want to talk about things that make me jealous.  Ah well, I'm too fat to play sports now....Six foot one and 185...I may as well be a derelict, stuck in a hammock all the long day with five fans around me cooling the air and spreading my foul stench throughout my trailer in Eastern Passage.  I hate Sundays.  No matter how good my weeks are, everything always resets.  And then I have to start anew, trying to get the week to go my way.  That is until the next Sunday when it resets and I must begin again.  This is also why I hate the word cyclical.  Well I am going to try to find out what happened to my last entry.  Hopefully I will start updating more than once a week.  And even more hopefully will write something that's not quite so self-centered."
Y2TM30X,female,17,"In the interests of keeping the site open, maintaining the excellent level of debate we've got going presently and avoiding personal misunderstandings and fights, something needs to be done.   I think Max that you should have placed prominently a list of what we believe and what our site regulations are, to avoid confusion by newcomers, as has happened with A_P_C.  Make it clear all these rules have been decided by the m3r community, and keep the list open to comment so that anyone who's interested can comment and campaign for whatever change they want. Maybe you could have it as a post which you replace and update regularly, and which people can continually vote on.  That way we can see the development of the beliefs of the group as a whole and add another area for people to argue about. It would also increase the feeling of ownership by everyone involved.  Admin.  Rules Ok here are the rules if anybody wants to add some more or challenge a rule say so. Fregmonto you've put me on the spot here. Could you help out.   1.This site is open to debate, all political views are welcome, except for blatantly fascist, racist,homophobic, sexist, basically no descriminatory views are welcome,  we all here have a good sense of humour and these things said in jest with no real feeling beneath them are acceptable. Please don't stop posting things that are un PC just exercise some good taste please. 2. The m3r community does not welcome anonymous posters if they post anything vaguely offensive. Please visitors to this site who aren't known to the m3r community you are welcome to post comments. But if you are known to us a name would be very much appreciated. Your comments will not be deleted unless they are offensive. 3.If m3r is to remain an utterly free cooperative positive forum for the reporting of injustice and for debates it requires all of you to be responsible in your posting. Stick to these guidelines but above all have fun!"
Y2TM30X,female,17,As of now we have are restricted to a small billboard on the third floor. This was facilitated by Ms Farrel. Ms Forster however still maintains her opposition to widespread free speech at PHSC. We may not put up posters unless they first come through Ms Farrel and then Ms Ford. They must be of the form of public notices and will only be limitedly put up. We as students should have the right to put up posters with out going through this political process.  The reason why this is not possible according to Ms Forster is that some teachers have complained. An unnamed teacher said: 'We should hunt them down and beat them up'  or words to this effect i support this notion put forward by this anonymous teacher of North American extraction.

Y2TM30X,female,17,"Not quite. But the OFLC have overturned their own ruling that Harry Potter be M rated, they've bowed to corporate pressure and its being released as a PG movie. The OFLC is a disgusting censorship institution which the m3r club is as of today launching a campaign against.  With their ruling of an M rating for this film they have proven ther irrelevancy to the people of Australia. When the age newspaper asked parents if they had any concern about taking their children to an M rated film, many parents said they didnt even know about the rating and others couldn't give a shit. This film is a childrens film and a fine one at that. Pretty much as soon as this M rating was announced the distibutors here in Australia applied to have it overturned and instead of sticking to their guns the OFLC have bowed to pressure. The OFLC is also heavily influenced by right wing censorship groups. Having given the film 'Irreversible' an R rating they're now going back after some prudes who want it banned have complained. The hearing will be held in Late June. You may remember further ridiculous acts by the OFLC including re rating Hannibal as an R after complaints while it was already showing in Cinemas. Many people between the ages of 15 and 18 having already have seen the film making the re-rating a complete farce, See Also the banning of Ken Park and the Banning of Baise Moi."
Y2TM30X,female,17,Ok the new m3r project is to create a list of all the teacher's home phone numbers and addresses. We can do this through the  urlLink white pages website  but we need to find out which suburbs the teachers live in to narrow it down. So your homework or rather schoolwork is to find out your teacher's suburbs as subtly as you can. Also as you can see your humble administrator has changed his display name to Nu-Ju and I would ask you all to change your display names and profiles to leave no evidence of who you are.     BTW if people don't want to be involved in this say so.

Y2TM30X,female,17,"Ok news from school. m3r posters have been replaced with some starving children posters and an anti sweatshop poster and some other one. However these posters are not affiliated with any group. It would have been nice if they asked us before taking down the m3r poster. Really quite rude. It shall replaced on thursday. Also all blogspot sites have been banned at school. If anyone out there has cable internet and Windows XP contact me as there's some sort f shindig you can do so people can get around the filter at school. We asked Woody what the deal was and he was all like 'some kids complained because there was derogatory language about womens bodies or something'. this may be true, Natasha's post about Lyndie England could be what they were referring to. Anyway its bullshit that they can just block all the blogspots. He said if we wanted to get certain sites exempted from the ban , then we could. So we might delete that post then submit m3r.

Y2TM30X,female,17,As reported by Max I was discriminated against by Ludowyke because of my links to soviet composers (See my comment on his post) . I have since done some research and found that the school has been hijacked by young liberals who want to make us all fat with junk food.   1.Teishan's young liberals are influencing the staff and are getting media to come to the school next term.   2. Reports on the news have shown footballers have been sponsoring mcdonalds in school  3. The recent film Super size me has exposed the link between conservative governments and fastfood  4. John Howard doesn't want to do anything about junk food  Ludowyke knows that communists are all fit because otherwise Stalin and Mao would have killed them and that fatness is a symptom of capitalism. The Liberals are making us fat so that our brains will slow down and we'll vote for thwem.

Y2TM30X,female,17,"Reviewing all m3r's posts recently I have come to the same conclusion as Hart: Our greatest moment was the debate in the comments on Peter's ""let us be fair on the stereotyped"" post(June archives). This in turn was in response to the debate about the ranking system. This was the site's richest and most exciting period and I thought at the time m3r had a bright future.   Unfortunately since then the site has been knocked off course by the seemingly interminable bullying saga and teacher intervention.   Although their have been interesting posts since none have generated the same heated but intelligent debate. At Phillip Island I had a great discussion with Neal and Hart on a whole range of issues from America's place in the world to personal religious belief to fundametalism to Guatemalan fruit companies. This is the kind of debate we've been missing. Now that Neal is back in Iowa we have a golden opportunity to hear about the opinions of his friends back there and return to the best days of m3r. Start posting and commenting on things you feel need talking about. You don't have to be deliberately controversial, just say what you believe, and who gives a fuck what any teacher thinks about it.   Admin. If anyone is wondering why there are a few deleted comments around, its because i'm now enforcing our new policy, which is to delete all comments made anonymously. btw this does not mean if you don't have an account with blogger.com you can't post comments, just make sure you leave your name or else your comment will be deleted."
Y2TM30X,female,17,"Ok if any teachers are reading this site please piss off. it's none of your business so just stay out. this is our own student forum for discussing issues without descrimination. Here stuff will be spoken about such as how Ms Wright admitted to deliberately locking me and Neal in the community centre toilets for 20 mins coz we were pissing her off, and then pretending she didnt know when she let us out at the end of the lesson. We shouldn't have to stand for this kind of shit. So please let us have our say with our friends without anyone spying on us. Its not like we're plotting to overthrow the teachers or anything, starting with attaching a car bomb to mr Hatters car. So please FUK OFF."

When I first created the ministry of pornography, I, like Max, Peter, and Anwar, chose positions that best suited their talents. I am an expert in the traditional Ralph style pornography, along with more internet age Paris Hilton sex tapes dubbed in Korean. However, certain people have misinterpreted this and view my posts as a sort of written pornography, exciting those who oppose my views. They, shall we say, intellectually masturbated to my posts, creating a fierce debate. Now, to take a bad metaphor too far, we have reached orgasm. Will the office of pornography fall? You decide.

Y2TM30X,female,17,"Neal's ranking system is turning an egalitarian inclusive blog area into a GENTLEMEN'S CLUB. Look at all these titles these men are giving themselves! This kind of ranking system is discrimination and hypocritical in the extreme. Neal has exposed his TRUE AMERICAN IMPERIALISTIC COLOURS with this act. He must wean himself from his MILITARISTIC HEIRARCHICAL SOCIETAL INFLUENCES to truly prove himself anti-discriminatory. He is a nice chap but what is he playing at with these titles? Minister of Pornography?? Who does he think he is? Hugh Hefner? I can just see them smoking their cigars, oppressing the masses, laughing all the while. Down with the Gentlemen's club!"

Y2TM30X,female,17,"Terence Chesterfield and his cronies have infiltrated the school. Posters will be popping up all over the place any moment. There's a meeting this week, Neal,Max, me and any other m3r members that are interested are going to infiltrate it, report back and bring down these bastards from the inside. Only then will we know Chesterfield's TRUE identity, and the identities of our enemies inside the school. This is not to attack liberal supporters, but to ACTUALLY JOIN THE YOUNG LIBERALS REQUIRES A LEVEL OF DEPRAVITY BEYOND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.  My grandparents are liberal voters and very nice people BUT THEY HAVE NO SOULS!!! Their eyes glaze over when you talk about politics and their forked tongues flicker in their mouths as they sliver down into their subterranean abode and do MATHS. That's right, Maths is a form of discrimination invented by LIBERALS.   A certain Maths teacher at school detains both MAX and NEAL for no reason, and when I go NUTS in class she does NOTHING.  WHY? I'LL LET YOU JOIN THE DOTS!  MATHS WAS INVENTED TO OPPRESS MINORITIES, THE LIBERAL PARTY WAS FOUNDED BY PEOPLE SCARED OF MINORITIES, SO SMELL THE MUSIC DAMN IT, DON'T LET THEM TAKE OVER THE SCHOOL!!!!!!!!"

Y2TM30X,female,17,"I was sitting back on my rocking chair slurpen on a peach, stairing at the situation, rocking back and forth when i had to ask my self. What does EMO really mean? so i started some intensive research, My first stop was Google. Nothing there except everything i didnt want to see about EMO. It claims that emo is extensivly just emo punk. This were i have to disagree, this is my purpose! EMO is a shortened term for the word emotional. Who the hell invented the word EMO for it to mean emo punk. wouldnt it its shortened term be like; EMUNK, PMO, EMK and the list goes on! I think people dont understand the meaning of EMO beacuse its actually everywhere, this piece of writting is EMO because it has emotion. This is what im trying to say, in everything there is emotion, which means all music is emo, which also means people use the wrong freaking word to describe one perticular type of music (emo punk). Bands like Tool and iron maiden are as emo as any other band beacuse they express emotion. No longer bands like simple plan and Good charlotte can simply be called EMO. All music is EMO, can you think of a song that doesnt express emotion? Even techno (my most feared music) express emotion. Jakes Gangster rap, express emotion! All music has emotion. You cant call one style simple just EMO."

Y2TM30X,female,17,"well geez, today got another HUGE ASS dose of the bitchin and the using. all throughout the day Sean and Aaron told me that they were coming  over to my house after school, so anyway at the end of school i went up to aaron to ask him if he wanted arda, and that i didnt have shit. so of then of course he changed his mind and decided to go to Brians. now the thing that gets me is brian had nuthin either, so obviously i am being used for arda or else he would have continued coming. well well i am getting so sick of the crap. why the hell would u go round to someones house everyday if u dnt even like them r only looking for arda. geez this offends me i wish people could be my friend aswell as getting arda, but that seems a bit too complicated for some poeple to understand. anyways i just wanna say hi to pearl and claire (the coolest team Win members in the world) ..... and claire why leave after school? u have only smoked with me 1 day this week........ nehow this is POlly siging out from....

Y2TM30X,female,17,"Hi all, i've just gotten off the phone from my Greek auntie who is in Athens at the moment. She is staying at my grandparents apartment in Kalethea-where the two ararchist bombs went off a few months ago- and had some interesting stories to tell me about the olympic city.  Firstly the airport. She arrived last week. She got through immigration eaysally, collected her bags, then was on her way out to meet our relatives that live in Athens when a police officer approched her. This is a rough transcript of what happened: Police officer(in broken english):"" Where are you from?"" Auntie:""Australia"" Police:""Where have you come from?"" Auntie:""Australia"" Police:""So, err, do you have anything in your bag?"" Auntie:""..........well"" Police:""Anything I would be interested in?"" Auntie:""No"" Police:""Move on"".  As for everyday life in Athens, apart from an increase in tourists, things remain the same. My Aunties cousin, who is an olympic voulenteer, is in the opening ceremony on the weekend. She was talking to my Auntie, and invited, in an offhanded way, for her to come to the opening ceremony practice run today!!!!!!!!!! FULLY SIK!!!!!!!!  My Auntie asked her what security passes or precautions she needed to do to go, and was told she can't bring 1-cameras, 2-mobile phones, 3-coins. Apart from that, she is fine to visit. Coins? Aparently the organisers are worried people will throw the coins at the peformers.  She will be ringing me tomorrow, i'll tell you what is in the opening ceromony."

He'll make some woman a very nice neurotic husband some day, just not this young lady.  I don't think I'll be calling him again....is that bad??  Am I a terrible person??  I just don't want to waste his time and besides, he's moving back to NYC.  More importantly I don't want to waste my own time, why drag out something that will inevitably be pointless...and I know what you're thinking, why not be his friend.  Well here's why...because I can barely maintain the friendships that I currently have, that's why.  You guys know that I can hardly listen to voice mails let alone throw another person into the mix.  So there's the story on Dave.  Short and sweet.  I wish him the best."

09SDT6G,female,24,"All morning I've been pretty much bored out of my mind, well this isn't really saying much because I could be in the middle of a rock concert and still be bored out of my mind because I have the attention span of a goldfish.....but I have been exceptionally bored so I decided to go against my better judgment and take personality tests.  The first one I took told me what personality disorders I suffer from most.  The #1 was schizoid.....riiiiiiiight.  Coming in a close second was Paranoid and last but certainly not least was narcissitic.  HAHAHAHAHA  Just what I wanted to hear....thanks for playing.  I should have stopped there, but my boredom got the better of me.  I then took a test to discern what movie I would be.....survey says:  Schindler's List.  How utterly depressing, I'm a black and white movie about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.  Fantastic.  Keep up the good work.  Next we have the famous leader test.....survey says:  Bill Clinton. It states that I have the ability to bend people's views and to be a social chameleon.  Greaaaaaaaaaat.  I should have quit while I was ahead.  I think my family will disown me for this last one, but how was I to know that 55 simple questions about myself would lead to such a deafening blow to my character.  Apparently the survey left out the part about being an adulterer/lying/cheating manipulator.  This does not bode well for me.  Maybe I'll take the test again later and lie if I have to....anything not to be compared to Clinton.    Highlight of my day today: lunch with Skittles at Gourmet 88"
09SDT6G,female,24,"Finally the post that had been published 3 times has been deleted, but now I will publish what got deleted once again for you all to see....that way today's post will make that much more sense to you.  It went as follows:   The Price of Beauty: One scratched cornea. No, it's true. It seems the beauty Gods have raised their prices. Me being in a hurry to apply mascara, jabbed it into my eye. Now I thought that I was fine, consulted with a bunch of people about it only to wake up Sunday morning with a swollen left eye. Not cool. I don't do well with eye afflictions in the first place, so this one is really freaking me out.   I have a doctor's appt. today and of course I'm expecting the worst that I have irreparably damaged my cornea, I will need a transplant before the week's out and if I don't receive one I am going to slowly loose my sight and am going to be unable to see my children grow up. Yep, it's just that bad.  Ok, well not really. I'm just a psycho. The upshot of all of this: I get to leave the office 3 hours early....on a Monday. There's always a silver lining, I just really had to dig for this one. Trust me, I'd almost rather stay here. Oh and another positive is that I am unable to apply eye make-up now, so I save myself another 5 minutes in the morning, that's 5 more minutes of glorious sleep....oh but that's right, since it feels like sandpaper rubbing on my eye, I'm unable to sleep!!   Ok, I'm building the bridge and I'll talk about more pleasant things. Ummmmm.....still thinking.   Oh, here's one for the masses....my brother's cat is OCD. Yep, I didn't stutter. Mozart is OCD and pulls his own fur out. HAHAHAHAAH. Since my reality is slowly becoming jaded after living in L.A. for 1.5 years, most people would take him to a pet therapist. However, Mozart lives in PA and no such resources are available to him. Luckily he's a persian and can stand to loose a little fur, but I feel sorry for the little thing. How does a cat become OCD??? I think they should take him to the pet psychic. And on that note....I'm done.   I'll keep you all posted about my eye as I'm sure it will keep you up nights."
09SDT6G,female,24,"My brother is currently in the third quarter of what will hopefully be longer then his ""15 minutes of fame.""  I came into the office Monday morning to be greeted with phone calls and emails saying that my brother had been quoted by FOX news on his views about Farhenheit 9/11.  He even made ABC and other various news outlets.  Apparently the media is trying to comment on the conservative side of an already biased, inflammatory ""documentary.""  I use the word 'documentary' loosely because it's basically just a propaganda piece.     I told him that with all of the hype currently surrounding him that he was going to need a PR person.  All fingers point to me!!  He wasn't thrilled with the idea.  But you know what, he's gonna need me some day to help him carry the state of California in a presidential election.  Just you wait.     You know you've made it when you can Google your name and it pops up more than one time.  Hell, I can't even do that.  It can be his claim to fame for the time being.    Kudos to Maurice.  He's making a name for himself."

09SDT6G,female,24,"My father's great aunt died yesterday.  She was 87.  Her name was Pearl.  Perhaps I had met her once upon a time, but I'm not certain.  Eighty-seven seems kind of young in the grand scheme of things, doesn't it??    I have had the fortunate luck (knock on wood) of never really suffering the death of someone close to me.  However, I think I'm getting to the stage in life where this 25 year reprieve may be ending.  It's not a pleasant thought.    I've always been envious of the fact that my brother is almost 8 years my senior.  He will have gotten to be with my parents 8 more years then I ever will have been...it's a fact that can't be helped and it's pointless to waste energy on thinking about it, but I can't help it.  It just doesn't seem fair. Another thing that I've thought about lately is that my brother also got married right out of college and has been married for almost 10 years.  I'm 25 and nowhere  near  being married.  As the years go by, that's one less year I will have with my future husband.  Now I know, or at least I've been told that matters like this happen in their own good time, but sometimes I can't stand it!  I was never one for delay of gratification.  Most importantly I suppose I don't want to be a statistic and end up a part of the 60% divorce rate.    I think I need to start believing that I belong in this body and this body belongs in this life."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Come back, Lynn Keegan!  Lindsey's mom left yesterday and it was the saddest thing ever.  I came home from the office on Monday, tired, mildly pissed off, and hungry only to find that she had already made dinner for all of us!  What a great mom!  Usually all of us are running around getting take-out at 9PM just in time to watch Survivor or following American Idol, but Monday Lynn was right on cue.  I think I could get used to coming home and having dinner ready and the table all set up.....not only did she make us dinner, but while she was here she got our lives in order, well our bedrooms to be exact.  When Lindsey and I moved in things were just kind of put places so as to get them out of the way and both of us never really took the time almost a year later to put things in their proper places....now everything's perfect!  It looks like we've lived there for years, what a difference pictures make in small picture frames.  That's the ticket people, put your pictures in smaller frames, it's astounding how much better they'll look.  My dear dear friend Eugenia got the most amazing job ever in Marketing and she was told that it could never be done because she didn't have the experience.  I'm so proud of her!  I know she's struggling with her decision, but she made the right one for this stage of her life.  She's gotta think about her retirement, she'll have plenty of time to save the world when she's older and has got money in the bank.  Her aspirations were noble and I know her heart was in the right place, that's why I think all is well and that her decision was a good one.  She's got a good heart.    Best News Ever!  My brother won his election by a margin of 3-1.  He almost doubled the other candidates votes.  I'm so proud of him!  I spoke to him briefly after he had found out that he won last evening and I could just tell that he was trying his damnest to keep his cool but that inside he was bursting!  I knew he could do it....he just needed to have a little faith.  My parents had a celebration of sorts for him today.  I'd say this is definitely cause to celebrate.  I just can't express how happy I am for him.  Eugenia was sitting with me when my mom called and told me that he'd won and after I got off the phone she told me that she knew that it had to be good because she'd never seen an expression like that on my face before!  Congrats Maurice!!"
09SDT6G,female,24,"As is usually the case, I always learn things when I'm out with Eugenia...little known truths are revealed.  We experienced three such truths on Saturday while watching the legions of pregnant women and small children parading by.... 1.  Everyone needs a nose. 2.  Her heart was in the right place. 3.  Never wear a tutu.  Now these are quite profound 'truths' one might say and more will be revealed in time....but for now some things must remain a mystery.  (i.e. the stories behind my truths)"
09SDT6G,female,24,"I just took a personality test and although I'm usually opposed to such garbage and feel that it holds little truth....I think there just might be some truth to this one.  This is what it had to say about me......  The Priss Deliberate Brutal Love Dreamer (DBLDf)       Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss.       Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.       These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.  You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Since I somehow managed once again to post the same posting twice, I must now quickly write something in order to delete the duplicate post...make sense?  Great.  Such are the laws of blogger land.  Speaking of blogs, I've been reading a great deal of interesting ones lately.  It seems as though people's abilities to write are not as lacking as I had originally thought.  Some of you are really quite good and funny as hell.  Nice work.  If I knew how to post a link I would link y'all to some of my favorites, but since I'm not tech savy, I am just capable of the blogging basics.  Hopefully this will be enough for now."
09SDT6G,female,24,I feel like blogging is a trend or something.   It's always embarrassing to start a blog (especially when it’s a hot trend). It takes a little pushing and a little shoving and then you don't know what to write about and you think it's all just stupid (which it probably is) but you forge ahead anyway and then ask all your friends to start blogs because you don't want to be the only asshole in your social circle talking about it like a technerd. Then your friends start blogs and their first posts are about how lame blogging is and how much they think it's dumb but they persist and more kids cave in. Soon enough every friendster you’ve ever had now miraculously has their own blog. And now you can go to bed content knowing you are a cliché.   The Moral: Peer pressure is still hot in 2004!
09SDT6G,female,24,"I know I know...it's been awhile since I've last posted.  Things have happened, MANY things, things I never thought would happen again.  Actually you know what??  I take that back.  I'm not all that surprised.  I'll do my best to fill in the gaps.  This past weekend Eugenia and I went to San Simeon, aka Hearst Castle.  To those of you who don't know, Hearst Castle is located in what would be the equivalent of Kentucky....basically the middle of nowhere.  It's a quick 4 hour trip from L.A. (with no traffic of course)  I'd been wanting to go there for years, ever since I saw it on A&E.  The antiquties and art Hearst was able to accumulate are mind-blowing at best.  I saw statues that pre-dated Moses.  It was almost too much to grasp in such a short period of time.  3 tours in the span of about 7 hours was almost more than I could bear. The one gentlemen that was leading our tour even pointed out the fact that I looked like I had had enough...that he had seen me on other tours and that I had obviously reached my fill.    On the way there we decided to stop in Santa Barbara because I had never really seen the downtown area.  Beautiful.  Hippie central, but beautiful.  Great little shops, great restaurants, beautiful scenery.  I even managed to talk Eugenia into stopping there on the way back as well even after our little snag a few hours earlier.  For those of you who don't know Eugneia, she basically shouldn't have a license.  No really, she shouldn't.  She knows this.  Her driving leaves much to be desired and going against my better judgement, she drove us on our little adventure.  Even after Lindsey, the night before had begged me to drive, knowing that my driving skills FAR outweighed hers.  Nope, I was sick and wanted no part in driving, so Eugenia drove.  Never again.  On the way there we were lucky and only went off the road a few dozen times, but on the way back things got interesting.  We of course were listening to Norah, she got emotional about one of the songs (naturally) and was going 92MPH.  She happens to look in her rearview mirror and sees a cop with lights flashing.  Since she lives and operates in her own world, she thinks the sirens and flashing lights do not apply to her.  After a few minutes she realizes they really are for her and she pulls over.  The cop clocked her at 92 MPH, reckless driving in the state of Calfornia.  Now I'm sitting in the passenger side praying that she doesn't pull her usual attitude because I am fully aware that she has exceeded the speed limit by more than 30MPH and if the cop really wanted to be a prick he could have impounded the car.  Luckily he didn't, even though she gave him a complete attitude.  The best part was when he asked her why she was speeding and she said that she was ""keeping up with traffic.""  I almost died, well more ways than one when she said that...but only she would have the gaul to blurt that out in the face of a major offense.  So 15 minutes later and about $400 later, we're back on HWY 1 along the Pacific Ocean.    She of course starts speeding again and this is too much for me to bear.  I flip out and start yelling that there is no reason whatsoever to ever be driving that fast because A. if we hit anything we will surely die and B. she doesn't drive a Ferrari.  I make her pull over so that I can drive because at this point I just don't feel safe anymore.  She happily agrees because she has as migraine and needs to sleep anyways. (MAYBE SHE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT SOONER!) Great.  Crisis averted.  I get to live a few more hours.  I managed to take some pictures of our little adventure.  I have one amazing photograph of a sunset that I took from the balcony of our hotel room.  I'm quite the photographer now.  Chris and I decided that my new occupation on my friendster profile is going to be Hippie/Photographer.  I think it's most fitting.  However, the pictures that we took of ourselves leave a lot to be desired.  Damn wind.  I think the wind wept at the sight of our outfits, but congratulated us on our hair.  Things could have been worse.   I tried to sleep with the doors open so that I could hear the ocean, but it just got too damn cold.  I think that is a sound that I would never grow tired of hearing...and the wind, I love the wind in my hair.  Although I regret it later when I'm throwing fits about the knots in it.  Eugenia had a hard time pulling me away from the balcony because I would just sit out there forever paralyzed by it all.  I find it ironic how one of my biggest fears in life is also one of the things that I find most beautiful and drawn to."
09SDT6G,female,24,"I know it's been awhile since I've last posted.  In the interim I've had a bit of a breakdown one could call it.  I think it all boils down to confusion.  Maybe I'm just pissed off that my life has turned out the way it has, it's hardly as I envisioned it would be on May 18, 2002 when I graduated from college.   Where did I go wrong...was it getting on that Continental flight on September 12, 2002??!!!  I suppose I'll never know."
09SDT6G,female,24,"The following is an email that I sent to Cukie regarding Friday night.....my thoughts aren't very organized or articulate, but neither were his.  And scene:  you know what, the more I thought about Dave's behavior, the more I got fired up about it.   a.  he wasn't invited to sit down with us b.  when he did sit down, he wasn't even a little entertaining and made NO effort to interact with us, he just did his inside jokes with Willy, who for the record skinned a sheep to make his jacket. c.  yes I know that it was a very touchy subject for him, but part of debating is listening to the other side, shutting up long enough to hear it and then accepting that you have agreed to disagree d.  I did NOT wait almost an hour to have dave sit down and ruin our dinner, well at least he did for me e.  yeah so he's unhappy, a lot of us are about a lot of things....but there is a time and a place for it.  Put on a smile and shut up about it for a brief moment. f.  granted it's a 2-way street, but his treatment of Lindsey right now is boarderline RIDICULOUS!  She's called him, if he has a problem with her just tell her.....it's a simple enough one to solve.  They are far too good of friends for this shit.   Now I know what you're going to say....but you have to admit that he was more than a little out of line.  I don't care if he was drunk and to point in Jess's face...come on, he knows better than that.   Right now I'm not a fan."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Ladies and Gentlemen: I am about to say something that I never thought I would hear myself say.....drum roll please..............  I had by far the best time I've ever had with Nigel last night.  He never once insulted me, upset me, or criticized me.  He was complimentary and thrilled to see me. Truly a unique experience when one thinks of an evening out with Nigel.  No drama.  Of course we did our usual drill of why we would never work together and the ""Janielle, you're the only one for me.""  (which may I please add is very flattering and validating right now on some level)  He's a good kid.  I've seen major change in that kid over the past few months.  Maybe he's just projecting what he wishes for me to pick up on...but I think he's trying.  Nigel wears pink ties with grey suits....there's something to be said for that other then the fact that he's British.    Pink ties make Janielle happy."
09SDT6G,female,24,"I am, by my nature, a polydenominational person. I drop into all churches and at various times have found just about every religious tradition ""closer to the truth."" In this society we have made it so incredibly difficult to have a relationship with God that doesn't somehow turn into a relationship between a bad child and a stern parent, or a slow child and a demanding parent, or a slacking, brutish teenager and an anxious parent, that most people have given up trying to have any kind of serious religious life.   Every once in a while, though, a work of art will make you feel like it would be fun to swim around in one or many of the great pools of faith. ""Dead Man Walking"" is a good example -- who wouldn't want to be the nun responsible for the vigorous redemption of scumbag Sean Penn? The movie made Christianity so toothsome, like sliding Jesus into a new Armani suit and a sexy haircut. And every once in awhile I meet a great and luminous character that is my ideal embodiment of spirituality and morality.    For me religion has always been about the interconnectedness of things and the importance of seemingly meaningless details and the yielding nature of true friendship, and how everything plays a part in recognizing a larger force and ultimate plan. There are always pitfalls and disasters, but these too play a part in the eventual logic of events.  I think this is what all people want from faith -- a feeling that the seemingly senseless indignities of life ultimately serve the higher purpose of educating the soul.  It is like life, when it all falls gracefully together into a whole that means more than the sum of its parts."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Since I'm sure you are all on the edge of your seats waiting to know if I ever heard from Brian again or more importantly, Bill....here's the scoop.  I got an email from Brian regaling me with a story from the other night that I missed because I didn't wait with him while his car was brought around.  Apparently some rap artist really liked his tie or something...totally inconsequential.  He also added as a final note that he ""hopes I had fun last night.""  Nope!  Definitely didn't check that box on the survey afterwards.  On to more pressing issues.  Bill.  He did what I knew he would do.  He sent me an email in response to my voicemail.  He's done this ever since we went our separate ways.  I'd like to think it's because he doesn't know how to talk to me or deal with me because he has yet to reconcile his feelings for me.  The other part of me feels it's because he's an asshole plain and simple and could really care less.  So he emailed.  A one-liner signed Bill.  I proceed to write back that for some reason or another I knew that he would respond to me via email and proceed to tell him how I've been since the 6+ months it had been since we'd last spoken.  Now here's the rub:  In less than 2 minutes I receive an email saying 'she did write she knew that I would email her back...hahahaha' and proceeds to talk about some aveda hair product.  Well of course I got the wrong email so I write him back asking if the message was meant for me.  Obviously it wasn't because by the time I had written a two sentence email he had already responded, stating that the previous email had been meant for his friend John.  By this time I'm livid!!  He's talking about me!!  Now boys usually don't gossip like this or pass along superfluous information to friends about girls, but for some reason Bill had felt the need prior to that email to tell John that I had called him the previous night.  You ask why?  Answer:  Bill's unstable so there is no answer.  I must admit though that in some twisted fashion I'm a bit flattered that Bill felt that this was an important enough tidbit to tell John.  If it had meant nothing to him he wouldn't have mentioned it, right??  Am I wrong in thinking this?!  Also in his previous email he said that he would love to grab a drink with me next time I'm in Santa Monica if I'd like him to....of course I would, but just how much am I willing to put up with to get me to that point?!  When is enough, enough?  I've taken more than my fair share of a beating from this kid and yet I keep coming back for more.  I keep telling myself that in 3 years none of this will have mattered, but it's almost a year later and it still consumes me everyday.  I can't help but feel as though I'm being punished for something I never did...it's like I represent to him one of the unhappiest moments in his life.  Granted he lost 3 friends and 2 family members all within the span of less than a year, but that's not my fault.  All I ever wanted to do was help him.  Apparently he doesn't need my help.  Well fine.  But when do I stop offering it?  About 9 months ago when he freaked out on me and attacked everything that I believe in as a human being?  Probably.    Those of you who know me know that I over-analyze things and beat them to death.  But this one really bothered me because I'm nobody's fool.  I'm not here to be made a mockery of so I shoot back and email telling him that he was so busted and just for that he owed me a drink.  I make light of the situation because Bill's always been fragile.  I'm not here to drive him further away.  He then writes back again that I can give him all the shit I want, that he can take it.  I can just picture him in his office shrugging his shoulders and saying 'so what!'  It's kind of like tough, what are you going to do about it?!  The answer: nothing.  I either just accept that this is the way he's going to be or move on.    I know a few of you are reading this and rolling your eyes and wondering when the hell is she going to snap out of this, the kid's a jackass...you're right he is.  I can know that and I can tell you until the cows come home that he's different, that there's something special about him....you'll call me crazy.  I'll still know that I'm right.  It's an endless cycle.  For one reason or another, whether or not you choose to accept it, and I know that many of you have had your differences with him....I adore him.  I took him at face value, not for the dealings that any of you may have had with him in the past....because you know what, it's the past.  Let it go.  We all make mistakes.  Hell I'm probably making one right now, but that's for me to decide and not for you to judge.  We all make our own beds, let me lie in mine.  Oh and would you save the I-told-you-so's??  They're old and you're too old to be saying it.    For me, right now is enough."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Some things a select few have overlooked because they were too concerned with the bad to see the good:  Rainy days make me sad.  I love the wind in my hair, even though I'll curse the knots in it later.  I still love to know what my parents are having for brunch on Sundays...it makes me miss home a little more.  Every day I question whether or not I made the right decision in moving 3000 miles away from my family.  I love that my laugh makes other people laugh.  I know that I made it on my own here without strings being pulled, phone calls being made, or favors being called in....I did it my way.  I'm proud of the fact that my parents have been married for 35 years.  I'm proud of my brother for pursuing a political career and even prouder that so far he's proved a success.  Despite your opinion, I was and never will be too good for public transportation.  Sometimes I'm afraid that I'll never live up to the expectations that others have for me.  My favorite noise is a comfortable silence.  I love that the friends I had as a child are still among my closest today.  I think we all need to believe in something greater then ourselves.  Last, but certainly not least...you will never know me."

09SDT6G,female,24,"I almost forgot!  I now check voicemail regularly.  The days of my inbox containing 36 unheard messages are gone.  Now this is not to say that in the future I will be this good, but for right now, I'm listening to my messages as I receive them.  So leave me a message.  I'll actually get it!"
09SDT6G,female,24,"April 12th:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SKITTLES      HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANDY!  Literally over the past week there has been at least one birthday everday and today is no exception.  Kevin is a whapping 38 going on 17 (seriously, the guy looks younger than me) and well Andy, he's 24 today.  Happy Happy Birthday to you both!!    So this weekend, Friday to be exact marked Flora's 24th Birthday.  As many of you are all too aware, Flora and I parted ways about 7 months ago.  I'll leave the details of the separation in the past.  However, that didn't stop her from sweeping everything under the rug and still inviting Lindsey (another leper in Flora's eyes) and me to her birthday gathering.  It wasn't in the slightest bit entertaining.  In fact it was downright painful.  Upon leaving I exclaimed to Lindsey and Eugenia, ""I'm done...no really, this time I'm done.  That was terrible.  Our group of 'friends' is held together by at thread and I just can't do it anymore.'  Yep, it's just that dramatic.  Reagan was her normal charming, obnoxious self accompanied by her flavor of the week, Liam.  (cool guy...almost too good for her)  Then there's Pete, Flora's boyfriend who is an authority on everything.  I'm sure he wonders why CNN or MSNBC haven't called him up yet to be a correspondant/resident expert on all aspects of the universe.  Hey Pete, stick to the toy biz....we don't need you in entertainment/finance/or marketing!!  Is it just me or do others find it strange that Flora chose to surround herself with the very people that she despises and talks non-stop shit about on her birthday of all days?!  Was this a feeble attempt at trying to appear as though you'd won the popularity contest and we were all pleased as punch that you held us in such high regard so as to include us in your birthday celebration!??!  ENNNNNNNNNNNNN....WRONG!  You're a phony, a fake, a fraud!  I hope that when you got home that night and washed off your insane amounts of eye make-up (newsflash babe, the theme of the night was not Call Girl wannabes) and the rest of your caked on make-up that you realized, if only for a nano-second that none of us were there to celebrate you.  Hell I don't even know why I went, something to do I suppose.  But don't think for one second that it was for you.  I don't owe you that much.  You got us all there under false pretenses....we came for Eric and the countless others you had promised would make a guest appearance.  In the future, I'll call these people myself.  Lots less effort, lots less phoniness, and most importantly, you're not worth it!    The real drama of the weekend was my flat tire Friday night/Saturday morning.  I've never had to deal with car drama myself, so it should come as no surprise to any of you that this was about all I could take and of course freaked out.  I called my mom, she of course told me to call AAA.  What a novel idea!!  Why couldn't I think of that?!?  Apparently I'm not as good under pressure as I had originally believed myself to be.  Anyways, I made an appointment with the AAA people to come change my tire Saturday morning.  All was fine and well and I was able to go out without a heavy heart.  My state of euphoria was not to last.  Saturday morning roles around and the mechanic asks me in a really laid back way....'Do you have any enemies??!' I of course say no and ask why...well kids, the answer is that I had a broken off knife blade in my tire.  Some one had intentionally slashed it and to think my car was only parked outside of our house for 20 minutes tops at all the previous day.    Just great!  So thanks to Lindsey and her dad, I'm was off to Just Tires for a nice new round of tires.  Great!  Just how we all want to spend a thousand dollars.  But you may rest assured that all is well and order has been restored.  I look back on the whole incident now and laugh...well not quite all out laughing, but I'm no longer in maniac-mode.  Baby steps...."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Last night marked my much anticipated evening out with Brian.  We were to meet at 8 o'clock sharp at the Four Seasons on Doheny, not Wilshire because as Brian said, the one on Wilshire is 'lame and for tourists.'   He said this was neutral ground after my having vetoed three of his previous suggestions.  I don't like the Sunset Strip, I make no apologies for that.....  So we get together, we're both a little early.  Oh I almost forgot!  On my way there, they for some reason or another had to divert the 10 E traffic onto the 10 W so westbound was virtually a parking lot...anyways, I'm sitting in traffic, listening to Jay-Z's Black album and this brand new Astin Martin DB7 pulls up next to me.  Now who should be in it but none other than Pierce Brosnan and his lovely wife!  Even Bond gets stuck in traffic.  Ok, back to my story....  I come into the bar/restaurant area and there he is in all his glory, perfectly tailored black suit, custom white dress shirt WITH cufflinks and a maroon and pink tie, he looks great!  He hugs me and gives me a kiss on the check, remarks on how much he likes my watch and we go from there just giving general information about ourselves.  Everything was fine except for the fact that he was like a little kid in that he had to stare and watch everyone that walked by our table.  So annoying and a total turn off.  I then proceed to tell him how rude that is and tell him to focus.  From my chair I was able to watch people hurrying by, but I noticed that all too often people would slow down and look at us as they walked past, trying I imagine, to get a glimpse of someone rich/famous/interesting. Instead, they got me -  but how were they to know that I was only in there for drinks with a friend? Answer: they weren't. All those people looking in thought that I was someone special, which I'm not. It's an interesting lesson on how society confers status onto people. I can understand how some crave fame and fortune, for I must admit that I too got a fair kick out of people looking at me and wondering who I was to be consorting with the agents to the likes of Eminem, Tom Cruise, and Charlize Theron.  I think I was the only person in the room who didn't know which studio or agency everyone else was working with/for.    Now for those of you who don't know, Brian is an agent to the stars.  He's caught up in the whole hollywood drama, but with good reason...he's made it his life to be a dealmaker so that we at home are entertained by the best of the best.  So we're enjoying our drinks and talking, but we're interrupted about every 10 minutes by someone else that he knows ""in the business"" and they're all so happy that the Oscars and award show season are over....well at least until June 4th.  How very awful for them!    To put this in terms that many of you can relate to, agents in L.A. are what investment bankers are to NYC....they're a different breed and terribly affected.  As Brian said, the only difference is that the 'I-bankers wear two button and single pleat suits, while the agents wear flat-front and 3 button suits.'  Really?  Is that the only real distinguising quality??  Gee, you know... I'd never thought of it in those terms before you self-righteous little twirp!   Your observations are astoundingly astute....riiiight.   I was always very intrigued by the glitterati and the fashionistas...not anymore.  I don't envy him his 14 hour days and constantly being told over the phone that he's worthless.  Well, maybe he is.....  Bottom line is that I am numb to last evening.  I have no other way of describing it.  I didn't have a grand time nor did I have a terrible time.  It was just time.  Not necessarily wasted time, but I'll just chalk it up to a learning experience.  Will we ever speak again??  Probably not.  Am I sad about this??  No.  He needs someone to be impressed with the contents of his blackberry and his ability to get you into The Whiskey because maybe, just maybe ""Clooney will be there.""    So we abruptly left, the valets brought around our cars, we said our goodbyes, I thanked him, he thanked me for driving 'all the way' to the westside and I left.....a little sad I might add.  Not sure why I felt that way but I just did.  On the way home something remarkable and completely unpremeditated happened.  I called Bill.  That's right, I finally did it.  At 10:15 I picked up the phone and called him wihtout even thinking.  He didn't pick up and I left him probably one of the most sincere messages I have ever left.  No joking, none of my usual antics, just a genuine interest in how he was doing and a sincere hope for him to call me back.  We'll see....  I won't hold my breath."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Has anyone else seen the Toyota commercial for the Sequoias...the one with all of the beautiful children and the children are saying things like ""some day I'll be walking down the aisle"" and then this other little boy says the killer of all comments, ""Someday, I'll take my children to the same places my parents took me....""  I tear up every time I see it...I think I need to write to Toyota and tell them what a bang up job they did! Two thumbs up.  And yes, only me...well me and Lindsey cry at commercials."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Dearest Flora,      In light of recent events, it has been made abundantly clear to me that you are a much smaller human being then I had originally given you credit for being.  You see, and forgive me for assuming, I thought that for the most part we were past the events of October of last year...however I now know that we are not.  Thanks for the memo.      Your manipulative efforts may work on weaker minds, such as your beloved boyfriend, but on stand-up individuals like Keegan and Christopher they are altogether lost.  For as much as you would like to make a dent in my and Keegan's relationship, it will  never  happen.  I promise you that.  It is most laughable that you thought for even a nanosecond that Keegan would go to Pete's birthday party without me.  Hell, she despises him as much as I do and here's one for you...she knows as much about the situation as I do...she knows everything!!!  Every last detail.       I don't pity your current situation, nor do I pity either one of you.  You both will get what you deserve and right now you deserve each other.  It all comes back to karma and in a way, I am your karma.  I supposedly did to you what you had already done to countless others.  Oh and Flora, do you forget what I know??  And is Pete dumb enough to think that I don't remember every little detail he'd ever told me about himself??  I think my information may come in handy one day.       I promised myself that I would always be a lady given the current climate...I will continue to do so.  But I'm disappointed in you.  Your actions as of late were not in your best interest.  You're capable of better.  It was your idea to sweep everything under the rug, so don't go airing your dirty laundry now.  It's a bit late for that, don't you think?     Now I know that all you every truly aspired to  be with that 1.8GPA of yours was Mrs. Pete Frank complete with the Jonathan Club and LACC memberships, but really...did you ever think that would come to pass??  They have these nasty little things called membership committees to ensure that your kind never even see the ladies room.  You possess no class and everyone will always know that you're not a part of the club...you'll give yourself away.  You'll take all of the fun out of guessing what hole your family crawled out of...it's a pity really.       I suppose this is all for the best because given your behavior this past weekend, I am washing my hands of you and your little dog, too.  You will cease to exist to me and I will always know that I acted in a respectable manner.  I think a part of me always hoped that we could work things out, but I see that you're too small for that.  I wish you the best.   regards,    janielle"
09SDT6G,female,24,"Everyone, or at least most people have a core group of friends, The Breakfast Club as I like to call them.  Well in my case I am fortunate enough to be surrounded with larger than life characters....this is all fine and well until one day something/someone rocks the boat and drama ensues.  This is precisely what happened to me a few months ago......and I'd be lying if I told you that I didn't think about it everyday.  Sometimes people can surprise you and you realize that for having shared so much and given so much of yourself, you never really knew this person at all.  In your mind's eye they were the kind of person that had you known them at the tender age of 6, you would have carved their name in a tree alongside your own or you always thought they would be the friend that your own children would refer to as 'aunt' XXX minus the blood relation.    This is not always so.  Things happen.  People change, it's human nature.  It used to be a pleasant little kingdom.    I've been told on numerous occasions that love is never having to say you're sorry, but in actuality that is precisely what it is.....sometimes sorry is enough to alleviate the pain of any situation and sometimes, not even love is enough.    It was a pleasant little kingom, full of pleasant little things.  Lots of gardening and fixing, all very outdoors.  And in the driveway is a sports car I shouldn't have bought.....and if on occasion I think about you......I eliminate the thought.    I can't really say that I'm sorry........the castle needs repair and I never shed a tear.  What I am sorry for is that you'll have missed out on some of the best people you ever could have hoped to surround yourself with.....all for the life that you've envied for so long.  Good luck with that, you've sold your soul."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Hopelessly Confused  Just because something isn't wrong doesn't necessarily  mean that it's right either. I feel like I live my whole life this way. We tend to rationalize things as being right simply because there is nothing wrong with them. Whether it is a relationship or a work situation, the lack of cons doesn't add up to pros. But the risk of change brings fear that it could be worse. Is it better to stay put because you are content rather than risk the possibility of misery?  I am eating myself up inside with thoughts of the future and the present. I want to make sure that the present facilities a pleasant future, but at the same time I don't want a present that is consumed by thoughts of the unknown quantity. I guess that is the problem you must face when you have a ""day job"" which only provides monetary compensation. To ask yourself to rely on the faith of your dreams to make it all seem worthwhile. But all faith wavers. Faith is hard, it questions you everyday. I worry about the one day when it pushes me to the brink. So naturally I wonder where I want to be on that day.  The saying goes: ""expect the worst, and hope for the best"" (or something to that effect). Dreams require so many elements to come together in just the right formation and time. And in the right place. Maybe leaving one place will tamper with the set course or maybe it will spark it.  And then comes the issue of loyalty. I'm naturally an extremely loyal person. I feel like I'm betraying a person or a place by even looking to change situations. There is always a huge problem when one is loyal and also non-confrontational. I don't want to leave my situation but I don't know how to change it. If I fix the problems then I might realize that the car is still a piece of crap. Or worse yet maybe it needs a whole new engine.  My confusion is only made arithmetically worse by my emphasis of my decision being the end all be all of my life. Why do I weight my decisions in the next few weeks to be earth shatteringly important when really every single decision we make alters our path in life. I'm a fool for thinking and a fool for not thinking enough. I see the road in front of me... I'm just not sure what exit to take. I hope that if I take the wrong one then at least it will be easy off/ easy on."
09SDT6G,female,24,"I am always amazed by how small the world really and truly is....over the past week my life has mingled with two people that I don't even know.  I'm almost reluctant to explain how, but I'll do so regardless, against my better judgement.  There are two blogs that I read religiously, very different blogs.  I identify with each person in a unique way.  One lives in Canada, the other right here in my very backyard of L.A.  My favorite blog, the woman writing it, we'll call her 'Kerry' has been having this on-going drama with this guy at Coffee Bean...I read Craigslist religiously as well.  I have some kind of sick, twisted fascination with it all.  Anyways, I digress...well the other day I see that she has posted a missed connections for this man.  Now how in the hell else would I have known that if I didn't read her blog daily.  I knew exactly what she was talking about, I knew the story behind the story...much like a friend would know the situation.  It's sick, but I feel like I know this woman.   Then there's this other gentlemen, we'll call him 'Skylar' who is entirely self-loathing, opionionated, crazy smart, and outrageously funny. I check his blog about twice a day because he is constantly updating it.  Well I read it yesterday morning and he's blabbing about how he feels like he should have his own network and wonders if anyone reads his blog that could give him one...then he proceeds to mention how someone from Disney reads his blog twice a day...THAT'S ME!!!  THAT'S ME!!  He mentioned me!!  It's the little things people....  Ok, so I know I wasn't very eloquent just now...but it's strange how all of our lives are woven together.  It's like one gigantic friendster connection only you can see people beyond the three degrees. You may all make fun of me now because I am a gigantic dork!  Happy 80th Birthday Grandma!  I love you!"

You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test.

God, I hate you.   So I was just called 'nifty.'  Of course I've been called worse, but perhaps they should have also inserted 'golly' in there as well.    Christopher, you can take this quiz at thudfactor.com and are our emails having a picnic theme today??"
09SDT6G,female,24,"I just finished watching President Reagan's funeral through a live broadcast on my computer.  It's a bit surreal to see that many leaders and former presidents all congregated in one place, it's rather moving actually.  One of the few times where everyone's differences and political affiliations are put aside.  I think all of us lost it when Bush Sr. started crying.  And of course once again Nancy was the epitome of class and grace.  I envy her composure.  I lose it every time I see her rest her head on his coffin...I think all of us can agree that we hope and pray that one day, someone loves us that much.  Yesterday when I was in the bank waiting in line I was watching the replay of President Bush and Laura going in to the Rotunda to pay their respects and President Bush smoothing out the flag of his coffin like Nancy had previously done.  Great, I then became the girl standing in line with tears in her eyes, that gets me every time.  I had to put my sunglasses on and then realized that was stupid.  However I will state that I am sick and tired of all of these liberals blaming Reagan for the spread of AIDS and the allowance of it to become an epidemic.  No one man is responsible for it.  It sickens me that in his death, people could not muster up the honor and respect that his office commanded.  I'm sure that when President Clinton dies, people won't be standing in the streets spouting off garbage about how he was a womanizer...no, of course not.  He'll be remembered as one of the most beloved presidents in the history of the United States.  Reagan will be remembered as one such president.  My mom told me the other day that President Reagan wouldn't even set foot in the Oval Office unless he was wearing a suit because he felt that the office deserved that kind of respect.  President Reagan was an honorable man.  An asset to this country.  He will be missed."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Yet again, another personality test...I couldn't help myself.  Here's my 'life colors:'  You scored mainly in the Sky-Fire quadrant. This 'yellow' quadrant highlights the fire sign of your personality and your tendency to blaze across the sky like a comet, taking new ideas and concepts and trying to push them into action. You may well have a vivid imagination and enjoy constantly dreaming up new things to do. Because of your fire sign, you will probably push some of these ideas into action before you and others are ready. You may well be a persuasive person when discussing issues you passionately believe in. In these situations, many people may well be influenced by your apparent confidence.  People who map into this quadrant like to connect the future to the present. Your mind may constantly be exploring possibilities concerning where you are going and what you might do with your life. However, there are times when you could become over-enthusiastic and make decisions before you have fully thought about the ramifications. If anything, your mind might be focused on too many ideas at once. This may result in fewer successes, mainly because of your desire to get into action before you have completely done your homework.  For you there are unlikely to be too many problems. Of all the signs, yours describes someone who can turn a problem into an opportunity. Failure is unlikely to disturb you too much as you have a knack of being able to rebound from adversity.  Yep, that's definitely me....HAHAHAHAH"

09SDT6G,female,24,"After a brief hiatus I am back.  Nigel has this uncanny ability to make my blood boil.  I have no clue why I allow him to get under my skin the way he does...maybe it's because he points out my flaws like nobody's business...maybe he's just an asshole.  Yeah, that's it...  We'd been doing well over the past week or so.  Basically he stayed out of my way and I stayed out of his.  We hadn't seen each other in awhile so I thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea if we were social...together.  Once again, I was wrong.  It all started on Saturday when I had a lapse in judgment and invited him to the Galaxy Soccer game.  He was already going with his family.  I was going with Eugenia and John.    Just as I was saying to Eugenia how weird it would be if we ran into Nigel, he comes walking down the staircase next to our seats with his family...TOO WEIRD.  He doesn't notice us.  It was the first time that I had ever seen his family.  To his family's credit, his parents appear very much in love.  He seems to adore her.  Too bad that didn't rub off on their children.  I blame his mother for not hugging him enough as a child.  It's minute 83 of the game and Nigel finally realizes that we're 2 rows behind him.  He sees me and his face gets beet red.  I loved it!  He was mortified.  HAHAHAHA  After the game is over he proceeds to book it out of the stadium, leaving his parents in the dust.  Now one can only surmise that the last thing he wanted to happen was for me to meet his parents...it's like he's ashamed of all of us even though he told me the other day that I would be the only one that he would ever allow to meet his parents.  I think it's just lip service.  The kid's a freak.  End of story.  Cut to Sunday night after a long day at Disneyland with screaming children and ridiculous heat.  I come home, Keegan tells me that he's called.  I call him back.  We all agree to go out for a drink.  All is fine and well.  Keegan gets the grand idea to have everyone back to our house.  Fine.  It's still relatively early.  We all go back and the clan quickly grows.  We're all drinking, laughing, having a generally good time...but that was not to last my friends.  Nigel tells me that he needs to talk to me outside.  I reluctantly agree because as we all know, Nigel+alcohol=drama to the nth power.  As soon as we get outside he proceeds to have the nerve to tell me that I have far too many ugly qualities and that Keegan and I are frighteningly lazy and that we really don't do real work.  My blood begins to BOIL!!!!!  I start yelling and swearing and just generally acting like an idiot.  How dare he talk to me like that...but the buck didn't stop there.  Nope.  He had to make matters worse.  He continues to point out my flaws, question the importance of my job, the likelihood that I would ever have a career, that I have so many good things about me, but my ""ugly qualities"" so many times will overshadow them.  Fine...you know what Nig...LET ME GO!!! And that is exactly what I screamed at him.  I told him just to let me go, not to concern himself with me when he could only find negative qualities about me.    OH AND THE BEST thing of the night happened when he was on the phone with Lauren and I asked him if Lauren was coming over and he proceeded to tell me to shut up and flicked me off...gets off the phone and proceeds to berate me, telling me to ""never do that again, you know better!!!""  THAT'S IT! I'VE HAD IT!  I will not continue to be talked to like this...  So, I tell him to leave...I proceed to tell him that I'm done, not to bother with me ever again.  Forget he ever knew me.  I proceed to tell him that not even Christopher can save his ass with me this time.  He just rolls his eyes at me, I slam the door so hard that I thought for sure the glass was going to break.  I storm inside, Keegan immediately yells at Nigel, ""What did you do to her!!!!""  I go straight upstairs, citing to Keegan that if anyone thinks it would be cute or funny to follow me or wake me up or if Nigel even came within 5 feet of my bedroom door that I was moving out...end of story.  I thought that I could sleep on it...wake up this morning and realize that I had acted irrationally.  I'm a girl and sometimes girls do that...but NOPE!  I am completely in the right.  I did nothing wrong.  In fact, I didn't do enough.  My mind is reeling with things I should have said to that bastard.    Believe me, I thought about firing off an email...but what good would it do...it would just further serve to involve me in this ridiculous game.    The real kicker is that after I was finished yelling, as I was about to go inside Nigel grabs my arm and says in the most arrogant, condescending tone, ""I look forward to being married to you some day.""  I give him the look of death and tell him to go to hell.    Best night ever.  And Christopher, not even you can save it this time.  I'm done.  My unborn children thank me."
09SDT6G,female,24,"""I thought we were hairdressers, not tough guys...""  Best quote EVER from my new favorite show Blowout.  I adore Jonathan and if it weren't for his haircuts costing $700-$800, you bet I'd have him cut these tresses...yes folks, even I have some limits, very few, but some.  I keep telling Keegan that we've got to keep going to Backstage because that's where his stylists hang out...I need to catch a glimpse of them.  Afterall, it's my new favorite show!  Ok so are you ready?!?!  Picture it:  I'm running through O'Hare Airport yesterday with maybe 7 minutes in which to catch a flight, I get on only to find that some woman is sitting in MY seat!  Great!  I find the flight attendant...there is one seat open in the section next to a rather tall man.  I don't really notice who this man is...well I will not keep you waiting.  I sat next to Vince Vaughn for, get this...4 Hours and 22 Minutes!!!!  Yep!  However, now I think he's the best thing ever, but at the time I was annoyed that he wouldn't stop bouncing his leg, even after I had ever so politely asked him to stop.  We chit chatted a bit and the cutest thing ever happened...this mother and her son came up and asked him for an autograph. He happily obliged them (much to my surprise) Also another hilarious point of note, there was so much traffic coming up through first class that the flight attendant had to ask that those passengers in the main cabin not use the first class bathroom.  We had people parading up through there four or five times....perhaps you had to be there to find amusement in it all.  Interesting flight to say the least, I was most entertained and now today after doing a little background check on him I just adore him!!  Dammit!!  Missed connection.  Maybe I need to post for him on Craigslist...KIDDING, TOTALLY KIDDING!!    Tiffany and I decided that he's a 33 year old, troubled, 6'5"" man.  Due to the shear fact that he's 6'5"", we've decided to overlook the fact that he's troubled and somewhat, ok, a lot hyperactive.  He's a smartass.  The best kind."
09SDT6G,female,24,"I forgot to post a review of the latest movie that I've seen.  13 Going on 30.  So the critics seemed to all love it, I saw very few unfavorable reviews about it.  Jennifer Garner on the whole does a good job of playing a 13 year old...but I just know her as Sydney Bristow, CIA agent.  It seems out of character to see this ridiculously muscular back and legs dressed up in frilly Nanette Lepore and Ralph Lauren frocks.  It just doesn't look right...and Fendi purses???  Please.  Sydney likes her latex and leather and Gwen Steffani pink hair.  I guess I could be type-casting her now and pigeon-holing her....like all of my industry lingo??  You too could live in L.A. for 18 months and learn to speak like me.  Scary thought I know.  Overall, it's a cute movie.  Christopher just liked it because he got to gawk at Garner for 97 minutes. I think I may have even detected a little bit of drool out of the left  corner of his mouth...Don't quote me on that though since I was sitting on the left hand-side of him, I have no clue what was going on on the other side.  Perhaps the movie was a little too cookie-cutter and predictable at times.  Although she does get to live in a pink house, what a dream!  I won't say anymore...I don't want to ruin it for you!"
09SDT6G,female,24,"I was once again pleasantly surprised by my friends today...they never cease to amaze me.    Simply: Thank you.  Christopher, I had yet to write it...but I've never been prouder.  You're a good egg."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Yep, definitely can't figure out why my ramblings are posting 4 times.......still working on it.  My apologies.  How embarrassing that I even jack my blog up!    So I just read a gentlemen's blog that I regularly read and I saw that he has deleted all of its contents and archives.  Apparently it had cost him his job and the Canadian government was tracking his writing....weird.  He said how strange it is to have googled himself and found that he was listed 24,000+ times and then another gentlemen also took down his blog because he felt he was being stalked......but isn't that kind of to be expected if you display your life in explicit detail for all the world to see??  You knew what you were getting yourself into, but this is not to say that inquiring minds necessarily want to read about your grocery list and what you wore to work today either.  Just make sure it's interesting, entertaining...it doesn't even have to be profound or what I've found to be the cliche on here...political.    I watched one of the most beautiful movies that I have ever seen yesterday....What Dreams May Come.  Visually stunning, terrible reviews.....but stunning nonetheless.  I guess it's not exactly a pick-me-upper, I mean the story of a man dying in a car crash and then his wife taking her own life out of insurmountable grief, only to have her husband travel into the depths of hell to bring her to heaven......afterall, they were soulmates.    Soulmates and their existence is a question I have long asked myself.....I suppose I'll get it when it does/doesn't happen to me.  Although I don't necessarily believe that soulmates have to be individuals that we were/are romantically involved with, there might just be a magnificent connection.  A cosmic connection one might say.    In other news:  new Nora Jones album coming soon.  Hopefully I'll actually be able to listen to this one without too many bad memories coming rushing back to me."
09SDT6G,female,24,"I thought I would give a status update on my first ever eye injury.  After a much anticipated doctor's visit, Dr. Linda Vu (pronounced like Woo) diagnosed the problem as me having irriated my eye and there being ever so slight scratches.  Treatment:  eye drops 3 times a day for a week.  Riiiiiight.  The thought makes me ill and you would think that I was a 4 year old with the way I carry on when the drops must be dropped.  Hopefully by the end of the week I'll have become accustomed to it and it won't be such a dramatic event.  Don't hold your breath.    Oh and I almost forgot, she also told me that my cornea is scarred from one time having had a mild case of pink eye and not treating it.  Wacky.    And as Christopher says ""only you could create drama from Craig's List.""  I will indeed make it another day.  Oh and for the record I would like to state that Brian (few of you are going to know who that is) said that my antics and drama queen like tendencies are and I quote ""very cute.""  See, someone appreciates my lunacy.    Today I filled out my first ever absentee ballot so that I could vote for my brother in an upcoming Pennsylvania election since I have yet to make CA my certifiable home.  You wanna know what's scary?? I had difficulties doing it and apparently since I've been taken off of the tax roll (yeah, don't ask...I don't know what it is either) I may not even be eligible to vote.  Another thing that is problematic is that when I was talking to my brother I told him that I was going to have to call him when I received the ballot so that he could tell me who to vote for.  Now that is scary!!  There are countries where people still die for the right to vote and here I sit not even abreast of the issues, being told who to vote for...but in all fairness, those who know me best know that with a check mark in the wrong box I could loose my happy home.  ;o)    That's all for now. I'm leaving the office soon."
09SDT6G,female,24,"All is well that ends well.  Meeting went off without a hitch.  Ivy really seemed to like me, she felt I was articulate and insightful.  We seemed to see eye to eye on many of the topics.  Yay!  I have a meeting scheduled with her in the next few weeks to talk about ideas/concerns for the project.  I'm the best!  Although lunch was a little lacking therefore I'm ditching out of here earlier than planned so I can eat!"
09SDT6G,female,24,Finally I took the number out of my cell phone.  Finally I deleted the countless emails from my inbox.  Finally I woke up.  It was time.  Long overdue.  I'm emotionally drained.
09SDT6G,female,24,"Tonight's the night.  Dave and I are finally getting together for drinks after two long months of phone tag, business trips, and I think just a general avoidance of each other. (well at least on my part)  Right now I'm not really feelin' it.  I'm going to go and go through the motions.  You think this horrible of me, I'm sure.  But I've got packing to do for Vegas, errands to run, bills to pay....it never ends.  It's just one of those things where I lost interest.  Kind of like that fuschia Trina Turk sweater you just have to have because it goes so well with your black DK poncho, only to loose interest in it a few months later because you got the cashmere fuschia sweater that you wanted originally.  (yep, I'm sick)  I think that it's best in these cases to hope for the best, expect the worst.  My fear is that I'm going to have to put a muzzle on him because he tends to talk.....a lot.  And by that I mean....a lot.  It's difficult to get a word in edge wise and he's so passionate about what he does that he just rambles.  I admire his voracity for the subject, we should all be so lucky as to love what we do....but curb it, for one night....please, I'm begging you.    I think that I'm destined to be alone.  I find the most minute details about people troublesome and I obsess over them until it's like they'd commited 1st degree murder and just can't focus on anything but my hang-up with whatever it is I'm hung up on.  A gentlemen that I work with told me today that the best advice he ever received was, 'never get married.' (this coming from a married man)  Perhaps there's some truth to this statement, however it's a bold one at best.    It's ok, I'm destined for greatness.  Like I once told someone, your life will stand out in tremendous ways....and I meant it."
09SDT6G,female,24,"So much happened this weekend I don't really even know where to begin.  I guess I'll take it from the top.  Friday night I went out with Andy, Chris, and Nigel to West Hollywood (or Hairdresser Hollywood as Nigel so lovingly coined it) We went to The Belmont, great place, lots of beautiful people, men were a bit Ryan Secrest-y.  Good drinks, good food, overall good time...that is until the inevitable happened and Nigel did his usual drunk routine.  We proceeded to leave that bar and make one more stop before going home because of course Nigel became a baby and of course he had to go home so he could call his high school teacher.  Wacky.  Not worth talking about any further than that, really.    So we go to this other bar and Nigel decides that this is the appropriate time to lay in to me about his feelings or lack-thereof for me and mine for him.  I should have walked away then but of course didn't.  He proceeds to tell me that although I'm a good person, I could be better, that I'm a pretty girl, but could be a better person and that we all have this five year window in which to change our ways and if we don't do it then, we'll never do it because it's that much harder to change once that five year window closes.    As I'm trying not to laugh and giving him a blank stare, I ask him what exactly he feels needs to change...his answer ladies and gentlemen and I quote: 'If you don't already know, I'm afraid I can't help you.'  Thanks Nig, I always knew that I could count on you to help me when times get tough!  The conversation only proceeds to go downhill from there.  I'm proud of myself for maintaining my composure and for those who witnessed it, they too felt that I was trying to be the rational one in the bunch.  I kept my mouth shut (for once) didn't get emotional, and basically just let it roll off my back and chalked it up to another one of Nigel's sermons on how he is so much more evolved then the rest of us.  Next.  Saturday morning I was very proud of myself because I got up and went to the gym and did my full work-out.  As the day progressed I was a little hesitant to go out that night, but when it got down to the wire, Keegan and I stepped up to the plate and rallied.  As she said, the ship is sailing on our youth, let's make the most of it!  Yes kids, we went to Beverly Hills to this really low-key bar.  We loved it!  Great people, great drinks.    So Keegan and I always complain that we never meet anyone...well that all changed Saturday night.  We met Nick.  Nick who proved yet again it's a small small world.  His best friend growing up is one of our good friends from Bucknell.  Madness!    The only way that I can describe Nick is have you ever seen someone that you just know is well-off, not because they were pretentious or flagrant about their wealth, but they just have this air about them?  Well, Nick had this air..as well as a pretty face.  Best of all he was able to withstand my sarcasm, not only did he withstand it, he appreciated it!!  Major points for him.  So we all talked on and off for the rest of the evening.  Nigel of course left in a half-drunken stupor.  My apologies for all of those on the 10 and 110 freeways around midnight on Saturday.  Be thankful he didn't hit you.  Yeah, so we'll see where this goes with Nick.  Probably not far because he couldn't even divulge to me his last name, but we'll see...  Now my big day was Sunday.  First I had Timmy's 4th birthday party...fun, fun.  I miss that family.  They're good people.  Then....the LAKER'S GAME!!  Kevin and I had fantastic seats, 2 rows in front of Arnold and his family.  He's much more attractive in person then on T.V.  Saw tons of celebs...terrible terrible showing from the Lakers.  I still can't believe we lost.  It's the first time that I've ever been in attendance for a game and the Lakers actually lost.  Amazing experience though.  We did however have the unfortunate luck of having a Piston's fan directly in front of us...the only reason that it was quasi-forgiveable was because the guy was hot.  Kevin and I both agreed on that one.  Not that I'm a die hard Laker fan, but he had some nerve showing his face in the Staples Center wearing a Piston's jersey.  He could have gotten himself killed.  But oh how the L.A. fans are such fairweather fans...there was about two minutes left on the clock and we were down by 8.  If one looked around the place you would have thought that the game had been over with for over an hour because all of the fans had booked it to the parking lot so as to avoid traffic.  WAY TO SUPPORT YOUR TEAM PEOPLE!!!  CHEERS TO YOU!!  My God, you probably payed $1,000 for your seat and $100 for a few luke warm beers, at least stay the whole time.  On a more depressing note, former President Reagan died this weekend.  I think Democrats and Republicans alike can agree that Reagan was one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.  He was the eternal optimist and president for the greater part of my childhood.  I grew up in the Reagan years, his administration marked a turning point for the U.S.  We are the great nation we are today due in large part to many of Reagan's policies.  My condolences and best wishes to his family."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Last night I had a delightful evening with Kevin, Brian, and ""Paul the Model.""  We had dinner at the highly acclaimed Normans on Sunset.  My verdict: less then stellar.  I wasn't impressed.  Granted the decor is beautifully done, the kitchen is unparalleled with it's glass enclosure and tables in the middle of it for special patrons, and the service is bar none.  But it still didn't lessen the difficult time I had finding anything on the menu that I would even attempt to eat... so for my starter I settled on Vietnamese Spring Rolls with tuna sashimi.  Yep, I was that desperate.  For my main dish I had Key West Sole with asparagus and potatos in a salsa butter sauce.    By the end of our 3 1/2 hour dinner and $100 a person later, I was asking to be taken to In 'n' Out so I could eat dinner.  Everyone got quite a laugh and I think they all concurred on some level, but it was Brian's birthday so whatever Baby Brian wants, Baby Brian gets.  The real highlight of the evening was my determining Brian to be a ""Club Level Drunk.""  Paul laughed hysterically at the phrase and found it to be oddly perfect.  Brian even liked it and found it a suitable title for himself.    Best of all was for the grand total of 230 minutes I was able to forget."
09SDT6G,female,24,"An Open Letter To Several  People:  Someday when I hear Nora Jones, I won't think of you.  Someday I won't be mad at you.  Someday I will travel back in time and get you that record you really want.  Someday I will leave the room before saying that one thing that completely pisses you off and ensures three days of silence.  Someday you won't be mad at me.  Someday when we run into each other I'll look amazingly good and you'll look like shit.  Someday we'll be able to talk to one another without the conversation dissolving into an acrimonious debate about nothing.  Someday I'll see you on TV and regret turning you down.  Someday I'll think of the way your hands looked when you danced and I'll smile.  Someday we'll be able to finish each other's sentences.  Someday I'll sell all of the letters you wrote me from Paris to a tabloid.  Someday we'll play hookey together.  Someday I'll be a character in your book.  Someday you'll wake up next to me and that will be enough.  Someday I'll wonder what your children look like.  Someday when I'm living in London I'll think I'll see you so I'll chase after you but I'll never quite catch up and I'll always wonder if you faked your death.  Someday I won't regret having met you.  Someday I'll thank God for having met you.  Someday you'll call out of the blue and we'll talk like no time has passed.  Someday I'll let you sleep on my couch and we'll lie awake, separately.  Someday I'll save the drama.  Someday you'll stop saying you're sorry.  Someday you'll say you're sorry and mean it.  Someday I'll forget you.  Someday we'll be together again."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Last night I made the mistake of watching 'Forever Eden.'  Now I should have known better because the show was clouded in secrecy, it involved 'paradise' with 12 beautiful strangers, and the real tell-tale sign that it is doomed for failure, FOX was the network that dreamed it all up.  Let's be honest folks, beautiful strangers was a term used terribly loosely here.  These people are 4's at best.  I think the real problem is that the networks are running out of morons to apply for their half-witted shows and frankly there just aren't enough people left willing to be the laughing stock of their home town.....not even in toothless Alabama.  My prognosis for Forever Eden:  TRASH!!  Hardly a plot, ugly people, stupid premise.  Show won't last.  Now on to Average Joe.  I half-heartedly followed this show, but from what I did see I was able to discern that while Larissa was beautiful, she was about as sharp as a marble.  I must admit I really thought the average joe was going to win this time.  Now of course Gil was gorgeous, but he too was less interesting than watching paint dry.  They deserved each other, that is until he freaked out on her for her ex-boyfriend having been Fabio.    Ok, whoa Chief....she's not with him anymore.  The guy's a joke and needs a haircut.  Why are you getting all bent out of shape??  Ladies and gentlemen, survey says:  He was looking for an out.  And she served it to him on a silver platter.  Done and done.  Bottom line for this show is that the ending was very unsatisfying....I wanted her secret to be that she had been harboring a child in the jungle the past few months or that she was formerly a man....something, anything but the fact that her ex-boyfriend was Fabio.  Shame on you NBC.  Leave that kind of garbage to FOX or the WBN.  Luckily you've still got The Apprentice going for you.    The only person who made out on this deal is Brian.....women will flock to him after Larissa dumped him.  He deserves better than her and I must say that his transformation was fantastic throughout the duration of the show.  Yay for stylists.  He would have made even the Fab 5 proud."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Keegan has this ridiculous habit of thinking that every time we see someone, she knows them....seldom, if ever is she correct.  Hell, we could be watching an AT&T Wireless commercial and she'll swear that she knows the person in it.   Last night at Carmine's was no different.  We both noticed a girl sitting at a corner table that we couldn't place.  We racked our brains for over an hour, calling mulitple side bars from the boys to discuss it, but we came up empty handed every time.  Finally I knew that she had to work at Amadeus.  Keegan (as terrible as this sounds) could place her bringing her something to drink before she got her hair cut.  Yes I know, we're sick.   This girl finally comes over to our table to bum a cigarette.  Keegan immediately tells her that she recognizes her and asks her if she works at Amadeus.  Her response (are you ready?!?) ""No I work at Jonathan's, are you both stylists?!?""  We of course kind of giggle to ourselves and all I can say is ""I love him!""  Over and over....and over and over.  I looked like a lune!  It was Kimberly, Jonathan's assistant/new hair stylist who took 4 hours to cut some guy's hair in the last episode.    Oh. My.God.  Most of you have no idea how much I love Jonathan.  This is a dream come true for me.  I want nothing more then for him to cut my hair.  And she was in Pasadena!!  We might be neighbors and I don't even know it! Imagine it!  We could become friends, she could tell Jonathan that she met the perfect girl for him...Shut up, Kevin.  He likes girls, this one's in my family!!  AHHHHHHHHHH!!    You would think that after all of that excitement, my night couldn't have gotten any better...I've got  4 words for you: ""Amish in the City.""  Learn it.  Love it.  You'll be a better person for it."

No one cares that you arrived in a Prius and were environmentally friendly because the line of Bentleys behind you just more than cancelled out your efforts. And besides, tomorrow you'll go back to driving your Range Rover and sitting in traffic for 2 hours on the 405 to get back to your Bel Air mansion....your good deeds are lost to most of us.  What statement were you trying to make again???  Also, please check your political views, rants/raves at the door.  It's not really the time or the place.  Sean Penn, I'm looking in your direction.  I like you, I think you're talented.....but you're receiving Hollywood's 'highest honor.'  Just leave well enough alone, thank your hoards of fans, your lovely wife that day in and day out puts up with your quirkiness and forgives the fact that you were at one point married to Madonna (no easy thing to overlook) and sit down.  You are now part of the Hollywood elite after being denied access to the club 3 times prior to last night.  Be grateful because the Oscar gods may never shine down upon you as brightly as they did last night....Applauding for Charlize, her speech was heartfelt, emotional....the people loved it and they love you.  Overall, just one complaint.  People, thank your fans.  We make your life possible.  We go see your movies, we buy the DVD's, thank us because without us you are nothing."
09SDT6G,female,24,"One roundtrip plane ticket to San Francisco given as a birthday gift.  Flora is going to be using this ticket in the next few hours to go spend the weekend with Bill.  I'd be lying to you all if I said that I wasn't envious.  When Keegan told me last night my stomach turned and I literally felt ill.  It makes me sick to know that he can return her phone calls, even devote 48 hours for her entertainment in a city far too sophisticated for her kind and yet he can't even return my phone call.  Like my mom said, I guess I now know where I stand.  Not that I didn't before.      Keegan and I are going to be going to San Francisco at the end of August and I can safetly say that I have no intention of contacting him while there.  He has more then made it clear that he wants no part in any kind of a friendship with me.  But that got me to thinking...if you'd put such great energy and emotion into someone previously and before you left you made it clear that you wanted to remain friends, then what is the harm in returning a phone call or an email...the small gesture is almost effortless and creates less heartache and at the  very  least puts your mind at ease.  Why!?!?      I've never really had any sort of reasonable explanation for why he acts the way he does...I have a pretty good idea.  But I'm sorry Bill, that excuse is quickly getting old.  You can't use it forever.  It's tired.      I guess Flora's going to visit him really irks me on another level because he never wanted me around his friends citing that they wouldn't like me and I them...yet he'll let one of the most un-PC, obnoxious, over bearing people I've ever met in my life around them.  Makes no sense.  Perhaps he wants his San Francisco friends to know that he associates with trash.    I think I'm a glutton for punishment.  I want to be able to ask someone some day how I met them and I want their response to be, ""because I willed you here."""

(walking in minor silence) me:  Let's just keep walking until we can't walk anymore Princess:  Yeah, right...and who do you think would be the first one to stop. me:  certainly not me... Princess:  Woman, who's the runner here.... me:  Yeah, well who was the gym goer 5 months ago.  I rest my case.  In light of such evidence, I would be the first to stop walking.    In other news.   I made the colossal mistake of watching Newlyweds last night.  That's it!  I'm done.  I can't take it anymore.  Television is not supposed to make your head hurt.  I now understand why geniuses are overlooked in this world because the producers behind Jessica Simpson's show are making morons stars and making light of the fact that the public school system in Texas failed....failed miserably.  Apparently she believes that there are white pigs in Germany that produce Bratwurst because it's white. Riiiiiight.  It's just incredible to me that people like her continue to make millions and I don't care what anyone says...She is just plain, straight-up dumb.  I'm tired of the media outlets sugar coating her stupidity and vouching for her intelligence.  If you have to say it, chances are you're not too bright.  And yes Jessica, we are lauging AT you, not with you.  Oh and Jessica, you're no comedic genius...the only reason you're scoring any points is because these pathetic, over-sexed adolescent boys find you attractive therefore boosting your stock and forgiving you your stupidity.  I am not so forgiving.  I am no longer watching Newlyweds.  If you commit it to print it's a solemn vowel.    Oh and I almost forgot to share my most favorite thing that happened today.  My friend Andy posted a missed connection to me on Craig's List.  Now normally this wouldn't be the way to my heart, but I loved it!  Thanks Andy Gar. (payback for the Jackson comment)  I inherited my superstar qualities from you.  You give me my extra spitfireness.....  I also need to thank Andy for introducing me to the fun-filled world of Craig's List.  Now I know what you're thinking, that I'm the last person alive to learn about this and see it's value, but I think I rebeled against it for so long because I knew that once I got involved I would be hooked.  I was right!  I now spend my days reading blogs and Craig's List.  The way things are looking now, I'm not going to have time for work."

(did you like that twist lindsey?) but he was filming some movie for a class where these drunken teenagers are having a party and they're really loud so this zombie wakes up (brian) and he's gonna go eat them but when he gets there he decides to grab a beer and play some twister. but in the end it's really like a lesson on how drinking is bad because some drunk guy is gonna give him a ride home (to the cemetery i guess......) and brian says ""no. you're drunk man."" so then he bites the persons hand to get the keys away and they're gonna zoom in on this fake bloody hand for the right effect and all.  so it was really uncomfortable being around all of those people and we were around the corner from max and drew's so i wanted to just go and get stoned but maggie either wouldn't or couldn't leave..... i still don't understand why..... but it didn't matter because we were outside smoking and this kid Ian comes out with the video camera and said he needed a shot of the front of the house so we could just stand right there. but anywho he was wearing a pink floyd shirt so, naturally, i asked him if he smoked pot and, naturally, he said yes so i ask this kid if he would give me some and he goes inside and gets his dugout for me and he had the cutest little piece from his mom..... and i got stoned. and then things weren't so bad.   so we left there and went back to kevin's and watched parts of labrynth (god damn spelling), detroit rock city (what a kick ass fucking movie), some of chappelle's show, some of thirteen, and care bears......  so now i'm home and my fingers are going numb cause it's so fucking cold down here in the depths of hell but i'm working in my free time on a note to my mother in the event of my tragic death. i'll post it upon completion. but how about some new quotes!  ""i just heard you speak through my nose..... does my nose have ear drums? nose drums!""  ""now, i said, hand over my FUCKING drumsticks mom..... please.....""  ""if the lesson is you are a penis with ears and a bad haircut, then yes, i have learned a lesson.""  but now i am sad becuase i can't find the song that mario was singing...... and all i wanna do is hear it right now....... but all i hear is time bomb..... and for the life of me i cannot remember what he said the song was called..... but i wanna go look up that band Air or whatever.... and grand daddy....... good bye my children."

BIUWHTT,female,16,wow. today really sucked. ashleigh won't even talk to me anymore. and she told britni that i supposedly called her a whore. what the hell. i love britni and if i ever said anything it would always be in a joking manner. jeez ashleigh i thought you knew me. and your the one who wants to kill nate for telling brittany all the crap you said about her. what the hell. today at lunch it seemed as if she was trying to come onto brady. did you notice that brady? i think she wants maggie to get jealous or something. i dunno. and my best friend emily broke down crying today because everyone keeps giving her so much crap for going out with max. like it's really their business to express their opinions of someone else's relationship to their face. emily never cries. it's the worst thing to see. i can't wait till i'm older. and i can move out. or move away. or just leave. i don't know. i've got to do something or else my head is going to explode. i swear.
BIUWHTT,female,16,"all day i feel stupid. and i know it's because of the drugs. but i don't know what's worse. feeling stupid or wanting to die. when i'm stoned i'm just happy and i don't care what happens i just live in the moment and have a good time. when i'm sober i feel stupid because of the pot but i'm just not happy.  i'm fucking depressed as hell and it's just so hard to think of how fucking sad i'm going to be now that i'm quitting.  i work every day this next week and i think i might just stay home and have some alone time and try to clear my head. i know i won't be able to make it without at least seeing emily. but i just really want to be alone.  i don't know if i've said this before, but i find it really hard to believe that suicidal thoughts aren't normal. i mean, it blows my mind to think that something like that never even crosses other people's minds when i think about it everyday. and this isn't a god damn cry for help. i'm not going to kill myself. i just think about it. a lot.   and i  know  i've said this before, but i really don't like talking about this stuff. that's why i type it into here.  i made this thing for you guys, in case you felt like knowing what's going on in my head. that way i don't have to talk to you about it. i have a lot of social problems. i never know how to tell you guys how i truly feel. and i really want to start being honest with you. i just don't want to hurt you."
BIUWHTT,female,16,"i'm really sick of this, guys. i mean, nothing bad has happened today at all but i'm still depressed as hell and i don't even know why. i mean, it would make sense for me to be sad and for no one else to know why. just me and my reasons that i don't feel like sharing. but i hate this feeling that i don't even know what's wrong with me. it's ME. why can't i let myself in on what the fuck is going on. i'm out of energy. i'm done with caring. i just don't give a shit anymore.  and i don't know if i've said it before, but i fucking hate it when people bring up stuff i've said in my blog during everyday discussions.   there's so much i want to say to you, i just don't want you to hear it. i can't bear to see the look on your face. and this was supposed to be my happy blog. fuck this. i just don't know how to express myself freely when people are going to read this later. it's time to write in my other blog........"
BIUWHTT,female,16,"you know, you can relate and sypathize and talk through things. but no one will ever really understand you. you'll never even understand yourself. and i just can't comprehend these things right now. my eyes are flickering and all i can do is wonder whether or not i've done my homework. i need to crash. but in order to crash, i would have to do something to make me high in some way. and drugs are out of the question now. and caffeine hurts. i guess i'll just go and sit in my bed until i can't think anymore and at least feel like i'm asleep. who am i trying to kid? i tell myself that i don't need medication or any help for that matter but i really don't know what the fuck i'm doing. i don't know what's wrong with my brain. for some reason i think i would sleep like a baby if i was on the big couch in brandon jones' apartment. i just can't think of any other place that would make me actually sleep."
BIUWHTT,female,16,"i'm back. yes it's really me. just to inform anyone who cares, today is the 17th birthday of my best friend emily. and this saturday is my 15th. if anyone really cares. i don't really have much else to say, except another thanks to brady for telling me about this. you should check out his blog at cheeseyfeet.blogspot.com. he's a cool kid. even if he does have a funny haircut..... no i'm just kidding brady. well, i have to go look up kanji for japanese. damnit. bye for now."
BIUWHTT,female,16,ok brady i really need your help. i just started to write a new blog and then i lost it and it said it saved it but i don't know where to get it back from and i tried to change the template and it erased all my first entries. aaaargh.  what do i do?

BIUWHTT,female,16,"when the fuck did this have to do with drugs? i mean, i hate to bring it up again, but i'm just in awe right now that this whole thing had to do with drugs and i never even knew drugs had anything to do with it? really though, how DO drugs have anything to do with it? the last argument we had about drugs is when you said you were quitting and not to call you if we were just going to be smoking so then we didn't call you and you got angry and said you were just kidding when you said you wanted nothing to do with it. what the fuck. now i'm getting worked up because since then i don't think any part of this fucked up fucking argument has had anything to do with drugs..... i mean sure drugs were involved with the lindsey thing but i thought the main ordeal there was controlling people and putting people in charge of other people and the drug thing didn't really matter is was just a part on the instance and what the fuck i'm just going to stop because i'm getting really worked up about nothing and i'm not angry i just have no fucking clue where all of this ""blaming it on the drugs"" shit came up and why do you assume that i think i can only be happy when i'm on drugs? what the fuck? i RARELY fucking do anything anymore and i could care less i'm not like some fucking zombie that just walks around school thinking about drugs and wait for school to get out just so i can get back to my precious drugs. what the fuck i mean sure, drugs make me happy. but that doesn't mean i fucking depend on them for happiness. i'm sorry that my brain is fucking unbalanced and i'm usually depressed all the time to the point of constantly wishing i wasn't such a chicken shit and could just get it all over with and just pretending everything's okay for you kids and my mom and that drugs just make me happy when i'm having a bad fucking day but god damn it's not like i can't be happy unless i'm fucking stoned or speeding.

BIUWHTT,female,16,"last night geebes drove us to the loop for the midnight show at the tivoli. oh god. he put drew in charge of the music and we ended up listening to eighties tunes the whole way..... he was dancing like crazy too. it was wonderful. geebes and drew and blue all tried to sing the high pitched voices of the girls and everything. i wish you guys could have been there.  so the movie was evil dead 2 and i was the only one who hadn't seen it so this scary part was coming and i didn't know what was going to happen and BAM! drew squeals and throws his popcorn up in the air and it lands all over me and he's just laughing and my heart was racing... he scared the shit out of me.... they picked on me the whole night because emily had stayed at the apartment with max and i had no one to defend me..... and everytime i had a fucking cigarette drew was like ""shame on you. especially you."" just because he quit a while ago and thinks it's horrible that i smoke at ""such a young age"".  they were all really drunk. and i think geebes might have snorted a bit before he came to pick us up. he's such a weird kid...... so we're driving back and we stop at that gas station (maggie you know the one. the one with no bathroom.) and i find this like 40 ounce can of beer at my feet and i hand it to blue and he sets it down by his feet and later we hear this hissing sound and apparently there are holes in the can and somehow it was shooting up towards me so there was beer all up in my shiny shoe...... so blue chucks it out of the window on this busy street and everyone puts their seat belts on real quick in preparation of getting pulled over. but we didn't. so we're getting onto the highway and geebes is telling us about how one night he was really fucking drunk and driving on the same exact road except he had like ""triple vision"" or some shit and was demonstrating how he was driving and i had the only seat belt that didn't work so i'm holding onto the shit handles and drew is screaming like a little girl and blue starts to throw up a little bit. so geebes quit it. oh yeah so we finally get back to the apartment around two and drew and blue go up to the patio and i'm being the nice one waiting for geebes to see if he needs any help or anything and he goes to the trunk and grabs this box of beer bottles.  glass  beer bottles. all of a sudden there's this huge crashing sound and beer is everywhere and geebes looks like he's going to cry only he's too damn happy and wired to cry and there's beer in my hair. and on my pants. and, oh yeah, there's more in my shoe.    lindsey, you know the fun facts? max's ""five fun facts""? you want to know what the fifth one was? because emily told me and i wish she wouldn't have because it's really no fun at all..... damnit.   the city museum kicked ass on friday and we need to go again to visit the feminine drew but we will bring the masculine drew along as well.   what a long post... i have to go feed my neighbor's cats and pick up a pack from emily's house for the show tonight. bye guys."

BIUWHTT,female,16,i really like the idea of how i'm going to start hanging out with lots of people and meeting new kids while i still hang out with all of my friends now. but i also start to panick a little bit when i think about meeting people. like i know i'll be akward and stupid if i ever end up in the same room as beautiful steven. and i don't even like him. i just think he's pretty. man pretty. but i'll still act like a fool.

As you can probably tell, I'm bored as fuck right now. I just posted three times in like, five minutes. That has to be breaking some kind of I-have-no-life record. I actually think I've broken that record more than once. About a year and a half ago, I found out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie-pop. I think it was like, 365 to get to the actual tootsie-roll center, and 984 to get all the hard-candy shit off so all you have is a tootsie-roll on a now limp stick.  You know what cereal I haven't had in a long time? Cap'n Crunch. I love Cap'n Crunch. Or, at least, from what I remember, I  think  I love Cap'n Crunch. I remember they have (or had, for all I know) the peanut butter kind, and the kind with the ""berries"", and then they made the kind with the berries and the green things. I want some of those green things. Next time I'm this bored I might walk to the store and buy some. I'm too lazy right now.  I'll shut up and stop taking my boredom out on you.

This drilled into my head the impression that if anyone did call for my parents while they weren't home, they were hiding in the bush out front, waiting for the cue to come kidnap me.   Whenever my mom or dad had to leave the house, I sat in the front window waving until I couldn't see their car anymore. I think they thought it was because I couldn't bare to see them leave, but I was actually waiting for my kidnapper to pop out of the bushes.  I don't remember when I stopped waving."

6EVFFK2,female,16,"Windows    It's so funny when you do something every day, but never truly realise what you're really doing, or what it really means.  Actually, the funny part is when you do realise.  I'm talking mutual recognition here. Like..when you brush up against someone or talk to someone. The one that gets me the most, though, is when two peoples' eyes meet. It could be purposely or accidentally, willingly, or not. Whatever the reason, or lack thereof, it happens all the time.  Forgive the cheesy names, but for example:  Little Tommy could be looking Little Dorothy in the eyes, telling her how lucky he is to be with her. Of course, he was staring at Little Cindy's ass five seconds earlier, but that's completely not the point.  Or...  Bored Student could be optically wandering the room while Mr. Tohkaloht's voice sings on without her. Longing for something to indulge in, Bored Student's eyes wander up to Tired Student's eyes, and for a moment, their eyes lock. Bored Student is also a victim of Social Anxiety Disorder, so the moment is not quite a moment, but a quarter of a second.  Or...  Suzie could be sitting in her room, thinking about why she had re-decorated the newly painted white kitchen walls with landscapes of greem and orange crayon. Hr cat walks in the room and stares right at her. Suzie takes this as a sign that it's time to play Princess Fluffy, and pulls out her doll clothes and nail polish.  What about...  Ms. S could be in a black-walled chamber with Mr. M. She smiles as she looks at him, his arms chained to the wall, and she takes out a whip.....You know what? We're gonna skip this one...  Well, I was thinking about what is actually going on when people's eyes meet.  By my looking you in the eyes, I would sort of be recognizing your existance, while at the same time, you're recognizing my existance and the fact that I'm recognizing yours. I'd recognize the fact that you'd recognize the fact that I was recognizing your existance, and...  Restrain yourself, Maddie. New paragraph.  ...you'd...  Now.    Anyway, it's pretty cool. It's like...for that that moment, however long it may last, both people are kind of reading each other's minds. They're kind of thinking the same thing, and they both know it.

If you're religious, you have your beliefs, but how can you be sure? I know, I fucking know aleady, it's called faith. Even with faith, you can't be sure. It's comletely possible that when we do die, absolutely nothing happens. It's scary how we can be so uncertain about something so important. I guess we don't really realize how many things we dont know anything about. Of course we wouldn't think of them often, for reasons being....we don't know anything about them. I'm getting confusing now, even to myself. I'll stop.  I seem to have a talent for stating the obvious. See, I did it again!  I've gotten sidetracked now. The point is, when I die, or when the people I love die, I want everyone to know that I love them.

He brought her this guitar, which he bought on E-Bay for $60.00, and he gave it to me. He said I can learn on it, and if I like it, I can buy it for no more than $60.00, or I can borrow it until I know what I'm doing and I know what I really want in a guitar, and then I can go buy something bigger if I'd like. He's so cool.  So, I went and got it restrung at Centre Music, and I taught myself a song when I got home.

That's simply  how it's done.   My little feild trip today brought back a shitload of memories. Just being in that kind of atmosphere again- It's no Vegas, but I won't be getting any closer anytime soon. Who would've guessed that even the dirty parking garages and ashtrays would make want to cry.

6EVFFK2,female,16,"On Drama    Oy.  .6 score and 22 days ago, my highschool hosted a little annual event we like to call Theatre Exchange. Pretty fuckin' cool. We had the school to ourselves for the entirety of a Saturday. Starting at 6AM. Oh boy. It was pretty exciting though, having drama companies that were full of kids that were EXACTLY LIKE US only from Ashland, or Reading, or something. There were six schools there, ours included, and we hung out acting like idiots for a while. Then, we grouped off into workshops where we learned about improv, stage combat, character development, and dance. We ate lunch (thank you, Subway) and we sat in the auditorium watching each others' plays for HOURS. It was really amazing. Our play, the one we would soon be taking to the Massachusetts High School Drama Guild Festival, was  Creation of the World and Other Business , by Arthur Miller. It seriously kicked ass. This drama company is the only thing I will be conceited about in my life. It's  that  awesome. Anyway, after the plays, we all gathered back in the cafeteria for a pizza party/dance thing. I met a few really awesme guys. One of them was adoreable, and I ran outside before he got on his bus to leave in the freezing cold in a tank top to get his screenname. I then found out he had a girlfriend, but it's been really cool to talk to him anyway, hes a good guy.  We took the show to prelims, and we didn't move on. One of the judges had us as her #1 choice, but the two of them couldn't agree on which plays to send on to semi-finals, so they didn't send any of their top three choices. That's bull, but we loved our play, and everyone else did, and we are incredibly proud of everyone. Sorry, I sound like Suzie Sunshine or something, but we had too much fun to be sad about the experience. Fun, fun time. The handcuffs only heightened the fun.  O:)  Now we're working on  Fiddler on the Roof , and trust me, it will be worth seeing, so come if you can. I'm only ensemble, a ""daughter"", but I'm havin a blast, and our main cast is so cool. I love you guys.  I saw my mom's play at New Rep,  Threepenny Opera . A very weird show, but it was so, so great. This is the same group of people (mostly) who put on the production of  Sweeney Todd  last year, which my mom also worked on, and that was THE best peice of theatrical art I have ever experienced. Hey, I'm not the only one who thought so. It recently won, like, 10 Ernies.  I'll keep you updated. I think now I'm supposed to say something along the lines of ""Go Drama"". So... Go Drama.

6EVFFK2,female,16,"Why I Slept Until 2:00PM Today    Cause this time I actually have a reason.  I usually hate blogs that are just ""So this weekend I...."", but it's all I really have to write at the moment.  So this weekend, I had fun.  After school Friday, my neighbors gave me two tickets to the WBCN River Rave. They were looking for someone to give them to because they won the tickets and weren't planning on going. They were box seats. I wasn't complaining. I need to bake some cookies for my neighbors or something...that was too cool of them. Then my mom took me to the mall to buy presents for my friend Erin and my friend Nina. Then I went to Erin's house for her birthday party. It was really cool, cause she's homeschooled, so she dosn't go to my school. Obviously. So she had a bunch of very different friends from many different places, and I didn't know any of them. I loved it. I met a whole group of new people, and thye were all really great kids that I'm glad to know. I'm also really happy for Erin, I think she enjoyed the party a lot. So, I spent the night there, and went home early Saturday morning to start getting ready for my friend Nina's sweet 15.  She's Mexican, so instead of a sweet 16, they ahve a sweet 15, and it's s big deal. It was a formal party, and she had a group of friends who were kind of her bridesmaids of the occasion. I was one of 'em. SO...Afetr I took a shower and stuff, I went over to Joyce's house and we got our hair done. Then we stopped by my house to pick up our dresses and stuff, and went down to Nina's house. We got dressed and took pictures, then took a limo over to the party. We did this big enterance thing, where we all came in in couples, lined up, and held roses over Nina as she walked in with her ""guy"". Then we gave Nina her roses, and sat down at our special little table. In came the Mariachis. Those guys were so cool. That's what I wanna do when I grow up. They sang to her, and she cried, and they kept singing, and then they went onstage and sang some more. She had her dad change her shoes in this big chair thing, from slippers to silver heels, to symbolize her growing up. Then we ate and danced. At 10:00 we, her special friends, did the waltz. It was cool, even though the DJ messed up the song at the end, nobody could really tell. Then we sang to her and she cut the cake, and we ate more, and danced more, and everyone went home at about midnight. We cleaned up and got to her house by 1:00, then hung out there while she opened presents and watched a movie and listened to her parents' friends play guitar and sing in spanish in the kitchen. I loved it. I'm so happy for Nina, cause she spent such a long time planning the party, and I think it kicked ass.  We got to sleep at about 5:00 AM, then woke up at 9:30 cause Joyce and Devan and Jorge and his friend Jose had to go home. Then Shaina left, then Nina and I slept for a couple more hours. Then we walked to Burger King, then ate, then slept. Then slept. Then we got ready and drove down to Mansfield to go to the River Rave. One of my presents to her was one of the tickets. We were a couple hours late, but we still got there in time to see most of the good bands. Box seats are so cool. It's VIP, so they were really good seats, and we had our own   little waitress lady come around to take our order. We ordered drinks and a pizza and a smoothie. Fun stuff. Bands? The Darkness was AMAZING, as well as The Offspring, who was headlining. Dashboard Confessional had good music, but, performance-wise they fell a little short. New Found Glory was fun. P.O.D. Kicked A-S-S. I honestly wasn't expecting them to be that good, but they were. AMAZING performance. Wow. Then we waited in the parking lot getting hit on by drunken boys and watching people set off fireworks for an hour until my mom came to pick us up. Let me just tell you, I love drunk boys at rock concerts. They are SO funny. Then we drove back to my house, and fell asleep in our clothes 'till 10:00, when my mom woke up up to go upstairs cause she had someone coming over, and we were drooling on the couch. We went up to my room and slept until 2:00PM. Then Nina went home.  There you have it; my Memorial Day weekend."
6EVFFK2,female,16,"What About That Dude Named God?    Religion....where do I start?  Both my parents were raised in catholic families, and attended catholic school some point. In my Mom's case, that point would be her entire life until college. Anyway... of course, my parents raised me and my brothers as catholics, taking us to church every sunday and holiday, and ensuring our reception of first communion.  I guess that all kind of fell apart when my parents' marriage did. We still attended church, but only on special occasions. After a couple years, we stopped going altogether.  But, in the past six months or so, I've begun to become increasingly interested in religion again. The only problem is, I've decided that I don't particularly like Catholicism. Watch Stigmata. That's kind of how I feel, only a tad bit less extreme. I'm still kind of confused.  I go to The Root every once in a while, which is a religious group that meets once weekly after school. I have some good friends who are avid participants. Really frickin awesome kids. A couple of them, who attend a Protestant church, invited me to go with them, and i went a couple of times. It felt really good to be involved with religion again, but I still wasn't sure if that was the path I wanted to be on. So I tried the UU church with Mom. Very, very interesting. But definitely not what I'm looking for. So, I kind of stopped going to church for a few weeks because I didn't know where I wanted to go, and I didn't have anyone to go church-taste-testing with, because my mom started working again.  Then: the rally. The kids from The Root put together a Christian rally, and had bands play, kids tell their stories, and an evangelist change people's lives. I'll admit it, during his  little  speech, some things he mentioned hit so close to home that I started to cry. At the end, he had kids come up to the stage who weren't ""right with God"". I'll let you define that for yourself. I went up. It was really cool, because all the kids at the stage were kind of proclaiming in front of everyone the fact that they were going to try to live their lives for God from that point on. There was such a sense of spiritual unity. Plus, it was just fun :)  So, I'm going back to my Protestant friends' church again. I went tonight, for the Good Friday service, and I'm going for Easter, and hopefully the sunday following that, and the one following that, and the one following that....  I'm still not sure if this is exactly where I want to be, but I really do like it, and I love my friends for being so inviting and helpful.  God rocks."

We take ideas from....just about everything that happens to pass into our little brains and is lucky enough not to fall out the other side. We use these ideas and, basically, build ourselves. From the qualities we already have, that we're constantly striving to improve, to the qualities we don't have, and are desperately trying to attain. We become these collages of shit. Good shit, bad shit, that's for you to decide. The final product is pretty much the person we accept as someone we want to be.

ABETS17,male,25,"came across a very interesting article today..    Michael Schumacher has agreed to take on the current rally world champion Sebastien Loeb in December's Race of Champions. The rally-based event will take place at the Stade de France in Paris on a one kilometre, figure-of-eight track.   Schumacher has previously avoided meddling in other forms of motor sports but has had a change of heart and insists he is looking forward to the event. ""I'm really looking forward to it, it looks a lot of fun,"" said Schumacher. Promoter Michele Mouton said: ""We're thrilled he accepted our invitation. Rally drivers will not want to lose to a circuit driver.""    that sounds very cool, but what really piqued my interest here was the name michele mouton. she was the fastest woman in rallying back in the early 80s, and no doubt one of the hottest too!! click on this  urlLink link  for a quick bio. this is what she looks like  urlLink now , trying out the audi nuvolari quattro concept car. this name takes me back to the grand old days of the world rally championship (WRC), when it was still about endurance and car conservation and not the trade plied by the speed merchants today.. the  urlLink audi quattro was the meanest sonofabitch on the roads, and it was driven by  urlLink hannu mikkola , walter rohrl & michele, while peugeot had just gotten out their  urlLink 205 T16  under  urlLink ari vatanen  &  urlLink juha kankkunen .. and the strongest car by far was the  urlLink toyota celica twincam turbo  driven by  urlLink bjorn waldegaard .. good old days.    back then the Safari Rally held in kenya was a 5 day event; unlike what it is  urlLink today , it was over 5,000 kilometers in length, and it had the name ""the toughest rally in the world"".. still is, actually.  urlLink the 50th Safari  was held last year following the original format of kenya, uganda and tanzania in the route.. the driver who won was never the fastest guy, always the smartest guy. bjorn waldegaard, juha kankkunen, local boys  urlLink rob collinge , shekhar mehta and vic preston junior... these were the smart guys.. while ari vatanen, hannu mikkola, walter rohrl, timo salonen & markku alen were the blazers.   some of my most vivid childhood memories of the kenyan countryside were of the safari.. we'd go and camp out in the bush for the period of the rally.. in vast endless savannah plains, with a single rutted dirt track snaking through it.. and a rally car whizzing in from the distance.. trailing clouds of dust behind it.. an orange sunset blazing above the green-brown canopy of thorn acacias that lined the horizon.. a herd of elephants somewhere in the distance trumpet at the intrusion by the turbocharged cars.. giraffe nonchalantly chewing away at the baobab twigs.. antelope grazing shyly, at a respectful distance from the road, casting nervous glances at the thicket behind.. where lions could be lurking, and hyenas behind them, cackling their evil laughs.. yes, those were the days *sentimental flashback memory of home*.. finally,  urlLink here is a link  (click the red tab on the left side that says ""TTE's Images"", then click on Safari) to some awesome images from the Toyota Team Europe (TTE) site for the '99 Safari, which was special to me as it was eth last Safari i saw before leaving kenya.."

'iris' was amazing.. rain and all.. and testament to the buffalonians party spirit, the show was fully packed right up to the fireworks display at the end!! thank god the rain let up in the end so that we could enjoy the fireworks.. that was also really awesome..  came back home and got out of the wets, then ate at Lake Effect.. which is so much like the diner in Archie comics.. then went to 55 tyler and had a couple of drinks, smoked up some stuff.. and chilled out playing cards.. finally crashed at around 6.."

ABETS17,male,25,"those of you who know me know that monday and i are not friends.. there has not been a monday in living memory that i can say that i have enjoyed immensely.. today was no less.. instead of resting my bones after a hard weekend's partying, i had to get up early and go work at the archi. dept. cleanup.. that was fun though.. i'm getting paid good money to play with power tools.. woo hoo :-)) demolished a wind tunnel in a few hours.. its all a huge pile of firewood and screws now.. though i am wondering if i can get the twin fans from it and put it somewhere in the house.. the heat and humidity will NOT be a problem this summer then!!  ahh. monday suddenly got so so much better.. gaurav just got back from india.. brought a bottle of seagram's 'blender's pride'.. nice.. and of course, there was the wills classic as well.. drank well, ate dal-rajmaha-chawwal and had a nice time reminiscing the summer's 'harkatey'!! good times man, good times.."
ABETS17,male,25,"for me every day of the week has started taking some kind of meaning nowadays:   monday:  another weekend down the drain.. time to make a fresh start.. do something meaningful this week   tuesday:  good intentions remain exactly that, good intentions.. targets for the week are hastily recalculated and meetings rescheduled   wednesday:  *big sigh of relief* halfway down the week, the last two days cannot be that bad at all.. somehow this day always whizzes right by me   thursday:  by default we land up at Third Base at night.. so i know whatever happens during the day it will all end well   friday:  will actually do some work cos i always catch my advisor on fridays.. and he keeps scaring me with how far he thinks my work can go!   saturday:  glad that another week has passed without any major dramas, and i still have full use of all my bodily functions.. usually my most inspired day too   sunday:  the one day that everyone sleeps in, i can't! invariably, for some reason or the other, i will be up and about, bright and early on sunday mornings.. and i will be waxing philosophical about the week ahead"
ABETS17,male,25,"woke up bright and early today (ok, ok, stop laughing.. it was 9.15!) went to the MAL to finish my poster, then went for the conference - pretty big do it was.. everyone suited out and stuff.. i, in the spirit of kooky biomaterials engineers on a friday - went in jeans, sneakers and white shirt! have to present my goddamn poster tomorrow.. yuck! the speakers were giants in the field and all, but they failed to keep me interested, or awake!! there was an albert einstein impersonation that was funny, but then he started waxing sentimental and i started waxing jim n' cokes.. so all was well again..  the cocktail after the conference was fun.. nice hor d'oeuvres, and free booze!! knocked back a few buds and jim n' cokes in rapid fire :-)) coming back home on the subway with karrishma and ranjini was fuuun after that!! ;-))  passed by 55, helped sank and vip with a bit of the cleaning, passed up on raghu's birthday party at dawg's.. came home, put on pearl jam and crashed.. long day tomorrow too.

ABETS17,male,25,"sorry this took so long to put up.. but here it is finally.. the account of the road trip we went on last week. also see the pics in the side bar!!   all set for the road trip.. we did get stuck with a stupid small car (chevy aveo) for a while, but then got the dodge neon... bright red in colour.. a little cramped, but will do.. ash, sank, vip, mal and i.. left around 10 on thursday night.. the time in the car was hilarious.. kept on cracking jokes.. ash and sank did most of the driving.. went the harrisburg PA route to get to baltimore at around 6 in the morning.. drove past the bayside area to get to the marriott where vip's sis deepti works.. she took us to her apartment.. we showered and cleaned up, and ate samosas and parathas.. heavenly!! we relaxed for a bit, then went out to walk around the bay area there.. beautiful and warm.. feels great to be out of buffalo!!  drove to washington then.. and got a bit stuck in the crazy traffic.. we'd left b'lo without our atlas.. so struggled manfully with the yahoo maps.. did get a little lost in a 5 block by 5 block area.. in washington d.c. downtown proper.. it was very irritating, knowing exactly where you are, but at the same time not being where you were supposed to be.. got there, setlled down in the afty, then vip's friends rahul and purva showed up, and we went to 'The Mall'.. and no people, that is NOT the shopping area.. but this mile-long or so strip which has the LIncoln Memorial, Washington Monument on one end, and Capitol Hill on the other - in between are most of the major museums in the area.. pretty awesome place, just that we got tired of walking.. especially after having been on the move all last night.. the White House was also there somewhere.. spoke to aditya saini.. but didn't get a chance to meet him.. at night we met a friend of sank's - thomas and his gf, and we all went out partying in d.c. - area called adam's morgan.. which is a 2-block area with an amazing number of clubs, pubs n restaurants in it.. pretty amazing place.. had dinner at an ethiopian place, then went dancing to a latino club.. but after that we were really knackered, so we walked down the strip, and went and chilled out at the Marriott we were staying at.  next morning we were up bright and early.. a little earlier than necessary thanks to some people's watch alarms!! (grr!!) another one of vip's friends, rishi came over and we drove to blacksburg.. successfully getting stuck in the traffic the I-81 is so famous for.. we got into VTech around 4 ish, and went to ash's friend anamika's place.. had a late lunch, chilled out for a bit then went out to the downtown.. it was a pretty small downtown, just 2 blocks and 4 pubs.. but ok nonetheless.. danced like crazy and were pretty wired up by the time Woody's closed at 2.. so we moved the party to shiv's house.. who is in seattle!! his roomies rohan and bhushan are actually sank's college-mates.. so we took out our stock of scotch and vodka which we carried on our travels.. and got busy!!   woke up on sunday morning arnd 9ish.. really groggy and fuzzy.. we were up till arnd 5 drinking, then got home and crashed.. after breakfast we drove up to this place called Claytor Lake, a pretty little lake, where we chilled out and relaxed the day away.. they had a little artificial sand beach, and we played some beach volley too.. and i spent more time diving around preventing the ball landing on pretty people in bikinis and getting sand on them!! fun times! had an early dinner and piled into the car for the ride back.. the return route was via pittsburgh, though we were quite sure the temple there wouldn't be open at 3 in the morning, so we didn't stop there!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"woke up, saw the rain, and promptly went back to sleep.. ain't life grand!! finally had to wake up.. and decided that i was not going to the lab in the rain - my excuse? i don't have an umbrella!! thursday's at the square also got scrapped as a result!! i mean, for us at least..  had some awesome news in the mail!! the guys i had mailed up at mga research want to speak to me!! so i called them up.. it turned into a telephone interview!! now they wanna see me tommorrow at 2!! woohoo!! it's perfect, not too early either!! my advisor dr. baier told me to just chill out and take it easy, they are very informal and so not to worry at all, just read up on ur material and be cool!! sweet!! i can be cool!! will probably take a pack of camel lights and a sixpack of bud and make a picnic of it!! what say?! ;-))  and now football update.. rooney is my man!! i hate to tell people i told you so, but i told you so!! he came good and whacked swiss ass!! england beat a wrongly-depleted switzerland 3-0.. and then croatia lived up to their mercurial billing by rocking the 'vichy-souiss' boys.. france did recover to make it 2-2.. trezeguet finally came good.. but for all of you who watched the game.. did anyone notice how good zidane  still  is??!! i am very impressed!!"

ABETS17,male,25,"my head hurts!! beer is not supposed to give you a hangover!! then again you're not supposed to chug endless beers either.. ;-)) apparently we went through 5 18-packs of bud.. saurabh and his friend dhiraj came in from pittsburgh yesterday afternoon.. showed them the downtown and the two UB campuses.. then at night we barbecued at vip's along with his cricket team.. what a wild lot.. raghu dude, reddy and kavin.. adi is also big time into new rock.. molson express and vamshi were quiet.. and then mallick and puri also dropped in.. puri's back from india.. with enough packs of Wills Classic.. ahh, Wills Classic.. *nostalgic moment*. we grilled some chicken thighs, they came out pretty awesome!! was really really hammered.. came home and crashed on the couch straight!!  woke up solid sozzled still, hey, that's alliteration! i have realised that i do my best and most inspired work on the day after.. the day after is always gooood, you always wake up with a smile on your face ;-) went with mayank and the juniors to Moti Mahal for the lunch buffet.. $5-all-you-can-eat.. couldn't stuff myself silly as usual.. which is definitely the best indication that i'm getting too old for this rock n' roll lifestyle.. sigh.  took them to the niagara falls after that.. had a nice long chilled out nap there under a tree.. spoke to quite a few people at length today.. smi, abi, neil, my aunt in NJ.. then i joined the baccho on the Cave of The Winds thingy.. hurricane deck rules!! got back home at night around 12ish, then vip called - we had the living leaves, the fantastic foliage, the vonderful vegetation, the verdant vitality.. felt goood to smoke up after so long!! went to Third Base with ash.. was very quiet and chilled out today, luke was bartender, nate was sitting around, and dodi and hubby were pretty tight, you should have seen ash squirm!! we made it worthwhile though with the captain morgan flavoured rums.. i just lurrv the pineapple..    greece did the business on the french!! amazing!! they beat them 1-0, and actually pretty much outclassed them too. then holland took out the swedes on penalties.. they finally seem to be getting over their big-tournament-penalty-hoodoo.. wow, some euro this is turning out to be.. the superpowers are all out.. now portugal play holland, and greece play the winner of cz. rep. vs. denmark, most likely cz.. cool!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"yeah, the title says it all!! that's what we've been doing since yesterday.. setting up the house and finding place to put all the stuff we dumped in it! everyone has pretty much got their rooms in shape, but the kitchen will need quite some work! we have like 4 different sets of every spice under the sun.. and while that is not a bad thing at all, it is quite a pain since the chilli powders decide to stick together and go missing in one nook of the kitchen cupboard, while the garam masalas have also formed a separate league of their own, and don't even talk about the cloves and cardamoms! we did a shopping trip to Aldi and got two cartfuls worth of supplies.. our refrigerator is already complaining and last time we checked it was contemplating writing a letter to the Secretary of State for Labor!  small world eh, georgie's mom was arul's teacher in school! she sent a parcel for him via arul, so georgie came over. he's done with his defense so he's joined the job search market.. ash made awesome daal, and nats and mal had also come over for dinner.. so we had a small dinner party.. though the girls seemed more interested in watching 'Sex And The City'..   i keep meaning to call it an early night every night, but stuff keeps coming up and i end up crashing around 2ish invariably.. was kinda dazed and sleepy all day today.. will definitely catch myself a small siesta tomorrow."
ABETS17,male,25,"despite all my good intentions of waking up early and going to the lab, i could not - the spirit was willing but the flesh was weak, sigh!! ;-)) just played around a bit with the blog, and made some modifications and stuff. you will have noticed the My Photos and My Poetry sections on the right hand column (not all is original - you can tell my stuff way before you reach the credits at the end!!). by the way, shavi and abi, saurabh gupta of your wing is coming here for a couple of days tomorrow.. he's currently in pittsburgh at carnegie-mellon for his summer training.  effectively did nothing constructive today then; no going downtown for Thursday At The Square since i had to go to the archi. dept to help out with the cleaning, then was fiercely hungry, so came home and cooked.. mal, nats, sank, vip and ash all came over.. and we had to watch 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banni Chahti Hoon' yet again.. raja of course stole the show:  ""sab toh nahin dekh pahte hain..""  and  ""bhaiya chai faltoo hain kya?""   england got knocked out on penalties yet again in a major tournament, by hosts portugal this time. they did have reason to feel aggrieved though, since they had what looked like a perfectly good goal disallowed due to goalie ricardo's antics.. the 'silver goal' rule didn't ease tensions either.. and the penalty shootout was a thriller too.. beckham has not exorcised his penalty demons yet has he?! ricardo also committed himself too early as three consecutive penalties went in dead centre.. did anyone notice he was keeping in the shootout without his gloves!! poor vassell looked overawed as he shot tamely at ricardo, who picked himself up too shoot very well into the bottom left corner and send the host nation into raptures. just a quick note about wayne rooney - no doubt he would have been a major influence to the game had he not limped off after 20 minutes.. and from a very selfish evertonian point of view, hopefully now the big team scouts will stop hounding him!!"

ABETS17,male,25,"going back to the point i raised a few days ago - too many blogs i read these days are tinged with emotion, sentiment and memories. every one's asking questions, of others, of themselves.. of what we are.   i know what i am. i am sick of judging, and being judged. i am tired of having to live conforming to standards. and easy as it is for people to say  ""break free, live your own life!"" , no one really does. we pretty much do what we have to do, what we are supposed to do, but rarely what we want to do. i can rarely do what i want to do. and things almost never go the way i want them to. i derive my strength from helping people with their problems, in what is probably a selfish streak of wanting to take parts in everyone's lives. i want control. i want to control. so judge me now! let's hear it!!  i am tired of seeing good people.. my friends usually.. being hurt. i am tired of seeing them being hit by pretty much everything that can go wrong. and i am tired of seeing them battered and bruised, but still struggling to smile and put up brave faces. the scariest thing of it all is that when all is falling apart around me, my little world is still holding up. and all i can think is how long? those favored by fortune say  'touch wood' , those upon whom divine light shines, say  'praise the Lord' , those who epitomise action over words say  'it is but karma' , and i? i say  'we live to fight another day. thank you all'     mindless ramblings seem to be flavor of the week with my postings.. this is nice. i get to say so much, yet say nothing.. except to those who hear what they want to hear here, and to those too who hear what they don't want to hear - for them i say something. and it is upto them to understand what it means to them.   a quick shout out to the boys of RSF - see you all very very soon in buffalo!! let the games begin!! the meat will roast, the alcohol flow freely, and the women.. c'mon guys.. pull your own chicks!! i can't do  everything  for you!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"hi y'all,  as always, bunty comes up with the most awesome ideas.. this is one of them!! anyways, hope ppl write in, until then, take care and see you laters!!  saurabh!"
ABETS17,male,25,"woke up somehow at 10 cos bunty should be landing at 11.. and the first thing i did was chat with farhina.. mmm.. sigh! she sent me some pics, and she was lookng astounding.. amazing.. awesome.. i'm short of words!! what a nice way to wake up.. i wish i could wake up like this every day.. then i might even wake up more often.. ;-D  bunty came home.. and we made pancakes.. then we chilled out waiting for pinku and his frnds to come.. they left there at 11.. finally did my laundry.. all 3 loads of it!! pinku, ramanendra and venkat came around 6, and then the games begun!! picked up a biggie of vodka and one of whiskey too, then mal, ash and puri landed up at my place, we had a couple of drinks then went downtown for the holiday weekend concerts.. guster, ben folds and rufus wainwright played.. we then came back home.. picked up pizza and wings and went to 55 tyler.. smoked up, then after getting nice and sozzled there, we moved to Third Base  nice quiet night at the base.. just a few people.. and nate was keeping bar.. so we let him experiment on us with a whole range of weird, wild and wonderful shots.. yet another awesome night out on the town.. though we have to start hitting the place before 12.. we end up missing most of the hot drunk chix!!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"chilled out day today.. recovering from the excesses of the weekend.. there's lots of work to be done, but it can wait until i am back to my regular verve.. though we were discussing yesterday that it has been quite sometime since we last showed up at Third Base.. by the way, heard that nats was really pissed off that we went on a road trip without her.. she's in california, in case anyone's wondering.. sounds to me a classic case of  ""Hello, Pot? This is Kettle here, you're black!!""  we 6 all then had a nice long conference chat in the afternoon.. she will be back this weekend.  chatted with garima today after what must be months.. she is really not enjoying the start to her last year of college in ahmedabad.. not helped at all by it being a dry state, so i called her up and we talked for ages.. she should be coming over next year for her masters - now  that  is something definitely worth looking forward to!!  went over to dawg's place for pau-bhajji dinner.. excellent stuff.. which just reminds me i have not cooked in over two weeks.. then we went over to Third Base, but it looked kinda dull, so we went over to drop mal, sat around at her place for a bit.. then came home and crashed with a Max Brand Western.. its been ages since i read a cowboy novel!

ABETS17,male,25,"guess what people?! i got an internship!! woohoo!! that  urlLink mga research thingy  i had mentioned yeterday, it worked out.. it's gonna be part of my CPT.. so i'll probably take the next semester off too and work with them!! i spent the whole afternoon bouncing around with joy..   until the italy game that is.. actually until the 82nd minute.. when 'trap' took off  urlLink alex del piero .. one just knew no good was going to come of it.. and sure enough sweden came back to tie 1-1.. i was really really glad that he played so well.. should take some pressure off him.. especially after totti got himself idiotically suspended!! denmark overcame bulgaria 2-0 in the other game.. so italy is barely hanging in there now.. stoichkov was right about the new bulgarian captain stilian petrov, he needs to move to spain or italy.. he'll never develop at celtic!!  we had to go out and party at night, so when going back home, ashish, vipul and i had to pass by Third Base (of course!!).. we had a 'happy meal' each.. for the uninitiated, that is NOT what you get at Mickey-D's.. it's a tequila shot chased by a cold corona.. and it's called the happy meal because one of them in the evening and you're happy the next few hours!! :-)) kelly is out of town, so nate's sis natalie was filling in.. i do have hazy memories of dancing with her on her birthday.. and i do remember she was totally hammered.. so we were trying to refresh each other's memories!! ;-))  went over to mal and nat's place.. opened a bottle of shiraz.. that was ok.. we saved the port wine for later!! nats n sank had plans with dan and jess, and mal didn't feel like pubbing, so it was us boyz again!! by the way, sank better watch out, he's slowly losing his 'boyz' status.. the man has stopped drinking.. or almost!! we demolished a double order of hot wings from Just Pizza.. then when we got back to Third Base it was like all family there.. it's awesome now.. we barely have to buy drinks these days.. the first round went on bo, then john got us the next.. nate did a round of shots.. then bo again.. then natalie.. we had to return the favor though, so we did two for the house.. dodi was there, and so was the hubby, but ash was undaunted, turning on the charm and the pool form in buckets!! after innumerable jack n' cokes, tequila shots, harley davidsons, wild turkeys, and god only knows what else, they finally had to throw us cos it was like 4.30!! john gave us some freebie tshirts too!! yay!! then with dodi and alisha we ended up going to Jim's Steakout after that to settle the munchies, and also cos saying b-bye to dodi was too painful for ash!! we really need to get a tab going there.. this cashflow is a biig issue..  poor poor ash.. after the happy meal we fed him, he was buzzed.. at 8 in the evening when its still light out!! then the glass of shiraz.. by the time we landed at vip's at 12.. he was dazed and just wanted to crash.. but vip n i.. shetani dimaag.. dragged him to third base.. with the lure that we just want one jack n coke each, and he can say hi to dodi (how could he say no to  that !!) then there we kept getting plied with shots.. and dodi kept hovering tantalisingly close enough to him, but the hubby was around too!! steakout mein toh ekdum chippak ke behte the.. aur kaan mein kuch kusur-pusur karey jaa rahey the.. lagey raho mere sher.. or should i say .. mere daw-g!!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"again staggered out of bed around 10 and landed up at the falls.. this time to do the Cave of the Winds walk.. which was awesome fun too.. more drenching was in order at the Hurricane Deck.. for those who do not know about this.. you gotta come here and do it for yourself!! we then went to the outlet mall at niagara falls.. generally walking around and buying even  more  clothes.. we then had lunch there.. and bunty's aunt and cousin picked him up from there.. will see him in a week's time.. then we came back to buffalo.. pinkz, ram and venky packed up and left around 6.. and there came to an end the mini-reunion.. which was supposed to be the appetizer to the real deal happening in august..   and now the really juicy bits that everyone in RSF wants to know about!! pinku is not as fat as everyone thinks/wants him to be!! he's a bit on the plump side, but it's nothing a month's gymming (or a bossy gf!!) can't take care of!! and bunty.. well.. bunty is now going to be called 'phattu' by all of us.. because daroo dekh ke hi 'phat jati hain'!! c'mon bunty, you were supposed to sit with us and get stone drunk.. like them good ol' first year walds days!! what happened??   chilled out in the evening.. watched 'Mumbai Matinee' at my place with vip n sank.. we cooked up some stuff.. made a few screwdrivers.. and had a nice quiet sunday-evening-type nights.. it's very nice being normal again.. after having spent the last week in a stoned-happy, drunk-blurry daze.. but those days had their merits to!!  aargh.. back to work tomorrow.. i will not manage this well at all!! after the amount of non-stop partying that we have been doing the last few days, mundane tasks like seeing my bank manager, returning books to the library (novels, to the public library, before anyone of you start getting weird ideas about me, textbooks, and college libraries!!), meeting my graduate secretary.. and even worse.. going to the lab and doing some work!! :-0!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"woke up very very early to take ranj to the canadian embassy for her visa.. then i rushed back to MAL to finish up the paperwork for my fulltime status and Application To Candidacy.. though i really don't know what the rush is since i have told these people so many times now that i'm in the US i'm not planning to leave for a few years!!  we went to the boulevard mall and then to the prime outlets at niagara falls.. and i think ranj and viki got horribly pissed off with ash, sank and me.. we went wild shopping there.. while they just got dragged along in our slipstream and didn't pick up anything!  we saw the lights and the fireworks at niagara falls, pics will be up soon.. then we went to the Hard Rock there and met up with ranj's uncle and family.. ranj left and viki then pushed off for rochester.. the gang lande up at mal's.. she'd made awesome baked pasta.. then came home and crashed.. really whacked!  just a quick thought - farhina, where are you? if you're reading this mail me or come online sometime!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"the day dawned cloudy and dreary, but it got hot today, cos  urlLink projekt revolution  has rolled into town.. linkin park, korn, snoop dogg were all here - wooha!! mallika, ash and i went for it at 2. we tailgated until 3 with the tequila of Senor Jose Cuervo, then went in to the revolution stage where some of the smaller sidey bands were playing - we got bored there pretty soon and when the gates to the main stage lawn opened we rushed in!   less than jake   started it off, and weren't too impressive either, and   the used   followed them and they weren't much better either.. at least the opening acts for   nickelback   and   evanescence   were much better, but i guess that was the premise of the projekt revolution.. giving smaller bands a chance to play the big arenas.   finally   snoop dogg   came in and bitch-slapped some ass into shape!! that was good! he got the crowd going in no time.. and it actually wasn't so incongruous getting a gangster rap act on a rock outfit tour!! his version of the ""goodbye song"" and ""next episode"" had everyone wild!! he really got the crowd jumping fine for   korn   coming in next..  ""are you ready?!"" were the words screamed out at the top of jon davies' lungs as he bounded onstage in a black leather kilt and adidas stripes on it!! ""korn!! it's on!!""   korn   did some awesome shit, pulling out a whole best-of collection in the one hour they played.. ""freak on a leash"", ""blind"" and ""falling away from me"" deserve special mention!! then they blew everyone away by launching into their MTV Icon version of   metallica's   ""one"".. and then they really set the roof on fire when they played   pink floyd's   ""another brick in the wall"", but in their own style, with their seven-string bass and screaming guitars!! jon davies played the bagpipes as well for ""shoots & ladders"".. in between taking breaks for oxygen 'shots' for his anxiety disorder.. yeah, if you didn't know that! the scary part is that his wife is always standing there side-stage smoking away to glory next to those damned oxygen cylinders!! the wild moshpits we had for korn were scary too!! there were three large ones in the lawn section alone!! loads of people being taken away with gashes, rips, broken noses and various other injuries!!  the crowd was getting restless, feet tired after standing 7 hours all day.. wondering what the heck was taking so long.. then the explosions, and   linkin park   was there!! they had so much freaking energy jumping on and off and all about the stage!! i had watched them in columbus in january, but this time was maaaad!! ""it's going DOWN, it's going DOWN!!"" they did a couple of freestyle raps from unreleased songs, apart from the regular picks out of hybrid theory and meteora. these guys are amazing live.. simply superb! they didn't have lasers or pyros or shit, just simple lights and good hard ROCK!! we ripped out our throats yet again.. and still had some more in the reserve tanks to usher in the encore.. ""crawling"" and ""one step closer""!! ama-f**kin'-zing show man!!  managed to get lost twice (again!!) on the way back from darien lakes.. landed up at 55 tyler where there was biryani leftovers.. good work nats, sank, mal n' vip.. came home, updated this blog and crashed.. sweet dreams. actually, hard rocking heavy metal dreams.. but sweet in their own way!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"damn, summer is definitely here!! and the beautiful people were out in force too - me like!! too hot to do any decent sort of work today.. stayed in and watched 'Scarface' and 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon'.. finally found the computer and the system disk for the infra-red microscope.. the IBM comp must have been top of the line.. some 20 years ago that is.. it looked like it would have a major seizure if i tried to run even internet explorer on it though!! did they have IE back then?? another major headache trying to find a computer that still has the 5 1/4"" drives to run the original floppies!!  came home early and had a nice siesta.. cooked up some beans and rice.. vipul came over too.. it's bloody 1 a.m. already.. looks like tomorrow's gonna be another day where nothing gets done until the second half!!    urlLink euro 2004  starts on friday,and we can't watch it.. damn!! some hick channel has the rights, but it costs $195 for the whole tournament.. not happening man.. anyways, forza del piero, forza italia!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"it's my roommate inder's birthday today!! yay!! went out for dinner to ""Taste of India"", and stuffed ourselves silly.. now i'm too full to sit!! nats made chocolate-chip cookies, and i passed those up, so you can imagine how full i was!! saw some really cool sites today.. one of them i'm trying to make myself -  urlLink Saurabh's World , no harm in a bit of self-promotion eh?! ;-)) .. the other cool one was  urlLink Worst Case Scenarios , which contains info on how to get out of all sorts of weird and wild scrapes - i found it especially useful, knowing the kinds of things i keep doing!!  nilesh finally did what i have been sooo lazy about.. he posted most of the florida pics at his yahoo pics site -  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/decemberdude .. enjoy!!  sweden and denmark somehow contrived to get the exact 2-2 score that they would need to both go through, and lock italy out.. much as one hates to say that it is not possible to rig an interational soccer match.. but the bitter man in me does feel really aggrieved.. italy created chance upon chance and finally scraped out a 2-1 win over a very resolute bulgarian side.. though what the f**k had the ref been drinking/smoking before the freaking game!!!"
ABETS17,male,25,"yesterday i woke up and thought, since i've made it to the middle of the week, might as well take a day off!! so i did ;-)) it didn't help that i was on the phone until around 3 before that - had spoken to mal, smi, john, karrishma, and my cousin tulz.. and then really made an effort to finish that Harry Potter V.. and i must say that JK Rowlings has written an eye-opener for all the pre-teen kids who will read this!! harry and hermione keep going at it every couple of pages!! yeesh!! they're like a couple of bunnies!! vip, mal, ash, guess who i'm thinking about right now ;-))!!  watched a very ruthless czech republic 'B' team do the business on the germans 2-1.. and then holland dispatched a visibly exhausted latvia 3-0, so the germans join italy and spain on a early summer holiday.. the quarter finals start today.. england & hosts portugal face off today.  went and did a bit of the clean up with nats n' mal, then went over to their place, sank, vip n ash also came over.. and we had some awesome pasta (mal made!!) and choccie-chip cookies (nats made!!), with a bottle of port (thanks viki) and a 3 litre box of white zin (thank you thank you!) - came home buzzed, and slept off early for a change!!   just a quick line to say a very big  THANK YOU  to all of you who keep coming back to read the blog.. it's getting around 40 hits a day thanks to all of you.. and i have put up some pics in the My Photos section on the right.. enjoy!!"
XCCGR54,male,23,"Ok so I haven't updated this thing for a long time.  I have a good reason or at least an excuse.  THe last few weeks have been insane busy.  THere has yet to be a week in which I haven't pulled an all nighter and last week I pulled 3, 2 of them right in a row.  Yes, I didn't sleep wed or thurs night and then I had to go to work fri night so I basically had like 2 hours of sleep from wed till sat about 1:00am...  Thats ok though my body has learned to adjust and I did well in all my classes.  My school is going surprisingly well for how much I miss class and slack.  Hopefully I will pull somewhere around a 3.0-3.5, no gaurantees thoug because there is stil alot of work though.  I got my next semester's schedual pretty mcuh done and hoepfuly it will be very easy aned put me on the road to graduation.  (I know this is the point wher you insert the Tommy Boy quote about Dr.'s going to school for 7 years, but at least I'm not still at Jr. College)  Last week amidst my lack of sleep I hadd the joy of seeing Willie Neslon in Topeka which did surround me with all the grey hairs in town but it was still a hell of a show.  Found a new Wilie song that I love (Me and Paul, funny cuz I lived with Paul last year).  I also have been having and loving life as usual so there is no complaints there.  Just finally learning how to fuck around in school and still do well.   A lesson learned late is better than no lesson at all. Hoepfully there will be more updates about m life more often but if I keep not sleeping like has been the norm lately I can't promise anything.  Peace out homies.

XCCGR54,male,23,"Ok sorry I have been slacking so much I have been sick lately...  Friday night I went and got some dinner with Claudia at Paddy's and we started drinking.  Paul and Sieckman showed up a little later and we continued drinking...  We then headed to meet Finkle, Aaron, Kristen, Carolyn and some other folks up at Incredibowl...  Drank a litle bit more there..  socialized a little bit then Claudia and I headed back to my place drunk out of our minds and thats where the night ended.. Sat night I went and saww the Lord of the Rings: The Two Tower with McKay, His Girl, and Osty.  It was fairly dissapointing.  Sunday night I worked then went to Paddy's to see Welzenbach who was in town for a short while. That is always nice..  We hung out and talked for a while then went to Coach's where we saw Big Maroon and Joe Dirr they had just lost 50 bucks in pool and were pissed about it..  If you see Maroon ask him about it.. It's a good story.. We then saw Doug the bartender at the Peanut and he said Me and Sieckman could come back.. neat..  I still think it was more of me boycotting than me not being able to come back.. but whatever..  then the last few days I have felt like shit and done nothing but sleep, eat and watch TV..  I am so lazy...  OK well it is off to wait for Santa to bring me all his bobble heads and Simpsons figures...  Yeah me..."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK last night I wrote a bunch of my paper but I realized that it sucked.  So I wrote my teacher got an extension and now I have almost finished a better version but it still need a lot of editing.  This paper is fairly odd and giving me a lot of trouble but I swear to Jebus that it will be awesome by tommorrow.  But I'm off to make a bunch of money to pay for my stupidity tonight so all you kids out there have fun while I'm slaving for the man..  and in the memorable words of Nik Loecher, ""I'm out like Kyle Wilson in a dodgeball game."""
XCCGR54,male,23,Alright my computer has been going crazy and it has been pissing me of a lot.  I had to reload some things to fix it but thats ok as long as I can hold it together for a while.  Damn I need XP.  But on a happier note I thought i was going to get like a D in physics so I went and talked to my prof and she told me that I had a 64 which scared the fuck out of me.  But then she said that with the final I could get up to an 84 because she didn't have it figured in to the grade yet so all I need is a 75 on the final to get a B.  I can handle that.  SO this semester I have the possibility to get 2 A's and 1 B but it will probably be 1 A and 2 B's..  both work for me though so it's cool.  OK I gotta go work and then to write a paper and study some.  Damn finals...
XCCGR54,male,23,Well I tried out for Rock Chalk today.  I didn't know if I was going to but I decided to and I think I did pretty amazing.  I might have made Claudia mad not sure though..  She is either kidding around or else she really is mad.  Ohh well she will get over it.  I am way to charming and cute to stay mad at.  Well since I didn't go work out earlier I'm going to go now and then maybe to the wheel for a beer or two...
XCCGR54,male,23,"Last night was a crazy drunken night..  I was supposed to go see Jason Boland and the Stragglers with Toms but the band decided that a little snow on the ground was too extreme for them so they canceled the show.  So instead we got drunk and went to Last Call, which is a new bar and will probably be cool once people start going there..  When  we were going in were were the ony guys in the place other than the bouncers, yet they still question my id (22 fucking yrs old)...  When they have decided I'm old enough they let us in a we just hang out and play a new golf game PGA open or something (Toms like it a lot more than me even though I still beat him by like 2 strokes)..  then we decided to go to the sandbar at like 12:00..  at this point I am pretty drunk..  When we get there they question my id again..  I give them another form then they decide they can't let me in...  They have a scanner and just don't use it..  dumb bastards..  so me and toms go to meet his girl at Brothers..   this saga continues but I gotta run to class real fast and then I will complete the tale..."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Ok so far in school I have a 4.0 which is good for me but it hasonlybeen one week. The last week i have been drinking pretty heavily and that is good for me.  Tonight I got drunk and went to a fucking dance club.  It was awful so I left and went to the wheel with some of my buddies.  The wheel is the best bar in all of lawrence and I hung out with a lot of kids I knew there.  I saw girls, guys and whatever.  Then this girl called me and wanted me to come over to where she was partying and then take her home so i was ok with that. I went over there and there were like 10 douchebags there, this girl and me.  It was pretty gay but I figured Icould get some so i was ok.  Then this girl started saying things abouthow I washer bigger brother, Gay.  I tried to work my game and maybe could have done it but would have been a douchebag take advantage of girls guy.  Thats not me so I just left and realized that I should have hung out with the other girls that wanted to hang with me that night.  Ohh well..  I would rather kick it with my boys anytime than hang out with some girl trying to score.  Guaranteed fun against a hope of some kind of play.  I have just realized that I should say screw women and just do my own thing and they will come.  Everytie I'm just at a bar hanging out I meet at least one girl who wants to hook up whether or not I get too drunk to actually do anything aboutit.  But people just rolled in my room so I have to go and hang out with some women..  Peace kids.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK time for Yale stories..  Well It's thurs night and McKay has his secret society stuff so i got to The Bar with some of his buddies...  It's dollar night and we are drinking heavily.  We keep drinking and drinking and so by the time McKay shows up I am drunk and I get some Pizza and then we roll to the after party.  Well this after party is free beer and wine and shit so I'm drinking a beer and talking to people when I see this girl trying to open a bottle of wine with a knife.  I go over to help her open it.  We start shotting the shit and it turns out she's from Austin, so were talkin' Texas music and some stuff like that..  and then some dude comes and snags the bottle or whatever and I'm out of beer at this point so I say goodbye and go to get another beer.  As I'm walking away the guy who's place it is, I met earlier, Snags me and asks me if I knew who I was talking to.  I said Yeah, Barbara from Texas.  He was like Barbara Bush..  I said, ""Thats a wierd name.""  He said, ""Thats the Presidents daughter.""  So that was the story of me kicking it with the presidents daughter..  Tha is just one of the many stories from Yale..  The others soon to come..  ""Zeke eat's soul food in harlem""  ""Zeke Threatening Rich Kids with  a Bowie KNife""..  Yes, You are reading Zeke's Blog and We will b back after paying some bills..."
XCCGR54,male,23,Well yesterday was another worthless day...  I got absolutely nothing done.. I tried to read for western civ but kept getting interrupted by people.  Then I just kinda hung out all night..  should have gone home..  ohh well at least my night was better than Sieckman's..  He stayed at his apt alone and got drunk drinking 40's..  Sad...  well I'm gonna go home today and read and try to do some work..  wish me luck..
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK yet another disclaimer cuz I have gotten some people reading my stuff and thinking different things about it..  Just me drunk and feeling sorry for myself because all my shit was up..  some people get in fights I sit down and write and it just so happens the world has a window to my feelings..  I guess thats all I can say about that...  Peace out kids..  In closing here's a little nascar philosophy, because as you know all great philosophers were nascar fans..  ""Some days you're the bug. Some days you're the windshield"""
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK as usual I lack the ability to sleep.  Even though I do have to wake up in 3 and a half hours.  If I could find a job that would let me work any hours I want I would be the most productive human being ever I think because at this time of night I just want to accomplish something.  Professional writer would work but for you kids who read my earlier poetry that probably isn't an option.  Ohh well.. I guess I will have to get with the real world at some point.  Ohh well...  I guess since there is no crystal ball to tell me the future I will have to rely on the old magic eight ball...  Well I asked the magic eight ball if I will ever fit in as a successful member of society and it comes back with...  (drum roll)  ""It is decidedly so""  Ok so I guess I'm safe for now so I will let all you other sleepers get on with your life.  I'm out to try to sleep or at least maybe write some emails and watch Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.  So  on that note I will leave you with a last that from Bill S. Preston Esquire, ""Be excellent to each other.""   NIght kids..  Maybe I will be back later for more late night madness..."
XCCGR54,male,23,"The last week I went to a Leadership conference put on by the school called LeaderShape.  It was a good time where I met lots of people I wouldn't have met anywhere else.  I met one guy, Juan, who was from Bolivia.  One of the funniest guys ever.  I laughed my ass off everytime I was around this kid.  I also met a bunch of other people that were cool and some nice ladies as well.  Did lots of cool stuff and anyone who has the oppertunity to take part in this program I would say to do it.  I know this was probably a boring update but School is just starting so things will start to get wild later.  Peace out kids.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Coming down and knowing Kristen had plans that she didn't specify and seemed to take some skill going around explaining we automatically new date.  So when we went out Friday night and met this girl Larimie who was pretty cute and definately ready to go home with Paul. (I mean she called him later that night at like 2:30 to see what he was doing).  I encouraged him to bring her home with us.  We would beat Kristen home and he could go in and hook up with Larimie in Kristens room.  So when Kristen came home from her ""Date"" I could say (with a straight face of course), ""You shouldn't go in there Paul's with a girl.""  I think that would have made my whole Weekend worth it.  Even the sleeping in the car that would have had to have happened the rest of the weekend. Also I don't know if I put this in the story but Kristen has started to question whether she is going to law school anymore.  NOw I really like Kristen, she is a fun girl but I'm seeing a trend.  Dating a 31 yr old, deciding not to go to law school yet sticking with the fake breasts decision.  Something seems to have gone very wrong down there in the Lonestar State.  Hopefully Kristen will return to us with the same fun and sanity that there normally is in this girl.  I mean doing shit like this sounds a lot more like me than someone fairly rational.  Ohh well  it could definately be a soap opera for everyone to watch.  Thats my 2 cents..  It's late.. I'm tired..  I love you all but I'm out.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Ok the last few days have been filled with reading..  Either western civ or religion class..  But I just got done with my religion test and I think I did real well...  Which is a very good thing..  We have a party tommorrow and as of yet I have no date..  Who knows what I'm gonna do..  but no matter what I alwys have fun..   Thats about all I got..  I'm about to go jump in the shower now but everyone go check out this band called the  urlLink Lost Trailers ...  You can download their tunes on Kazaa and it's one of my new fav bands..  so go check it out..  and I will end in the words of the  urlLink Lost Trailers  ""Bitter grapes are gonna turn to wine and take your blues away."""
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK so it has been over a month since I updated this journal of mine and tons of things have happened which I can't hope to recall all of them.  I have gotten drunk and made an ass out of myself.  I have studied.  I have worked.  That is the recap of the month now on to more current things...  Ok we will start with Thursday night.. Thursday night was one for the record books..  I first went to go see  urlLink Ryan Cabrera  play his guitar at the granada because our fraternity put it on.  I have to say it was one of the gayest things I have ever seen in my life and if I could erase it from my memory I would.  I mean imagine a little metrosexual dude from Texas up playing all this cheesy John Mayer type shit..  Yeah it wasn't good.    Well I proceed to get hammered and yell at this dude to play Willie Nelson all night.  He tells me he doesn't know any Willie, So of course I question his manhood because hell he's from Texas and plays guitar and knows no Willie..  He's gotta be gay..  So I end up going and getting completely wasted and playing pool against some people that I don't really remember but I played awful..    So the concert ended at like 10:30 so we go to 815 where one of my buddies is having his birthday..  I proceed to get even more drunk playing Blackjack for fake money and getting a Key Chain and drinking some Rapper drinks (Hypnotic) but of course I was hammered so those 40 proof rapstar drinks aren't good enough for me so I get it mixed with stoli..  Imagine 40 proof liquor mixed with 80 proof liquor and I'm drinking this shit down..  We will just say there is a period of time I don't remember..  I think I called a girl from work and made an ass out of myself..  I'm pretty sure cuz she hasn't called me since..  And of course me being the pussy I am avoids that shit like the plague..  well just say time lapsed for a while here and next thing I know I wake up to Mike23's Girl Rachel drawing a palm tree on my face in permanent marker.  Now I didn't mind so much cuz she is probably the hottest girl I know but eventually it gets annoying so I think I roll of the couch and tackle her..  Then the rest of the night is me being a drunk idiot running around yelling at everybody because I remembered I ordered a pizza and someone brought it to me and I paid for it.. but it was gone..  I finally hunted down the damn freshman who took it and threatened to blackball him and kick his ass..  Then just said fuck it and went to lay down and watch family guy..  Ahh what a night..  Friday night some interesting shit happened too but right now I'm pulling an all nighter so I gotta go to bed..  Peace out all my homies in computer land.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK great weekend this weekend..  Went to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic with Kit...  a buddie in my house.  WE had a great time.  BUt we did have an amazing amount of kidness shown to use.  Texas is full of great people.  Especially Younger's Girl, Stephanie and her family.  Extremely welcoming nice folks.  But I have beeen living in a car since fri.  SO I'm off to jump in the shower.  BUt if you need someone to be nice to ya..  drive to Texas..  those people are awesome..  but I will give you the low down on everything that happened in a while..  I'm out.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK so we wake up Saturday and get ready.  Her friend Kathryn Murphy came over and this girl is funny, not as funny as me but funny.  ;-)  Well we all go out to eat at Uncle Julio's for some good Mexican food.  Me and Kathryn start drinking by getting their signature drink, ""The Twist.""  It definitely had some booze in it though, that is where Kristen dropped the Bomb, Her man from the night before was  31 .  Yeah I couldn't believe it either, Old Balls.  But whatever after that we went and they took us to one of the greatest things I have ever heard of.  A drive through Daquari stand.  You can drive up to this place, order a daquari, in one of 32 different flavors, add extra shots of liquor if you want.  A great concept and a great start to the day.  After that it was fairly uneventful afternoon, watched ""The Cutting Edge"" and slept. For dinner we went to some little Italian place that was ok but the great thing about this place is that it is BYOB.  We were drinking Franzia from a box sitting on the table and it was great.  A lively conversation about sex was had by all and then it was off to see Willie Nelson.  Now I love Willie.  He is my Hero and I will do anything for the man but this concert was awful.  Absolutely nothing to do with Willie but the Venue was terrible.  Little girls yelling like it was an En'sync show.  Just awful full of people who didn't care about the concert.  I was pissed and left after 30 min. Then went back to the bar to hang with Kristen and Kathryn.  But it seems that while we were at the concert Kristen saw the 31 year old out with some other girl.  Then she got put on a Rugby players shoulders and had the entire bar yelling at her to show them her tits.  She of course didn't but during that time she had some bitch throw ice at her and yell shit at her.  This pissed her off so when she got of the Rugby players shoulders she went and bought a drink and then proceeded to throw it on her.  This led to her getting molested by one of her large, African friends.  So by the time we met up with them they were not in a good mood to say the least. But we still went to the bar and had a pretty good time..  Kristen got fall down drunk. Which was fun.  Then we went home at cheeseballs and it was off to bed.  Then in the morning we woke up tried to watch the chiefs which we didn't get in Dallas so we left.  I'm sure there were more things that happened.  Details that I left out but that is the gist of it and I'm tired..  I will throw in the advice I gave Paul on Friday night as an appendix.  And maybe a few other thoughts on the weekend.  But for now I'm out.. Peace."
XCCGR54,male,23,"I have been in a wierd mood lately..  I should be in a great mood..  My semester is starting off really well..  I get a nice break from work..  Basicaly just have the time to sit back and live my life without much stress...  Yet I am somehow still unhappy..  My computer's soundboard is messed up so I get no sound out of it..  THis keeps me seperated from Willie, Pat, Hank and all my other boys that help me feel good at times when I start to kinda drop a little..  Ohh well life goes on.. I have found a new obsession..  The Sopranos..  I have watched like 15 episodes in a day.. thats almost 15 hours of Sopranos in a day with out missing any of my 4 classes (one that was 3 hours long)..  I must not have slept at all..  Women piss me off too..  I keep dwelling on all the lies told to me throughout my life by women..  God damn..  NO one can lie quite like a girl.. they have a style and I have a weakness that makes me trust them more than anyone else..  Fucking shit..  This is what gets me pissed but ohh well  I should have known what I was geting into when I started hanging out with any of these girls..  What I need more than anything is night spent with willie, hank, pat, jerry jeff and the rest of my buddies and a nice bottle..  doesn't look like I'm going to be able to get that anytime soon though..  I need to start working out.. burn off some of my anger and start feeling good..  If only it wasn't so god damn cold and icy out maybe I would actually do it..  Ohh well.. theres enough feeling sorry for myself right there..  Ohh yeah Nikki had her kid..  What a crazy life we're living..  Hope everything goes well for that kid.. Kinda scared seeing Nikki as a mom though..  Hope she does a better job with the kid then her mom did with her.. doubtful though..   I'm not a real beleiver in god but if anyone who reads this is that Kid needs all the prayers it can get..  Well I'm off to go finish my bottle of scotch and watch some more Sopranos..  NO class for me tommorrow..    Ed Asner said that ""Raising kids is part joy and part guerilla warfare""  I feel that..  It could probably apply to most things in life..  especially women..  I need to go on the war path..  Alright.. I hope this isn't just a bunch of ramblings and maybe it will make someone here smile..  Peace out  kids.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Alright got my speech done last night at like 3:30.  Then I had to get up and give it at 9:30 this morning without ever practicing.  I thought I did terribly but my teacher actually complimented my speech and didn't compliment anyone else which is a good sign.  BUt i still have a Western Civ paper to write but I think that I should be alright with this..  I'm still gonna try and get an extension but hopefully I won't need it...  My manager at work also called and said he had a bunch of shifts for me to pick up which means money which I need.  Seems like things are really falling together...  In the famous words of the Illustrious Scott Younger, ""Peace Out Fags"""
XCCGR54,male,23,"Alright folks I know it's hard to believe but yes it's true, Zeke is on a diet.  I have started on the South Beach Diet and I am going strong.  I have actually lost like 11 pounds over the last week which is a lot, especially because I'm not exercising yet.  I started on Tuesday and I weighed 240 and now I am down to a slim (ok.. slimmer) 229.  I have not drank since Tuesday May 25 and my goal is to keep it that way until July.  Lets just see if I can do it.  This is the first step in my summer plan to become Metro-sexual.  I have set up a totally different blog to track my progress from slovenly drunk to hip, stylish metrosexual so you can follow my progress there, @  urlLink metrosexualmadness.blogspot.com.   Here I will just talk about what's been going on in my life like always.  Oh yeah I'm in the process of finding a new job and it looks like I might end up in the wireless business like Bonomo which would be nice but who knows.  Other than that I'm off.  Oh yeah Paul and I are going to Raul's tonight to play Texas Hold 'em so if you interested there's games at 7:00 and 10:00.  Later..."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Last night I went to The Wheel, drank some coldies, went home hung out a little bit.  A pretty normal thurs night, maybe a little more mellow than usual but that's cool too..  Then today I got up, went to class, bought some books and hung out.  Today we had a meeting to see who we were going to initiate, did that.  Decided I was going to work sat morning so I am off to home to get some sleep and do some reading before work.  Gotta prepare for Toms' birthday on sunday.  Alright well I'm off to shower and go home so Peace..."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK i have not updated this site forever.  I have missed christmas, new years and a bunch of other random bullshit that has gone on in my life.  I have thought about catching up and writing a bunch but I decided to forget about thatand just start from today.  Last night I worked and went to Fatso's for Jay's Bday and going away party since he is going to war in Iraq along with some other guys in our house.  I had a few beers then went home.  Pretty uneventful but I think I am going to go to the wheel to hang out tonight so that should be alright, hang with some nice folks.  Alright well all this writing has tired me out.  I need to get back in training but I'll write more later."
XCCGR54,male,23,Alright now this is for today..  Yesterday was a fairly regular day but I felt very productve anyway.  I woke up about 2:30 (alright that is not very productive at all but it gets better).  I hung out with the fam for a little bit.  Went and worked out.  It wa a rough workout and I pushed myself real hard but that is the best way to work out. A funny thing happened though.  I was on the stairmaster (what a pussy) and was watching the chiefs game (ok he might be kinda masculine) and Trent Green almost threw an interception in the end zone.  When this happened I heard a loud thud.  I looked over and the guy to the left of me had lost balance and fel of the treadmill. Trent was not only hurting The Great Chiefs that day but also poor innocent middle aged men trying to work off the gut.  well then I went home and ate.  FInished reading Galileo.  Wrote my paper on Galileo.  Then went and rented Changing lanes and watched it with Claudia. Stayed up and talked late into the night (You can call me Mary) and then drove her home.  When I came home I was very horny and couldn't get to sleep.  It was a horrible thing to toss and turn cuz of all the God given testosterone. Ohh well..  I deal..  well I'm off to study for my Physics and West Civ tests...  Everyone out there wish me luck...
XCCGR54,male,23,"Wow, I'm getting better at updating this whole blog deal more often.  But enough of the patting myself on the back I'm here to talk about me.   Last weekend we had formal.  I always dread formal because, as those of you who know me know, I hate dressing up.  Not only do I hate dressing up but if I'm not guaranteed to hook up with my date I'm uncomfortable with that.  I mean come one, you take me, tons of booze and then a hot girl in my bed, things could end awkwardly.  But luckily I have always had good experiences with formals so my fears are generally unfounded. Last year I took Claudia who I was very comfortable around and we had fun and things went very well.  The year before that I took Elizabeth Baddely and things went well also.  This year though posed a different situation. I took my friend Kellie from USC.  We're friends and I'm very comfortable with her but there was going to be no hooking up which is scary because the girl is gorgeous and I'm not always the most gentlemanly human being after about 15-20 drinks.  Especially this year we had open bar with all top shelf liquor being included.  I think this was my saving grace.  This and the fact that I was aware of my weaknesses. I went and picked Kellie up from her house around seven and we drove down to the Westin in my moms convertible.  We talked about music and just random stuff.  It was a beautiful day and the drive was very enjoyable, surprisingly so for a drive in the car. We then got there and went up to the room.  Talked to Paul and Maroon about where to eat.  We decided on some Italian joint real near the hotel in Crown Center because it was easy and time saving. After dinner Paul and I and our dates went to go grab some beer at the liquor store and then on to the party.  The party was at Union Station and was awesome.  Free Booze makes almost anything great and this would have been cool anyway.  It was real chill and we hung out and drank and got pretty liquored.  Then it was time to go so me and Kellie started walking home when she decided she wanted to go play in the fountains.  I was ok with that so we went down one of the stairwells to the street.  We had ended up going to the wrong door and couldn't get back in because the door locked behind him. After that things get pretty vague and fuzzy from inebriation but we ended up not making it to the fountains and I remember climbing over some wall.  But we got home and then I had part of a beer and past out. A good time.  The next day I drove Kellie home and went home to take a nap and hang with my sister.   Well that was a long series of events but I still have a little more to say but I'll save that for another time."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Ok this is exciting for me but I officially own a car now so hopefully money will be flowing in fairly consistantly at this point (because I can now get to work).  It's a beautiful blue-green '94 Honda Accord.  i wish I had a digital camera so I could show a picture of it to you folks but soon I should be adding pictures to this thing which might make things a little more interesting.  But right now I'm off to get some food, a book and then lie to myself about going to work out.  I think it's ok to lie to yourself sometimes as long as you don't start believing yourself.  Ohh yeah I have finals Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (Whatever).  Ohh another exciting note, I have to get tickets to go to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic.  It's gonna be great and it's in Fort Worth so if anyone wants to go they should email me or else it will be and maybe my sister and someone from the house.  Well ok I'm off..  Hopefully more exciting things to talk about later."
XCCGR54,male,23,Just started this Log today.  Saw an Article In the University Daily Kansan about it and figured it would be a cool thing to do.  Today I have a big paper for western civ to write and then more reading to do.  I have to get it all done tonight so that fri I can go have free beer at Abe and Jakes and then go see Andrew WK on Sat.  Well thats about all I have for my first post.
XCCGR54,male,23,Tonight I am taking to my sister to see Toby Kieth.. I got her the tickets for her birthday and it should be fun.. Rascal Flats is opening but it is in Columbia so I will be real tired tommorrow..    Thats when I have to go to A work meeting at 8:00 am god damn..  and then I go back at 1:00 am and work all day..  Then back to Lawrence to Party with McKay..  Then back to work sunday morning..  and then studying for my West Civ 2 Midterm..  Also Claudia is coming in town so she will be partying too..  Lots of stuff going on..  I know I can handle it though..  Wel I'm off to handle it..  Your faithful leader..  King Zeke
XCCGR54,male,23,Drunken poetry..  Next time Limericks...
XCCGR54,male,23,"Mostly this week has been taken up with not drinking, eating healthy, trying to get a job I enjoy and can make decent money at and just trying to survive.  I of course didn't get the T-Mobile job even though everyone went out of their way for me, having a DUI is just too much.  God damn DUI.  So instead of having a Job I like I don't have a job I like.  I've been looking for more jobs though.  Preferable in sales and not in a restaurant (god I'm sick of restaurants).  So that's the way things are.  School starts tomorrow and at that point I will probably disappear off the planet and this will probably be the only way to get ahold of me.  9 hours in a month.  What was I thinking.    oh but on a lighter side, saw 3 great movies this weekend.  ""Love Actually,"" which was funny and sweet and just good on all sorts of levels.  Would probably have been better if I watched it with a cute girl instead of my parents but it was still good.  I also saw, ""Miracle"" which was good as any sports movie about underdogs that is done well is good.  And I saw ""In America"" which was amazing and basically beyond words how good it was.  If you want to know I cried through the whole thing and just was moved by everything in it.  If you can sit through movies without explosions, I know some of you can't (Paul), then you will enjoy this movie.  So I'm off to achieve a few more goals today and see if I can actually succeed at anything without someone dropping the hammer on me."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Yes thats right, this weekend marks my Grandma's 90th birthday.  The whole Burlbaw Clan met up in Jefferson City this weekend.  It was full of long drawn out stories that go nowhere.  Food that was actually killed by one of my relatives.  Drunken revelry and hours spent hiding from the camera.  All in All it was an interesting weekend.  More and more I realize where I come from when I go to these things.  I think everyone needs to have some kind of large family gathering where there is booze to keep them grounded.  You get an oppertunity to see how crazy you will be in 30 years, and that is good for everyone to keep in mind.  Alright well I'm going to end with me taking a cue from aaron and telling you folks what I'm listening to and watching or basically whatever has captured my interest inthe last five minutes.

I have a big project where I have to interview a person in a sales field and I'm going to interview Toms' dad but I need to get on it and have been procrastinating.  It's rough to do all this stuff without a car.  I also had a very good night on tuesday and then ended very roughly.  Basically it ended with me sitting at the wheel and Fat Anne Walden talking mad shit on everyone I know.  Screw that bullshit.  I am going to get drinking right now and enjoy this great day as it were.  Then I will finish my weekend which should be great.  I'm going to see OAR and Guster tommorrow night which should be cool but Sunday I'm going to Columbia, MO to attend the Stephen Covey Institute Seminar.  Should be good and help me do well with the rest of the semester.  Well I'm off to enjoy this beautiful day.  I'll get back to all you fools later.  Things will start looking better."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK it seems like I have been missing days but ohh well during finals not many interesting things happen..  went and saw ""The Emperor's Club"" with Claudia..  Lots of movies with Claudia lately but it's pretty fun..  Then I went home and watched some tube and studied some more physics...  went to sleep and basically just studied and did boring things since then..  but I have done well on all my finals which is nice..  ok I just wrote some stuff cuz i felt I was slacking...  I will have more after tommorrow cuz it is my last final and then I am drinking!!!"

XCCGR54,male,23,"Alright folks I have been going further down the road of Metro-Sexualness.  Luckily I have a little sister because thanks to her I know I have facial products.  I have been watching Queer eye and one of the cats on there always is talking about moisturizing your face and what not so one night when I ran out of bar soap and contact solution I came upstairs at about 4am to look for some when I discovered a treasure trove of all kinds of shit in my sisters bathroom closet and cleaned her out.  I know have Facial Scrub to exfoliate, Facial Wash, Face Lotion, and shampoo and conditioner.  Yes this is about 10 times the amount of stuff I had before..  Not to mention the regular stuff I stocked up on too like Q-Tips.  So getting the skin taken care of and yes I've lost more weight, I'm now down to a slim 225.  Tomorrow I start working out.  I'm telling you, prepare yourself for the new improved Zeke.  I don't know if you folks will be able to handle it."
XCCGR54,male,23,"I'm in the library at 3 am doing some silly little project that is fit for a 4 year old.  putting all my papers in a pretty little book so my teacher can look at them.  Awesome.  Makes me want to hit the fuckin'  nit picky bitch in the mouth.  This woman, my TA, is a cute, smiling little ex sorority girl which while good to sleep with is no one you want in charge of your grade.  She doesn't explain things and then hates confrontation.  When asked questions about the assignment she will respond with answers like everyones will be different, there is no wrong way to do this assignment all you have to do is complete it.  So you think awesome, go home and do it and then bring it to her before class and ask, ""Is this what you wanted.""  and she replies ""Yes, Perfect.""  Then you get it back and you get a C.  What a dumb bitch.  This is happening to everyone in my class and I want to fucking yell at her and hit her in the goddamn mouth.  I want to hit a bunch of women in the mouth but that is just a common thing with me hating women.  But I restrain myself and am nice to them 90% of the time unless I'm drunk and then I tell them how I really feel about them being fat and worth nothing unless they are on their knees.  God I'm a nice person..  Well I'm off to do some more of this bullshit and scream a little bit about i  Fuck the World"
XCCGR54,male,23,"Thats right folks, Your hero has decided to become a ""Metrosexual.""  It's only pink shirts and stylish pants from here on out.  No more beers for this man.  Guiness is replaced with a stylish cosmopolitan but until after I am done being on the trendy ""South Beach Diet.""  No more watching of Cartoons, Porn or CNN, only reality shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and MTV.  I will still attend Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic but I will do it wearing an A&F cowboy hat if they make them if not I will find a womens cowboy hat and wear that.  The Journey will be long and hard but I'm sure I can make it."
XCCGR54,male,23,"I am so pissed right now at one of the guys in our house.  I honestly think some kids just don't know when they are being douchebags but I have reached my limit and I am done with that bullshit.   But now on to some more interesting fun type stuff...  Last night me and a couple guys were out grabbing some food and we met this guy who was teaching at Bill Self's KU Basketball Camp and he was looking for a place to go drinking.  I started to give him directions to the bull and the I decided what the fuck just come home with us we got beer...  Got to drinking and then we went out with some guys from the house to The Bull and then The Wheel.  At the Wheel these old guys were buying us beer and telling us all these crazy stories, It was funny.  Then Anne showed up and since Claudia was there craziness ensued.  The wierdest shit was Anne saying she could Black Mail me with something but then not telling me what.  But she said she wouldn't cuz she was nice.  It was wierd shit going down at the old Wheel.  But you know what they say...  ""When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro."""
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK folks.. some bad things have happened to the Hero of our story recently..  Yes it's true.. Zeke (thats me!) has no more first gear in his car.  this would be ok if he lived in western KS but he lives in Lawrence, the land of many hills.  It was a serious setback to the fuure of his money making and fun having experience.  Thats ok though because a fairly amazing girl named Lauren (her stage name) has promised to ease his pain by practicing all her pleasure giving delights on his body.  What a lucky guy..  Well other than that we had initiation last night which was boring and KU and MU lost today so I went out and ate and drank with my Mom and sis and Kalina.  Didn't seem to drink enough so I'm off to the bar to continue this trend of inebriation..  More later and everyone enjoy their Superbowl extravaganzas...  Lata' Homes..."
XCCGR54,male,23,Today has been an extremely lazy day.  I wasted a lot of time.  Hopefully I will become more productive later on.  I think I'm going to go work out right now but who knows if I actually will.  It has been very hard to get myself motivated lately.  Tonight I have a lot to do but should end up being ok.
XCCGR54,male,23,"Last night I was up late helping whitney, Toms' Girlfriend, write her western civ paper.  I got mine done pretty early and should do well on it.  That should help me get my grade somewhere near that A that I nee.  Kind of Scared about my Physics grade though.  Doing well in all my clases but that one.  I'm going to have to go talk to her about that next week but tonight I am going to not worry about it.  I'm going to Abe and Jakes to drink beer and listen to some good tunes."
XCCGR54,male,23,"This is a disclaimer.  This is not the normal drunken ramblings your used to.  Zeke is about to talk about serious subjects such as love and other things as that.  If you are looking for fun silly topics turn back now.   How many guys have been attracted to women without any idea why.  The girl you are attracted to isn't better looking then the other girls and there isn't anything really physically different about them than anyone else yet there is something about them that catches your eye.  This intangable (sp?) quality is what I refer to as ""The Spark.""  ""The Spark"" is something you can only see when looking in a girls eyes.  It's a glow that you can catch burning from deep within their soul.  These women are totally unaware they have it.  They just think that men are drawn to them and don't even try to explain why.  These are the girls with inner beauty sometimes as well as outer beauty.  This confidence and personality that they have is unmistakable and most men can see they possess it.  Yet there is an anomaly about ""The Spark.""  The annomally is that ""The Spark"" sometimes appears differently to different people.  Some people call this types but I don't believe that.  I just think that there are different types of flames inside of people that burn at different intensities that others appreciate more.  Soem burn too bright and others too dim.  It's your own preference yet some have no spark at all.  These are sad folk that people can recognize almost instantaniously.  These sad cases settle for other non spark carrying folk or sometimes luck out and find someone who has that spark who can not find themselves anyone who recognizes it who they find acceptable.  The worst case though is those girls ( i say girls because that is the sex I can see ""The Spark"" in.  I'm sure this happens in both sexes) who's spark burns out.  I'm not going to say who I have seen do this because they might read this but buy me a few beers and I'm sure I will tell you.  Their is nothing sadder than a girl who is not only beautiful but glows from within because of a fire in her soul.  These girls who think lowly of themselves and let lesser men blow their spark away and turn them into shells of the person they were are the saddest beings on the planet.  Honestly nothing makes me feel worse about life than people such as these.  This is written to all these girls to remind them to keep the flame burning.  THe passion that fuels the flame is all you need.  Feed the fire and life will turn out ok.  If the fire dies out you will end up with an insurance salesman husband wondering how your life turned out the way it did.    This is not only an informative session about ""The Spark"" so that people know they have it but also advice to look for this passion burning in others.  This passion can light up a room and these are the people you want to be near for your lifetime.  A little advice from a failed romantic trying to find the things he's lost.  Sometimes I will find them but hopefully You will read this before you ever lose them.  Just something to keep in mind.  As always to end my writing I would like to quote a man, not just any man, but The Man for his time and place, Willie Nelson.                         How's your new love,                         I hope that he's doin' fine                         Heard you told him,                          That you'd love him till the end of time                         Well you know, that's the same thing                         that you told me                         Well it seems like just the other day                         Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  Just a song that I love and reminds me a lot of life."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK I'm back from my journies to the far east, ok Maybe not the far east but Connecticut and NYC.  Spent a few days just get blasted at Yale with McKay and his boys.  Those kids are awesome...  Then I went up to NYC to kick it with Rife..  tons of stuff st write and I am crazy busy so I will fill in the details later...  back to studying..."
XCCGR54,male,23,Oki know I have been terrible about posting to this thing but I will start to make an improvement.. I have just felt real overwhelmed by work and school and things and just haven't found the time..  But i do promise I will start updating it at least every other day so there will be more fun things to be learned...  BUt the jayhawks are in the final four with a good chance at winning it so things are much better indeed...  Alright peace out kids...
XCCGR54,male,23,"Ahh.. life passes so quickly when your young..  Things have been going along pretty well recently..  I have been managing to handle life as it comes which is kind of surprising at times because they get kind of hairy.  I have summer classes all planned out.  I'm moving home for the summer and then maybe for next year.  Trying to get my life under control.  Start working out.  Stop smoking.  Just function like a normal well adjusted human being.  Ohh well.. FInals will be easy.  The semester is almost done.  Just looking for a nice little bit of rest.Hopefully it will come but you know what they say no rest for the weary.  Ohh yeah..  I'm about to buy a Car too so whats up..  Zeke has freedom of movement.  And then on to Formal this friday.  Open bar is such a great thing.  Ohh yeah and Aaron is coming down today so it will hopefully be a good week.   Hope everyone has a nice Cinco de Mayo, ""La vida es muy confuso. """
XCCGR54,male,23,Just because I say that things aren't drunken ramblings doesn't mean I wasn't drunk when I wrote them.  Just that they aren't silly stupid things because I was most definately drunk when I wrote my last entry.  But sometimes you have to love the openness that alcohol brings you.  It can bring out feelings and thoughts you didn't know you had or couldn't put a finger on.  Just another great thing beer can do.
XCCGR54,male,23,This weekend was a crazy one.  Friday I went to Abe and Jakes where we had free kegs.  Got pretty drunk there.  Then a bunch of guys went to Quintons so I followed them over there.Got really really drunk.  Pulled out the phone.  Bad move when your drunk.  I talked to Niki and she decided to rive up.  I then went to the wheel were I remember very little but Fergi told me I talked to Megan Murphy for a while.  THen I was back to the house to meet Niki.  THe rest of the night is just blackness and I'm kinda glad.  I probably was did some embarrassing stuff.  well the next day i just kind of recovered and slept.  I was going to go see Andrew WK but the person I was going to go with backed out and then my car was blocked in so i just kinda watched a movie and chilled.  It was nice.  But today I have to go to the Push banquet but I am going to work out right now.
XCCGR54,male,23,"WEll Last night was a fun night...  I only did a little homework and the kid who's room I'm moving into hasn't moved out yet.. what a bitch..  so i decided to go out and grab a drink.. Me and Harpole went to the Sandbar and hung out there for a little bit.  we had a few margaritas (Yes I was Wearing my skirt) then we moved on to the meat market which was a pretty cool place.  Had abeer and then decided to roll home.  On our way home we saw Goodvin and some guys driving so we called them and they were going to Fatso's so we decided what the hell and we went to Fatso's too.  Dollar anything so I was drinking Shiner Bottles all night..  Then Harpole left so I got a ride home with Goodvin which was similar to Mr Toad's wild ride.  Craziness ensued from there but I have to go to work right now so I will have to leave you kids hanging...  Sorry..  Your Exhalted Leader, King Zeke."
XCCGR54,male,23,"I have feelings for such girls that don't know about things like my life.  Poetry has nothing to do with the way I feel.  I would write poetry to wrap around myself to cmfert things in my life.  I hear things about my ex girlfirend that I can control the way I feel.  It's embarrising to feel the way I feel.  To know that things are going the way they are with my ex.  I'm happy for her cuz I love her and hope that she is happy.  Yet I meet girls who are beauitful and they distract me from those things.  I am a sad person and just go to class and get a 4.0 and do what I need.  NO love escapes me or engulfs me because ther is no real love around me.  I love mself but that is all there is.  Love as a misson or an escape.  Thas how I am.  Too bad for me and the way I feel.  Tonight is not goood feelings in my soul.  I love life the way it fills me, with life and love and soul, I feel the love around me, I drink it from my bowl, Like a cup of life, it's filled for ever more, I feel the pain around me, I am the man thats full, Life is pain , And life is pleasure, LIfe I can't describe, I hope I live, to see the day, that I will be the scribe"
XCCGR54,male,23,"Yesterday I was sick yet again..  (This morning I woke up and Yes still sick)  So I didn't go anywhere for the super bowl. Stayed home ate pizza and watched at my house.  On a good not ethough I did win 5 dollars from Vanderet because he was dumb enough to bet on  the Bucs.  I wandered downstairs late last night and ended up getting into a game of RISK (I took someones spot and it was the first time I played so I'm not as big a loser as it sounds..) We ended up just hanging out and talking about funny sexual encounters and things we can do to improve the house...  Intresting night but I ended up setting my alarm wrong so I missed my first class..  Well I'm off to shower now and head to my next class but I'll probably be back to write something else later today.  I remembered some stuff that happened that I hadn't written about..  I think it was too tramatic and I blocked it out..  Well in the famous last words of Anna Pavlova ""Get my swan costume.""  I'm outta here.."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"I'm glad you all had fun...and got completely and utterly bladdered by the sounds of it! I've been good and have been ""revising"". That means keeping my revision notes by my side at all times but kind of forgetting they're there. Oh well. Tomorrow I'm going to my mates birthday BBQ/Partay. The problem is it's a birthday and I don't know what to get him. Plus...it's TOMORROW! any ideas? I'd be very, very grateful! poor you Dave...get well soon! (that'll teach you for drinking so much!)"
YXAYK9X,male,17,Christ! Another update! This does not happen often for me. It seems to happen a lot for the Blogger boys though. Along with their new look came some nice templates for me. You can tell this because I am far too damned lazy to go to all THIS effort.. Figures.
YXAYK9X,male,17,"When was the last time i posted more than once in a day? (it was saturday, btw)  Anyway, today i went to work and had to demolish an ex-smoking room. It was the most nauseating smell imaginable. I almost threw up several times. But in the end it was ok, and next week I get to drive this big sit on floor sweeper thing, which is cool. I got paid as well.    One week til campdowne! And I'm not even excited yet, because I don't know what to expect. Anyway, I should go now. No reason why, I have nothing else to do, but I'll go anyway.     Actually, I've had a great idea for a feature:    Who knows what this holiday may bring?  Possibilities:  I will get a girlfirend.    Penmo will get a girlfriend. (this is almost certain, since he tends to pull at jamborees, usually someone who he has no hope of ever seeing again. A weird guy, this one. I'm not intending to pull at an international camp, cos I'll never be able to see them again. This is logic which penmo would do well to consider.)    Dave will get sued for £2000 by an irate farmer.    Penmo will get sued for £2000 by an irate farmer.    I will get shot by an irate farmer. (I tend to have the worst luck around)    Vicky will take up bull fighting while in spain, become a famous matador, and never return.    Bri-y will not get pissed. (Unlikely this one, since my birthday is going to be during the holidays... Oh, and she is unbelievably lightweight, that too.)    Dave will form the Dave Thomson band.    Carly will be allowed back on the computer.    I will stay sober. (no comment)    Penmo will ask every fouteenth girl he meets to put him on a lead and drag him around, and every second guy.(seriously, this could happen)    I could take the record for the longest post.(MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)    Emily Jayne Harris (that is a very Jane ustin- pride and prejudice-esque name, which is why I keep typing it in full) might actually make herself a profile for blogger.    I will buy some CD's (this is really quite likely)    Dave will eat some chocolate whilst standing upside-down in a bucket    I will get bored of writing what will happen to people I know.    I might have too much time on my hands.    Vicky will pass her driving test.    We will be able to go to see  urlLink Keane  as a driect result (yay!) (I LOVE Keane!)    I will stop witing now. (That is quite likely)"
YXAYK9X,male,17,Ahh. That happens far too often. If only phones would decide what to be and stick with it!  I have decided to calculate the accumulative amount we consumed yesterday. Say  that  when you're drunk..
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Woooo. Dave informs me his biceps have grown mysteriously. now they are huge. But i am stronger than him. Grrrr, check out my strength, woo, etc."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Oh wow. that looks like sooooooo much fun!! Woohoo!!! Yay! think i mite be able2 afford the cost of the insurance now if (as vicky informed me (cos im thick)) i do lotsa ironin (cos i get paid 4 it) so yay. i wont go out for the next year cos il be ironin so much, but hey, sure itl be worth it... (altho not sure if itl be THAT worth it)  Anyway, i could get a job as wel.

YXAYK9X,male,17,"Well, we are back. It wasn't too bad, but it rained. Such is life. We got lost, but I found us again. Yay! Lots of pics will follow at some point. I think we passed too."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Well I just my bloody french exam. At least I proved my french teacher wrong. I wanted to be pu tin for higher listening and foundation reading...but he thought I was really good at reading. Now he'll know, I SUCK!! Ah well, a game of footy tonight and a ""end of exmas"" celebration on Sunday with plenty of alcohol and my favourite lame-ass lads ^.^ YAYYYYY (even though my last exam isn't til next week...but shhhh!)"

Always with a smile, Or possibly a frown, He'll go that extra mile To stop you feeling down.  He knows exactly what he thinks, He'll tell you at great length. He's pulld me back from several brinks With his almighty strength.  Im going to write one of these for everybody, so there."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Yeah, last nite was quite fun i suppose....wouldv bin much beta if id eaten or drunk sumthin other than water all nite! Ah well."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Ode to Briony   Bri is very lightweight  She is a subtle thief  She can get in such a state  On just a single reef!   She'll sit down at a party  She'll get all settled down  When playing complex card-games  With concentration she will frown.   Very multi talented  Video extroadonaire  If she can't film it, no one can  She doesn't have black hair.  hehe Rob  Hope you all enjoyed that. I was bored."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Had no sleep last night, and three science exams this morning. What a great combo that was. I am pissed off with boats. Just as Penman is getting used to how to sail it, and I am too, it fucking breaks  again . Oh well. I  hate science, but if I have passed them, I have just done my last ever peace of science. Yay! Kind of yay anyway, cos if I fail I have to retake them. Cue ppl saying, it'll be fine and I won't fail. God I am pissed off with exams. Grrrr! Damn them into hell, or hades or some other rather unpleasant place. Birmingham, for instance."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"I updated my website today! Aren't I nice? (I've said it before and I'll say it again: Rhetorical..)     urlLink PKWeb     Jesus! This post isn't long!    Live with it. That last one was quite long enough for one day, thanks."
YXAYK9X,male,17,oh yeah. it sure does. mmmmmm...
YXAYK9X,male,17,urlLink    This is ME Diabloing. Someone else put some pics on here sometime.  Pics by Rob
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Ok, first blog! I can't be bothered to write in this yet. I'll do it later. That's why I'm male y'see; I'm really good at procrastinating. Funny that. How do blokes get so good at procrastinating? I can't remember the exact statistics, but out of all the blokes who leave Christmas shopping to the last 2-3 days before the 25th, only about 20% of women admit to the same.  I think what it boils down to is incredible laziness. I find if there's something to do I don't want to actually do a damn thing. My reasoning? I'm a bloke.  Oh look, I wrote a blog. Har."
YXAYK9X,male,17,Gosh. That's a lot of posts. Last night I  did  go to Jujutsu. It was very exhausting. Especially after putting up tents all day. Then afterwards I went to a party. There was not nearly enough alcohol as I returned home sober. Once again. Though there was a guitar to entertain myself with.. If only the alcohol hadn't nulled my senses enough to make me forget how to play everything I know. I have trouble remembering without being intoxicated.
YXAYK9X,male,17,urlLink    KIrsten and I by the sphinx. Such a shame I stick out my tummy in photos!  urlLink
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Wow, I'm part of something *wipes a tear from her eye* so, seeing as it seems to be only Dave and Rob that write on here I feel it is my duty to write as much crap on here as possible. Today was bad for me. I had history which is never good. NEVER. Well, unless it's war history or something cool like that. Today I had a thought about My Future. And the fact I'm gonig to end up in McDonalds or even worse...WIMPY! *gulp* Oh, and I had a boogie."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"We were going to go for a barbecue tonight, but now we're not, because no one else wanted to. I ask you. Maybe it was the weather. Maybe it was because they are all lazy. Maybe its not."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Today I wasn't bored. Yes, that's right, I wasn't bored. Incredible, no? Anyway, I built myself some new CD shelves, and put my TV back in my room. (yay!).   Anyway, I had an idea spawned by Dave's previous post, which was this: What is the greatest song in the world?   Place your comments now!  Also, It won't let me comment on dear Bri-y's post below, so I'll just edit this post to include it: How dare you? I am not stupid. My mind runs just as quickly as anyone elses, although sometimes in the opposite direction. Thank you.   Commenting's fine now ~Dave"
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Today, I was fortunate enough to get outside.  What did I do outside? Well, Rob claimed to have found an excellent ""monging"" place. This intrigued me. We went down to the stream that runs out near the back of our houses to see how good this monging place was.  We then found an excellent place. It had a waterfall, a large flat area of land and was brilliantly secluded. This was good. We decided that we would speed up the waterfall. We started to dig away at the banks and redirect the stream so it went straight to the waterfall, rather than the bend that was already there. This involved making a huge dam involving a brick and some clay. Then we went further up and sped it up by clearing a massive blockage.  All in all, a successful day."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Fantastic. Nuclear winters, here they come!"
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Yes. Camp was bloody good fun. Me and Vicky are now set for life with our wood-walking skills and number plate business.  The campfire was not anywhere near as good as it should have been.  Oh, and I seem to have misplaced my CD case and pass the bomb. Anger."
YXAYK9X,male,17,"Hey hey kids! I am saying that sort of thing a lot these days. I will stop, unless anyone likes it.  Anyway, I have Ash's new album, and it is absolutely great! Buy it, or you shall perish! Ahahaha!  I also have the audiobully's album, but I don't expect you to have heard of them, because you think dance is $hit. (VICKY!) ahem.  That is good too. I also got the last Discworld Novel that I haven't read, and one of those cool  urlLink  Airzooka  things. It is very cool, but my dog doesn't like it.     In 2 days The Daves (like the hives, only different) and myself are off to Campedowne, which I cannot spell. There we will scuba dive, mong, talk and miss you all terribly. For those of you who wish to get in touch, our mobiles will be turned on on the evening, but not anytime else to conserve battery. If we do not reply, assume one of the following:       We have no battery left     We have no credit left     We are dead         Our phone has been stolen     We hate you (only joking, hahahahaha! Had you for a minute, but I can see we didn't fool you really, you canny bugger. :-D)    Anyway, you will be without us for 9 days! NINE WHOLE DAYS! We will miss you all terribly, and I'm sure you will pretend to miss us too.    Rob  xXx      <>"

YXAYK9X,male,17,"Rob has posted too much. He has too much time on his hands. Let's help him out here.  I now present you with:   List Of Things To Do When You Are Very, Very Bored   1. Invent new ways of dancing. Turning ordinary tasks into robot style dances are tremendous fun (I draw your attention to microwaving things, or eating noodles)  2. Construct elaborate buildings using only matchsticks/toothpicks/lollysticks or a combination of all of those.  3. Write bizarre poetry involving some sort of action hero, fighting hard against the opressive dictators of the world in a desperate attempt to liberate his wife from their vile clutches and once more keep the world safe from the foul, corrupt, communistic government of the nazi-commie-fascist rulers.  4. Compose the greatest song in the world.  5. Write obscure lists.  6. Rip-off the same ""Write obscure lists"" gag that has been used in almost every single 'things to do when you are bored' list ever contrived.  7. Make an ""obscure list"" post your own by making a joke about how it's been done before.  8. Cook fish.  9. Try very hard to fill in 10 points of ""Things To Do When You Are Very, Very Bored"" lists.  10. Shutup."

YXAYK9X,male,17,"Whilst lying in bed last night and picking at my hair, as you do, I found an unusual little mass, buried deep into my scalp. Once I had removed it I thought it looked remarkably similar to a toast crumb. This got me thinking. People never tell about the little weird things that happen to them. I'm talking about things like how they found a thorn embedded into their arm or when leaping out of bed, a barrage of lego bricks suddenly appeared from nowhere to be landed on. People always discuss how they fell out of bed last night, but they don't discuss how they smashed their elbow whilst jumping back in. Just recently, I found myself urinating, in just underwear and sandles, outside in the rain with a freezing wind encouraging me to be done quickly. Ever found a woodlouse in your shoe? Or perhaps another foreign object like an old, dried-up leaf. Most of us have. How about a huge chunk of metal? I have.  People just don't discuss the little things that happen, the little accidents and mishaps that make life that little bit fruitier. I want to know about how you slipped whilst trying to go to the bathroom and landed on a pin. I want to know about how you keep on writing the letter 'g' when you write an 'a'.  I want to know!"

LMFYNYG,female,17,"Twins beat bumbling Yanks after 13 straight losses   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By Buster Olney ESPN The Magazine     RECAP | BOX SCORE | GAME LOG | PHOTOS  NEW YORK -- As the Yankees ran out of outs in Game 1 of the Division Series, the grumbling from the Yankee Stadium crowd increased in intensity and the chins of the hitters seemed to drop further with each strikeout. The Yankees' tradition and great expectations had once been a weapon for them. Now it looks like a burden.   Game 1 breakdown     Hero LaTroy Hawkins. He was nearly unhittable in his two innings -- seventh and eighth -- of work, striking out four while walking none. In all, he threw 27 pitches, 21 for strikes.  Goat Bernie Williams. Letting the ball Torii Hunter hit to the right-center gap in the top of the sixth inning get past him and go to the wall was pivotal as it allowed the Twins to have a big inning. Not only did Matthew LeCroy score all the way from first base on the play, but Hunter also scored when Alfonso Soriano took the relay from Williams and threw it wild past third base.   Turning Point With runners on first and third and out in the bottom of the seventh, Hawkins came up big by striking out Soriano and Nick Johnson to end the inning. In striking out Soriano, Hawkins threw a perfect pitch -- a fastball -- on the outside part of the plate that Soriano swung through.   It Figures Leaving runners on base usually proves disastrous for teams and that was definitely the case for the Yankees. The Yanks stranded 10 runners, including five in scoring position.   On Deck The Twins will send Brad Radke to the mound against the Yankees in Game 2. Radke was 9-1 with a 3.24 ERA in 14 starts in the second half. The Yankees will counter with Andy Pettitte, who led the team with 21 wins during the regular season.     The Minnesota Twins, on the other hand, almost bounced off the field, after winning, 3-1, to take the first game in the best-of-five series. There is a respite in the series Wednesday, giving the Twins 48 hours to rest a bullpen that contributed five strong innings in Game 1, 48 hours to relax and enjoy New York.  But for 48 hours, the Yankees must try not to think about what might happen. They looked very flat in Game 1, playing sloppily, making mistakes, looking very little like a World Series favorite and more like they did when they were swiftly eliminated by Anaheim in the 2002 Division Series.  ""We've got to show up on Thursday,"" said catcher Jorge Posada. ""I know we can do it, I know we'll show up on Thursday.""  Said Minnesota left fielder Shannon Stewart: ""This is a huge win.""  The Yankees had beaten the Twins in the last 13 regular-season meetings between the two teams, and New York starter Mike Mussina was 20-2 in his career against the Minnesota. But that history did not matter; if anything, the Yankees looked more like they did when they were swiftly eliminated by Anaheim in the 2002 Division Series, playing sloppily, making mistakes.  And they caught a break on an unexpected injury, after getting dominated early by Johan Santana, the Twins starter.  Santana appears to throw from a relatively low arm angle, making it difficult for the hitters to pick up the ball; they constantly react just a little late, as if Santana is throwing from 55 feet instead of 60 feet, 6 inches. Right-handed hitters kept peeling fouls into the stands along the right field foul line, while left-handed batters fouled balls into the stands behind third base.  Santana struggled to throw any of his secondary pitches for strikes in his four innings, his slider spinning high, his changeup often flopping in the dirt. But his fastball was so good -- masked by the deception built into his delivery -- that the Yankees rarely mustered healthy swings against Santana, even when they knew he had to throw a fastball.   Right-handed hitters kept peeling fouls into the stands along the left field side. ""He was tough,"" said Soriano.  The Twins scored a run in the third, after Alfonso Soriano failed to bare-hand an infield single by Cristian Guzman, and in the bottom of the fourth, the Yankees' Nick Johnson walked with two outs. Derek Jeter got ahead in the count 2 balls and 0 strikes, and with Jason Giambi on deck. It was a great situation for Jeter, knowing that Santana had to throw a fastball.  And Santana did throw a fastball, 92 mph. But Jeter swung late, fouling off the pitch. The count went to 3-1, another hitter's count, another situation in which Jeter knew he could hack at a fastball. And Santana did throw a fastball, 91 mph. But Jeter swung late again, fouling the ball off.  Jeter eventually walked, but Santana struck out Giambi on three pitches, Santanta's third strikeout in four innings.  Santana went back to the dugout, but as he sat on the bench, he felt his right hamstring camp -- an occasional problem with his left leg during the regular season. Gardenhire scanned the lineup card and began matching up his relievers, the Twins' right-handers against the Yankees' right-handers, lefties vs. lefties, and the call went to the bullpen. ""The phone rang and we were like, 'Oh, my God,'"" said Hawkins.  Rick Reed got a couple of outs, before J.C. Romero took over to get the last out in the fifth. The Twins still had four innings to go, and their margin for error still very slim, with the Yankees trailing by only a run.  That would change in the top of the sixth. Twins DH Matt LeCroy pulled a single inside the third base leading off against Mussina. Jacque Jones struck out, but with Mussina's pitch count climbing toward 100, Torii Hunter smashed a line drive into short right-center field, the ball skipping low. Bernie Williams moved over to cut the ball off, appearing as if he had an easy play and would be able to hold LeCroy at second.  But the ball skidded low on the outfield grass -- veering to Williams' left, he said after the game -- and the speed of the bounder appeared to surprise Williams, rolling past him. LeCroy rumbled to third and was waved home as Williams retrieved the ball, and when Hunter sprinted around second and decided to try for an extra base, cut-off man Alfonso Soriano fired toward third.  Soriano's throw sailed high, however, bouncing off the facing of the seats on the third base side and a rolling away from third baseman Aaron Boone. By the time Boone recovered the ball and threw home, Hunter had swiped his hand across home plate with Minnesota's third run. ""It was unfortunate,"" said Yankees manager Joe Torre, ""but you have to make the plays, obviously, when you play in postseason, because they are magnified.""  Hideki Matsui and Boone reached base to start the Yankees' seventh inning, but with one out, reliever LaTroy Hawkins blew away Soriano with a 96 mph fastball, then Nick Johnson with a chest-high 97 mph fastball.  Hawkins picked up two more strikeouts in the eighth inning, before Twins closer Eddie Guardado took over for the ninth. Williams singled, and Hideki Matsui drove a ball deep to the left field wall. Stewart retreated, jumped and made the catch in front of the outstretched hands of fans, banging against the wall and falling. ""At first I was like, 'Whew,'"" said Twins catcher A.J. Pierzynski, ""and then I was thinking, 'Thank God, not Jeffrey Maier' "" -- the kid who reached out to pull in Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 playoffs.  A run scored on Soriano's infield single, but Guardado retired Johnson with a week grounder, and amid the muttering of departing fans, the voices of a couple of dozen happy Minnesota players could be heard.  It could have all turned badly for the Twins in the innings that followed Santana's injury. But the four relievers combined to get the last 15 outs, Santana figures to be ready to pitch Game 4 with even more rest than expected, and the Twins' bullpen can rest Wednesday.  The day off might only increase the anxiety for the Yankees. Andy Pettitte, the Yankees' starter in Game 2, has recent postseason failure hanging on his psyche: he failed to get out of the third inning in Game 6 of the 2001 World Series and couldn't reach the fourth inning in Game 2 of last year's Division Series, and the Yankees were beaten each time.  Pettitte and the other Yankees have an extra 24 hours to think about what went wrong in Game 1, what went wrong last year, and what could go wrong. The pressure on the Yankees builds.

LMFYNYG,female,17,"mmmhmmm im thinking that recent events have provoked some quality blogging.  or just plain compaining whatever toots that horn of yours. couple exciting things at work today-charlie and justin need i say more. that was weird. things like that dont just   happen   you see...its all a part of this weird conspiracy thats starting to ruin my life. you know, the really boring one that nothing ever happens in..yea thats the one. and then there was ted. good name. good man. we talked baseball while i was wrapping his frontega-no chips. it was weird and extremely friendly and it pretty much made my day. its not all the time when a complete stranger will just strike conversation, at least not something youre remotely interested in to begin with.  he thought AJ was a punk...that is, until i shared my stories with him that soon changed his mind :D left and came home...got ready for the 'big night.' yes, big night.  of, what..you inquire? stalking. now, as ive said before this is a skill that takes time, dedication, and practice. not saying that im a stalker, but it all makes sense that one would have to be very good to pull it off...so anyway this is a   class assignment   to let you know... we were supposed to pick out someone and watch them....observe them...become one with them. we were supposed to use our 5 senses and everything.  it worked out perty well considering our very hot victims...:D tee hee big bowl was swell. we alllllll know that that guy was waiting there for us. no doubt. that kinda made my night as well....  but, dont think that this blog has come to an ending yet...ive still got a whole lot more to talk about. everyone knows, that when ive got some extra time on my hands i like to think. think alot. which, is NOT a good idea. because ive come to the conclusion that life sucks. and yes, it will never be fair. or understood. and there really isnt anything that i hate more than not knowing how things work. i dont understand, why ive got like...what...4 people that i mainly hangout with. dont get me wrong ive got school friends..but not the ones that i ever see on a regular basis.i dont understand what it is about some people that make them think they are so UNBELIEVIBLY untouchable to the world, the ones that think that they are just so ready to take everything away from everyone else...and that i hate. i hate not knowing why things happen the way they do, i hate the way everything always ALWAYS stays the same, i hate talking to people expecting them to understand and realize that they either a)dont give a fuck or b)have no way to even remotely relate to me because their life has been so sheltered and perfect and they have no idea what to say. i dont want to sound mean but thats what i know i sound like right now. i just dont understand why i seem to get the shaft in the whole life department.  i dont expect anyone to understand it expect for those people who know exactly how i feel. and i feel helpless, like i cant do anything about where i am right now because everytime i try its always the same. i know i can make my own reality. i know that if i really what something to happen, i have to make it happen. no matter how bad i want something, it will never happen. and i know that. and i dont even know what im even typing anymore but sometimes when you type, dont your fingers just keep going so fast you cant seem to make them stop? yeh thats what it is right now. i guess the plus with all this AIM and blogging i can type an essay in no time flat. :D  see? ive still got a little bit of optimism left :D right.  skittles0387@msn.com  tell me your thoughts? thought so.  night  gus gus"

LMFYNYG,female,17,"i used to know the sound of a smile in your voice.  isnt that true? i mean you can totally tell when someone is smiling when you talk to them on the phone. And then it makes you smile.  ive been influenced to write my views. and you know what? i think thats what im gonna do.  Sometimes, dont you just sit there, half awake but lying down, and think about the world? i often find myself wondering what i would be doing if i wasnt, me. Which, then obviously, gets me thinking about what people think of me. what i look like to other people. But...i must add, Do Not Get Me Wrong. i think that when people say that they dont care what people think, they are lying like asian rugs.   i think that we all walk around, constantly wondering what we look like to everyone else. (speaking of...why do people always check themselves out in every reflection they walk by..have you changed in the last 5 minutes??) i think that as shallow as it is, it will never change. but the thing that separates me and my friends from most, is that even though we are curious as to what people think...it will never have an affect on us. i wont ever look at myself and say 'maybe i shouldnt wear this to school...dont wanna be shunned by the abercrombie clique' dont get me wrong, though. i dont have anything against anyone, unless they are unable to accept other people as they are. i dont understand how some people walk the halls, completely oblivious to the fact that as they walk, and as they give those looks, they are taking away someones thunder. i just think that we are only in highschool for so long..why not get to know someone that you never pictured yourself as being friends with? i find myself talking about this stuff all the time with my friends. and once again, we cant understand the human race... or maybe just the slp highschool race. cuz we   know and accept the fact that no matter what we do, its never going to be okay in some peoples eyes. but i say that being your own person is definatly okay.   its weird... usually the people that understand everyone else, is the most alone.   just somethin to think about until baseball starts up again.. o0o0o0o ash"

[tee hee] and who can forget about steve erickson? dem polar bears at 5 in da morn. cell phone reflections, oh lordy. but we lost. and i DO remember that.  so last night.....i know i know, i was about to lose hope. its not often that i do that, but they were down 0-4 up to the 7th inning. twas quite dry on the twins side. i think we had like 3 hits. kind of pathetic for my twinkies. but i digress. because with that NICE walk from mauer [hubba hubba] and some hits by cuddyer with a nice crack by the Bosskie to left field really put us on the map. so i was happy. and im impressed with Nathans solid pitching, too. Rincon had a nice close. i liked yesterday, i likeditalot.  11 innings, well done boys.  im in love with joe. coughcough[mauer]coughcough speaking of, JJH, you are an ass. yes, you are. i think i will recap on spring break at a later time. yessum, a later time. theres just too much to type. call me scatterbrain. thats weird.  thanks for the comments you left. youre a pal.mmmhmm thats enough of that. i want to go to all the twins games this year. i want season tickets. but i can not afford them. please take me. kthx.  amtrak has finally departed. ashm"

LMFYNYG,female,17,"Four baseball fans are mountain climbing. Each climber happens to be a rabid fan of a different MLB team. One fan is from Chicago, one from Kansas City, one from Minnesota and the other from New York. As they climbed higher and higher, they argue more and more about, which of them is the most loyal to their particular baseball team. As they reach the summit, the climber from Chicago takes a running leap and throws himself off the mountain yelling, ""This is for the Chicago White Sox!"" Not wanting to be outdone, the climber from Kansas City throws himself off the mountain shouting, ""This is for the Kansas City Royals!” Seeing this, the Minnesota Twins fan walks to the edge and yells, ""This is for baseball fans everywhere!” He then pushes the fan of the New York Yankees off the cliff.  Go Twins!"

LMFYNYG,female,17,"WOWZAH. man today was EXCITING! for all of your that need some background info: today was the Hormel AJ Pierzynski Bobble Head giveaway day at the metrodome. naturally, being the Twins fan that i am, make plans to camp out for those lil buggas. so me and my bobble buddy Stephanie get all packed up and ready with our lil napsacks and fridge and head out at 4 in the A.M. to camp. so get there, find a cozzy lil spot on the grassy knoll under a tree and get ready for the day ahead. i was thinkin this was gonna b pretty good. (i mean, we had a GREAT spot in line and everything)  then it started to go downhill.. more and more people were lurkin from the streets and coming in line. no problem, u say..well you say WRONG cuz it was a very big problem. so theres this old guy, (lets call him Herve...herve the perve)  im going to say about 45-50 years in age, ripped shirt, pot belly , bald head, and some glasses on. to the average eye this guy poses no harm. until now. so me and steph are sittin there, and notice that this guy....has a little black camera in his fanny pack. u know, nothing out of the ordinary for a twins game, right? WRONG. we musta been watching him for a good hour before me and my BB realized that this guy wasnt taking your average pictures of scenery, but of your average little boy. yup. no joke. there were some little fellas playin catch and he would just walk right up to take their pic. it was sick. and i was thinkin i was about to blow chunks. so i try to just, u kno, put it in the back of my mind, while i reach into BB's goody bag for a bagle. and then he comes. 'do u mind if i take a picture of u?' -herv the perv  'uhhh no, u cant take a picture!' (looks away with hands over my face) -me and herv walks away.  im sittin there, thinking OMFG lets leave this guy is sick...but then there was the fact that weve been sitting in line for about 3 hours and didnt wanna leave our spot...so we tucked it out. but then i watched him take more pictures of little boys. and teenage girls. and couples sitting together. and couples making out on the grassy knoll. and women with their little boys. and then he was starring at me again. and i was gonna b sick. so BB has her back to him to make sure he wont b able to see me. but he keeps dodging his head about stephanies to get a look at me. I AM NOT FLATTERING MYSELF so dont say that em the flem....he was perv. the his friiend turns his chair around to face me and steph and Herv comes back around, stands in front of me and steph, puts up his camera and takes a picture with our hands over our face. talk about SICK. so then we got our stuff and left.  but we still managed to get our bobble heads, so it was ok.  then we watched the game and had the brilliant idear to sit out side and wait for the players to come out of the dome and go to their cars. and we saw most of them (gg cc gg cc)and i got a picture with AJ and his autograph and RON GARDENHIRE SAID THAT HE LIKED MY HAIR! HOW AWESOME IT THAT??!! very.  then me and steph went to Best Buy in maple grove for Johan Santana's autograph and we got a picture with him too. omg it was the best day im telling ya.  but thats about. and im getting a cramp in my fingers from typing all of this so ima fill u in later...  love and the way my body was shaking when AJ Pierzynksi put his arm around me,   --Bobble Buddy #1  p.s. were in 1st place suckas!"

[yes, g-a-w-d] what a night it was. and not it a very good way, mind you. lets see where do i begin... work was fine. did the whole line check deal-io twice and got on my way...but not before KEVIN scheduled everyone to git outta there at 1 and leave me all alone at the sandwich line to do everything myself....ahem. but, punched out about 15 minutes early and got some soup and a bagel yummay. drove home in my car that is practically white with all of the salt thats been splashed upon it but heard some new linkin park on 93 X so i guess that made it a little bit more enjoyable...as much as it could, i guess. got home...came online..dabbled in this, dabbled in that, got in the shower got ready for the most exciting portion of my night thus far: the st paul ice palace. good lord. never again. im not sure what made me dislike it so much...maybe its because of the excessive amount of very good looking guys with their girlfriends plastered to their arm as they huddle about in the streets...or maybe it was the whole below-freezing temperature and the numbness of my legs that eventually got to me...you know, lack of blood circulation cant always be good...or, i dont know..it could have quite possibly have been my strong disliking of Disney mooovies with the whole, ice-castle-y perspective that kinda hindered my moods. im perty sure it was the evening with the family though.  i stood in line for god knows how long for a   light show.   ok? a   light show  .  now, i guess ive never really seen a really GOOD light show to compare it to to begin with...but i think im being fair when i say it was mediocre.  not brilliant, or spectacular...hell, im thinking i could have made something look a whole lot more b-e-a-utiful on my light brite. and were talking when i was 7.   this is bringing back painful memories of this evening. i'll leave you with that to think about.  woulda been a ton more 'brilliant' if it consisted of me and a significant other. but lord knows thats not gonna happen. :D way to be optimistic, ash.  gusgus"
LMFYNYG,female,17,"what a wonderful weekend. friday was less painful that i was thinking it to be. which was a nice suprise. i was thinking about bringing a pistol, which even if i did i wouldnt have had to use it. i did my salsa dance for everyone. that was abig hit i must say. i swear, i have never seen anna crack up more than when i do that. ROFLMAO [haha marma].. yehp..did a little decortating of certain said destinations at 2 o clock in the morning as well.

Apparently there is only one -  one!  - building over fifty years old in the city centre. So the question arose in my head just now as to why armies bomb cities at all, what with the high probability of civilian casualties etc. A quick  urlLink Google search  brought up  urlLink this chilling article . In short: that's exactly why they do it. Aren't humans great?"

I2OY8HV,male,25,"Okay, my turn  Another meme to be propagated (see next post down). I'm just hanging on the coat-tails of  urlLink these   urlLink two  as per usual.   1. What was the first record you owned (bought for you)? The Mini-Pops LP  2. What was the first record you ever bought? Went halves with my sister on Now (That's What I Call Music) 12  3. If you had someone of the opposite sex coming over and you wanted to impress them, which cds would you hide? Too many to list all of them: highlights include D:Ream On Vol. 1, Best of Jimmy Somerville and Best of Huey Lewis & The News  4. Is there a song that reminds you most of your childhood? More than any other, Karma Chameleon by Culture Club might have been the first song I noticed on TV/radio and where I knew the band's name, not to mention a fair few of the lyrics. I was 5; Sr. Theresa didn't appreciate my singing either.  5. If you could spend a night with five musical artists - three for their minds and two for their bodies - who would they be? Minds: Liam Howlett George Michael Tom Morello  Bodies: Nelly Furtado (saw her vid on MTV today - OH was that the sun...) Uh...Salma Hayek sang on the Desperado OST! Woohoo!  6. If your life was a movie, what song would play over the following: Opening Credits: Prodigy, Climbatize Love Scene: George Michael, Cowboys and Angels Closing Credits: Massive Attack, (Exchange)  7. If applicable, name a song or concert that moved you to tears. No one particular song has done this, but lots of songs hit the mark on a particular day and I sometimes find my eyes watering and the hair on the back of my neck stands up. It's not an emotional thing as such; it could be Limp Bizkit (opening chords/build-up from Take A Look Around, anyone?) or RATM or even Britney Spears, but it'll do something on the day. *shrug*  8. What do you listen to when you are... Fucking: It was the Smashing Pumpkins last time, if I recall... Waking up: Currently: Doedel Up by Guano Apes Bored: Er...I play UT :-) Excited: Propellerheads, The Crystal Method, random progressive house if it's around  9. Name one musical artist you would like to see banished: Only one? Who remembers Roy ""Chubby"" Brown's hilarious rendition of (Who The F*** Is) Alice?  10. Name one musical genre you would like to see banished: There is a particular style of music unique to Germany, listened to by the over 50s. It's not traditional, necessarily; its only prerequisite is that it be easy to sing along to, usually whilst drinking (and preferably clapped to on the 1-3 instead of the 2-4). It will be warbled by someone for whose hairpiece an entire colony of yaks was put to the sword and it is far, FAR worse than ANYTHING Susan McCann or Daniel O'Donnell and their hell-minions could throw at you in Ireland. It's called Schlagermusik and, for the record, this is the category both Johnny Logan and David Hasselhof fall into.  11. Name a song you would rather hear never again: Bryan Adams, Everything I do (I do it for you) - I second Cliph.  12. What now-defunct band would you most like to see reunite (living or dead)? The Doors  13. Name an album that is perfect all the way through. Radiohead, OK Computer  14. Music you like that could be considered a guilty pleasure: A surprising amount of Lou Perlman's progeny, not to mention Limp Bizkit (I hate Durst too, but the band play well,  OK??? )  15. If your music collection was about to go up in flames, which five cds would you save? Chemical Bros - Surrender Asian Dub Foundation - Community Music Radiohead - OK Computer Jimi Hendrix - Blues (as soon as I buy it!) Leftfield - Rhythm and Stealth  16. Is there a song that describes you or a situation you've been in so well that you could have written it? George Michael, Cowboys and Angels  17. Which underrated artist deserves more attention? Hybrid  18. Has a song or artist changed your life in any way? If so, how? There have been artists that have caused huge changes in my taste in music, but nothing that has really spilled over into my life. 'Cept maybe for Jimi :-)  19. What is your favorite soundtrack? Pulp Fiction  20. Best music-related movie: The Commitments  21. What would your dream band be? The Dewaele brothers + Liam Howlett + Thom Yorke + Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  22. Do you miss the days when MTV used to, like, show videos and stuff? I've not had access to MTV for as long as others might have, but even I've noticed a decline in standards.  23. What is your favorite all-time video? Pearl Jam, Do The Evolution  24. Current favorite radio hit: Guano Apes, Doedel Up  25. What's your favorite artist/band(s) of all time? Sergey Rachmaninoff P. I. Tschaikovsky Chemical Brothers Massive Attack George Michael"

QY4JAZP,male,24,"urlLink Jordon Cooper  had this great quote by Henri Nouwen:  ""Freedom from judging, freedom for mercy  We spend an enormous amount of energy making up our minds about other people. Not a day goes by without somebody doing or saying something that evokes in us the need to form an opinion about him or her. We hear a lot, see a lot, and know a lot. The feeling that we have to sort it all out in our minds and make judgments about it can be quite oppressive. The desert fathers said that judging others is a heavy burden, while being judged by others is a light one. Once we can let go of our need to judge others, we will experience an immense inner freedom. Once we are free from judging, we will be also free for mercy. Let's remember Jesus' words: 'Do not judge, and you will not be judged' (Matthew 7:1)"" It reminds me of a story  urlLink Pastor Steve Long , here at TACF, told once.   The gist is that he was severly offended by someone.  He went to God and said ""I want justice... this is unfair.  I haven't done anything wrong to this person God.

QY4JAZP,male,24,"God's been doing a lot lately in me as I've been reading  urlLink Celebration of Discipline  still... I'm really hungry to have God establish more truth in my daily patterns of life.  Read this and it resounded:  Henri Nouwen, Lenten Reflections on the Prodigal Son  Discipline is the human effort to create the space in which God can be generous and give you what you need. When you are fearful, worried, or anxious, you want to control your life and to hold onto the reins. You want to do it your own way, whether it's like the younger son or the older son. The practice of discipline is to let the Father touch you, let the Father forgive you, let the Father receive you. And for that you need to be available; you have to be home. You have to have an address if you want to be addressed. You have to be at home in order to receive a guest or to receive God. So disciplines are ways of creating a space, a home within, in which God can come into your life to forgive you, to heal you, and to bring you many gifts.  The first discipline is listening. The word listening in Latin is audire. And if you listen with great attention the words are ob audire. That is the word for 'obedience.' The word obedience means listening. If you are not listening, you are deaf. The Latin word for deaf is surdus, and if you're actually deaf, you're ab surdus. The 'absurd' life is a life in which you're not listening. And obedient life is a life in which you are listening. Quote via  urlLink Onehouse ."
QY4JAZP,male,24,"was reading  urlLink Liquidthinking  before work this morning and was taken aback by some thoughts, I don't know what to do with things like ""Turn the other cheek""; ""Sell your possessions and give to the poor""; ""I came not to bring peace but a sword""; and ""Don't worry about tomorrow""? I don't think Jesus was kidding, so what the heck I'm I supposed to do with it all?  We are so quick to judge. Next time you're tempted to think a bad thought about someone, just remember you don't know what they are facing in life and you don't know what you might be like if you were in their situation. Take the time to know someone's story, then, when you might possibly have the right to judge you probably won't want to anyway.  What would it be like if the criteria for telling someone about Jesus was that you must be willing to die for them? What would that change? Paul said that if his being cut off from Christ meant that his Jewish brothers could find salvation, he would do it...can you imagine that?  I've often thought, how far would I go to show God's love.  I mean, I've said  urlLink I would die  for my faith but if I was actually faced with that situation I wonder if my passion would still be strong... Also, all that stuff about turning the other cheek and selling my possessions is really easy to teach but really difficult to live.

Sarah : “I think you’ve picked up an offence Andrew.”  Me : “Crap, I think you’re right.”  It’s difficult to not pick up an offence when it’s someone you really care about.

QY4JAZP,male,24,"Reading Andy Mullins'  urlLink Blog  and he says some good stuff about ChurchÂ© The corporate church is about reputation not righteousness. Its not about repentance and vulnerability. This world is so jacked, why do we really care whether someone else thinks we have it all together.  The church must embrace our broken, wicked hearts and allow us to struggle.  Who is unfit for ministry the man who confesses his sins or the man who feigns that he has no sin. Today the church would rather have a liar than a struggling growing believer.  I think one of the most difficult things to do help people to deal with their sin.  Being a cell leader gives me this ongoing privilege... but it does take a lot of grace  and  a lot of brokenness on my part.

QY4JAZP,male,24,"so very tired lately, i haven't been sleeping more than about 5 or 6 hours a night (which is really bad for me because i can't survive without sleep)... i think it's stress.  some advice from  urlLink About.com :  How to improve your sleep   Don't expect to fall asleep immediately after hearing or watching disturbing news.  Stop watching or listening to news programs at least an hour before trying to go to sleep.  Leave the war news (or other bad news on the TV or radio) in the living room or den and out of the bedroom. Engage in a relaxing, non-alerting activity at bedtime such as reading or listening to music.     For some people, soaking in a warm bath or hot tub can be helpful. Avoid activities that are mentally or physically stimulating.  Do not eat or drink too much before bedtime.  Alcohol is not a sleep aid; don't use it to try to help you sleep.  Only get into bed when you're tired.  If you don't fall asleep within 15 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and engage in a relaxing activity such as reading.  Return to your bed when you're sleepy. Create a sleep-promoting environment that is quiet, dark, cool and comfortable.    During the day:   Consume less or no caffeine.  Excess caffeine has the potential to disturb sleep at night.  If you feel tired during the day, substitute a short nap of about 15-20 minutes for caffeine.  Naps can relieve acute sleepiness and restore alertness, but for people suffering from insomnia, daytime naps should be avoided. Avoid alcohol and nicotine, especially close to bedtime. Exercise, but not within 3 hours before bedtime. ... good thing about the exercise because my butt is still in winter hibernation."

QY4JAZP,male,24,"urlLink TheHeresy.com  has a really good post based on ""tract"" evangelism.  This is especially good:  ... following Christ is more like a marriage than signing up for a cell phone plan.  With a marriage we carefully consider whom we are going to be with. The commitment we make is lasts our entire life and it encompasses all aspects of our life.  But that isn't how we spread Christianity today.  Today becoming a Christian is much more like signing people up for a cell phone plan.  Sign up today and get a free phone.  The real cost of the phone in the monthly service plan.  Unfortunately people can drop out of this contract at any time.  I believe the issue of the gospel is crucial because there are subtle differences between following Christ and following the values of a subculture.  There are many people in the church that don't know Christ. They are just living out the values they absorbed from others in the church.   No more people joining our club.

QY4JAZP,male,24,"I just read an article from the updated  urlLink Heart of Worship  website.   Matt Redman says some good stuff that has me dreaming again: One of the biggest obstacles to consistently fervent worship in a local church is that we miss the magnitude of the occasion. We focus in on the four walls surrounding us, and that becomes our reality. We see and hear a group of people in or out of tune with each other - sometimes passionate, at other times a little apathetic. And that becomes our whole reality. But there is a bigger picture to be seen.  Most of us have found ourselves in the midst of a large crowd at some event or another. Whether it’s 5000 or 100,000 people, we experience an amazing dynamic when we’re part of that many gathered voices.  ... let’s be honest, singing our hearts out in a home group setting with three or four of our less vocally talented friends just isn’t the same somehow. Or is it? Perhaps it can be, if we somehow in our spirits grasp the bigger picture. However small or large a gathering, however in or out of tune we are musically, we are joining with the eternal flow of praise that rise every moment before the very throne of God.  ... Take a moment to put the sound of this worshipping choir into perspective. Imagine every language you’ve ever heard. Every accent and dialect. Every beautiful vocal sound. Add to that every harmony and every crowd, every choir, every large gathering. As these voices blend into one in your imagination, they are just the tiniest ripple of what is to come. One day every tribe and tongue will join this song. Multitudes and multitudes of passionate worshippers. Add now the sounds of all creation – every birdsong you ever woke to, every ocean wave you heard reach shore, every clap of thunder, every wild animal roar - and every time you experienced a wind whistling through the trees. Blend this sound with those cries of the nations, and the orchestration begins to take shape. Yet it is still a mere whisper.  Find the whole article  urlLink here ."

There was a shootout, I thought it was part of the movie, but it was real, and I was shot. I died and went to hell. After a dark and bumpy ride down, down, down a dark red shaft in a rusty, wrought-iron elevator, I crash landed in a sunny suburb somewhere. No birds, no music, no sounds, and no people, just a gentle summer breeze. I went from house to house looking for someone, anyone. All I found were unfinished blueprints, unused airplane tickets, crumpled up music scores, and half-painted canvases. Dreams that'd never come true, for an eternity. Half-formed projects that'd never be completed. Creative yearnings that would never be satiated, ever. That was my hell. Sartre would be proud.

QY4JAZP,male,24,"Was reading  urlLink Kerismith's Blog  this morning and she has this beautiful post about just seeing the beauty in everything:   Last night I stopped in front of the local corner store. In the window I saw the owner talking to a customer. The customer was taking clementines out of a box and squeezing them, then putting them into another box. I saw the owner take a clementine, peel it open and then offer a piece to the woman. I could not hear anything of what was being said. It was like a scene from a movie, the way the light was, the colours, the snow, the quiet, and I had a front row seat. The act of peeling an orange for another person seemed so intimate and beautiful. And, yet I know in reality it may not have been, (was she complaining?) But something about the whole image summed up something so simple, an everyday task, an interaction with another human being. I watched as the woman left the store with a box of clementines and bag of Tender Vittles.    I love how she just puts the mystery in the everyday.  God spoke to me a whole bunch about this kind of stuff last year.  My fruit of the spirit that i was working on was gentleness and a large part of my learning came from enjoying life.  ""Stop and smell the roses"" and ""take your time"" were two important phrases last year.  Plus He really spoke to me through a chapter in  urlLink The Ragamuffin Gospel  where Brennan Manning talks about wonder.  I want to walk in wonder every day... drinking in the His beauty everywhere and in everything I do.   I think that's kind of why I love watching the stars (when i get out of the city) because there's nothing i need to do; I can just take it all in.    This all reminds me of this quote by  urlLink David Crowder :    You know in romantic comedies when the lead and their love interest are in the scene where they are at a dinner party with tons of other guests and conversation is going on all around them, some of which they are even involved in, for they are the leading couple, but then there is that moment. You know, the moment where the couple’s eyes lock. They communicate without any words spoken. Things no one else is aware of. They are still present with everyone else but they have checked out for a bit. This individual, romantic experience is had and no one else has any clue.   There is something similar that happens in the corporate worship experience that is truly amazing and transcending. I mean we know that our convening with God is not confined to any specific moment of any specific day, so what makes, say, a Sunday morning any more special than a Tuesday in the middle of traffic on our drive home? Is God less present on Tuesday? No. Yet, there is something so different and other than when we are in a room full of people that have gathered in the name of Christ.   But the thing that really sends my head spinning is that we can be in the middle of this corporate experience and feel like we have the sole attention of God. In the middle of a crowd, it’s just the two of us in this beautiful exchange. And these other individual’s voices who believe, no less than I, to have his total attention start to blend with mine. It doesn’t lessen my individual experience it only deepens and heightens the romance somehow. All of these individual voices blending to one.   not sure if this is a really connected entry, but it's my thoughts today and i like where they're headed  ;)"

What we believe is this: 7  8 If we get included in Christ's sin-conquering death, we also get included in his life-saving resurrection. 9 We know that when Jesus was raised from the dead it was a signal of the end of death-as-the-end. Never again will death have the last word. 10 When Jesus died, he took sin down with him, but alive he brings God down to us. 11 From now on, think of it this way: Sin speaks a dead language that means nothing to you; God speaks your mother tongue, and you hang on every word. You are dead to sin and alive to God. That's what Jesus did.    thank you papa"
QY4JAZP,male,24,"was reading  urlLink Brian McLaren's site  and he had this quote by Ed Chin:    ""'... in my own devotional time this morning, I read John 3:31-32: The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard... ( The Message  translates this passage as: ""The earthbound is earthbound and speaks earth language; the heavenborn is in a league of his own. He sets out the evidence of what he saw and heard in heaven..."") 'The primary reason I ever attend a church service (or, frankly, even have serious or long conversations with Christians) is the hope that I will hear something proclaimed out of heaven, something that carries the majesty, the revelation, the heart and breath of God. I want my heart to burn with a word from Heaven. I want to hear something which rumbles through the corridors of His chamber and then creates a sonic boom when it enters my earth space. I am not interested in a 3-point guide for living or recycled Oprah or political perspectives or even a Bible study or exploring ""styles of worship.""  And, I'm not looking for more apologetics and theology.  'I want the sound of Heaven to invade my heart, scare the hell out of me, and split me wide open. I want my ""Edness"" to spill out on the ground and for Him to take up residence in the suddenly empty vessel. 'We all know that the more traditional churches live in a ghetto of unreality; they speak only to themselves, write books for themselves, and make music for themselves. No one else has any clue what they're saying. That's why serious people have been ignoring them for a couple of decades. 'While I appreciate the freshness and youthfulness of ""the emergent church"" (or ""postmodern church movement"" as some call it), sometimes I think they have simply become better conversationalists. They’ve learned the language and the concepts of the natives and are very good about engaging them in real conversations. I greatly admire and enjoy that. But, very honestly, I’ve not heard very much in that world that really testifies of anything seen in Heaven. Like most other church worlds, they speak from a distinct “earthview” and in a distinct earth-language.""    I don't want that to be said of me.  i don't want to become so impressed with my desire to create something relevant that my words and lifestyle become impotent.  I think this is why the renewal is so revolutionary; you have people experiencing raw God and yet, he won't let that experience ever fit into an established wineskin.  Brian McLaren says,   ""[the Emergent movement] could just become another marketing gimmick to sell books, build egos, and bolster sagging spirits with a new invisible wardrobe for a pudgy, pasty old emporer. No doubt, in some quarters it will squander its potential, but if you care about the possibilites being actualized ... please ... let's aim deep and high.""

QY4JAZP,male,24,"Had an amazing cell tonight with my guys.    I led a short talk on  purity  that was based on  urlLink Galatians 2:20  ""I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.   It's amazing how much power there is when we realize that we're all dead meat.  I read most of the chapter from The Message and it provided so much insight for discussion.  I especially liked  urlLink  verses 15 to 21: 15 We Jews know that we have no advantage of birth over ""non-Jewish sinners."" 16 We know very well that we are not set right with God by rule-keeping but only through personal faith in Jesus Christ. How do we know? We tried it - and we had the best system of rules the world has ever seen! Convinced that  no human being can please God by self-improvement,  we believed in Jesus as the Messiah so that we might be set right before God by trusting in the Messiah, not by trying to be good.  17 Have some of you noticed that we are not yet perfect? (No great surprise, right?) And are you ready to make the accusation that since people like me, who go through Christ in order to get things right with God, aren't perfectly virtuous, Christ must therefore be an accessory to sin? The accusation is frivolous. 18 If I was ""trying to be good,"" I would be rebuilding the same old barn that I tore down. I would be acting as a charlatan. 19 What actually took place is this: I tried keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn't work. So I quit being a ""law man"" so that I could be God's man.  20 Christ's life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and  I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me.  The life you see me living is not ""mine,"" but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I am not going to go back on that.  Is it not clear to you that to go back to that old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion would be an abandonment of everything personal and free in my relationship with God?  I refuse to do that, to repudiate God's grace. If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.   all my guys agreed, we don't even want to move one inch in our own lives; the life we now life is completely in Jesus; there's no room for will-power or for trying to make the Kingdom happen in my life because  urlLink  I'm dead meat...   I'm dead to myself, but very alive in Jesus, and hidden in God.   It was just so great that this truth (that I've read so many times) became something dynamic for us.   Keep on leading us into more truth Holy Spirit.    Our first duty as Christians is to get ourselves happy in God.  --Puritan saying"
QY4JAZP,male,24,"I'm having a Robert Frost day today so I decided to post some of my favourites:  Meeting and Passing   As I went down the hill along the wall There was a gate I had leaned at for the view And had just turned from when I first saw you As you came up the hill. We met. But all We did that day was mingle great and small Footprints in summer dust as if we drew  The figure of our being less that two But more than one as yet. Your parasol Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust. And all the time we talked you seemed to see  Something down there to smile at in the dust. (Oh, it was without prejudice to me!) Afterward I went past what you had passed Before we met and you what I had passed   On Looking Up By Chance at the Constellations   You'll wait a long, long time for anything much To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves. The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch, Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud. The planets seem to interfere in their curves But nothing ever happens, no harm is done. We may as well go patiently on with our life, And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. It is true the longest drouth will end in rain, The longest peace in China will end in strife. Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break On his particular time and personal sight. That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night.   The Vantage Point   If tires of trees I seek again mankind, Well I know where to hie me--in the dawn, To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. There amid loggin juniper reclined, Myself unseen, I see in white defined Far off the homes of men, and farther still, The graves of men on an opposing hill, Living or dead, whichever are to mind.  And if by noon I have too much of these, I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, I smell the earth, I smell the bruisèd plant, I look into the crater of the ant."

QY4JAZP,male,24,"been finding a whole bunch around the net lately... Even in the best of health we should have death always before our eyes so that we will not expect to remain on this earth forever, but will have one foot in the air, so to speak...    When I preach I regard neither doctors nor magistrates, of whom I have above forty in my congregation; I have all my eyes on the servant maids and on the children. And if the learned men are not well pleased with what they hear, well, the door is open.    Faith is a living, daring confidence in God's grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times.   To gather with God's people in united adoration of the Father is as necessary to the Christian life as prayer.   Who loves not women, wine and song remains a fool his whole life long.

QY4JAZP,male,24,"Well, back from another awesome encounter... this time we were at the  urlLink Ontario Camp for the Deaf  which was stunning.  Everything was frozen but it was so beautiful.  I went for a (too) short walk on Saturday after a nap and was completely amazed at how much God's creation sings out his beauty and faithfulness.    Made me think of  urlLink  The Darkling Thrush   by  urlLink Thomas Hardy  I leant upon a coppice gate      When Frost was spectre-gray, And Winter's dregs made desolate      The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky      Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh      Had sought their household fires.   The land's sharp features seemed to be      The Century's corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy,      The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth      Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth      Seemed fevourless as I.  At once a voice arose among      The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong      Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,      In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul      Upon the growing gloom.  So little cause for carolings      Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things      Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through      His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew      And I was unaware. This poem's actually been on my mind for a while now.  It's funny how creation just knows to trust Him. All creation looks expectantly to you to give them their meals on time.  You come, and they gather around; you open your hand and they eat from it.  If you turned your back, they'd die in a minute - Take back your Spirit and they die, revert to original mud; Send out your Spirit and they spring to life - the whole countryside in bloom and blossom.   The glory of God - let it last forever! Let God enjoy his creation!   He takes one look at earth and triggers an earthquake, points a finger at the mountains, and volcanoes erupt.  Oh, let me sing to God all my life long, sing hymns to my God as long as I live!    urlLink Psalms 104:25 - 33"
QY4JAZP,male,24,"well, i'm getting back to life again.   Things have been up and down but God's really spoken to me a lot.  I guess  urlLink Comet's  death was harder for me than i thought.  It's funny how God uses these times that we're vulnerable to really do deep stuff.    Just as I've been unsure about my heart and asking him about my future... I've gotten about 10 prophetic words from people telling me exactly what I've been asking God for.  They all keep saying things like ""God wants you to step out,"" ""Step into prophetic worship,"" ""Dig into intimacy.""    I have really been wanting a greater depth in my God-relationship...   urlLink Don Potter  really challenged me last Friday night about living in that most Holy and intimate place.  When my buddy Bill and I went out to dinner with him, everything he kept saying was something like ""I've just dug right into God... I don't live for other people at all anymore... it's just Him."" I waited patiently for the LORD to help me, and he turned to me and heard my cry. 2 He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He set my feet on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along. 3 He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see what he has done and be astounded. They will put their trust in the LORD. 4 Oh, the joys of those who trust the LORD, who have no confidence in the proud, or in those who worship idols. 5 O LORD my God, you have done many miracles for us. Your plans for us are too numerous to list. If I tried to recite all your wonderful deeds, I would never come to the end of them...  urlLink Psalms 40 ."

82L9BY1,male,14,"Famous last words. Probably originated when school was invented (who gives a shit when that was).   Its like a week evaporated into thin air. Most of us must be mulling over where that anti-climatical first week went. Some people go places, others stay home to be entertained by TV, comp etc. A very small minority do work. (What a bunch of tossers!!!) But then the realisation comes that only a week is left. Many critics may say a weeks a long time (sport generally). Others, like me, totally disagree. Especially when u havent touched 3 assignment due in successive increments. However, i still dont want to begin any of them...

82L9BY1,male,14,"Our school needs money and a lot of it. Sure, you may be casually strolling past NSB one day and notice all the construction work going on in the front and think “wow this school can afford to build a new carpark, turfed area and new tennis courts” but think about this, it took our school something like 5 years to get the permit and federal funding for that. Most of that funding came from our parents anyway leading me to think that maybe the school has just been saving all the building fund donations from parents for the past 20 years in the eventuality that despite all the governments promises, there is no way in hell that they are going to give our school money.  	In the newspapers are few months ago, we all read that NSG had a million dollars in their trust fund, which made us NSB’s realize how much better our education could possibly be if we were taught at NSG. This notion was stopped when we got to the third letter of NSG, which we understood to mean girls. Obviously this created a problem. Fortunately for us boys (and NSG’s who read this), the mind of an adolescent male supposedly thinks about sex every eight seconds, so eight seconds later we promptly forgot about that topic and found something else to think about for the next eight seconds before we got distracted again.  Recently a friend from NSG asked a group of us whether our school actually followed a curriculum. Do people think that our school’s poverty is really that bad? The answer to that would be yes (the curriculum question, not the poverty one), but one can never be too sure. This question was asked following a brief exchange of what we have learnt in school so far and a comparison of textbooks. I have noted that in the subject of Latin we have the same textbooks, but they are ahead of us in learning and their textbook pages a white and shiny while ours a stained, tattered and yellow. They have one textbook for all the math classes while we have like five different textbooks for each of the five math classes. “Can’t afford a 150 book set” is what I thought I heard. I put that in, in the vain hope that a highly recognized public school education official with connections to the government will read this and increase our school funding or drastically cut funding to the girl’s school.  In the same session I also learnt that the level of information the girl’s are learning is much higher than what we are learning. This matter was put to rest when a friend said “Their teachers get paid”, which is a fair enough comment when you think about it.  I’m pretty sure that’s why NSG always beats our school in HSC rankings (the fact that boys are lazy bludgers, who wouldn’t do work if our lives depended on it had absolutely nothing to do with the rankings). It makes sense, paid teachers are happy teachers and it’s quite obvious that our teachers aren’t happy. For instance, today one of the geography classes had a substitute teacher. As I was leaving the school for sport, I saw the real teacher drive into the school and park his car. This prompted me to wonder whether our school is really bad enough to cause the teachers to jig. Of course the teacher in question could have been in an important meeting outside of school, but for the sake of the argument I’m going to assume that he wasn’t. So in the hope that someone important will read this I offer this ultimatum. Give us money or give us some of NSG’s money. It’s quite obvious that they don’t need it, girls are supposed to be resilient and I’m sure they’ll find a way to get more somehow. Failure to do so could result in hostile action. I mean we’ve already turned the school into a terrorist training camp with “Storm the Castle” and pretty soon you’ll have a bunch of semi-intelligent terrorists running around. Now you wouldn’t want that would you?"
82L9BY1,male,14,"hmm...wow, haven't blogged for a while. Went to dinner right after chem last night so didn't go on the internet. chem as usual was amusing. michael caristo is much better at teaching but as kiz pointed out, scary because he picks people to answer questions. the most amusing thing at chem this week was the prediction that zbaras would say ""ill go if you pay for me"" in the context of the  yr 10 formal . kiz asked him and he said exactly that...tsk tsk, zebs you cheaparse. *sigh* besides that, chem was a bore for we did not mention the word  wig . >. today has been extremely boring. woke up at 10 --- the  latest  in a long time. spent whole day doing my jap powerpoint when i figured out my completed copy was left at school yesterday --- i  forget  to take out my floppy disk!

82L9BY1,male,14,"Greetings all. And first of all thanks for visiting our site.  Readers of this blog must understand that we all have lives outside of this blog, so do no expect everone to post everyday. As long as everyone posts occasionally, there should always be something new to see. (The benefits of a group blog...:P)  So just a word of thanks to:  Contributors: Without you guys none of this would have happened. Blog on!  Andy: For co-ordinating and the beautiful banner at the top! :P.   Readers of Introspective: Thanks for coming! Keep telling your friends about it, keep tagging and commenting!!!  I will try to register a shorter URL soon for the sake of our visitors.  Sorry about the formality of this post, but it had to be said. (Where would a blog be without an annoying disclaimer??)  Thanks again and I'll see you all soon!"

82L9BY1,male,14,im back in all the glorified magnificence. No longer am I confined to the tempermental flooble chatterbox. Ye well thats all I wanted to say for now.
82L9BY1,male,14,"wow. haven't posted for quite a while. let's continue this lil RICEfest posting. yes, im not christian and i went. lolz. met jeff at strat station and waited for ben to come and pick us up. he took us bak to his house where we saw his maltese! joey. hehe. realli cool lil doggie. so yeh, went on a lil tour for jeff around the house, before we left for concord in charissa's car. when we got there i saw so many ppl! the line was huge and i met heidi for the first time, i saw tina and josie (wow, its been ages since ive seen em), alex zhang (ps friend who went to ruse), and all those other ppl from our skool. NSB: (yr10) me, jeff, jono, ben, almo, stanton, york, chi, nathan, joseph, jamie (with sisi). (yr 11) tommy, kelvin, phillip, (yr 12) tim....yes, that 'tim' and some other dudes i didnt know. oh and i think i saw lora wid jamie and co. at burwood station when i left? was that lora? hmm... overall, the fete was interesting. wasn't realli relevant in terms of chrisitanity lolz. it was more a huge gathering. lots of singing. there were three talks, only heard the first two. as doug said, the jumping castle brought back good memories. got my hair sprayed fluoro green...didnt turn out properly though. they had like, soy sauce drinking comps, lemon eating comps, blindfold dodge ball, blindfold wack-a-leader *grins at ben*, RICE idol and a load of other stuff. well worth our time. ^__^ yes...i know, its realli far away for north shore line ppl...but think about it, i am NON-CHRISTIAN and i live FURTHER away than all you nth shore ppl...and i WENT. so you should all go nxt yr. tina and josie wanted me to go spiderman wid them...hmm...but apparently it's not that good? hmm...so anyway. that was that. mum's bday today. going to bondi cos she needs to meet a client. hmmm.... she's getting consumed by her work - which in a way is good - cos she doesn't pick on me as much. lolz. hmmm... has anyone ever gotten that feeling where they have a lot of assignments/work and they still feel bored? i feel like that now. i should go and study for physics and maths and other stuff too...but i feel bored! dude. and then there's the three days of chairing for debates at UTS this week. wow...im pretty occupied. any idea where we're gonna eat before RICE 'where is the love' talk on saturday pplz?  and adro --- i didn't sigh AT ALL in this post! what an accomplishment. keke."
82L9BY1,male,14,"well then...a recap on YESTERDAYS events. pathetic really. had our  organic chemistry  test fifth period so me and adro decided to skip lunch to study. pointless in my opinion. i failed the test all the same. since when did we learn the structure of PVC?!? and then i was really hungry for 6th period *sigh* after school we waited till 4 for chem to start.  highly amusing. stevie got  upper-cutted  by almerick and lawrence took a photo with his camera phone of stevie rolling around on the grass half moaning and half laughing. LMAO. then phoebe and kiz came over and we discussed jason's  wig  ^__^ being pretty much the same with or without gel. haha.  rajiv decided to crack open some nut thingo which contained two seeds...big ones mind you. no sexual connotations there of course. chem, like last wk was laughable. amongst 'wig' discussions, kiz decided to check out the guyz in the class, we ate phoebe's crackers, looked up  wig  in my english-jap dictionary ---  katsura , and attempted to understand what shyam was teaching us.  oh...and i saw tim wong yesterday too ^__^ he looks like a gangster HAHA --- apparently a  nice  one? today, won't even bother talking about. went to library and that's it. going to jap restaurant tonight. so yeh.  studying  latin atm."
82L9BY1,male,14,"""It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it."" --Al Gore, Vice President  haha...quite amusing quotation i got from actually STARTING my geo assignment. whoever's doing collaroy human development as their issue and has any good websites, plz tell me!  ok, maybe i shouldnt be blogging, but who could resist chucking a ""mabel"" and going all psycho. ^0^ hehe...shame that i can't multi-colour this blog. oh well. our blog IS much more alive than yours mabel (no offense to other members of crazy-talk) keke.  so anyway...there realli isnt anything to talk about this early in the morning...but since im going down to my aunts place tonight, i wont be online, thus no blog. oh wellz. hmm...going to adro's youth group thingy tomoz but i have to get off at gordon station...grr..better not be any druggies *runs away* dumdedum..."
82L9BY1,male,14,"Stupid english open book essay tomorrow. Fortunately it's last period so cram, cram, cram at lunch and during DT. Unfortunately, i know what the topic is which i reckon is worse than not knowing because now you have no reason to screw it up. And to follow that up, on Friday i have an english speech assessment task on mental illness. YAY!! Researching topic on social attitudes towards mental health. Managed to get a 113 page analysis of social attitudes in Britain. Teacher wants all written references so she can mark them. This is seriously going to screw my printing bill at school. Anyway today was a pretty average day. Nothing happened in school. More stuff happened outside of school. For example on the way to sport, i learnt about ilia's attitudes towards Russians, Jews, Cossacks, Czechens, Hindus, Asians, Americans and basically every other race on the planet. I won't write it here coz it might offend some people, but if you want to find out go talk to ilia about his list of hated people and what he plans to do to them. Also got dropped 5m during rockclimbing because Rajiv is retarded and can't belay for nuts. Muscles still aching in body but not as bad as before. At least now i can sneeze, laugh and cough without to much pain. Ben hasn't been to school in the last two days and that means there is something seriously wrong with him. Hopes he gets better soon! While reading the paper i learnt about the magic mathematical ratio of ""phi"". This ratio is 1:1.618. Why am i rambling about maths? Because those who possess this divine ratio are beautiful. Not just average good looking but like really good looking. [Orly must have it (glances at Fel)]. So how do you find out if you have ""phi""? Go to www.beautyanalysis.com, download a phi mask and stick it over a picture of your self. I haven't done it yet so go do it and post a comment on this blog (don't have to mention whether your beautiful or not). Just to make all the ugly people (glances at andy) feel better, if you don't possess phi it doesn't mean your ugly, just average looking, which is ok, so don't stress. So go to the site, play around with it and leave a comment! Have fun pplz!"
82L9BY1,male,14,"GOD DANG...Not too gud.   Sheehan...plz stop telling ppl to do dat.  OLE!!! Allez Francais!!! J'aime l'equipe de francais. Henry est tres superbe. Trezeguet, Saha, Silvestre est aussi. Cependant, Zizou est le numero un. Le free kick est magnificente, car il marquent toujours les buts.  OLE!!! Go Ronaldo...Figo and Van Nistelrooy.

82L9BY1,male,14,"Greetings to the whole world in general, excluding any members of American congress, P.E teachers and 143 bus drivers, in which case may they be thrown back from whence the slimy pit they crawled from.  I, Weller Zheng have joined this group blog, the poor buggers. They must really be the fools they are, for they have summoned their downfall as a respectable blog.  For you see, contarary to the disclaimer that this blog has, I probably do not have much of a life out side of blogging, whether it be for this blog or my own. However I am not yet a complete and downright loser as I do not have any associations to Star Trek conventions, math teachers and Stephen Hawking.  I will not post too much egregarios loads of bullshit on this site. Instead such material can be found at my own blog at ""www.wellerzheng.blogspot.com"". I warn those that go that is a damned effcient waste of time and about as coherent as eating a pair of boots when agitated.  That is all. Yours, Weller."
82L9BY1,male,14,"Dammit SIAC really really sux. They didn't have any hot water so i had to come home for a shower, evil evil evil. I blame this on the government, they should put more money into the olympic park venues, yeah i kno they're pretty much redundant but i don't care. They should at least keep hot showers going for people who go there regularly like me. I'm stressing over the amount of homeword, assessment task and test that i have managed to rack up over the past 2 weeks. Somehow, by no fault of my own,  i find myself trying to complete them all this weekend as they're due next week."
82L9BY1,male,14,"jonOh:   ""Whats this, lyk all soapies we're back for a new season on ""Mabel of Tran - the new 'court' room"" (ahhhh get it). AND WHATS THIS a new character. Recapping bpay and tran man have crossed paths again.... in holy matrimony. GM-cHoWy aka Mr. Match raised bpay from death and helped tran man escape from a maximum security prison. He took them to a romantic tropical paradise off the coast of Timbuctoo, called Whoop Whoop. Mysterious remnants of a famous court room were found scoured around the island...   *Bpay: ahhh its such a wonderful day... my love*   *Tran Man: yes.... any day with u is wonderful, pure bliss*   *They gaze longingly into each others eyes, zooming out with a backdrop of the setting sun and the serene setting of waves melancholically crashing against the golden beach*   What heights of love will they reach on the next episode of Mabel of Tran   Benlee is not a girl, he simply lyks the show Girl TV which obviously isn't targeted at girls. He merely gives the false notion that he is, getting in touch with his feminine side which he obviously lacks, as we can see from his insecurities?!?!? did u get that???"
82L9BY1,male,14,"Ok, the title doesn't have much to do with this blog, it's just a reminder to those who blog here to blog, no matter how meaninglessly boring it is. Anyway today I went to the beach...to do some research for my geography assignment. Thanx to Yi-Long, Jack and Ken for coming. It was pretty good, we took (well Ken took) lots of photos. Most of them had nothing to do with coastal management but meh. Handed out some surveys to some residents of Collaroy. One old man, who was very friendly told us about recent developments in coastal management (Did you know there are concrete pyramids 7 feet below the sands of Collaroy? Laid down as tank traps against possible invasion during WWII) Saw Harvey, who was also doing geo assignment. Had lunch, watched a movie (mean girls) and then went home.  So remember keep the blog alive."
82L9BY1,male,14,"do you ever get that queasy feeling where you don't know where your at in life? that's what i'm feeling now. this blog is going to be long. as i've been mentioning over the past few weeks, i've made all these mistakes and my most recent one has been life changing. i wish we could go back and wipe out these mistakes. friendships have been made in the course of my life but there have been a few which have been broken. previous ones haven't ben as devastating as the recent one. then there's the exams that i don't study hard enough for because i procrastinate and then i fail them --- namely maths. it's obvious what the problem is but you can't yourself to change it. i sit in front of this computer almost everyday, spending time blogging, chatting on msn when i could be doing something productive and furthering my education and yet i can't pull myself away from the computer."
82L9BY1,male,14,"aiitez, as usual, didn't blog for monday because of stupid hill debating. its finally over! *sigh of relief* so anyway, to start off yesterday i shall begin with my total surprise at my speed on the race track --- i tied for first with eddie in the 16yrs 100m!! ok...sounded arrogant there but srsli.. i haven't sprinted like that since yr4. yipee! ok...now the bad news. someone convinced me to go into the 200m which i realli suck at cos i'm crap at endurance *once i remember who it was that convinced me, they shall die* and i came fourth in it. when i reached the finish line i stopped...took a breath and sprained my ankle for some reason cos my right leg gave way and twisted itself :/ WTH!!!?!?! FAR OUT! *sigh* so then i had to withdraw from the bloody finals and the relay and today i skipped three periods of school and had to go to a physiotherapist at 5:30 >. and that other guy in hinder. but i deserve sympathy too *glares at wayne* so yes...bad first part of monday. after we got back to school, waited for like one hour for debating coaching to start and found out that the crappy team *us* had been kicked outta the comp all together so i joined shuyan/kiri/sammy's team. i'd like to thank them for giving me the opportunity to be involved in their debating prep and also the fact that i got TOTALLY freeked out when sammy wasn't there which meant i had to replace her as first speaker. thnk you very much kiri and shues. LMAO. prep was extremely stressful -.-;; i don't think i've ever been happier at seeing sammy...she saved me from displaying my crappy debating skills in front of the two good teams...*relieved* so yeh...although we went in with no case and two palm cards, we...or rather, they won the debate against the yr 11 team. shues, kiri and sammy need a confidence boost...*looks to their friends for support* so yes...a happy end to monday ^__^ congrats you guyz!!   now for today. got to school at fourth period for english cos my mum wanted me to go to physiotherapist in the morning --- they were fully booked but missing out on commerce is always a good thing ^__^ the rest of the day was extremely tiring as i experienced just how big a struggle walking down stairs with a sprained ankle is. ARGH! physio guy was nice -- thought i didn't know how to speak canto...and he put suction pad thingos on my legs...*tingly* afterwards, found out david jones had a half-yr clearance, met almericks sister and bought a $99 winter coat...$400 discount!! ^__^ so now i am...supposedly doing my japanese work...hehe. gnite pplz! yes i noe this blog is long..but at least i didn't split it into three! *glares at wayne..AGAIN*"
82L9BY1,male,14,"Ever had that feeling where you were at school, and there was half the school there, and you wished that it was like that all the time? Probably not. But yeah that's what I'm feeling now. It's period 4 of the last day of term 2, and I'm here in A1 doing nothing. Waiting for wood to dry. So how's HOME for all those people who decided to jig? This is so boring. Going to go home in about an hour. Later."
82L9BY1,male,14,"I reckon Andys right. Were wasting our lives on this blog crap. Lets stop spending time on the comp and do more stuff we can look back at and be proud. Yeh, Im sounding hella weird, but I never blog anyways and no one but Andy blogs. Reasons for Shutdown?  1. No one but Andy blogs. If he doesnt blog = Dustbowl. 2. Our privacys out the window. 3. No one gives a shit about our blog. 4. Its a fad. Lets get over it. 5. Sitting our your ass doesnt help you. 6. Prevents us doing work. 7. We go to a ""good"" school. Lets pretend that we are students of such a school.  I cant think of anymore but theres tonnes of reasons. What do you guys think???  Alright, now to shake off that weird shit, heres some emphatic words.  MANLY AND MAN UTD - DO IT FOR UR FANS Go Rockets. Go Swans. Go Australia in anything. GO CHINA>>>KICK JAPASS."
82L9BY1,male,14,"Waking up after an athletics carnival is a complete BIATCH! Every single muscle in your body is aching and walking becomes the worst thing in the world. You can't laugh or sneeze and to top it off, you have go to school. (Glares at Ben and Andy). Ok Ben i can understand, he realli pushed himself beyond the limits on the 800 and he didn't look to good afterwards, but Andy just because you were clumsy enough to stumble and screw up your ankle after the 200 doesn't give you the excuse not to turn up to school the next day. Everybody who ran and turned up today was completely wasted i.e Stevie, Almo, me etc. I'm writing this during DT (probably why i was banned last time by evil lost DT teacher). Speaking of DT teacher, he won't get off my back for some site he claims i went to during the last DT lesson, which is impossible because i was stuck in B8 all lesson. Anyway, I'm writing this during DT because i have nothing else to do. I might blog during commerce if anything happens between now and 5th period."
82L9BY1,male,14,"Well me and my dad had a talk yesterday about subject selections for next year, and I was just interested in what everyone else was planning to do as well. So yeah, if you could post it up if you're a member, or leave it in the comments section that would be great. (Something serious on this blog for once... haha). Well anyway, at the moment I'm hoping to do:                    3 English                       2 Economics                   3 Maths                         2 Legal Studies                   2 Ancient History  Hmm... that's providing that I get a better rank for Maths in second semester. Now that doesn't sound too promising does it?"
