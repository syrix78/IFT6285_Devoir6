8GKTVWKJW5,---,---,"Apparently everyone's a critic.  I decided to tell some of my 'friends' (and I will later explain why 'friends' is in quotation marks) about my blog and I get nothing but sarcastic remarks....but this was to be expected with this group.  Now on to why 'friends' goes into quotations....I need to clarify a few things.  I guess there are those (Jess, I'm looking in your direction) that think I use the term 'best friend' loosely, a little too loosely in fact.  Not sure what my thoughts are on it at this point in time.  But after a brief conversation, Jess and I came to the conclusion that there are levels of 'best friends.'  For instance:  Jess is my work, girl 'best friend.'  Kevin is my work, guy/gay 'best friend.'  You get the picture.  Yet please don't misunderstand, my intention is not to diminish their importance and significance in my life whatsoever.  It is just that for different aspects in our lives we need an all-star team, people who are the best in a particular area, I just choose to cover all of the bases.  In the future I will be more careful when referencing a 'friend' or acquaintance so as not to offend my critics.  However I will go on record as saying that I probably have more 'best friends' than friends, but then that doesn't make any sense because how would I know they were my best 'friend' if I had no one to compare them to, so I guess I have degrees of better, best, and bestest 'friends.'  Done and done.  Also I think it is important to remember that today is Ronald Reagan's birthday, although they've probably had to tell him countless times and each time is still a surprise. (sorry, poor joke I know)  So here's to one of the greatest presidents in the modern era....Happy Birthday Reagan!!    Oh and one last thing before I forget...Jess would like me to point out that she is my muse.  Without her I am nothing, however I in turn am Dr. Phil without all of the stupid sayings no one's ever heard before to her so I suppose we're even.  But Jess, I can't promise that you will be my muse for every posting.  There might be others that inspire me.  A good Lindsey/Janielle car story may trump you next time....so bring your A-game."
V06AZTIMEM,---,---,"for once i want to know how it feels to be okay with everything. when something really good happens in my life something else is taken away. the thing is...no, there wasnt anything there, ever. i was happy with that. because i knew that i never wanted something to happen with him because i would be pissed off all the time. i didnt want anything with him because i didnt want to handle all of that with him. excuse me, do not flatter yourself into thinking that i somehow feel in love the second i saw you. dont flatter yourself into thinking that i was smitten by your lack of manners and off beat way of handleing every situation that youve been in, because truthfully i really didnt give a shit. you were suffocating and obviously didnt understand the meaning of ""if youre going to be late, let me know"" because youre weird. and i think i wanted something good to happen with my life after last year that i actually believed it for a second. and i tell myself, ashley, dont go through that again. dont let anything happen because you always get hurt. and i was cautious, because i didnt like him like that after i had talked to him for 3 months and found out what he was really like. but there is a big difference between the 2 situations that ive been in. because one cares about feelings, and one doesnt. so fuck you. fuck you for even thinking that i was somehow madly in love with you and your fucked up life.and fuck you for telling me the things you did, because if you were looking to bring up the past and hurt my feelings, you sure as hell did. so, fuck. you. ive made my point. but im left with so many unanswered questions to everything and i want someone, anyone, to help me out here. whats so wrong with me, that nothing ever happens? im sad. and mad. and i hate not understanding anything.

RZG0CHXUG0,---,---,"The environment is one of biggest issues facing our world today. There are newspapers, websites, and even whole political parties dedicated to its preservation. The main threats to it are from factories dumping, governments not regulating, and logging. The first two are easily preventable, but the third, which causes a large percentage of the damage is not so easily stopped. The logging is mostly in countries like Brazil or the Congo, where the people rely on it for a living. The logging industry provides work for thousands of people there, and the land cleared provides farming land for thousands more, whose food provides sustance to millions. If the environmental activists had their way, these people would all starve, and it would severely depress the economies of these growing countries, hurting even those who arent in the logging industry.  In the first world countries like Australia, the U.S., or even Tasmania (maybe a two and a half world country), the logging should be cut down on, at least in first growth forests. Also, Uma Thurman is the hottest chick alive, and Jennifer Aniston is the best girl next door.  Admin. This just in- James is gya."

The goal, as agreed upon by Lindsey and Eugenia is for all of us to lose 10 pounds.  How difficult can it be....then I'm sitting here remembering my fun-filled days as a 10 year old where if I wanted a cookie or a donut my father wouldn't only give me one, he'd give me 3 or as many as I wanted.  He denyed me nothing.  And yes, I know what you're thinking (Christopher I'm looking in your general direction) and amazingly enough I wasn't Superfudge and didn't weigh 300 pounds.

I wish I knew witchcraft.  I'd place a spell on all my things and if anyone did anything wrong with them or stole them the spell would make them blow up on their faces!  How I wish I could do that.  Sorry story about this mower:  We bought it for my parents to replace another that had been stolen before (I think I may have mentioned earlier... yes, yes I did).  Well this 2nd mower was in their possession for about 2 weeks when it too was stolen along with their new pup Beauty.  The constable was able to recuperate the machine (chase activity and all) but not the puppy.  Well, it's been 2 or 3 weeks since then.  My mother brought me the mower so that I could fix something on it (seems that it was bandalized by the robbers so that they could perhaps sell it without too much trouble, posing it as an old and used mower).  Well it is gone now... again... I doubt we'll get it back this time.  The police didn't really make me feel with good vibes about how interested they were on following up with the case.  I don't blame them.  They must get a lot of calls for yard robbing.  * sigh * Nothing ANYWHERE is safe.

QQV6ROB6F0,---,---,"This past weekend I went to my friend Jose's birthday party...I hadn't seen him in a good three months and I had forgotten how damn cute that boy is, but do NOT get all excited for me just yet because Jose is yet another one of my gay friends.  You might say one of the highlights of the evening was Morissey coming into the bar and a lesbian hitting on me, not exactly the first lesbian to do so, but certainly the first one to grab on to me and ask me if I was sure that I wasn't gay.  For the record I am not.  Besides, I now have my brother's, what I hope to be, brilliant political career to bear in mind and he of course is a republican.  I can't very well go ruining his life.    Lindsey had a BBQ on Memorial Day at the house before it gets demolished.  Good times were had by all and LGK was yet again placed in the most precarious position of 4 men all vying for the opportunity to spend the night with her.  Amazingly enough she managed to escape with minimal drama and a handful of drunken phone calls.  I will reserve any further comment.    Lately Lindsey and I have been discussing the amount of times per day that we cry.  It is exceedingly high when compared to those around us.  On Friday and Saturday I was unable to go out because I knew that I wasn't emotionally stable enough to handle an evening out.  I find myself on the verge of tears constantly....is that weird?  Everyone I talk to thinks so.  What is my problem?  I need to get a grip, I just don't know what to grip.  Not only does TV and movies make me cry, but I can be driving and all of a sudden my eyes will well up with tears.  Like I said...NOT NORMAL.  Maybe it's just a phase that I'm going through, maybe I need to let go of some things that are bothering me...maybe just maybe I need closure.  Yeah, that's it.  I need closure.    Eugenia made a very interesting point the other day at the Bean...I have a better life than 99.99% of the human race...in the grand scheme of things I have nothing to be unhappy about and everything in the world to be grateful for.  She is absolutely correct.  I have the luxury of being able to sweat the small stuff.  But what if you know, I mean you really just know that it's not really a small issue and if you let it go it will follow you for the rest of your life.  Perhaps it won't be as prevalent in your mind, but it will always haunt you.  Do you do everything in your power to rectify the situation or do you just shut up and deal.  Eleanor Roosevelt said that we should all do something every day that scares us.  I think I might just take her up on that...today I did something that scared me.  I'll take baby-steps to the one thing that will terrify me."

Haha I am the king of the run-on sentence.  I'm still trying to figure out how I am supposed to co-edit the school paper when I have no grammar skill whatsoever.  Well that's probably the least of my problems in terms of that situation.  How about that I did nothing about it all summer, the other editor was in Prague all summer, I don't know if we'll have the money to publish, at least by the first publishing date.  I don't know whether we'll have anyone writing for the paper, and more importantly I don't even know why I'm doing it.  I suppose it has something to do with the former editor believing that I was the right person for the job.  Although personally I still believe it's a big conspiracy because people just want to watch me crash and burn.  But I mean if that's the goal just sit me down and make me listen to ""It Won't Rain All The Time"" by Jane Siberry and see what happens.  You know, I'm just doing the whole...""I don't know how I'll ever make it"" thing.  Honestly, I have no idea how I made it through last year.  I had meds for most of that, and that helps.  But still, and especially the 2nd semester the meds started failing and I really stopped doing well.  Looking back it's amazing I passed a couple of my classes and wrote for the paper, and worked, let along finished the year with a not incredibly terrible GPA.  Mind you the lack of structure in that sentence should knock me down a grade point.  Thank goodness this isn't a school project.  My entries are too long, nobody wants to read this stuff.  But there's one story I feel like telling.  I'm working the other day, and this girl comes up, and I know her and she knows me, she's friends with my older sister.  And she wants to buy a chair, it's a cool chair, good for her.  But then this girls sister, who is my age comes in.  Words can never express the contempt I feel for this person.  I went to school with her for 10 years and not once did she make me feel like I was anything even close to human.  I despise her, and I always will.  I suppose it's a good thing I don't consider myself catholic anymore, otherwise I would be forced to forgive her.  I'm sure she's quite the mature and wonderful person now.  I mean we all grow up.  I haven't even talked to her in 8 years, aside from the hello I gave her when she came in the store.  However, sometimes I think people are forgiven too easily for past transgressions.  Or at least it's passed off as ""oh well that's what kids do.  They just need to grow up.""  Do you want to know why I hate guns so much??  It's because I'm afraid of what I would do if there was one in my hand."

B9942JTC9T,---,---,"Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein    So what do they have in common?   Both have a penchant for wearing military uniforms and growing facial hair.   Both are absolute dictators over small countries.   Both are irrationally demonized by the U.S. government.   Sure, we should be wary of these two, but is there any rational reason to go to war?   In the case of Fidel Castro, we've contained him for years.  Despite several adventures in the early '60s, Cuba has proven to be fairly harmless.  When the Russians wanted to put nuclear missiles in Cuba and the US government said ""No way,"" the Russian government collectively blinked and nothing further happened.  Rationality triumphed.   In the case of Saddam Hussein, he tried to invade Kuwait (and was thrown out decisively), murdered a bunch of his own citizens, and is suspected to be developing ""weapons of mass destruction.""   It's clear that the Iraqis have had some bioweapon capabilities.  They gassed a few hundred Kurds for almost no reason other than to say ""they could do it.""  But, they haven't done anything else with those weapons since the early '90s.   It's not so clear that they have nuclear weapons.  It's not that easy to enrich uranium.  Uranium enrichment facilities are large and easy to spot from the air.  It's also not that trivial to transport enriched uranium, so it would be tough to ""secretly"" bring it in from another country.  [[I later heard a report from an independent source (since I'm extremely untrusting about anything the Bush administration would say about Iraq) that the Iraqis probably did have some amount of enriched uranium in about 1990).  And, as we've just learned from North Korea, it is possible to enrich uranium and build bombs without the US knowing ""for sure"" (parentetical comments added 10/25/02)]]   And how would they deliver a nuclear weapon - by the post?     They don't have missiles and their Air Force is kept pretty busy due to US monitoring of the no-fly zone.   Have representatives of al-Queda met with representatives of the Iraqi government?  Probably.  And have representatives of al-Queda met with other governments?  Almost definitely.   We don't seem to be  going after other governments (beyond getting the Taliban mostly out of Afghanistan).   There is no rational reason to go to war against Iraq.  While Saddam Hussein is dangerous, he's much, much more dangerous to his own people than he is to the rest of the world.  Containment has worked very well, and can continue to work.     I keep hearing we should be afraid of Saddam Hussein.  It's as if we learned absolutely nothing from September 11 - we need to be more afraid of, more wary of the enemy we cannot see.  Like Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein is more bluster, someone I refuse to loose any sleep over, despite the overly-earnest pronouncements of our government.   Frankly, it's embarrassing."

RBIPTKH89Y,---,---,"Cry...    Somehow, I'm always listening to 'Cry' by Mandy Moore when I start updating my blog. But it's fine, it's a nice song. Kinda ironic to say that though, cause it's suppose to be depressing...is it? Anyway, talking about crying, I really felt like doing so after my Chemistry paper. It was so badly done I knew. I had never been so sure of doing badly for Chemistry. So I kinda broke down, but I didn't really cry though, was just so upset, cause all the papers were a catastrophe. But I'm ok. I have to try to relax and take things easy. But I think I had better study hard for my SA2. Can't believe I actually thought of getting 4 A1s for the End-of-Year. But I'll try to do it. After all, I wouldn't mind the $250 for Best Progress...hehe...*eyes rolling with $$$$*   Today was kinda great. Cause I got back my Chinese paper. I'm top in the class again. But it's only A2. And my class isn't really fantastic too, cause there are so many people who got their As in other classes. Oh well, at least it pulls down my L1R5. Then played carrom in band room after school. Somehow, people still think I'm good, and also find my fancy shots strange. But Mervin's the first person to attempt the fancy shots I do. hehe...he'll go a long way...(hey...who am I to say that). Just kidding...I'm really just an average player. And this was followed by an all out basketball session at Kin Lok's place. It was nice playing the game once again.   I watched 'High School Reunion' yesterday. And it kinda reminded me of my old school mates. Yippee!!! Teachers' Day will be here soon. And I hope I'll be able to gather with them this year. I decided to do something though. I'm gonna confess to my class monitoress that I had a crush on her. Not that I want her to know, but thought it'll be fun to laugh about it. Although I think she already knows. Or maybe the whole class knows. Ah!!! Abram didn't keep the secret!!! (he's my best friend in primary school.) Anyway, so exciting. I can imagine it now...hehe...so amusing.   Many things happen in my life this year. Particularly with other people. And things just don't turn out well. But somehow, I feel much more assured now. Cause I know that God makes all things beautiful in His time. So like the song says, Some Day We'll Know...   Listening to 'It's gonna be love' sang by Mandy Moore again. And there's something I disagree about the song. It goes:  The sooner you let two hearts beat together The sooner you'll know this love is forever (it's gonna be love) Love needs time now or never  And I disagree, cause like I learned, sometimes love have to wait. And the part about now or never. Sometimes,it's time now and it'll be never love. Ok, that's all I guess. Gotta rush on work."

The denial and outrage has been given by all big wigs involved and the performers are calling it a mistake.   Here are some comments:     CBS and the NFL disavowed a Super Bowl halftime performance Sunday night that concluded with Justin Timberlake baring Janet Jackson's right breast.   The incident was so upsetting to the NFL that it suggested MTV won't be permitted to produce another halftime show.   ""We were extremely disappointed by moments of the MTV-produced halftime show,"" said Joe Browne, NFL executive vice president of communications. ""They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the content of the show. It is unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.""   CBS, a sister of MTV (both are owned by Viacom), also appeared to be taken aback by Sunday's show.   ""CBS deeply regrets the incident that occurred during the Super Bowl halftime show,"" a network spokeswoman said. ""We attended rehearsals throughout the week, and there was no indication this would happen. It did not conform to CBS broadcast standards, and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended.""   Timberlake said he did not intend to tear the cup off Jackson's black leather bustier, exposing a nipple piercing shield.   ""I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl,"" Timberlake said in a statement. ""It was not intentional and is regrettable.""    If it was a wardrobe malfunction, what  was  supposed to happen when he reached over there?"

Q7COMV8U5M,---,---,"Alrighty. I got a call from Hubby at around 7am and he let me know that their plane back had been delayed due to bad weather conditions. Originally Hubby and Bashma were supposed to leave the Philadelphia airport at around 8 something but all flights were delayed by 2 ½ hours, approximately.  Uff.    So the plan to pick them up by 1 at the Harlingen airport was off. I would wait until they called me from Houston so that I would leave to pick them up. At around 2pm my husband called and said that they had just arrived to Houston and that they would arrive in Brownsville, not Harlingen. Since their first plane was delayed so much, they missed their connection flight in Houston and they were given another plane, which luckily made its flight all the way to Brownsville. All good for me!  Harlingen is another city about 40-some minutes away, and we live in Brownsville so that would work nice.  He told me that they were scheduled to arrive at around 3:45pm, so I left home close to 3pm.  At that airport I found out that the flight from Houston-Brownsville had been delayed as well and was running about 25 minutes late.  Okay, no problem… everybody was waiting and waiting. Finally it arrived at 4:10pm.    My niece stretched up so much!  She’s about a foot taller… and she’s not 10 or 11. She is actually 9!  Ooops.  Heheh. I received her with a small baggie with a teddy bear and drawing utensils: sketch pad, markers, color pencils, Disney No. 2 pencils, Disney blue and black ink pens, rulers, glue, and Barbie and Hello Kitty stickers. All materials swiped from mom’s home. Heheheh.  She’s got her garage full of notebooks, pens, pencils, markers, PRISMACOLOR pencils (wow… I was like… WOW… each set is worth so much and she has like boxes full).    Well, next we go to pick up the luggage…  the belt goes and goes… and goes and goes… and goes and goes… but no luggage.  Seems that in the change and re-change of flights, the luggage were sent somewhere else.  Hubby’s got all his stuff at home… but Bashma was only wearing what she had on.  Ehhh.    Oh wells.  We went home, ate some byrianni that Hubby’s mom made (nicely packaged in topper ware, which husband carried with him in the plane).  Then my husband had to take a nap while Bashma and I watched cartoons. We have the same taste in shows. ^_^  So after my parents came over (they came from Laredo and before going to their house they stopped at ours to say hi to Bashma), gave me some pillows and cases for Bashma and then headed to their home.  Zulfiker, Bashma and I went shopping for some pajamas and a change of clothes for her, while we got her luggage back.  A couple of hours later we received a call that the airport had located the bags and they would be delivering them to us at around 11pm.  ANNNDDDDD the people from the airport just knocked on the door… it’s 12:21am… Well, better late (or early!) than never!    I’m out."

VFWIXOK3LE,---,---,"How pathetic do I feel right now?  Well I don't have an answer for that but certainly I am feeling about the apex of patheticness at the moment.  I got up this morning...key word is morning...but after eating breakfast, I was cold and got under the covers once again and slept until 4.  How absolutely wonderful it is to sleep for so long and to never accomplish anything.  It's almost like my life, with the exception that in most of my life I have been awake when I don't accomplish anything.  And while I'm in this mood I may as well go on about my new theory of how my Dad likes my sisters boyfriend more than he likes me.  I am not saying love here...love is unconditional I know he loves me.  But on Sunday he didn't ask anyone if they wanted more garlic bread, there were three pieces left and he brought them all down and gave one to my sister, one to her boyfriend and the other for himself.  I realise it was just the mood I was in that day but it really bothered me.  He didn't even ask me if I wanted it.  And I did want it too.  Then it seems like I just get looks...and I know what they (my parents) must be thinking, I mean, I've been back for 4 days and haven't done jack shit.  I mean yes my back hurts but that's no excuse to spend the bulk of my time sleeping.  But somehow I need to get the idea of my head that I can hide from the world while sleeping.  Really that's what it's all about is hiding.  When I'm asleep I don't have to think of any of the things that plague me during my waking hours.  It was bascially a guaruntee that I would become depressed after moving.  In the period of adjustment there is always that weakening of my mind and will.  But I really don't want this to happen, I have so many things that need to get done around here...well not just around here, I have alot of stuff that needs to get done.  But the only things I have any attention span for are sleeping and staring at the tv...now that's pathetic!"

GBUWWC08S6,---,---,"More details:   urlLink      Update:  The Austin American-Statesman, Austin's liberal paper, published this  urlLink article  on the rally.  Notice the article does not mention that the homosexual activists repeatedly yelled and interrupted songs, speakers, and prayers with horns, shouts, and chants, including the frequent ""liar, liar, liar"" while Tony Perkins was speaking.  This is not the way to win over hearts and minds, if that is in fact what these folks were hoping to do.  To be fair, the interruptions were from a small minority of the activists.  The speakers and anttendees responded with restraint and love.  It is very saddening to see how hate seems to drive so many folks in the homosexual lobby.  We all need Christ so very badly.  We all need Him.  By Anita Powell While nearly 100,000 Austinites flocked to Zilker Park for this year's Independence Day festivities, about 400 others thronged the empty Texas Capitol to toss a hot issue on the grill: gay marriage.   In sweltering late-afternoon heat, about 150 supporters of gay marriage and about 250 people on the other side of the issue participated in an impassioned but orderly event that featured singing, speeches and a spontaneous union of the factions for a group prayer on the Capitol steps.   ""The issue is, we will be codifying into law what God himself has called an abomination,"" said keynote speaker Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Washington-based lobbying group that sponsored the Christian-centered event with Austin-based TakeUp.org.   Representing the opposition were the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas and Soulforce Austin, both gay rights groups.   Randall Ellis, executive director of the lobby group, said he felt it was his patriotic duty to represent gay rights.   ""I would much rather be home with my mother and father,"" he said. ""But I feel very strongly that I had to be here.""   Austin resident Doug McArthur, 59, came with his wife, Joan, to support their daughter, who is gay.   ""We have a 33-year-old boy and a 29-year-old girl,"" said Joan McArthur, 57. ""And both of them should be able to marry their girlfriends if they want to.""   Bryan Sturdivant, 46, brought his wife and daughter, but to support the opposite view. The family attends the Church at Canyon Creek, a Baptist congregation in North Austin that brought a group to the event.   ""I believe God created us as man and woman, and that's the way it should be,"" he said. ""America was founded on God. And we've got to get back to him.""   Some Christians in the crowd did not agree with that message, however.   ""I believe that God created all people and that everyone is equal in his eyes,"" said Kristen Thomas, 20, who is Catholic. ""Jesus loved tax collectors, he loved prostitutes; why wouldn't he have loved gays?""   Megan Steves, 26, and Naomi Douglas, 28, stood with their arms around each other's shoulders on the Capitol steps. Steves held a sign in support of gay marriage that read, ""I can't.""   ""Independence Day doesn't mean anything when people aren't able to make their own decisions,"" Steves said. ""They did this with blacks. And they're doing this with gays.""   But Julius Buckner, 50, who said he opposes gay marriage, blanched at the comparison to the civil rights movement.   ""It's not the same,"" said Buckner, who is black. ""They still have the right to do what they want to.""   An unexpected moment of solidarity occurred at the end, when the Rev. Michael Hatcher, pastor of Lighthouse Community Church in Fort Worth, invited the protesters to join him onstage in prayer.   ""Let freedom ring in your heart,"" he prayed, stricken with emotion, surrounded by a throng of activists, arms linked, hands clasped, intermingled and indistinguishable.   ""I saw it as an opportunity to spread love,"" he said of his call to prayer. ""For me not to call my enemies to come and reconcile would be the wrong thing for me to do."""

QNGXKEHFOZ,---,---,"We Spent an Enjoyable Three Days...  ...up in Boston and a cold, rainy day down in Newport.  Jim and I help to run science fiction conventions.  Last year, we managed the  urlLink Program  division  for the Millennium Philcon.  So now that we're starting to emerge from the burn-out from last year's Worldcon, we're starting to work on the 2004 Worldcon.  We really don't know what we'll be doing for the next Noreascon.  Jim has been somewhat more definite than I've been; I have some ideas of what I'd like to do, but I'm mostly trying to be very flexible and open-minded.  While we lived in Massachusetts from 1982-1993, we only spend about a week a year up there now as we're settled in Pittsburgh.  Boston is really bustling, despite the high tech bust.  I saw at least eight different limos in the Back Bay last Saturday night.  We visited friends and family and had some terrific meals.  We highly recommend Tapeo, a suburb Spanish Tapas restaurant about three blocks away from the Sheraton (home of next year's  urlLink Boskone  and  urlLink N4 in 2004 )."
I5WDLPVXBN,---,---,"Shoulders and legs day. Do you know why I love squats so much? Because if feels so good when I stop!  I'm feeling back in the exercise groove; I've decided I should run on Saturday and do a little more weight training on Monday to supplement my Tue/Wed/Fri workouts.    Last night I watched a movie I haven't seen in ages:  urlLink The Towering Inferno . Unlike  The Swarm , this movie is actually decent meow. I won't say great; it is somewhat dated. But what a cast! Both Paul Newman AND Steve McQueen. I spent some of the movie wondering whose eyes were bluer. My vote is McQueen.  I fondly recall that when my sister and I saw that movie, she decided she wanted Newman, and I wanted McQueen. I was 11 in 1975. In some ways I miss all those hormone rushes. Middle age sucks.  It also had William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Richard Chamberlain - you know, when he came out of the closet I was relieved I no longer had to feel guilty over all those times I saw him and thought ""I bet he's gay"". Not that there's anything wrong with that meow.  While the movie held up its tension in some places, in other places my eyes were crossing at how slow the action was creeping. I found another use for TiVo at that point: I sped up the entire 'scale down the twisted stair railings sequence' from about 5 hours to a half a minute. TiVo rules!  Some of the fun of this movie is the old-fashioned sexism: Newman and Dunaway are a couple - I could never figure out if they were married or not. Newman has just gotten a job out in bumblefuckmeow, Montana; and Dunaway has just been promoted in her job in San Fransisco. You don't have to be psychic to figure out who gived up his or her job by the end of the movie.    I taped  urlLink Midway , a movie about the turning point in the war in the Pacific. It has an amazing cast, including Charlton Heston. He's not an ex-listee, he has always had his own little niche in my heart.  Oh, yeah: editorial note. To all the people who mealy-mouthed Mr. Heston for becoming the head of the NRA. How dare you paint a man who marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. as some sort of ultra right-wing fanatic! I'm glad that Bush got elected; if nothing else because you aimed your 2-minute Hate sessions at someone else. Disagreeing with his stance on the 2nd amendment is one thing; making fun of his Alzheimer's is another. Yeah, you, George Clooney, you little meowdweeb!   Enough of *my* 2 minute Hate. More like a 2 minute grudge. I don't hold Clooney's stupidity or politics against him. If I did that, I'd have to do it for other actors then I'd probably never see another movie again.  Back to  Midway . Heston or no, cast of thousands or no, it is a boring-ass movie. I must have seen it a million times when I was a kid but this time it's slow going. I think I mentioned this before; it suffers from  Titanic  syndrome: much of the story is about a young pilot who is in love meow with a Japanese-American (whoopsie!). It hasn't really gotten to the battle scenes yet, so maybe I'll appreciate it more later on.  And in other news I'm hoping to talk Jon into going to see  urlLink Club Dread  with me. It's been a while since Bill Paxton's been in anything humorous. I found the humor in   Super Troopers  a little uneven, but the stuff I found funny I found to be really funny meow."

That's just plain disgusting."
DT0UBAWQ75,---,---,"The new Batman  movie has started filming. Some photos have popped up on the web:  urlLink go here  especially if you are a Christian fan. No batsuit photos; just him being Bruce Wayne. And I have heard all the ""Bateman"" jokes I care to, thankyouverymuch.  Judging by his face, he isn't on one of his severe body-altering diets.   I watched  urlLink The Patriot  last night, with ex-listee Mel Gibson and very much a listee Jason Isaacs (as the Evil Bad Guy). There's some pretty scenery in this movie, and some random acts of violence, but I could have done without all the cliches. This is one of those movies that I would have liked to have played script doctor on. Why make the Evil Bad Guy such a cartoon? Couldn't he and Gibson's Benjamin Martin come to be antagonists simply because they were on different sides? Why the snidely whiplash behavior (burns the house, shoots wounded Colonial soldiers AND one of Martin's sons)? The movie also had  Tchéky Karyo, a french actor whose name I can't pronounce but can always count on for an interesting character. And Chris Cooper (always interesting characters, far more pronouncable name).   urlLink Bundling,  by the way, is a real custom.  Why oh why is there mention of Orlando Bloom and James Bond in the same sentence? Clive Owen and Colin Firth at least have that generic handsome British man thing going for them. Bloom is a puppy! Great elves do not make great James Bonds. Hell, Hugh Jackman rumors make more sense to me.   I've mentioned  this before; when I become smitten by an actor, I do research on the web. I try to tell myself it's only to glean info on his movies, but that's partially horseshit. I do have a interest in the person himself. For the most part, I research then I leave. Occasionally though I find a fairly interesting fan community. Jason Isaacs is one of my favorite  urlLink and the only one  that I'm an active member of. I dig the people on the message board. Mostly older women but occasionally younger; they refer to themselves sometimes as a 'sewing circle'. There are topics that are strictly prohibited, especially any sexual in nature (although posts about how 'hot' a character or the actor himself are okay as long as they don't go into masturbatory detail). And if you want to be tarred and feathered, then run out on a rail, constantly use bad grammar and insult Mr. Isaac's family.   He occasionally reads the message boards, too. I'm sure it's a bit mind-bending and an ego rush to visit a community based around you.  I'm not active, but I subscribe to a fan mailing list for Damian Lewis. I stay subscribed because their community is a hoot, as well. Again, I'm struck by the older nature of the fans (the photo section has one area where fans post pictures of themselves with the actor) which is surprising because Lewis is in his early 30's (I want to say 32). There isn't so much self-regulating censorship here, but it hasn't really been needed that I've seen. People are more open about their feelings towards the actor (they refer to themselves as 'gutter bunnies' and once sent Lewis a huge boxful of ladies' underwear) but no one gets gross and I have yet to see a flame war erupt. I have been kept in stitches by all the stories of women whose husbands are curious about their sudden interest in World War II.  I have never met any celebrity beyond the occasional local news personality. I have seen some - when the Braves all of a sudden learned how to play baseball in the early 90's Fulton County stadium was crawling with them. Emilio Esteves was in town filming  Freejack  and he and his brother Charlie Sheen showed up once when the Cardinals (or was it the Reds?) were in town. My sister Andrea jabbed me in the ribs with an elbow when Sheen skulked past our seats wearing sunglasses and a ballcap. She whispered excitedly ""Hey! That's Charlie Sheen!!"" My thoughts were, ""so?"" Not impressed.  The late Gregory Hines came to a ballgame and he smiled and waved at people who were pointing at him. He was cool.   Arnold Swarzenneger and wife came to the stadium once. 6 foot 3 inch John Smoltz walked up to him and shook his hand; I was struck by how *short* arnold is. I'd put him somewhere between 5'6"" and 5'8"".  But anyway, I'm leading up to a point: would I want to ever meet an actor I admire/love/drool over? No; what if he was in a bad mood or something? I'm such a wuss. Well, if I ever could, I'd buy Bill Paxton a beer. He's such a hoot."
47RQMCWTBB,---,---,"I've been seeing a commercial on TV lately: a mother comforting her child, sitting in the bathroom with the shower on, encouraging the child to breathe deeply.  The camera pans to the medicine cabinent, where the mother chooses a medicine capsule, and continues to murmur comforting words to the child.  The commercial concludes with something about 1 in 5 families in America must choose between medicine or food.  The shower confused me the first few times I saw the commercial, but presumably the child has asthma.  I am wondering about the 1 in 5 statement though: how did they come up with this number?  I don't remember who pays for the commercial, or I'd look them up, but I checked around on Google rather extensively, and---for a problem so large---there is precious little real information.  Nearly every website I visited was an  assertion  by someone, usually a politician sponsoring a bill, a aid worker, or an opinion writer, that some people, especially the elderly, must choose between medicine and food.  The only actual evidence I could find  urlLink was a study  done in a Minneapolis hospital in 2001 or before, which concluded that 18% of 527 patients (53 people) had not had enough food to eat at least once in the previous year.  Now, it may be true that thousands upon thousands of Americans must choose between medicine and food, as one source I read claimed, but I haven't seen any  evidence  of that.  I'd like to know the truth, one way or the other: too many of those ""1 in 5"" claims are based on estimations or plain old spurious data."
F6F22OL711,---,---,"It has been such a hectic week.  Mom's closing the store so I've had to terminate contracts, write letters, pack equipment, move furniture, so on and so forth.  Most of the things we would like to get rid of because they are simply too big to store in any of our houses.  While I can have 4 computers in my house, 10 is just a tat too much. Not to mention I'd also have to bring the desks, shelves, display cases, etc, etc.  So we placed a couple of ads in the newspaper and some people have come to check out the stuff.  Mostly people from businesses wanting to get more equipment at a liquidation price, which is fine with me as long as they don't expect me to just give stuff away especially since all our stuff is in very good condition (my mother is a cleanliness true believer) and fairly 'new.'    So far we have been selling to people that just walk in to get a regular service and then find out that we are selling the stuff.  For a business a couple of hundreds may seem to high to pay for a piece of office furniture, but for a regular person it's a sweet deal - I just sold our lunchroom wood table with 4 chairs for 50 bucks... The thing is dark wood and weights at least 20 lbs a chair! None of that economy store stuff.  Highlight of the day - I had an exchange of heated words with some guy in the back alley.  I took my mom out to eat and when we were turning to park in our area (behind the store there is a one-way alley to our parking) this guy had his big truck parked right on the street opposing traffic.  So we were 'going' and he seemed to be 'coming.'  So I stopped my car and we waited nose to nose with his truck.  He had our parking behind him (we have room for a bout 3 or 4 cars in there) and we had... The street with all incoming traffic behind us.  The guy takes his sweet time and then gets in the truck and turn on the engine.  We look at each other and he raises his arms as if saying 'now what?'.  I make signs telling him to back up.  He shakes his head vigorously and signals me to back up.  Here I am, looking behind at all the coming cars (weren't really on the main street, but perpendicular to it; T style) and decide that it is simpler for him to back up because he has no cars behind him and all the parking space just to scoot over so I can pass to My parking area.    So we keep up signaling each other to move back and my mother gets down to tell him.  He said something and she comes back telling me to just back up and I asked why?  Was he towing something that was not allowing him to move back on this somewhat narrow road?  He kept up making sign and telling me to move and I get down.   ""Sir, that's my parking area. We work here.""    ""It's not important if you work here or not.  Move back so I can get out.""      ""It doesn't cost you Anything to move back.""    ""It doesn't cost you anything either.""    ""Well I am not going to.  You have no cars behind you and I have a the entire flow of 10 street!  MOVE BACK.  THIS IS MY PLACE, I PAY THE CITY FOR THIS ALLEY""    ""I PAY TOO!""    ""WELL I DON'T CARE. YOU MOVE NOW OR I CALL THE POLICE.  YOU ARE GOING ON THE OPPOSITE WAY AND YOU KNOW IT SO JUST MOVE BACK.""    ""Fine, I'll do you THE FAVOR-""    ""You are doing No Favor to me because you are WRONG and you know it.  SO MOVE. ANDELE!"" I snapped my fingers because by this time I was already super pissed. Then I turned and got in my car and waited for the guy to back away.  I parked and he went.   Pfft!  As if I was going to back away because he just felt like driving on the opposite direction of incoming traffic, park to check his frickn' tires and then expect me to wait for him and move back into the coming car so that he could just waltz to the main road.      As IF!"

I sometimes go with her to play.  I always have fun and usually, I learn something I never knew before.   For example, tonight, one twin and the four year old decided to help me get ready to get married.  The two year old put a scarf on my head and said, ""Now you can get married.""  At first, I thought she said, ""You can be Mary,"" thinking we were going to do a Bible story, but I finally realized (after a few repeats) she was saying, ""Put this on.  Now you can get  married .""    While the 4 year old put barrettes and a flower wreath in my hair, I asked the little one, ""So, what does the preacher say when you get married?"" thinking she'd recently been to a wedding and that's why all of a sudden she was talking about marriage.  She looked at me and said, ""he says, 'put this on,' and you're married.""  Then she put another scarf over my legs and said, ""there.  Now you won't ever be cold again.""  Meanwhile the four year old said, as she tied a man's necktie around my head, ""the preacher says you have to be tied together or it just won't work.""    ""Really?""  I ask.  ""What  else  does the preacher say?""  4 year old:  ""He tells you to take your clothes off.  All of them.  Then put on a bathing suit."" 2 year old:  (He says)  ""Now, let's have lunch!"" 4 year old:  ""You really do have to take all your clothes off, but then you put on the bathing suit and it's okay."" 2 year old (after the scarf falls off):  ""You can't get married without this on!""  Who knew that if I would just put a scarf on I could get married?  (ha ha)  I also learned something about the Great Wall of China.  The 4 year old and I watched about 21 minutes of  Mulan  before she went to bed.  In the very beginning there's a scene that shows the Great Wall.  She turns to me and says, ""that's the great big wall.  A  great  wall.  It goes up China and down China.  It goes  all over  China.""  I wonder if this all means I should honeymoon in China after I put my scarf on and get married?  Lots to ponder..."
QFD66IBT90,---,---,"Oh lord what am I doing up???  I have to get up for work in three hours.  I was just laying in bed with a million thoughts coming to me, many of them surprisingly clever.

Which would essentially be a book of some of my opinions and theories.  Most of which many people don't know.  It is this laying in bed and thinking that has made me realise that someone should invent software that will take the thoughts I am thinking and transfer them to the computer.  I am so much more clever when simply thinking as opposed to speaking or writing.  Everything is so much more cohesive in my head.  Well, at least in terms of certain things.

You get a nice little catalog to your door; samples of the new stuff, if you don't know much about their items you can always ask the local representative to give you some. You place your order with your rep and 2 weeks later you get your items delivered to your door. It's just great.  Of course... only buy from catalogs when you are not in desperate need of the products... so gotta make sure you're not close to the last drop of make-up when you order.  Two weeks without blush... eeeckkk!    My favorite stuff from Avon are its hair products. The oil treatments are wonderful.  They leave your hair shiny, soft, and smelling sweet.  Eye shadows, eye liners, and nail polish are a few of the other products I buy from the catalog. I stick to earth tones, and the occasional frosty pink or violet for the eyes, but brown and golden suit me best.  Lipsticks have to be golden, sand, light coffee, anything light brown to natural lip color. I do not feel I look good with red, oranges, or bright pinks - my lips are not thick enough... and they're crooked so those colors make it too obvious ~_~.   See piccie on profile  Nail polish colors: clear, clear with sprinkles, tan, light brown, mauve rose, those tones that are not too obvious, but that still show a little if you pay close attention.      Pretty color!      So very me    A couple of fragrances are good too, but I don't buy fragrances from Avon often, except for the aromatherapies - Avon has some nice orchid and lavender ones. When I buy my perfumes, I only get one, which does not happen to be an Avon one.  It's a perfume I have been wearing since the teenage years. It mixes very well with my skin and my natural scent.  I do not give out my perfume brand. ^_^ Wouldn't want the whole world smelling yummy like me!  Too bad it is getting more and more difficult to find. So I guess I better start trying out new fragrances.  I tried patchouli once... nice but not me.  I also bought this bottle of Acqua di Gio for women... it smells wonderfully on other people. With me it's just too sweet, but darn it, I paid close to 70 bucks for it so I have to wear it from time-to-time.  Oh yes. And I used to sell Avon when I started college. ^_^  I would make nice little comissions ranging in the 100s.  Paid for books and gas for a semester with this part-time job.  I no longer do it, though; I do not like to order things for people when I don't get the money up front. Hehehe.

Basically I've just been writing the book (which is coming along nicely, and about 1/15th finished, what a milestone, huh?) and reading and sleeping. I watched two hour long documentaries on Japanese history. I've decided to relinquish my grudge against modern Japan, as long as they promise to stop being so damn capitalist. The deal is in process, and I think they'll agree. Anyway, Japan is just an awesome country with a few drawbacks (everyone here who likes Japan watches entirely too much anime, which (I'm sorry) is kinda stupid., and there are too many people living there, and they make all kinds of high tech gadgets I don't care about and frankly don't trust.). I had Indian food for dinner tonight, and I LOVED it. I had Butter Chicken (curiously unbuttery), Kalachi Chicken, and some basmati rice and tasty flatbread. Very spicy, and magically delicious. I have promised myself that I will learn to make both Indian Butter Chicken, and Vietnamese Lemongrass soup. I'd also like to try some of the vegetarian recipes that come out of Southeast Asia.

One can't help but cry when they hear things like that.    Mattie participated in college level courses at the young age of 10 and wished to be remembered as a peacemaker.  Jimmy Carter was his idol.  He wanted us all to make the world a better place, however small.  Mattie extraordinarily enough was able to maintain his faith in God throughout his illness which enabled him to never fear death.  He cherished each and every day as a gift. Mattie was successful in leaving the world a better place then in which he found it."

Did one jump had a bad landing. More embarrassing than painful. We had a pool party at our house Saturday night and I slept in on Sunday.   The only thing I watched was  urlLink Ghosts of the Abyss , James Camernon's documentary about the Titanic. It was originally released in 3D in IMAX theaters. I wish I had seen it in the theater.   James Cameron led an expedition to the Titanic in 2001 and filmed a great deal of the wreckage using technology specifically created for the endeavor; namely two Remotely Operated Vehicles he nicknamed ""Jake"" and ""Elwood"". These little robots on fiber optic leashes were used to squeeze through windows and tight spaces to film deep into the interior of the shiprwerck. Cameron invited his friend Bill Paxton along. Paxton has acted in 4 of Cameron's movies, including  Titanic . The reason he was asked along seems to be as a stand-in for the audience. He's not a technician, diver, marine biologist, etc. so many scenes with him in it involve the professionals explaining to him about what is going on.   In his first experience aboard the tiny submersibles they take down to the Titanic wreck he is understandably quite nervous. By the later dives he participated in he is helping out like an old hand. He narrates most of the movie, too.   I really liked this documentary. It is a nice complementary piece to his movie and you really get a feel for the layout of the ill-fated ship. I enjoyed the movie  Titanic , but like a lot of people older than 14, I thought the love triangle was pointless. I give Mr. Cameron some points back with this movie."

It's about commitments, my future, people's future, and responsibility. It's no longer just me. For some reason, I'm starting to realise how one's life can change others. And I've gotta be more sensitive now.   Yesterday was a really special day for me. It reminded me very much that I'm growing up and that I've gotta take my life seriously now. It was my birthday. But I was really quiet. It was the first time I really actually celebrated with my friends. Not really used to being special. But I was thinking. Thinking about people and life.And how much things have changed since I turned 14, and now, before I knew it, I've spent 15 years in this world. But thanks anyway to those who made my day yesterday.   Today I had cross country. Never did enjoy it before. But this year, it was raining. So it was a totally different experience, and didn't regret the run that much. Then went to Macs for lunch and talked to some of my friends about the fate of the section. It's quite exciting. How things are gonna change with our leadership. But I should just stick to my job, and get my stocks all checked.   Really glad to be able to share my life with some people again. I've gone thru alot with people, and sometimes I'm glad I did. It somehow makes me feel that the reltionship is really special. Guess that's what it's all about, going thru together."

I'm flooded with visions of moving to San Diego, California (which for some reason is the land of opportunity for me -- or maybe just change? the weather is DEFINITELY a large reason), leaving my job at the end of the year, grad school, Peace Corps, teaching English in a foreign land, or just becoming a professional musician -- maybe joining a pro vocal band or something.

L625S75E2H,---,---,"I've found one of my paper topics.  ADHD and its treatments.  Am I really that interested in this topic?  Not really.  Then why am I writing about it?  Because I'm pissed off that today's class was so incredibly one-sided in discussing the issue.  Even when I was fishing for a sliver of support for the other side of the argument, I got no answers to my question.  I mean, it really shouldn't be that big of a deal, especially since I generally agree with what the professor and random-guy-in-back-with-degree were saying, but the implications of it all really began to piss me off afterward.  We're in an institution of higher learning where we should be encouraged to do just that: learn.  There are very few topics in the social sciences that can be conclusively decided upon one way or another.  Each side has its supporters, and each side has its adversaries.  I fully believe that we should be taught to search through both sides of the argument before coming to conclusions for ourselves.  I agree that professors and the like should have their own opinions about the topic and should be able to voice such opinions, but I also think that they should be qualified as opinions and not be discussed as if they were absolute fact.  They know we're impressionable, they know we're barely educated about any of these areas which they study with years of experience and expertise.  But their experience still does not justify this narrow-mindedness when it comes to not allowing students to explore all sides of the argument in order to form their own opinions.  And this is just an education class.  I can't even begin to fathom what goes on in the realms of more controversial disciplines.  Last week there were tons of articles talking about academia's reaction to Bush, revealing that over 90% of poli sci professors here who identify with one of the two major political parties are democrat.  Yes, I need to watch my influences, especially lately, but really, some diversity here please?  Fuck all this racial business.  Skin color does not equal diversity.  It's a diversity of ideas that really matter in an insitution of higher education, and granted these ideas may stem from a variety of experiences including being of a minority status, it's not all about race.  So stop fixating on it.  And now that we're looking at people's ideas--and political affiliation governs so many aspects of these ideas--we see how grossly unbalanced this department is.    I've never taken a poli sci class before (cuz' you all know how much I detest politics), but I'd imagine that one-sided arguments can be much more prevalent than in my ed classes.  It makes me sad, then, if this is really true, because as much as we'd like to think we're perpetuating the concept of learning and discovery, we may just be feasting on these spoon-fed opinions with little thought otherwise.    So note to self when I'm a professor: express opinions, justify them as opinions, empower students with the resources to form their own opinions, and for the love of god, fucking answer questions when asked."

XNC5YTHXCJ,---,---,"New Line Cinema - What Were They Thinking?   I've been to see  The Two Towers  four times (so far).  It's a glorious movie, but in order to see the movie, you have to see way too many bad trailers.  This tendency to preload potentially popular movies with bad trailers is so bad that audiences have been known to start yelling at the screen after a few minutes (in fact, Jim reported a full half hour of commercials and trailers before the premiere showing of  The Two Towers ).  What were they thinking?  How can the same company with the vision to bankroll Peter Jackson's dream to the tune of nearly 1/3rd of a billion dollars (and still make money at it), be the same company to make:   Final Destination 2   When Harry Met Lloyd  (Dumb vs. Dumber II)  A Man Apart  (the next Vin Diesel flick)  And I thought they were also responsible for the outrageously stupid concept movie,  The Core  (since I've been subjected to this preview every time I've gone to see  The Two Towers ), but it turns out that Paramount is to blame for what looks to be the most ludicrous waste of a studio's money since  Battlefield Earth .  Now it turns out that New Line Cinema did produce one other recently-released and fairly well-reviewed movie, namely  About Schmidt .  But it seems like everything else New Line is at all involved with (except for  The Lord of the Rings  movies) are pointless concept movies aimed at 14-year-old boys.  Yes, I know they buy the most tickets, but if the huge success of the  LOTR  movies shows anything it's that kids will pay to see films with a thoughtful story and good acting."

I'm a young Buddhist, with a scary amount of dedication to Buddhist practice and the following of Dharma as purely as possible. I'm not very good at it, but I try very hard. I'm a Theravada/Zen Buddhist, and I live in the west so crossing two very different traditions like that is acceptable. Beyond even that, I'm a political thinker. I am a socialist, in a broad sense of the word. I have read Marx, and I don't agree with all of it, but I greatly respect the ideology of communism, and the spirit it represents. That said, I'm not sure pure communism has a place in the modern world, especially after Marxism-Leninism has twisted it so fully that I'm not sure it could ever recover. Socialism, however, lives on. The ideology that it is immoral for rich men to sail around on yachts while women and children die in the streets of starvation. Does that make sense to you? It should. There is nothing wrong with redistribution of wealth according to fairness, and laws should be passed in the interests of those who need them most, not those who have the most economic or political power. Politics should be focused on the helpless and the voiceless, not on the bourgeois who use their connections and money to engineer government into an engine working in their favor. That's my little red rant."
WGKXKBZ6WC,---,---,"Alright last night We had a party and I didn't go cuz I'm a loser.  Actually I fell asleep real early and then decided that hunting a costume down in the last few moments of the night would not be worth it.  Even though People did come in a keep waking me up, it's a frat house and i knew that stuff when I signed on.  And thats the fun stuff anyway keeps me from becoming a hermit.  The best though was Lasher (Loecher..  i know how to spell it) came in at like 2:30 and needed someone to ref his boxing match with Walker.  So i went down and watched these two drunk fools duke it out.  It was very, very humurous but Lasher did pretty well especially considering the drunk factor.  But other than that I read some more for my speech I have to write for tues. on my main man  urlLink Hunter S. Thompson .  It should end up being pretty interesting.  But i also have a Western Civ paper due Wed.  which will be rough so I don't know if I'm going to go out at all this weekend.  I probably will end up going out tonight though..

YWXUBFYOAY,---,---,"It's been taking me a while to get my mom back-floating.  At first I tried teaching her the most basic way I know how: let yourself go back... arch your head back, the back of your head touching the neck, and the water will probably cover pass the ears (but not into the eyes or nose).  Then the body will just... float up.  It didn't quite work with her.  She was tensing up too much so that her legs would just fall down and take the rest of her as well. She was nervous.    The next step was to get her some floaters so that she could hold with her feet. That helped a lot more, but still she would start falling in after a while.  So then we went into teaching her to thread water while on her back.  With that she also became aware of how she could push her body up or move it about the area, which is nice.  Little by little.  She just needed to get comfortable and while she's still not 100% floating, she can hold the relaxed position for about 2 minutes.  ^_^  Now she practices with a styro board too.  It's all about kicks.  Well, it has been a little over 3 weeks now and she can swim Front Crawl style (yey!).  She still cannot put her head down in the water too much.  She starts it fine and gets quite a distance in about 5 strokes, but when she starts getting in air, it looks as if she misses the coordination between strokes and breathing.  She gave me quite a scare Monday.  In one of those, she took in some water that went the wrong way and she couldn’t breathe even after she stopped.  She calmed down once I had her by the edge of the pool and she began to breathe again.  Hmmm... I may get into some water rescue courses one of these days.  While I know how to swim 'alright' and how to get a person out of the water, I do not know exactly what to do when someone is in a 'safe' area, but that has just swallowed water and is 'nervous' (therefore making themselves choke even more).  Gotta research more on what to do there.  I will take the next 'class' in a different way.  Nothing but kicks for a while.  I have to get her comfortable with the head under water while she gains a balance of how to inhaled and exhale for swimming.  In other words, I need to teach her how to let her breath out under water."
5ZR2SXPZ02,---,---,"I haven't  finished  Warriors  yet, but I did do some research on that period. Apparently, after Tito (one of the Jackson 5) died and after the breakup of the Soviet Union (good riddance), Yugoslavia as a nation broke apart. Part of that breakup was the state of Bosnia-Herzocantspellit which has three distinct ethnic groups - the Serbs (Bosnia is right next to Serbia) who are Eastern Orthodox Christian, The Croats (Bosnia is right next to Croatia, as well) who are Catholic, and the Muslims (Slavs whose ancestors converted during the Ottoman Empire).  Slobodan Miloshevich, Serbia's ruler, didn't give much truck to the idea of Bosnian independence, instead preferring they stay attached to Serbia, despite the fact that the Serbs are a minority there. He whipped up a lot of nationalistic attitudes in Bosnia. That, plus a better army and plenty of warped press, incited the bloodbath that was Bosnia in the early 1990s. The United Nations stepped in in 1992 only to keep the populace fed.  What is really sad is these three groups, plus the requisite put-upon Jews and Gypsies, had lived in peaceful coexistence for 500 years (barring the happy time everyone had during WWII). These people aren't tribal types; Yugoslavia was an advanced European nation (despite the commie rule). What brought them to such awful destruction was ignorance, a controlled flow of news, and a petty tyrant.   Deciding to interfere or not when Hell breaks out is tough. When shite hits the fan its always the ordinary men, women, and children who suffer. Those who have any type of power thrive in appalling circumstances. My knee-jerk reaction is hell yes, go in there and make them stop hurting each other! But then what? If you get involved in a fight you will be beaten up as well. I'm not a student of history (the fact that I was predominantly ignorant of the problems in the Balkans until I saw a movie with a pretty face or two in it proves that), but it always seems to boil down to if you get involved you have to stomp pretty hard. Ordinary men, women, and children suffer. How can you insure that things won't get back to the normal business of killing if you leave? Hate is a mighty powerful emotion and you can't make people stop hating each other by getting in their way."
QUVKOLY7G2,---,---,"Good morning, loves! I hope you are doing wonderfully. It is a little rainy outside right now, and I am glad to have my computer back because I am planning on doing some writing today. My dad took it in to get fixed, and they deleted all my mp3s. Every last fucking one. Nothing was spared. I have nothing to listen to, and no program to download music. At least they saved my book. I was worried they would kill it.  What has happened since we last talked? Let me think. Oh! indeed, that's right, I have dreadlocks. So far, being dreaded has not been such a positive experience. It took a total of fifteen hours of excruciating pain with my sister backcombing like mad and stabbing me. And when they were finished, they stood straight up like waxy liberty spikes, and made me very sad. But now they've settled down. The last kick in the balls is this - I can't wash them for a week because they will fall apart if I wash them too soon. Do you know how nasty dreads get even after two days? It's disgusting, really. I still love them though. And yesterday I actually went out and did something, which was cool. I took the car and said I was going to Nate's. So I did, but then he hopped in the car and we picked up Liz. This was phase A of the plan, pick up Liz and get something to eat. So we drove the McDonalds in Magnetic hill, and Nate stole me a milkshake, and got some boardwalk tickets, and we set off to go gocarting which was fun. And then we drove to the mall (in the process of which I nearly got us killed several times cutting people off and changing lanes at the last minute and in general mystifying my fellow drivers with totally random and unpredictable movements) And Nate got Best of U2, from 1990-2000. And Finally, we returned to Nate's house and he burned me a copy of the CD (glee) and we chilled out and watched part of Daredevil which was so tacky and cheesy and gross that it was funny. Liz had basketball at 8, so it was pretty much over by then anyway, and I can't drive after dark so I was home at 9. Plans for today? 4000 words in the book, reading Desolation Angels, not washing my dreadlocks. That's the plan."

DIX9J07SVO,---,---,"THE CHRISTMAS PICKLE   Yes, you read that right... I am going to write about a pickle.   Why?    Jene' and I were shopping today and we were looking at ornaments.  I noticed a  pickle  ornament and chuckled.  Jene' told me it was a traditional ornament and one of her heritages (German, Scottish, Irish) put  pickles  on their trees.  Of course, she bought one to put on our tree.  Curiosity got the best of me and I called upon my friend, Google, to help me understand the enigma of the Christmas Pickle.  Here's where Google sent me ( urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/home/sallinger/holidayhouse/christpickle.htm ).  According to this website, the legend of the Christmas pickle comes from this story:   The Medieval tale of the pickle tells of two Spanish boys traveling home from boarding school for the holidays.  Weary from travel, they stop at an inn for the night.  The inn keeper, a mean and evil man, steals the boys' possessions, and stuffs the boys into a pickle barrel.  That evening, St. Nicholas stops in for a rest at the inn, and becomes aware of the boys' plight.  He taps the pickle barrel with his staff, and the boys are magically restored.  The boys thank St. Nicholas, and continue happily home for Christmas.    Okay, I think, much like many Christmas traditions, this little tale yielded marketable dividends, namely, a glass blown ornament (Production of the blown glass Christmas ornament started in the1890's).  Apparently, it's a kick for kids to hunt for this little ornament on the tree, for if they find it first, they either get to open their presents first, get whatever present they want, or get an extra present...depending on which website's info you choose to believe, and the financial status of the family.    Granted, many of the most...unique... Christmas traditions are German, so being of German/Swiss descent, I should have been aware of this little piece of Deutsche Christmas Lore, but alas, I was clueless.   Therefore, I wanted to educate the rest of you so you can run to the store and get Christmas Pickles to put on your tree.    I prefer dill.  :)"

GDT8N2QDG3,---,---,"I know that I promised to write in this thing everyday, but that proved to be more tedious than I had originally anticipated.  My apologies....I will make a greater effort in the future.  So a few days ago I got an IM from this guy that I used to know from the summer of my junior year in college....we used to talk almost every day and all of a sudden I just stopped returning his phone calls.  Now for those of you who know me, this is not uncharacteristic, in fact it is per my usual.  (It's not something I'm proud of, it just kind of happens and for those of you who know me best, you don't hold it against me)  Anyways, he IMs me to ask whatever happened to me and why I did what I did.....I offered him no real answers; which only further served to unsettle him.  By the end of our 45 minute conversation, more like him telling me his thoughts for 45 minutes, he told me how cold, unfeeling, and 'callous' I had been and that he hoped that I would one day look back on our conversation and realize how wrongly I had acted.......riiiiiiight, don't hold your breath.    But now the issue for me lies in the fact that I keep thinking about that conversation and how I was like John Malkovich in ""Dangerous Liasons"" telling Michelle Pfeifer that it was ""beyond my control.""  Perhaps it was beyond my control because I was genuinely unphased by my behavior and lack of reaction to him.  It is this very lack of a reaction that is becoming problematic to me......it's kind of twisted to remain unphased by another's obvious distress over a bad situation, yet blatantly refuse to help alleviate it.  I couldn't bring myself to do it.......I simply chose not to.  AND, here's the real kicker.....if I had it to do all over again I would have acted in exactly the same manner.  Sick."

O7I57IMZCJ,---,---,"I finished reading Howl by Allen Ginsberg again, and I am consistently amazed by the depth of beauty, and the intensity of that poem, despite its profanity and such. I think that the opening line to that poem has been burned into my mind forever... "" I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked."" Allen Ginsberg has been the greatest (ok, you caught me - only) influence on my poetry. If you haven't read Howl you must, as in right now. You can find it on the internet for free. It's a little lengthy, but easily possible to read in one sitting, even if you contemplate every word like I do. Speaking of poetry, I developed a plan in fifth period today. I will take every random poem I write, the two sides crumpled pieces of looseleaf with nonsense and hallucination scrawled all over them, and give them to Andrew R (my trusted beatnik compatriot) for safekeeping. When I die (hopefully with some renown for prose writing) I will ask him in my will to edit and publish those poems, giving the proceeds to charity. The main part of the plan I like is writing lots of random poetry and never seeing it again, but knowing it very well may come to some use. I wouldn't care very much if the whole lot of it burned either, so there's nothing lost.   There is a lot of writing going on right now. I have pulled out the manuscript of my novel, which will be called either ""Place of Refuge"", or ""No Utopia"" (I haven't decided, maybe the correct name is still out there somewhere) and I am editing it. There are parts I really like, and I smiled as I reread them, but there are also parts that made me want to be sick they were so amateurish. The first few chapters feel forced, like I was trying to fill space or something. There are long elaborate paragraphs, very poorly written, about hallways and turning on and off lightswitches. It's gross. There are also, however, delightful bits about the scenery and atmosphere, and  some  good bits about the characters, although they don't really flourish until later on. My theatre arts group (made of my the aforementioned beatnik compatriot and two others) is writing a musical version of a fable, the one about the goose that layed the golden eggs. It's quite wonderful actually. In addition to this, I'm writing an MLA essay on Jack Kerouac's invention of ""Spontaneous prose"" and the style's influence on the beat generation, which is quite a lot of fun. There is a lot of writing going on right now, and I'm soaking it all in.  Beautiful weather is beginning to surface, and I love it. Warm days and warm wind reaffirm my belief that when recognized for what it really is (beautiful emptiness) the world is perfect. My meditation schedule has become quite rigorous, compared to the past. I meditate for 30-45 minutes every night, and keep a journal of how well my concentration and mindfulness was, and what hindered it. So far I've been having a lot of headaches, and a little bit of backpain, and way too much laziness and inability to concentrate, but I think already I am beginning to see an improvement. Certainly the mind is more receptive and controlled, and conducive to positive mind states after meditation. I am firmly convinced that a good meditative practice is the healthiest thing for anyone, because it inevitably leads to Dharma, which leads to realization. What I want though, is a teacher. I've talked with a lot of Buddhists (even monks) online, and there is a consensus in everything I've read and heard that someone who is serious about following Dharma should not practice without a teacher for very long, because everyone needs help. Sure, the Buddha didn't have a teacher, but he was also a Bodhissatva with many lifetimes of perfection on his side. There are no teachers here in Moncton (I think, no theravada anyway) but when I go away to University I hope to find one). I am beginning to realize that while I am talking about Buddhism no one understands it, so maybe my next post will be a superbrief explanation of Buddhist beliefs and the terminology I use all the time (Buddha, Bodhissatva, Dharma, Dhyana, Tathagata, metta, Sattipattana, Karuna, Arhant, that kind of thing).   Much metta(lovingkindness) to everyone, especially those who have leapt to the other side of the blogging river to read my site here, even after I have unwillingly departed from xanga. :D"
EOAEN1BQVN,---,---,"FOOD POISONING REALLY BITES   You know, I know better than to eat salad that a) I didn't prepare myself or b) isn't kept cold at all times.  Bad Shae.  Bad.    MORE TALES FROM THE RECEPTIONIST   Friday... ah yes, Friday... well, since it was Friday, I don't know why I was surprised when they showed up at my desk.  The especially  odd  and  dangerous  walk-ins always find their way to my desk on Fridays.   I'll call my most recent walk-ins Fred and George.    Fred, a recent prison parolee (he showed me his card), comes in and leans on my desk.  George has already made himself comfy on the couch and uses the phone while Fred tries to tell me his ""story.""  I don't say that to be cold or uncaring, I just wish people didn't think that they need an elaborate story to get help.  In fact, the more elaborate the story, the less credibility they sometimes have.  If help is really needed, first, ask for help and keep the explanation very short...like, ""I need help with rent,"" and leave it at that.  I'm less apt to believe a person who feels it necessary to stand there and tell me some story that is totally improbable and gets more unbelieveable as the layers of the story are added.    For example (taken from real conversations I've had), after the second or third time they've been on disability while their husband's been laid off after after 10 strokes, 5 various organ transplants (in the same person, including the appendix)  and/or numerous prescriptions needed for their  fibleroid catatonial leuchosis  (a combination of all the false diseases some of these people have told me they're besieged with), well, let's just say where I work you do not get extra points or money for ""creativity.""    Granted, there are many people who come in who genuinely need help.  They tell me that they need help, I point them in the direction of our benevolence office which is well equipped to help, and they get help without needing their 5 various organ transplants story.  Those people can come see me any time.  Back to Fred.  Fred is telling me his story (which was nowhere close to making sense) and the phone was ringing off the hook, so I stopped him and asked him, ""what do you  need ?""  He wanted money, of course. To protect me and the other people in the building, we are not allowed to give out money and we have a place offsite for benevolence (it's with the food pantry and clothes closet). I explained to Fred this fact several times, but he didn't seem to get it.  The more I said, ""no one in this building is going to give you money,"" the more he disconnected from what I was saying.    I consider myself very intuitive.  At this point, I should have called security, but I was distracted -- so distracted that 3 callers in a row received wrong service time information, etc.  Why was I distracted?  The more disconnected Fred became, the more he stuck his finger up his nose and wiped his findings on the counter of my desk.  (Jene' says that the display of bodily fluids in public is a sign of a deranged person).  I explained to Fred again that NO ONE in the building was going to give them money, but I could send them down to the cafeteria to get a sandwich.  George hopped up off the couch and agreed.  They left and I immediately pulled out a clorox swipe and went to work on the counter, totally forgetting to call security at that point.  Jene' said my intuition was screaming at me at this point and I didn't listen.  She was right.  Boogeys distracted me from my intuition.  UGH  Well, Fred & George never made it down to the cafeteria. Eventually Officer W had to escort him and his friend out of the building because they were panhandling in the church. W said that they asked every single person they came in contact with for money.  Officer W sent them out to the bus stop, and he kept an eye on them, because  he  was listening to his intuition.   He saw George expose himself to 2 women at the bus stop (using the trash can as a latrine -- more bodily fluids in public).     Officer W sprang into action.  He called for backup and they chased down the bus Fred & George got on and W was so excited -- ""It was like cops!!"" he told me.  He got to make the arrest.  I know all this because he came back to let me know those two would not be coming back... and after one of the angels from housekeeping disinfected my desk, I felt even better.  It was a bizzare day.   Even more bizarre to realize I could be distracted from my screaming intuition over some boogeys..."

The guy cards all four of us.  This is when I decided not to use Mike's credit card especially after the clerk made a comment about my name.  I thought i would be stupid for a guy with an unusual name like Ezekiel to then try and use a credit card that had the name Mike on it.  So I just paid cash and figued mike would pay me back.  We go and put the beer in my room because Mike's at the party.  We then go to the party and I loan Mike another 5.00 at the party so he can tip the bartender.  The night continues like usual and no ends up drinking the beer because as I thought we were all too drunk to party afterwards. Fast forward to wednesday night.  I bring up the money Mike owes me and he says he doesn't owe me that much because he said he only asked me to buy him a twelve pack(he said case).  He also said he doesn't have to pay for it because he hasn't drank it yet.  All the beers were in the fridge except for the one he broke and one paul drank.  I continue to get so pissed that eventually I throw a beer all over Mike and leave.  That night I proceded to drink all the beers in the fridge down to his 11 (12 minus the one he broke).  He better pay me my money and he better nefver ask me to loan him anything ever again.  It's bullshit, and it's not like he doesn't have cash.  He just leased a brand new '05 escape and got a $8,000 check for his car.  Can't spare the 30 bucks he said he'd pay me..  bullshit.."
T4FEE3RXVB,---,---,"Just as I suspected, he apologized.  Via email.  Title of heresaid email ""hey yo.""  Gee, that email was just begging to be opened and read.  Granted I should have immediately hit the delete key, but my curiosity got the better of me and I read it.  Now, I have to say that I was right.  I knew that he would apologize this time.  I knew that he realized that he had gone too far.  He felt badly about it, or as badly as Nigel could ever feel about anything considering that his self-righteousness is practically suffocating.  The email states that he apologizes for upsetting me and that although he knows that we argued, he doesn't remember what was said.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?!??!  Am I supposed to buy into that garbage?!?!  THEN....THEN he has the gaul to ask if we want to go to the movies later this week.  This is some sort of joke, right?!?  I mean the kid really can't be this dense can he?!?    So I call Keegan, tell her what happened...ask her if I should just let bygones be bygones.  She advises me to ""enlighten"" him as to what was said so that he learns that he can't go that far.  However, note to self, she is in fight mode due to recent events.  Drama was the name of the game yesterday.  However I am in no mood or no condition for that matter to start a war of words with Nigel.  It wouldn't be pretty.  (no pun intended)  Although I don't feel that I can ignore it either because my silence in a sense is condoning his actions.  I can't let him win.  Not this time.    I think I should create a powerpoint bulleted presentation on the highlights of our argument.  Ideas?  Thoughts??    Haven't written back yet...I think I'll make him sweat it out a bit longer.  Not that he will sweat it out.  Once again the arrogance factor kicks in and he can safetly rest in his office knowing that at the end of the day his intellect is far superior to my own and that his life will be far superior...or so his delusional mind thinks...  Oh Nigel, sometimes I think you'll never learn."

I'm not going to try to recount what has happened in the last two months but I will start from where I am now.  I'm going to try to go back to updating this every few days like I used to. So here it goes...  This week a lot of big things happened to me.  First of all I bought a car, a '99 4 door blazer.  This is a big deal because I have never owned any car newer than 10 years old.  It's a good truck and I love it.  The only thing is that now I have a car payment but I guess I have to get responsible at some time.  Also this weekend I went up to Omaha with Toms, Paul and Ryan Miller.  It got a little crazy but all I'm going to say about it was that it ended up with an ambulance, fire truck and 2 police officers showing up and me spending 5 hours in the emergency room.  So my advice to all of you is to not piss off Claudia unless you have a lot of time on your hands.  No hard feelings though..

She called again today. yey!  ^_^ I think I know which book I am going to read next (or at least the subject of such book).  Later I may put up the dream I had last night... nah better not.

FZDH7YE6FD,---,---,"Ryan Zempel on today's Townhall  urlLink C-Log :   Last night I happened to watch the rather bizarre movie  The Shipping News  and was shocked to discover Hollywood addressing one of the true causes of homosexuality.  In a major subplot of the movie, we discover that a character named Agnis (played by Judi Dench) was raped by her brother when she was 12 years old and is now a lesbian rather hostile towards men. I applaud whoever it was in Hollywood who dared to make the politically incorrect implication that her (admittedly affirmed) homosexuality was the result of the sexual abuse.  If only people would pay attention.  When will liberals quit clinging to the ""it's genetic"" claim and acknowledge the fact that much of homosexuality (especially lesbianism) is the result of sexual abuse? And when will conservatives ingest this fact and begin responding to homosexuals with compassion rather than condemnation?

YZRASUWF73,---,---,"Lately, I've been consumed by notions of regret. Little moments that slipped away. Merely incidents, yet at times I'm consumed by them. Thousand of inconsequential moments that weave together to form the fabric of regret. I've always believed that once I got to a certain point in my life that regret would be null and void because every instance in my life would have led to where I was currently. If I was happy that all regret would be incidental because it was required to achieve said happiness.  But what if I am wrong. I recently saw a movie (a cute romantic comedy) that put my point of view in question. What if mistakes can't be undone? Maybe regret should be harped upon because it has led to your undoing. But if that is true then what is the point of regret? If something can't be undone than is regret simply a tool welded for growth. How can we move on and grow if regret glues us to the past?  My current issue of regret swirls around the little moments in life that I missed. Like never talking to that guy in college. Or never keeping in touch with that simple friendship. I feel as though my life consist of a series of regrets. Is this because I lack the confidence to stand behind my decisions? Is it because I hate myself for being cowardly? Or is it because I feel the future holds no light for me and I'm enveloped in a past that binds me to my future?  In the end I know I will regret all the regret that overwhelmed my life. I feel as though I have learned nothing from my regrets. I live a life of could have been rather than could be. The thing about regret is that we tend to romanticize it. We turn our past into what society has done to the fifties. It was a simpler time. Everything was black and white. Young teenagers went to the soda shop in their poodle skirts. People forget that the fifties was fraught with racism and sexism. Regret works the same way, the only difference is because it never really happened, there is no way of knowing what it might have been. We always romanticize regret in that we assume that things would have been better had we done the thing we regret not doing. It's kind of like how we assume that if aliens exist that they are going to be smarter than us earthlings.  So, I will be content with my notion that things that are supposed to happen will happen when they are supposed to. Maybe if one of those regrets wasn't a regret but an actuality, then my life might be ten times worse. Traces of the past will always haunt us and that is ok as long as they don't control us. It's justified to look back as long as you pay attention to the road in front of you. But I don't know, maybe I will regret saying that."

Of course, I have griped about this far too much to my friends and so I am as much a burden to them as myself, and so the solution for now is to shut up and get over it. More meditation, a harder try at writing, that sort of thing.

PB63O0FRHD,---,---,"Was reading  urlLink The Heresy  today and Leighton Tebay said some real things about Church conflict: It’s been 8 years since I finished my 3rd year at bible college.  I’ve watched many of my friends enter ministry and come out shattered and broken.  Most of my closest friends that went in to ministry aren’t in ministry any more.  They were so deeply wounded they changed their career.  In many cases they were treated unfairly with very little regard for their feelings.  Their critics were harsh and in some instances cowardly.    There is a big problem with the way we handle conflict in the church.  Some people feel they have the right to say whatever they want because it is the “truth”.  Some people feel they have the right to say whatever they want because they have been victimized.  What these people are not seeing is the profoundly negative impact their actions are having on the church in general.  Those who can’t see beyond their interpretation of the truth or their own hurt feelings have neutered the leadership of the church.  Some leaders are so deeply wounded that their faith in church and God is profoundly damaged.  They leave ministry in tens of thousands of dollars of debt with no other marketable skills.  For some they would rather make 8 dollars an hour than work in a church.  Many of the leaders that do survive learn how to play politics and keep people happy but are completely ineffective at actually leading or challenging the church.   Like most, I've experienced some awful church conflict in my time in Christendom.  I don't quite know what it is that makes us buck against pastors and leaders when we don't approve of a decision or opinion (or when they don't agree with my opinion).    I really like what Paul says in Ephesians 4:1-6 In light of all this, here's what I want you to do. While I'm locked up here, a prisoner for the Master, I want you to get out there and walk - better yet, run! - on the road God called you to travel. I don't want any of you sitting around on your hands. I don't want anyone strolling off, down some path that goes nowhere.  And mark that you do this with humility and discipline - not in fits and starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves out for each other in acts of love, alert at noticing differences and quick at mending fences.  You were all called to travel on the same road and in the same direction, so stay together, both outwardly and inwardly.  You have one Master, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who rules over all, works through all, and is present in all. Everything you are and think and do is permeated with Oneness."

MIEWQPUQYL,---,---,"mark: the 23-year-old living with my neighbor jolyn: my neighbor becky: my mom  so my mom was talking to jolyn a while ago about mark and she thought jolyn said something about mark having a learning disability or something but she couldn't remember what she called it. anyways, my mom was talking to mark a couple of days ago, and he was telling her how he met jolyn through his ex-girlfriend because they went to the same church. so then he starts telling her how it was hard for him to get girlfriends when he was younger because he was LDS. and how the parents would tell their daughters ""you stay away from that mark he's LDS he's bad news"" and shit but he said it's okay now because his girlfriend is LDS too. so my mom is thinking ""LDS must stand for learning disability something.... i don't know"" so when he's done, instead of asking him what LDS stands for, my mom goes ""do you have to take medication for that? i mean, the LDS and all?"" and mark just starts laughing and my mom is really confused and mark won't stop laughing. apparently LDS stands for latter day saints which means he's mormon and my mom is a dumbass."
M3TCNZCOEW,---,---,"I know that I've been on a bit of a hiatus....but I truly have been keeping myself insanely busy.  However I knew that my blogging was long overdue when I had friends emailing me that I had no clue that they even ever read the thing, telling me that I needed to post.  So here it is, my insignificant ramblings on a few things.  First off I would like to say that never before in my life have I been prouder of Lindsey G Keegan.  She has finally taken the first steps in her road to quit smoking.  I believe she is now 5 days smoke free.  I always told her that my one wish for her was that she some day quit smoking.  Anyone who knows her knows how she loves her cigarettes....I think she'll learn to love the extra years of living more.  Last night she told me that she's really excited about ""the glow"" returning to her face.  I guess, and I never knew this, that smoking dulls your skin.  Ya learn something new everyday!  Keep up the good work sunshine, I'm pulling for you!  Next:  Happy Birthday Arianne!!  Even though I know she reads my blog and is yet another person requesting that I update it, I felt that I had to write a bit about her for all of those who have not had the privilege of knowing her.    Arianne is one of my oldest and dearest friends.  Our lives crossed paths at the tender age of 6 and we've been best friends ever since.  Last night I sent her a quick note telling her how much I admired and adored her.  You see, she's always and probably always will be my biggest fan.  She sees the greatness in everyone and has always realized my potential for greatness.  There's something to be said for that kind of devotion.  And for that alone I love her.  As I told her, I'm grateful for everything she's ever done for me, the person she's become, and for the person she will someday be.  I have been blessed with one of life's greatest gifts: a true friend.    Recently I've been terribly homesick because I'm going on my longest time ever of not seeing my family, but when things get especially unbearable I just think of all of our countless memories and suddenly whatever it was that was bothering me isn't so terrible.  It's probably been at least 10 years since we've lived within the mile that we once did, but it in no way has put a damper on our relationship.  In fact I think it has only strengthened our resolve to maintain our friendship.  I don't dwell on the fact that I see her twice a year (if that)....I just focus on the few short moments that we are able to steal here and there and be forever grateful for them.  If truth be told, I don't know when I'm going to see her again.  I just know that it can't come soon enough and our time together would never be long enough.  But on April 8th 2004 I wish you the happiest of birthdays and a life of love, prosperity, and happiness.  Remember I'm with you in spirit always."

CRLRZN61ST,---,---,"America vs. Australia (basically, Iowa vs. Victoria) When I first got to Australia, and went to school there, I thought it was incredibaly easy, compared to my school back in Iowa. The subject material was a lot easier, as was the grading scales. The teachers, with the exception of Mr. Thompson and Ms. Plymin, were not even close the quality of Iowan teachers. In Iowa, you can choose different levels for each class. For example, you can take Basic English, English, and English Honors. Your previous teachers tell you which one would be best for you, but you don't have to follow their guidelines. The one thing I like was how in English and Literature we wrote creative pieces, which I hadn't done since the sixth grade. Although the school seemed much easier, the way to get into university seemed ridiculously hard. To have almost your entire entrance based on one test at the end of the year is absurd. Infinitely many things can happen to someone on that one day. A relative could die, their parents could get a divorce, or they just be really sick. Then they do poorly on the exam, and they basically fail life. In America, the universities look at your extracurricular activities, your grades throughout high school, your standartized test results, and many other things such as race and economic backgrounds to determine your entrance to university. Even if you do not do well throughout high school and drop out, you can take an equivalency test, which if you pass, basically means you are the same as a high school graduate. You can then go to a community college, which are somewhere between trade schools and universities in the Australian system, for two years, transfer to a university, graduate, then go to medical school and become a doctor. This would be impossible under the Australian system."

No one called the cops, so I guess we didn't get too loud. Not much to add; I received some pretty kewl loot, including an assortment of dried peppers, 2 bottles of Merlot, a bunch of Guinness, and some books. And a really nifty photo album one of our skydivers put together for me. Man I wish I could post photos.   Saturday  I managed to get my 1000th jump. Yay! I finally made it. I got pied for my efforts. It is a skydiving tradition to get a face full of whip cream - nay, my body was coated in sweet sticky goo. Bleah. Drank too much again; I'm going to have to cut back soon.    I did  nothing on Sunday and I loved it! I did drag out  Civilization III  and whupped up on India, France, and Greece for a while. I'd rather not whup up on the Romans, Germans, or Japanese. They're mean! Although a pissed-off Mahatma Ghandi is a sight to behold.    Monday I  did my 1001th jump. Jon, Steve, Harold and I did a demonstration jump into the Huntsville International Airport. One of the runways had been extended in a project to allow really super heavy planes to land and the jump was part of the opening ceremony. The runway is now over 13,000 feet long. You know, that's as long as our altitude for skydives. Damn that's a lot of tarmac!  Jon is always harping on his demo jumpers to look and act professional. So what happens? He is standing next to Steve during a photo op moment (a cutting of a banner) and he responds to something Steve says by saying ""Steve, you are *so* gay!"" And guess who is standing behind him biting her tongue? The mayor of Huntsville!  We finally finished season 1 of  24 ! I had no idea bleep was the mole! And oh my god poor bleep! I am glad bleep is dumping bleep, though. What a power-hungry bleep! I'm looking forward to season 2.

C0I8SLYL8L,---,---,"Alright, so what was the whole plane ride post all about yesterday?  My sister-in-law is sending our niece down here on vacation for 2 weeks. She is ten (or is it eleven?) and due to regulations she cannot travel alone, nor would we want her too… it’s dangerous out there with so many twisted people around… So anyway, we had been planning this for a couple of months and my husband gets to go to New York to come back with Bashma (pronounced Baah-sma) on Sunday.  In the process he also sees his parents who are visiting the country and staying at his sister’s apartment.  After the 2 weeks are done, my sister-in-law flies down here and then goes back with my niece.  Nice arrangement.  I hope Bashma doesn’t get bored while down here. We have the beach at 30 minutes travel and also plenty of public pools and 2 water parks.  Then there are the parks, Peter-Piper’s, Chuck-E-Cheeses, and the city’s recreation area. We don’t have much in the area of ‘cool’ museums, except for the historical places (well… historical for the area). Oh yes! We have the Zoo!  You know, that cool place where all the animals are always asleep inside their cages?  ~_~  Now, I don’t know how many places I will be able to take her.  My husband will be working all day so we’ll probably do the whole-day-long activities (water park, beach, zoo, etc) on the weekends and I’ll take her around the smaller places on the weekdays.  I’ve been getting tons of kiddie anime (the one with nothing censorable or questionable) to keep her busy in the mornings or before bedtime.  These 2 weeks should be good for me as some sort of training. Ehhhh.  We’ll see what happens.  Well, for now, I think I should give a call to my in-laws. I still haven’t… I really should… really,   really   should…   I have an excuse on why I did not call yesterday when my husband arrived. ^_^ I did not wish to bother them because I knew they would have so many things to talk to him!  Yeash, that’s it.    Truth is… I was upset.  They called yesterday, probably looking for hubby to find out how the trip was going.  I answered the phone (remember that I gave him mine because he forgot his at home) and they hung up on me.  I said, maybe, since they were calling his cel phone and a girl answered (yes there is the probability they still do not recognize my voice) they thought that it was a wrong number.  So I said, they’ll call again… but they didn’t.  I had given my number to his sister (when she called his cel phone) so that she could be informed of his whereabouts and she surely gave it to her parents.  So, if they dialed his number and then hung up thinking it was a wrong number, why did they not dial it again?  Easy. Because they already knew that my husband was using my phone, so they probably dialed that number then.     They could have at least said ‘hi.’"

C4XB9QYP13,---,---,"Ok, I am going to straighten some things out. Meditation might not be what you think. There are two kinds in Buddhism (excluding some of the questionable nu-agey ""spirit guide"" kind of things out there) and they focus on two things: concentration and mindfulness. Concentration meditation involves focusing on one thing, usually the breath, and it allows you greater peace and clarity of mind. The second is mindfulness meditation, called vipassana, and by focusing on the truth and reality of your own mind and what is around you, vipassana gives you wisdom. Wisdom is what leads you to end your suffering. The Satipatthana (four foundations of mindfulness) Sutra, tells us that mindfulness is the only way to end suffering, and the Buddha makes the promise that in Seven years, Seven months, or Seven days of complete mindfulness, a meditator can gain either total awakening or else non-return (the stage before awakening).   Ok. So I doubt you care. But I've been doing both kinds of meditation for about half an hour a day for six months (half an hour is embarassingly little actually) and what have I noticed? Life is SO much more beautiful when you see it clearly. Walking around in a daze is overrated. For instance, every morning I look out my windows and see the forest which is always bright green and still. When I mentally wake myself up, clear away the anger and the headaches and the hunger and just  see  everything is perfect, it's me that's the problem. So far I have had two real spiritual experiences through meditation, although they are wholly unremarkable and ordinary, they are very important. The first has been that my mind is scattered! Terribly scattered, it floats away whenever I stop watching it and It can't even focus for more than two or three minutes at a time (and in the beginning this was twenty or thirty seconds), but I realized when I was focused everything became still and it was a very pleasurable feeling. The second realization has been impermanence. Thoughts arise and go away. Music starts and finished. My mind focuses and becomes unfocused. Trees grow and die. Houses are built and fall down. Through meditation I saw this (although it doesn't really take meditation at all to see it, it's obvious). Anything that is created will change. Change is universal and inescapable ( except for the unborn and uncreated Nibbana, but that's another issue).  Meditation is a wonderful experience, and I advise everyone to try it, regardless of whether you are Buddhist or not. Meditation is healthy, and gives a clarity of mind that you can't find anywhere else. It's better than being drunk, and it lasts longer than sex (lol). Meditation is a refuge, no matter where you and what you're doing you can meditate and be happy, and if you approach it the right will it will lead to true happiness all the time."

BFW4LNRLTK,---,---,"There once were six men, not one was a gay, They all were close friends, but not in a gay way.  Some liked cooking and sleeping, others wrestling and beer, They often showered together, but not one was a queer.  But what united them most, brought them closer than that, Was putting up with the smell, of each other's crap.  One man's doodoo smelt awful, not of roses or vanilla, He wasn't really blamed, cos he did have salmonella.  Another would be grumpy, if by ten he hadn't poo'd, Which goes some way in explaining his perpetual bad mood.  The third would ponder the merits, while sitting on the pot, Of terrine de poule Bresse with sea urchin compte.  Number four had to be quick, or he'd be an unhappy camper, He'd mutter a little something, do a jerky jobby and then scamper.  The fifth had odourless defecations, in making a smell he was remiss, But he took particular pleasure, whenever he experienced Poseidon's kiss.  The final man suffered, if a lady's visit was anticipated, If she stayed more than a day, he'd be awfully constipated.  The men's house was permeated, by the combined faecal essences, And in this redolent bouquet, all were comforted by the six presences.  But now the same fragrances do not mingle or coalesce, For two have departed, taking their feculent incense.

Maybe I'm being cynical. Not that Stephen is doing this.  I avoided any coverage of the DNC just like I'll studiously avoid the Republican convention. I was unable to avoid one picture of demonstrators burning an effigy with two faces:  Kerry on one side, and Bush on the other.

Lewis plays an American photographer who falls in love with a Greek mail-order bride who is sailing to America on the same ship as he. A more detailed description of the plot makes it seem like a four-hanky romance, but part of me was humming 'the Love Boat' while I was reading it. But still, if he doesn't smack her around or rape her, it will be a step up role-wise.  I know a man who is having an affair with a married woman (whom I also know). Without going into details, I am horribly fascinated by their relationship. I won't judge them; if they want to be together that's their business. But am I surreptitiously watching a romance, or a train wreck? I hope the former but I suspect the latter. I know a woman who is having an affair with a married man (whom I don't know). Her life is a train wreck; but she was pretty well psychotic beforehand. Cupid is an incorrect image; Love is a fearsome rabid beast that likes to bite people on the ass."

That's really disappointing to know. Just a mark less on my Mid-Year paper, and I'll be in for English remedial. Which simply amounts to the fact that I'm of the weaker students in the school when it comes to English. This is of a great importance or might be better described as irritation and disturbance. English is an important subject. Not just here in Victoria School, nor Singapore, but all over the world. It means as much as you can't do anything if you're not proficient at it. Furthermore, I'm a humanities student. Where am I ever going to land up without a good command of the English Language? Just when I was thinking of reading more Chinese books, the results and initial news of me entering the English remedial completely changed my mind. I'd be in the remedial alright, if I hadn't just when to see the principal and ask why I'm in it in the first place, since I passed the mark? I'm out of the remedial. Nonetheless, it is still humiliating and very disappointing to be that close. The reality pounces on me. 'You're bad at English!'  Therefore, it's going to be all out for English now. I'm going to get that A1 by all means. And prove to my dear principal that I didn't need his remedial. Why did he have shout at us anyway? We're free from his rememdial according to his requirements. 'You better make sure you do well in English!', he said. And worst of all, he wrote at the back of my report card, 'Given reprieve from English class.' He had to use the word 'reprieve'.  Oh Lord, curb my anger."

R71CKIOOT7,---,---,"Am I satisfied? I should...  Why am I asking myself this question? Recently, I had just gotten back many of my papers. Some people would have said that I had done well, but I just seem to want more. Many of my friends did really alot worst then me. Maybe I should really learn to be grateful. After all, there's so much God has done for me already, God's goodness is so great, that I should be wondering how I should ever be able to things in return. Although, I'll never be able to, but guess I should really give my life to Him. Ok, didn't post here last night, cause I was just totally tired after coming back from Kent Ridge Guild House. Was watching American Idol. It was very long, cause they each sang two songs. And I think it was a really good performance by all of them last night. I think Clay will win. He has many supporters and I don't really remember him in the bottom three ( I just didn't watch from the start maybe ). Either way, he really has a good voice, just that sometimes he has weird facial expressions. Then yesterday, we had Chemistry practical. It was a blunder by me yesterday. I was testing for the presence of sulphur dioxide I think. Then we were suppose to heat it until the Potassium(VI) Dichromate turns from orange to green. But I moved it out of the fire, and the chemical got sucked back into the other test tube. Contaminating everything. So I had to redo everything. Then the second time I did it, I added so much of Potassium(VI) Dichromate that it took so long to change colour. Then Mr Wong told me hang on there. Then heat and heat, finally turn green! But soon after that, one of my test tubes broke due to overheating. Argh...then the precipitate formed outside the test tube. Then the chemical suddenly shot out into the front bench...just nice missed everyone...hehe. But quite fun la. What a day. Today, it was really ok. Nothing much, except that my styrofoam plate broke when I carried my food back to the table...argh...then my mash potato and fries all fell out. Then, hungry la. So quickly when to get a plate of Mee Goreng just before the bell rang. Then was just so tired today la. During band practice I also felt like sleeping. Just remembered Mr Tan praised me again for my chinese composition. hehe. He said that one part of my essay about an adaptation of a story about patience was very touching and meaningful. I thought so too. I really like it. I'll post here. It's found in ""I kissed dating goodbye"" by Joshua Harris. Apparently, he adapted from another book himself. But guess I'll post it here tomorrow. They say I'm Storm. hmm...I'm strong and protective of those I love? Well, I really want to protect my loved once, but I often feel inadequate in doing that. And I don't think I'm strong. But maybe that's when the last part comes in. I do have alot of fears and concerns. As ZQ always tell me that I don't dare to try things. And sometimes, I just can't convince myself that I mean anything or can do anything for my loved ones at all. hmm...maybe I really have to work on that. Not bad, quite accurately. hehe...but no one's perfect la...just like everyone in X-men. Each of them has their own weakness. But I guess that's when God comes in. Hope I'll always remember that it is most important that my life is for God, but not how satisfied I am with myself."
BQARON61LW,---,---,"Safety, Again    Well, I was in Silver Spring, MD during the recent sniper episode and arrived home alive.  So did my husband.  So did all of our friends.

Capclave was probably slightly less well-attended than it might have been, but most of the people I wanted to see braved the news reports and went to Silver Spring anyway.   I don't want to be too blase about danger, but the overreaction to living is getting tiresome.  Some of my friends have become very fatalistic (""If there's a bullet out there with your name on it, that's it"").  I'm not.  Increasingly, I feel like I'm living with the religion of statistics.

This was the fifth time since 1978 that I'd been to a protest on the Mall in Washington, and it was substantially larger than any previous protest I'd been to.  We probably had somewhere near 800,000 people there, meaning it was the biggest national rally ever in DC (yup, even bigger than ""The Million Man March"").     April 26 March:  Posters Including - If You Aren't Outraged, You Aren't Paying Attention  I have been paying attention.  And while I was one of the liberals who counseled ""patience"" at the beginning of the Bush administration, I am more outraged about the tactics of the administration every day.  Just today, representatives from NASA were forebidden from making any comment to the media on an upcoming science fiction movie ( The Day After Tomorrow ) on global warning.  Is there anything they aren't going to gag?  At the March, I was working with Jeanne Clark, who was the lead PR person for the March and one of its organizers.  I ran errands and moved people around, and was also put in charge of getting the lead banners assembled:     April 26 March:  Laurie Mann, Bannerer  The mall was unbelievably crowded, particularly before and after the March:     April 26 March:  Post March Rally  At the end of the March, I met up with Rachel, my brother's fiancee, and her friends:     April 26 March:  Rachel Pentlarge's Crowd - Rachel's in the middle, her sister Mara is on her far left."
JUYFTYVGXO,---,---,"Take a look at the falsities being peddled to prospective students at this website.  'Princes Hill is the centre of a vibrant community of parents, students and teachers. All play an active part in the daily life, decisions and programs of the school. It is a community united by a shared belief in the importance of the following values: Community: belonging together and caring for each other Diversity: respecting and valuing individual and cultural difference Social Responsibility: a passionate commitment to ethical and socially just action Creativity: nurturing a spirit of innovative inquiry and expression Achievement: striving to set and reach challenging personal goals Self-reliance: the self-discipline and resilience required to achieve these goals  You will find that these beliefs permeate and inform everything that the school does.' Oh yes you can clearly find these beliefs informing the school's policy against free speech. 'Nurturing a spirit of innovative inquiry and expression' of course by limiting students ability to express themselves. Brilliant!  In a subsection titled Freedom of expression we get these 'facts' presented to us.  'The college encourages the expression of a range of opinions unless they are perceived to be racist, defamatory or sexist, to threaten the harmony of the college or otherwise contravene equal opportunity legislation.'  This is fucking bullshit. How dare they try and sell new students on our beliefs of social responsibility? How dare they say they encourage inquiry and expression when this is clearly not the case in practice?"

724NXAUCFM,---,---,"It is a shame I am not a teacher, for there are so many lessons people need to learn.  I sometimes wonder if most people comprehend the gravity of the word 'genocide'.  As I recall nobody leaped to Rwanda to stop all the killing.  In fact well over 500'000 were killed before anyone batted an eye lash.  I mean the people who were being killed no doubt batted their eyelashes right before they were hacked to death with a machete.  Where was the outrage???  It is 10 years later, and we honor the memory.  Which is good.  We should never forget.  But I have had people tell me they didn't realise how big a deal it was.  Granted at the time I don't think I did either.  I did learn much sooner than now, however.  Does nobody comprehend that over one million people were senselessly butchered???  Now we have the most powerful nation in the world hunting down those for killing 2000 people.  It's a shame not all people are allowed that kind of justice.  Actually, forget shame.  It's not fair.  Of course life is not fair.  That may even be the meaning of life, at least for some.  Bah!  I lost my train of thought.  Which happens all too often and explains why I can talk big but can't back it up.  Thoughts are one thing, and actions are another.  Although it is true that words can be powerful.

JDXTTJ3H23,---,---,"I've been reflecting quite a bit lately, about the format of a weblog.  It occured to me, probably for the first time ever, that no one who reads this is Buddhist, or understands what I'm talking about, especially since I use all kinds of lingo in Pali, the language of the Himalayas. But it runs deeper than that. I started this blog at xanga, under somethingzen, in the interest of writing a blog about the teenage Buddhist experience, but I am no longer so sure that public exposure is good for my day-to-day Dharma practice. It is vain, I think, and at the very least pointless. I am at the point now where there must be more doing, and less saying. I am going to change the focus of the blog. I will still mention Buddhism, it is an inseperable part of my life, probably it will be mentioned in anecdotes of Satoris (momentary illuminations), but besides that it will be phased out. The blog will remain up as a journal about writing, and as an avenue for stories about friends, and thoughts about philosophy and the cosmos, and everyday nonsense a person has to deal with. Basically - it's becoming a little more normal. I hope you'll stick around. If anyone has any questions about anything, or wants to know something personal, just email me."

I'm completely serious when I say I want to be a UPS truck driver ('cause if you know me at all by now you know I'm just odd like that), but I don't want to do that and only that. I want to do something else, where I can help people in ways other than delivering cardboard packages (....gorgeous ones...may I add....*cough*...) to them.  I do want to go to Columbia. With the current academic position I'm in, what I want quite possibly won't be what I get. I am trying to change this. I think I'm going to start taking more english honors classes during the summer, and start engaging in more activites that might look good on my college application. Unfortunately, one of these activities isn't creeping through a parking lot with engine-hungry-sugar, exhaust-pipe-happy-potatoes, and a baseball bat, but with the right medical care, I think I'll manage.  One thing I definitely will keep up with is writing on a regular basis. I have no proof of this, but I feel like putting my brain on paper (or computer screens...whatever) helps me analyze myself more easily. Putting my thoughts into words comes natrually to me, and I guess I should be thankful for that, if self-analysis happens to be a good thing. But, dude, look back at my posts from the beginning of my blogdom and compare them to what I write now. I amaze myself with how much I've matured. Don't get me wrong here- I still am an immature, naive freshman, but at least I recognize it, and if not embrace it openly, I accept and tolerate it. Just think- six months ago I though I knew everything my brain would allow. Now, I look back on my ""old"" (by half a year) self and laugh. And hell, I'm not even fifteen yet.   (OK, I realize that at this point I'm sounding a bit egocenteric, but go with the flow.)   Will I ever reach a point where I stop learning and put my knowledge to use in life? In ways, I guess not. Life's not about reaching goals like that. It's about working as you go along, putting the knowledge you've gained so far to good use, and being open about learning more. You can never know enough, and if you think you have it's only because you don't know that you don't know the things you don't know yet because you don't know them yet. Get me? Didn't think so (and I don't blame you...try figuring it out when you're really bored one day because it's not worth wasting valuable time on. Like that riddle.....How can you use only a jug that holds exactly 3 gallons, a jug that holds exactly 5 gallons, and an unlimited water supply to get exactly 4 gallons in one jar? Keep in mind the only exact way of measuring is by filling the jars- they don't have gallon marks on them.)   Off topic, off topic, I don't give a fuck.  My overall point: Life's wierd. But isn't that the point to everything?"

So in closing, I bring you these words of wisdom from Steve Martin:   Be courteous, kind and forgiving,  Be gentle and peaceful each day,  Be warm and human and grateful,  And have a good thing to say.   Be thoughtful and trustful and childlike,  Be witty and happy and wise,  Be honest and love all your neighbours,  Be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant.   Be pompus, obese, and eat cactus,  Be dull, and boring, and omnipresent,  Criticize things you don't know about,  Be oblong and have your knees removed.   Be tasteless, rude, and offensive,  Live in a swamp and be three dimentional,  Put a live chicken in your underwear,  Get all excited and go to a yawning festival.   O.K. everybody!  Be courteous, kind and forgiving,  Be gentle and peaceful each day,  Be warm and human and grateful,  And have a good thing to say.   Be thoughtful and trustful and childlike,  (O.K. everybody on this!)  Be witty and happy and wise,  Be honest and love all your neighbours,  Be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant.  (Let 'em hear you outside!)   Be pompus, obese, and eat cactus,  (Everybody sing!)  Be dull, and boring, and omnipresent,  Criticize things you don't know about,  Be oblong and have your knees removed.   (Ladies only)  Be tasteless, rude, and offensive,  (Now the men)  Live in a swamp and be three dimentional,  (Everybody)  Put a live chicken in your underwear,  Go into a closet and suck eggs."

KULQNKCRXP,---,---,"Overreaction to the Super Bowl   Only a boob would show her boob on broadcast television.  And only a boob would rip the shirt in the first place.  I'm not that much of a prude - I adore  Sex in the City , and, of course, was watching that instead of the Super Bowl on Sunday night.   But the overreaction to Janice and Justin's stunt is ridiculous.  Obscene behavior on broadcast TV has been going on for a while.  Despite what Michael Powell says, it doesn't need an FCC investigation.  This is yet another example of the Bush-led government being completely clueless about priorities.     The FCC ought to send Janice, Justin and most of the rap singers a bill for public obscene behavior and let that be that.  I find the badly dresed ""singers"" scratching themselves in pubic to the sound of gun/drug-drenched lyrics to be much more offensive than a brief glimpse of Janice's breast."
NZ9C5GJ22X,---,---,"Greetings from Snowkone!   Yes, Boskone happened in Boston for the first time since 1987.  There were either one or two fire alarms, but the hotel didn't take them personally... ;->  The con went pretty well, and Sharon Sbarsky now holds the record of running the world's longest Boskone.  This morning, to the surprise of absolutely no one, flights out of Boston were cancelled due to the closure of airports due to the Presidents Day Blizzard.  At about 9am, it finally started to snow here.  Then, after more than 12 hours, we had more than a foot of snow in downtown Boston.  This has turned Boskone into Snowkone, since there are about 50 of us at the airport who couldn't leave Boston today.  We have a con suite (Sharon's room), a flyer (in progress), possible badges, a day-long program in the bar, et.c.  We might have some photos as Del Cotter, John Lorenz and Bill Jensen all had cameras."

O4DHJL39Z1,---,---,"Last night a group of us went out to this wonderful little restaurant in Silverlake called Cafe Stella to celebrate Bastille Day.  Keegan finally got to meed Tiffany.  All in all I'd say things went well.  It felt like a tiny piece of Paris in the middle of L.A.  Actually it was a bit refreshing to feel like I'd stepped out of the city for a moment.      After our three hour dinner and an ever so slight disagreement over the tip, Keegan and I went to Beverly Hills where we met Lauren and some girl.  (don't be fooled, Lauren's a boy)  We all met up at Backstage and it was a total bust!  However I did finally manage to talk to the owner who is Sting's manager....Yay!!  I'll keep going back to that place just for that mere fact.     So I still have yet to write back to Nigel.  I've calmed down a great deal about the whole thing, but I can't help but feel like I should address it in some way because it is going to be virtually impossible for me to avoid him for the rest of my life....however nice that thought may be.     If truth be told I don't really know how to go about addressing it.  I don't want to attack him, I don't want to point fingers, and I'm certainly not out to make him feel like shit.  I just don't want an argument.  I suppose my silence is making some sort of a statment to him, but like I've said previously....Nigel's immune to the feelings of others.  They just don't register on his radar.  Plus I'm not quite sure what I'm hoping to gain from all of this because he does  not  in any way, shape, or form ever make me feel better about myself or make my life better in any way.  Bottom line: he doesn't contribute in a positive respect.      On second thought, maybe it's best not to say anything."

ULFK0E04IU,---,---,"I am blogging here tonight on the request of andy, because we both know that nobody else would blog tonight and so i had to strain brain cells (surprise...i do have them) to think of a topic to blog about. I have chosen to blog about auto pilot.  Auto pilot is cool because it gives the impression that i'm doing something when mentally i'm not. Here's an example, for those who don't know i play the piano, and after a while my fingers know all the notes. This allows my mind to kinda wander away for the hours that i practise while letting anyone who walks by see that i'm playing properly. Another good example is swimming. During my weekly 4km swim, my mind drifts away while my arms and legs continue to stroke. Auto pilot is also good indication whether something is boring or not. I do not enjoy swimming or playing the piano because it's boring so i have autopilot. I have not yet come across any other activities that have autopilot yet but if any of you guys have an auto pilot for something tell me. I just want to see the wide range of activities that have them"

3XSUNI5BR5,---,---,"So.......  So yes apologies for not updating in a long time.  Aside from moving I have been putting it off because I honestly have nothing good to say, and by that I mean I'm likely to write something horribly depressing.  Today is my birthday by the way.  Thank you Dallas for my wonderful card.  I hate birthdays.  Not because of getting older, or anything like that.  Just because it's a day that doesn't warrant celebration.  Although sometimes I think that the fact that I managed to live another year does warrant some form of celebration.  Recently a friend of mine pointed out something about my behaviour.  He said ""Do you think that by trying to make people stay away from you, you are in fact doing the opposite and making them want to know you more.""  I'm paraphrasing, he was more articulate than I am being.  When I think about it, it's a valid point.  I guess I come accross as being mysterious to alot of people, and this is intentional in that I don't like giving alot of myself up to people.  And yet at the same time I am forthcoming with people, but usually only with things that I hope will drive them away from me.  There are few people on earth who know me well.  Indeed even my best friends would not be able to claim that they know me all that well.  Because I do not talk about many things with people.  Subjects that aren't talked about in detail:  1. My Depression 2. My hatred for myself 3. My lack of will to live 4. Severity of depression 5. Suicide 6. My hopes to die everyday  I've got more but you get the idea.  And no, typing those out for all to see provides no catharsis whatsoever.  It honestly makes no difference if people know or not, because everyone offers the same help and nobody really gets it.  Although I fault nobody for that because at least they try, and I can't explain my feelings sometime anyway.  I had a Psycholgist promise to cure my depression.  He doesn't return my calls.  Hahaha, I think I'm too far gone for him.  And as I get older I am actually getting worse.  Time was that I could hide it well enough, I never used to have problems getting up and going to work or whatever.  Now over the past year it's nearly cost me my job because I don't want to get up in the morning to face it.  I had gone to see another Psychologist once and he was absolutely shocked that I had a job, and left my house.  He was also shocked that I was even still alive.  And do you want to know why I am still alive??  Because I have a conscience.  I cannot hurt my family like that.  So I live for them, because it's the only reason I can think of.  I hate being alive.  I hate getting up in the morning.  I hate going to sleep at night.  I hate inhaling, I hate exhaling.  But most of all I hate myself for being this way.  There now you know that I'm nuts :)  So I suggest that you re-evaluate whether or not you truly wish to know me."
O57U24DBB1,---,---,"Every little girl dreams of growing up and having the most beautiful wedding that the mind of a five year old can dream up...I of course had to go and be the exception to this rule.  I never fantasized about that dream wedding day, but instead panicked over the thought of leaving my parents because no one would ever pamper me or take care of me the way they had for so many years.  In a sense a part of me still feels this way.    Over the past few months, perhaps over the last year I have come to the conclusion that I will most likely elope.  I don't care if I have carrot or white chocolate lemon mousse cake, if I have pink or black bridesmaid's dresses, if you wear an updo or your hair down...I just don't care.  Weddings in my mind are one big lump of drama because everyone has their vision, the way things 'should' look...I just don't care.  I don't want to go through the effort.  No offense to my friends, but I'm not here to throw you all a six figure party, a party that at the end of the day I won't even remember.  Lindsey always told me that I would marry quickly, that I would meet that person and I would just know in an instant.  I tend to agree.  So then why spend a year planning a wedding??  Now I know that many if not all of you reading this are thinking, she's crazy, Janielle's wedding was going to be the party of the century, the kind that graces the pages of In Style or Town and Country.  Nope, I'm not crazy...I just feel that so many people stray from the true meaning of marriage and what a wedding should represent.  Will you regret it, you ask?  No.  What if your husband wants a wedding surrounded by family and friends?  Great, we'll throw a party.  However something tells me that he too will share my ideas...Would you do it and not tell your family/friends?  Never.  I don't mean elopement in the traditional sense of the word.  Of course my family would be there as well as my closest friends.  I want to be able to look at everyone and know that we share a story together, that each and every one of you has contributed to my life in a positive way...in a way that no one else has.    Such is my wish for myself."
