3IXQTFO,female,26,"Well general election is come again, now it's time to choose a president. Off course we need a good leader that can bring this country into a glory again. But after all, it's so difficult to find it. We have passed 59 years of our independence. Manythings happen, rebellions, violances and terrorisms. The poor citizens become poorer and the rich become richer, so unfair. When the democracation is just a word, nothing implementation. The voices from the citizen is unlisten. When the cry is no tears, the words is unspeakable and the hurt is just keep inside.   Now the reformation is open, all start to be repair and rearrange. The general election become an implementation of democracation. But is it really a true democration? or same still....just the all bads is hide behind the name of democration?  Are we'll just keep silent see our country become more drowning and drowning everyday? Where is the spirit of the country's son? Really we miss our Indonesia, the green , friendly and the peace of Indonesia. When all will be materialize?   ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~"
3IXQTFO,female,26,"""Jika Kau menginginkan cinta dari seseorang,  tunjukkan cintamu. Cinta tidak membutuhkan keraguan, Tunjukkan saja !!""    *POHON*       Alasan mengapa orang2 memanggilku ""Pohon"" karena aku sangat baik dalam  menggambar pohon. Setelah itu, aku selalu menggunakan gambar pohon pada sisi  kanan sebagai trademark pada semua lukisanku. Aku telah berpacaran sebanyak 5 orang wanita ketika aku masih di SMA. Adasatu  wanita yang aku sangat aku cintai, tapi aku tidak punya keberanian untuk mengatakannya.  Dia tidak memiliki wajah yang cantik,tubuh yang sexy, dsb, dia sangat  peduli dengan orang lain dan religius tapi dia  hanya wanita biasa saja.              Aku menyukainya, sangat menyukainya, menyukai gayanya yang innocent dan apa  adanya, kemandiriannya, aku menyukai kepandaiannya dan kekuatannya. Alasan aku tidak mengajaknya kencan karena aku merasa dia yang sangat biasa  dan tidak serasi untukku. Aku juga takut, jika kami bersama semua perasaan  yang indah ini akan hilang. Aku juga takut kalau gosip2 yang ada akan menyakitinya. Aku merasa dia adalah ""sahabatku"" dan aku akan memilikinya tiada batasnya dan aku tidak harus memberikan semuanya hanya untuk dia. Alasan yang terakhir, membuat dia menemaniku dalam berbagai pergumulan selama 3 tahun ini.        Dia tau aku mengejar gadis2lain, dan aku telah membuatnya menangis selama 3 tahun.  Ketika aku mencium pacarku yan kedua, dan terlihat olehnya. Dia hanya tersenyum dengan berwajah merah dan berkata""lanjutkan saja"" dan setelah itu pergi meninggalkan kami. Esoknya, matanya bengkak.. danmerah ..             Aku sengaja tidak mau memikirkan apa yang menyebabkannya menangis, butaku tertawa dengannya seharian. Ketika semuanya telah pulang, dia sendirian di kelas untuk menangis. Dia tidak tau bahwa aku kembali dari latihan sepakbola untuk mengambil sesuatu di kelas, dan aku melihatnya menangis selama  sejam-an.  Pacarku yang ke-4 tidak menyukainya. Pernah sekali mereka berdua perang dingin, aku tau bukan sifatnya untuk memulai perang dingin.Tapi aku masih tetap bersama pacarku. Aku berteriak padanya dan matanya penuh dengan air mata sedih dan kaget. Aku tidak memikirkan perasaannya dan pergi meninggalkannya bersama pacarku. Esoknya masih tertawa dan bercanda denganku  seperti tidak ada yang terjadi sebelumnya. Aku tau bahwa dia sangat sedih dan kecewa tapi dia tidak tau bahwa sakit hatiku sama buruknya dengan dia,  aku juga sedih.         Ketika aku putus dengan pacarku yang ke 5, aku mengajaknya pergi.Setelah kencan satu hari itu, aku mengatakan bahwa ada sesuatu yang ingin kukatakan  padanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa kebetulan sekali bahwa dia juga ada sesuatu  yang ingin dia katakan pada ku. Aku cerita padanya tentang putusnya aku dengan pacarku dan dia berkata tentang dia sedang memulai suatu hubungan dengan seseorang. Aku tau pria itu. Dia sering mengejarnya selama  ini. Pria yang baik, penuh energi dan menarik.  Aku tak bisa memperlihatkan betapa sakit hatinya aku, tapi hanya bisa tersenyum dan mengucapkan selamat padanya. Ketika aku sampai di rumah,sakit  hatiku bertambah kuat dan aku tidak dapat menahannya. Seperti ada batu yang  sangat berat didadaku. Aku tak bisa bernapas dan ingin berteriak namun tidak bisa.Air mata mengalir dan aku jatuh menangis. Sudah sering aku melihatnya menangis untuk pria yang mengacuhkan kehadirannya. Ketika upacara kelulusan, aku membaca SMS di Handphoneku. SMS itu dikirim 10 hari yang lalu ketika aku sedih dan menangis.  SMS itu berbunyi,     ""Daun terbang karena Angin bertiup atau karena Pohon tidak  memintanya untuk tinggal ?"".    *DAUN*         Selama SMA, aku suka mengoleksi daun2, kenapa? Karena aku merasa bahwa daun  untuk meninggalkan pohon yang selama iniditinggali selama ini membutuhkan banyak kekuatan. Selama 3 thn di SMA, aku dekat dengan seorang pria, bukan sebagai pacar tapi  ""Sahabat"". Tapi ketika dia mempunyai pacar untuk yang pertama kalinya, Aku mempelajari sebuah perasaan yang belum pernah aku pelajari sebelumnya - CEMBURU.Perasaan di hati ini tidak bisa  digambarkan dengan menggunakan Lemon.Hal itu seperti 100 butir lemon busuk. Mereka hanya bersama selama 2bulan. Ketika mereka putus, aku menyembunyikan perasaan  yang luar biasa gembiranya. Tapi sebulan kemudian dia bersama seorang gadis  lagi.         Aku menyukainya dan aku tau bahwa dia juga  menyukaiku, but mengapa dia tidak  mau mengatakannya? Sejak dia mencintaiku, mengapa  dia tidak yang memulainya dulu untuk melangkah? Ketika dia punya pacar baru lagi, hatiku selalu sakit. Waktu berjalan dan berjalan, hatiku sakit.  Aku mulai mengira bahwa ini adalah cinta yang bertepuk sebelah tangan,tapi  mengapa dia memperlakukanku dengan sangat baik  diluar perlakuannya hanya untuk seorang teman?  Menyukai seseorang sangat menyusahkan hati, aku tau kesukaannya,kebiasaannya. Tapi perasaannya kepadaku tidak pernah bisa diketahui.Kau  tidak mengharapkan aku seorang wanita untuk mengatakannya bukan ?  Diluar itu, aku mau tetap disampingnya, memberiknya perhatian,menemaninya, dan mencintainya. Berharap, bahwa suatu hari,dia  akan datang dan  mencintaiku. Hal itu seperti menunggu telphonenya setiap malam,  mengharapkannya untuk mengirimku SMS. Aku tau  sesibuk apapun dia, dia pasti meluangkan waktunya untuk ku.Karena itu, aku  menunggunya. 3 tahun cukup berat untuk kulalui dan aku mau menyerah.        Kadang aku berpikir untuk tetap  menunggu. Luka dan Sakit hati, dan dilema yang menemaniku selama 3 tahun  ini.  Ketika diakhir tahun ke 3, seorang pria mengejarku  dia adalah adik kelasku, setiap hari dia mengejarku tanpa lelah. Dari penolakan2 yang telah ditunjukkan, aku merasa bahwa aku ingin memberikan dia ruang kecil di hatiku.  Dia seperti angin yang hangat dan lembut, mencoba  meniup daun untukterbang dari pohon. Akhirnya, aku sadar bahwa aku tidak  ingin memberikan Angin ini  ruang yang kecil di hatiku. Aku tau Angin ini akan membawa pergi Daun yang lusuh jauh dan ketempatyang lebih baik.        Akhirnya Aku meninggalkan Pohon, tapi  Pohon hanya tersenyum  dan  tidak memintaku untuk tinggal, aku sangat sedih memandangnya tersenyum ke  arahku.       ""Daun terbang karena Angin bertiup atau Pohon  tidak memintanya untuk tinggal""    *ANGIN*         Karena aku menyukai seorang gadis bernama Daun, karena dia sangat  bergantung  pada Pohon, jadi aku harus menjadi Angin yang  kuat.  Angin akan meniup Daun terbang jauh. Ketika aku  pertama kalinya,ketika 1 bulan setelah aku pindah sekolah. Aku melihat seorang memperhatikan kami  bermain sepakbola. Ketika itu, dia selalu duduk disana sendirian atau dengan teman2nya memerhatikan Pohon. Ketika Pohon  berbicara dengan gadis2, ada cemburu di matanya. Ketika Pohon melihat ke arah Daun, ada senyum di matanya. Memperhatikannya menjadi kebiasaanku,seperti daun yang suka melihat Pohon.        Satu hari, dia tdk tampak, aku merasakan kehilangan.  Seniorku juga tidak ada saat itu, Aku pergi ke kelas mereka, melihat seniorku sedang memperhatikan daun. Air mata mengalir di mata daun ketika  Pohon pergi, besoknya, aku melihat Daun di tempatnya yang biasa, memperhatikan Pohon. Aku melangkah dan tersenyum padanya. Menulis catatan dan memberikan kepadanya. Dia sangat kaget.  Dia melihat ke arahku, tersenyum dan menerima catatanku. Besoknya, dia datang, menghampiriku dan memberiku catatan.         Hati Daun sangat kuat dan Angin tidak bisa  meniupnya pergi, hal itu karena  Daun tidak mau meninggalkan Pohon. Aku melihat ke  arahnya dengan kata2 tersebut dan pelan dia mulai berkata padaku dan menerimakehadiranku dan telp ku.  Aku tau orang yang dia cintai bukan aku, tapi aku akan berusaha agar suatu  hari dia  menyukai aku.            Selama 4 bln, Aku tlah mengucapkan kata Cinta tidak kurang dari 20x kepadanya. Setiap kali dia mengalihkan pembicaraan .. tapi aku tidak menyerah, aku memutuskan untuk memiliki dia dan berharap dia akan setuju menjadi pacarku. Akubertanya,"" apa yang kau lakukan? Kenapa kau  tidak pernah membalas?"",dia berkata, ""aku mengengadahkan kepalaku"".       ""Ah?"" Aku tidak percaya apa yang aku dengar.  ""Aku menengadahkan kepalaku"" dia berteriak.    ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~"

3IXQTFO,female,26,"Yesterday i gave this web address to my bestfriend, he is from Pakistan, name Shakeel. After red it, he asked me why i m not write anything abt my love one heheheh :P. Acctually i have write a little in the profile. But my friend said that it's not enough. Well okay, so this time i will write something abt him....my lover, my fionce n my jan :P  His name is Bilal ...he work in congo now, in a medical office. He is a nice guy (off course nice, coz if not nice he will not become my lover :P hahaha).What i like from him is his honesty, he always tell me all abt what he do, what he feel and all. He never hide anything from me. Though sometime the truth is hurt, but he always said that better you know it from me, than from other. If he do any mistake, he will tell me and then ask for sorry, well sometime it annoying me (off course !!!) but most of all, i really respect him so much. Coz i know to be honest is the most brave act, especially about confess our mistake in front of others :P....(it's true naaa)  He has a strong character and sensitive ...but sooooo muchhhh emotional :P,...and if he angry..i will be speechless (better silent than get shout hheheheheh :P).But he never angry for long time, today he angry, tomorrow he will smile again. What he hate is when someone do same mistake or say something again and again (I often it, fiueehhhh he angry me so muchhhh).  Basically he is a moody person (sometime so cool n sometime so romantic), serious and want other think and do practical. If he has a dream, he will try hard to reach it. He hate someone who always hopeless.   He taught me much abt live and love. One thing that capture so deep inside my heart is abt love to Mother. He said that Mother is our jaan (jaan=heart,soul), so we should respect n make her happy always. and he also teach me always to express my feeling,never to hide it, if im angry i must said im angry, if hurt i must said i feel hurt. He always say me that ""there is someone in the world will be happy if you happy and will be cry if you cry, and that person is me, so if u wanna see me happy pls keep your smile and be happy always, coz i love ur smile and i love ur laughing voice"" heheheh cieeeeeeeeeeeeee :P:P (make me shy heheheh)   okay that some abt him ....acctually i still have lot to write but i don't want to write all...coz i know you will be boring to read it heheheh.    P.S :Shaki, i have fullfill my promise to you to write a special post for him, someday i will write abt you...just wait naaaaaaaaaaaa...!! Thanks for being a true bestfriend for bilal and me, we will never ever forget all what you do and give to us, your support and love. We always pray that you will get all your dreams and happy always.  "" When god gave you to us, He planned capture the image of you deep inside our heart.

I'm gonna call her again in 10 min, but I don't know. She may just run away. The thing is, she didn't even annoy her dad. She made him hashbrowns this morning and gave him a card. Her mom's pissed at her too. We were talking bout it and we have no idea why. I hope she goes home. She may just bike to my house or another friend's house or something.

Reason: When I discovered about the bycatch and stuff that comes as a result as fishing, I swore never to eat fish/seafood. I had to tonight. I felt terrible.

KHRNMUL,female,25,"if today had a theme, it would be 'naming names.'  because of a couple things i've been reading lately and a few movies i've seen recently, i've been thinking about what would happen if i was put in a position where i had to choose between being able to live a normal life and going to prison and/or being executed on a matter of principle - like refusing to finger someone as a spy or Communist or being unwilling, as Sir Thomas More was, to betray a deeply held moral precept.  how much hypocrisy would i be able to tolerate in order to save my own skin?  tonight i saw a documentary made by one of the granddaughters of the Rosenbergs.  they had apparently been given a choice by the FBI while they were on death row, name the names of these suspected Communists and we will commute your sentences to life imprisonment and your children will not be orphans.  and they died rather than implicate others.  which, viewed one way, could just have indicated how deeply held their loyalty was to the Communist Party.  but is it easier to believe that these people were so morally vacant that they preferred to serve an ideology than to be able to see their boys grow up or is it easier to believe that they were too honorable to endanger another group of innocents from the excesses of the Red Scare?  we know now that Julius Rosenberg probably was a spy for the Soviets and that he gave military secrets to the Russians, at least during World War II, though there is no evidence that they had any access to nuclear secrets and ample evidence of prosecutorial misconduct on the part of J. Edgar Hoover and Roy Cohn - and the government's star witness (Ethel's brother) recanted his testimony on 60 Minutes several years ago.  This is a really interesting moral dilemma to me.  personal values against the state.  Is there any more modern conflict?  when marlon brando named names to help the police break up the dockworkers syndicate in on the waterfront, elia kazan wants us to think this is a heroic act - and in a way, it is.  whenever you stand up against coercion, it's heroic, sure... and the syndicate was criminal.  kazan named names to HUAC.  simply participating in an organization is not criminal and he did not provide evidence of criminal activity, like that of hiss or the rosenbergs, and he did it with full knowledge that the reputations (at least) of the people whose names were named would be harmed.  that's certainly an awful thing to do.  was it heroic to stand up against the hollywood omerta and break silence to assist the government?  no way, not unless the Reds in hollywood were actually materially assisting the Communists in any of their crimes against the United States or humanity.  I mean, if Kazan had said ""dalton trumbo helped stalin kill millions"" and that was true and the hollywood omerta was keeping that secret, then he would be a truly brave man.  but that just wasn't the case.  i've been rambling in this entry, but i just wanted to write down some stuff that i think is interesting and i don't know what i think about it yet.  maybe i'll figure it out later, or with the help of anyone who decides to comment on this.  by the way, today was the anniversary of the murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.

KHRNMUL,female,25,"First Off , on the subject of magazines. When  urlLink Maxim  rolled around some five years ago, they were pretty cool.  After the 90s, they had a very refreshing attitude: Guys are guys--the straight ones generally like beer and sex and girls, and (here's the important part),  there is nothing wrong with that .  Very unsophisticated, but brutally honest and entertainingly written.    But that was then, and this is now.  I just tore 4 damn scratch-and-sniff ads out of this month's issue, which was additionally packed with ads and in-copy placements for hair product, clothes, and accessories.  Don't get me wrong--I don't care about ads or product placement, I just don't need to be told how ugly I (apparently) am each month.  It's no longer Cosmo's Evil Twin, it's now Cosmo's co-conspirator;  I expect a quiz next month on my feelings about my relationship with my cat.  The whole magazine has become a metrosexual shill and will  not  be getting renewed.   Next :  urlLink The Bourne Identity  is a great movie.  It has all those cool elements that I've wanted to see in a movie for a long time.  Black Ops guy takes on the entire CIA, we get to hear office leadership guys say things like, ""He's alive? That's impossible!"" and ""Activate them all...I want him in a body bag by sunset,"" Nice resolution, very satisfying.  Not particularly intellectually challenging, but very satisfying.    And Finally,  (speaking of The Bourne Identity) I was reminded of the excellent young German actress,  urlLink Franka Potente .  I saw her first in  urlLink Lola rennt , and then in  urlLink Anatomie , and now in the Bourne Identity.  There is, of course, a documented weakness on my part for cute (pixie-esque) women who can speak German.  But I think she's a good actress independent of my bias.

KHRNMUL,female,25,"You may be familiar with Newton's first law of nachos, which states that nachos are simply tostitos covered with tasty things.  Similarly, Einstein's theory of TexMex states that a taco is a tostito wrapped around tasty things.   Since then other researchers have built on Einstein's work to produce the fish taco, the pizza taco, and the sub-atomic lepton-based taco.  I, however, was among the first to theorize the possibility of a Tostito-Taco, wherein a tostito is wrapped around a tostito, creating an infinite loop of taco/tostito duality.    Following upon that revelation, I am moving forward today with presenting my most stunning and controversial theory to date: The Grand Unified Nacho-Taco theory.  It proves mathematically that a tostito which has been wrapped around itself not only has a single expansive ""side"" (much like a Klein Bottle), but also that that side can be partially coated in tasty things.  The resultant construct would be simultaneously a tostito, a nacho, and a taco.   Members of the Nobel Committee can reach me at my lab as usual.   ~db"

Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, with most of the nation's air traffic still grounded, a small jet landed at Tampa International Airport, picked up three young Saudi men and left.  The men, one of them thought to be a member of the Saudi royal family, were accompanied by a former FBI agent and a former Tampa police officer on the flight to Lexington, Ky.  The Saudis then took another flight out of the country. The two ex-officers returned to TIA a few hours later on the same plane.  For nearly three years, White House, aviation and law enforcement officials have insisted the flight never took place and have denied published reports and widespread Internet speculation about its purpose.

I reply: Alright, I’m blown away that my clock was the problem. I changed the time and suddenly it works. but why? Why does the clock need to be within 5 minutes of ""UW time""? And how do I check this time. Does the exact time really matter when something is posted to the web? Wouldn’t the servers simply know what time it is in Seattle, irrelevant to what time some other computer says it is? And what if I, as an alumni, move to Washington DC, and want to keep my UW account? Do I have to ""pretend"" I’m actually on the west coast just to sync Dreamweaver with the UW? Please, tell me why?  And they get back to me (this is all within 24 hours mind you)...  Saying the clock needs to be within 5 minutes of ""UW time"" is a bit of an oversimplification. Your clock needs to be within 5 minutes of the  correct time  for kerberos to work. The UW's clocks are synchronized to atomic clocks which provide a reference time, so if your computer's clock is similarly synchronized to an atomic clock, it will always be within 5 minutes of the UW's. (In fact, it should always be within a few microseconds.)  I don't know that any desktop version of Windows has a time synchronization utility built in. I found an article about a few different pieces of software that will keep your computer's clock accurate at  urlLink http://geodsoft.com/howto/timesync/wininstall.htm . You can search the web yourself; the search terms I used to find that page were ""windows ntp client"". If you use a network time client on your computer, you can rely on your computer's clock being accurate.  There's a lot more on how the Standard Time is calculated and kept in synch at  urlLink http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/ , if you're interested. It's not so much that the time matters on the web as that Kerberos requires accurate time on the part of both sides (the server and you) in order to work. It's pretty technical, and has to do with security. The short answer is that Kerberos just doesn't work if the clocks of the computers involved are out of synch by too much.  Kerberos takes time zones into account, I believe. As long as your computer's clock is set to the correct time where you are  and  your computer's time zone is set to the time zone where you are, then everything should continue to work.  Alright, so my question wasn’t really answered. I wanted to know why someone, at some point in time, chose to say that the computers clock had to be within 5 minutes of the atomically “correct” time. I thought it might have something to do with security, and that answer was alluded to, but not expounded upon. But, my curiosity had been somewhat alleviated but the length and depth of the reply, and I didn’t want to take anymore of their time (though maybe they have plenty of it, if they can send me such an extensive answers). So I sent a brief thank you note.   To which I receive this reply...  One little addition to Josh's answer. If you are using Windows XP there is a built in network time client. You can set your have your time automatically updated by following these instructions:  1. Double click on the clock (or open up the date/time control panel) 2. Click on the ""Internet Time"" Tab 3. Check ""Automatically synchronize with an Internet time server"" 4. Click ""Update Now""  I believe that once you turn this feature on it syncs your clock once a week.  But I’m running Windows 2k, so until I upgrade my system and install Windows XP, which I'm hoping to do this summer, I just have to keep my clock inline on my own."
4HOYZD4,male,23,"If you haven’t seen the news, these two link, one to the Israeli paper  urlLink Ha’aretz  (The Land) and the  urlLink NY Times , should bring you up to speed regarding the bombing that took place Sunday morning. This is the start of the work week, and a lot of soldiers head back to their bases via the bus system.    The blast was in the southern part of Tel Aviv, while the Tal Hotel and the other places we visited in Tel Aviv are in the northern part.   Now for my opinions: I’m angry about this, especially now that I know individuals who live in Israel. I trust they are all safe, and that the Jess and Mike are also safe (I doubt they were even awake at that 7am hour). This comes two days after the UN’s Internal Court of Justice ruled that the Separation Fence which Israel is building, is illegal and that countries should consider measures to punish Israel if the fence isn’t torn down. Where is the ruling and the recommendations that punish the Palestinians for such bombings?   If there were no terrorism, there would be no fence.  But you say if there was no occupation there would be no terrorism?  There would be no occupation if the Palestinians had leaders dedicated to peace.    It is a vicious stalemate Israel is in. I wish there was strong enough leadership somewhere in the world to figure out a way to break it."

4HOYZD4,male,23,"My mother called today. We had a nice chat. Talked about the up coming float trip, my pseudo-job hunt, and my plans for Israel. But as we were wrapping up, she remembered to tell me, as a matter of passing information, that my Grandmother isn’t doing very well.   She’s 86, and her health is, well, she’s still alive and not in hooked to any machines. But her body is slowly failing, and her mind has deteriorated, particularly over the course of the passed 3 years. When I saw her last autumn, she had trouble recognizing me. After a few seconds of mental work, she recognized me as “Grandson”, which was really okay with me. My mother has told me of numerous occasions how she has been meet by my grandmother with an unrecognizing blank stare. Last week apparently, Mom took Grandmother to have her spectacles adjusted. As they were riding in the car, Grandmother said, “Funny, my daughter spoke of doing this same thing”. When my mom asked, “Well, who do you think I am?” all my grandmother could do was giggle in embarrassment.   So  urlLink Hospice  is helping Mom care for Grandmother now. This is in addition of course to the very nice assisted living facility Grandmother has been in for nearly three years. Basically, Hospice provides support during the last few steps of the journey from the cradle to the grave. If there is a medical emergency, 911 isn’t called, there is no resuscitation. A shot of morphine or a tranquilizer to keep her comfortable is the most they do.   It’s weird, and very sad to be thinking about all of this. I’m not particularly close to Grandmother, but she’s Grandmother. She’s been the nebulous, comforting, stable force all of my life. She made Halloween costume for  urlLink Rebekah  and I when we were kids on her visits from Florida. She baked cookies and went with us to the Zoo. Of all the shit that happened in my family, of all the words said in anger and disrespect, she was never part of it. Only once, during fight between my parents, did I hear my father speak ill of Grandmother. She was, is, just above it all. There is only one thing left for her to do, but she will do it on her own time, as she has done so many other things in her life."
DWGIVEF,male,16,"Well are these new upgrades? or have they been here for a while and i just haven't noticed before/ what ever the case it's very resourcefull new upgrades. Today has been a day of news my aunt from tampico alongside her family are comimg to visit on the 25th, for 3 day's of sight seeing, and shooping, which should be fun if, my room wasn't before time offered as a welcomiming for them to sleep in, they won't get much sleep there are birds and insects who sing and croak outside my window every other night. SO again to the seeing and shooping this will be another good excuse to drive to katy mall and blow our money, hehe. So yesterday in due to my insomnia i saw the most interesting short story called evelyn the cuttest evil dead girl, it's avery interesting gothic twist about the age old long story of tryin to fit in somewhere and making friends, even though it was 6 minutes long it was still interesting.

Then again i do take that back i wasn't that anti-social when i think about it i actually did have one or two friends but they happened to be seniors who are now GONE a TRIP out of the states *tear*. I NEED TO GET A JOB and slave away at the counter somewhere. Id actually walk somewhere but there's nothing worth walking to in my area *another obese tear* I NEED A LIFE AGAIN ahhhhh. oh well."
DWGIVEF,male,16,"Well Im feeling happily bummed out today, i guess it happened after i ran  into Thad at the mall today, well he actually saw me from a distance so i guess it was him.  When i started to approach him my eye's felt stinging/burning as if though they were on fire. So when i talked to he was like guess what happened at Wais, and are you returning next year and me i was like Unsure! i actually would have talked to him longer but he was with soemone and so unfortanetely he was like see u later. and so afterwards since he was the first person/ link  from WAIS that i had actually physically spoken and felt, since i left there, everyone else I've seen online and haven't seen them in actuall people,* tear, Anyhow this kinda got me down becouse he was a real nice guy to me and i don't even remember how the hell i met him, but seriously he was the only guy who actually would have spent an entire conversation, unlike the most of the other males at wais who only stared, gave a small hello and goodbye and can i borrow a pen or pencil and then there's  evil eye's some would do all becouse of who a i was friends with, this is an idiotic  thing they did that alway's pissed me of. Anyway where was i, yeah so after he left i was left with a feeling of loneliness and longing to what i didn't have anymore, even though it kind of put a werid Ironic smile on my face, and the rest of the day i spent with that feeling whether  at the mall which i spent some hr's inside with the family shoping for their need's ( i really need to buy some clothe's) oh remindin me i saw thse wickedly cool pant's at Torrid, yes Torrid even though it's a store for womam's alternative sizes as they say,  and I'm not even a size 12 which is the minimun size they have. But still I'm like what a few sizes away, and I'm used to wearing loose clothing, even though i have to hold them up with a belt becouse if they don't they'll slip to my lower waist and so forth. Anyhow as i was saying yes it might be a store for woman, I would actually wear some type of female clothing if it isn't to feminine or revealing, and so forth. mI'm actually used to it in a weird way because A) whn i was in elementary school my mom had a habbit when i didn't have any vlean clothes she'd give me one of her shir'ts or jeans, and she'd send me off and most of the time i was so clueless to what i was wearing, and not until i wa soutside I'd be all like wait since when are these my clothing and so as you can guess after a while i was like whatever, but this stopod at the end of 4th grade becouse she didn't want me getting queerish ideas, which is very ironic considering how I'm bi and stuff, Oh my god i remeber this one incident in 4th grade whn i didn't have any clean uniform pant's and so we were in a hurry and my mom was in her room and i was like complaining about how i didn't have any clean pant's and so she was like here put this on and get ready, and so i put them and i was mortified because these were her short, short's that were what 1.5-2.5 inches away from my crotch, can you imagine a male 4th grader in very revealing short, shorts, i actually tried to lower them but when i did  most of my ass was exposed and so in the end i gave up with trying to lower them. Whn i arrivewd at school it was okay becouse people choose to ignore it or not comment or what ever. and so in the end i didn't get up or stretch because i was paranoid and didn't want people looking up my shorts to see everything. But still I'm going to buy those jeans' because,  A) they are on clearence, B) the male version of those jeans are extremely heavy and it feel's like I'm doing exercises in them.......One step.............two steps..................threeeeeeeeeeeeee steps. and so forth."

Im free, from the roach infested, place called summer school, i have a sore back as a suveneir, damn chair's, this leads me to another topic, now that im free this has cleared up 7.5 hrs in a day of noting to do there are many things to do but after a while i'll probboly have done everything. call this the 2nd sight but i see myself doing alot more cooking than usuall and working on organising my room which will take about 2 day's, becouse oncei start cleaning my mind eye sees something and starts reminicing. I might as weel go back to doing my art projects becouse those projects of mine take up alot of space, either that i can go to the bookstore and catch up on my literature.

DWGIVEF,male,16,"As i lay on my knees on the bathroom floor puking, my brain couldn't have made my puking any easier instead it was giving me a killer headache, and the people outside the bathroom floor asking are you alright, really didn't help at all, after i was done the pain was also gone and left me with a bitter anger towards frozen food's that you leave in the freezer and never eat due to the fact it was food that you've never heard of and what it was didn't have an appealing sound, such as bread filled with cream cheese from the inside, i ate it due to the fact that i was starving and there where wasn't anything edible to eat. I also think i puked due to tha fact that im sick.ANyhow after i puked i was calm and i started thinking and well my mind came up with a Thank's fr putting up with me so here you go and so my mind came up with this crappy story plot about love,revenge,Atlantis,the sea god,Re-incarnation,& divine winter witches/guardians, i have an idea of the story plot.This is what i have so far the Witch/guardian( don't have a name yet)Fell in love with the sea god and so did the sea god. The were madly in love with each other until the people of altlantis weakend and destroyed him.... it goes on so I''l just say it plainly she attacks and destroys atlantis, other  countries hear of what the guardian did and so the people threaten to go to war with them so the guardians not wanting to go to war forever decide to kill the one who destroyed atlantis, and start with that guardian from the begining.So they do, but what nobody knows about them is that wether they all die they will return becouse that's how they go on they are all the re-incarnations of the original guardian's, so wether they are killed the will be guardians forever until the end of time. Same with the sea god reborn again but not as a god. That's what i have so far im thinking of changing some stuff it sounds kinda crappy but you could never know. On some lighter subject it's the 4th of july yipee, not really it's just another excuse for people to get drunk as hell and accidenatlly burn up someones house wit fireworks, fireworks are cool but when you get outside there are alot of idiot's who do the most stupid thing's with fireworks, such as oh i wonder what happen's if i aim this to the floor ? this is not a lie ive actually heard people say this with fireworks and i'm like oh my god. Im almost temppted to go to a public place and say"" ""hey whose ridding the shooting star headed towards us"".

So guess what i forgot to mention a couple of day's it was jim morrison's anniversary on the july the 3th, i remembered yesterday when i was listening to light my fire, when i suddenly remembered hey it was his passing anniversary on the 3d. Today today what a day not really, it's just been bleaker.I spent all this morning remembering a Tragic Fairy tale from when i was younger,yes there are such things as tragic fairy tales,i finally remembered all the datails to it, the story is basically like the little mermaid, but the differences are the sea hag isn't evil, she doesn't interfeare, actually she just makes bargain's, the bargain the mermaid made was that she also had three day's to get the prince's heart and if she didn't onthe mornng of the 3rd day she would turn into bubbles and disipate into the wind. So when she goes to the prince she tries and the prince by his own will falls in love with another girl. And so the prince invites her to go with him and his new lover to go to the sea in his boat.so when her sisiter's find out,(dady doesn't rescue her)so they  sneak into the sea hag's cave and look for how to break the spell, so in the morning on the 3rd day they tell her she must drive a knife through his heart in order to break the spell, so she finds herself in his room with a knife in her hands, she looks at his face nad finds herself unable to and heads up the deck where she waits for morning and her sister's ask her why didn't she, she responds I can't kill him i love him to much, i would ratehr turn into bubbles and be around him fore ever, than never be with him, and so it ends with her turning into bubbles and dissapearing into the wind. This i think was one of those stories that gave me an early belief that there is no such thing as Happily ever after, and this was about when i was 7 or 8, it's amazing what i can remeber from when i was younger."

Anyway the restaurant wasn't all that bad ok it all was bad except for the uhm person(guy)who i passed path's with he was so CUTE and he saw me looking and had like okay he's looking at me whatever. i coud even see him if i turned around since all i had to do was look back and i could see him i kept doing this and my mom was like ""what are you looking at"" and of course i was Like im looking at the bathrooms since i feel like taking a piss.

This isn't anything new this squables have been going on for like a long time ago, but this time there getting more violent, and stupid, such an example of why they're getting stupid is that for some reason my aunt keeps involving my mom's best friend in everything when they get into fight's saying, ""if it was for her you'd do anything"". I personally think she's jealous becouse my mom has a better friend than she does or she just wants her to herself, but i dont know. These fight's are slowly escalating to the point where all it this anger needs is just a spark to burn like hell, and that spark will no doubtedly invovle me. Anyway on a lighter note my school is infested with roaches, this morning when i was waiting for the bell to ring i had to take a piss real bad and i didn't feel like going to the second floor so i went to the first floor bathroom and so the lights were off and so i walked in a step and turnes on the light next thing i see are like a shit load of roaches moving around and im like ""WHHAT THE HELL!"" and i walked out and like a few followed me out. so i was like ok i can take my chances and go back inside there and get to the  other side of the wall where all the stalls are and take a piss and most likely have roaches jump out of everywhere and attack me until im on the ground having my skin eaten by roaches, or i can delay for another minute or two and go upstairs and take a piss where it migfht be safer? ""I think i'll go to the second floor"" Afterwards i kept seeing roaches here and there in the halls and i was like damn where's The Department of public Health.while on the subject of school ive got a 4 page/750 word minimun report on Holland/Netherlands to do -yay- me im just shining with joy that its just to unrealistic *tear* and another *obese tear*."

And she again was like you'll have to see and i was like yeah, i was tempted to put the name of my teacher Mr hebert on it and put it on his desk, so he could think it was for him, but i was like better not, i don't want to be that mean, he hasn't done anything to prevoke me like other teachers who have been complete asses twards me.

After an 2.5 hrs we calmed down and were like okay. Afterwards i was still feeling moody, but it wasn't regular moody this was a different kind of moody the mood i was feeling was differnt it was a type of feeling where it feels as though you're soul is flying but yet is imprisoned underground, i feel happy but sad at the same time, more in tuned but out of my sense's, the type of feeling where shadow's whisper seductive things to you're soul and so forth. i was trying to understand the  reason behind my emotions when i started feeling this way i was like Okay i feel this way after a fight, i feel sad but connected none the less, in the end i just gave up trying to understand my emotions since i will never understand them completely.

The roads there are not near large or elaborate enough to accommodate all of the traffic.  I spent the last 4 days with veins popping out of my forehead, and terrible things coming out of my mouth.  NOBODY there drives with ANY urgency.  Cant tell you how many times I've pleaded with people to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!!!!!!  It will be a while before I can endure such incompetence behind the wheel!   drunk...  When in Rome, do what the Romans do.

So friends, as I dive into my 4th week straight of not being at home with my beloved Miss Pants, I look forward to divulging to you all of the details that I'm allowed to share (hey, bachelor party...some shit that happens in Chicago dies in Chicago). I bid you all a good weekend.    For those of you looking for a place to rob, I will be out of town from Friday morning till Sunday night! I keep most valuables under the bed and in the closet, so do forget to check there.    Cheers!"
VX6CYDH,male,27,"marriage...   Yesterday I'm hanging out at the Harvester Of Sorrow's house doing what we do.  Suddenly, from upstairs his newly wed wife starting yelling downstairs about what's going on some stupid reality show.  She shouts for about 2 minutes, the whole time Harvester is busy dicking around with his stereo receiver.  Now, I was listening to what she was saying, and if he wanted to even partially pretend that he was listening to what she was saying, he would have responded with a ""wow"" or ""that's gross"" but what does H.O.S. respond with?   ""OK""   Just made me giggle.  Married for a month and already with the dismissive responses.  I think they put some kind of depressant in wedding cake."
VX6CYDH,male,27,Who ever came up with the idea of mondays....they have something coming to 'em! BEATDOWN!
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Tyke has taken more naps this week than any other week in his life.  Well, any other week in the last 10 years of his life.  And that might even be true.  It very well might not be exaggeration.  Tyke just yawned now even.  Today though was a great day.  Tyke got screwed in math and got one of the two worst new seats in the class and just had to sit there for a long time.  But then 2nd period was fun.  Tyke had some people talk to him as he was walking to class which is always fun cuz it is unexpected cuz it's from people he doesn't normally talk to.  Like this one junior girl who really liked his pink shirt yesterday has been talking to him a lot the past week and seems to think he's pretty cool which makes Tyke feel good, even though she has a boyfriend so it's not like she likes him.  Well, seh could but odds are not.  But now she talks with Tyke about a lot of things and whenever she sees Tyke somewhere she goes out of her way to say hi or say something to him and that is nice.  Like after school she yelled at Tyke to have a great weekend from approximately 58 feet away while walking with her boyfriend.  Oh, here's something that Tyke doesn't super like about his blog.  Whenever he mentions something like this that has to do with a girl he always seems to get at least one person who thinks that now Tyke has a thing for the girl.  Well, that usually isn't true.  That impression just comes because Tyke takes a little bit of time to mention some fun stuff that happened and since often she is the only girl Tyke talks about that day, it seems like he is developing a crush on her.  Let's just squash that idea that Tyke has a crush on this girl.  There.  That's done.  But anyway, Tyke played Bump in Weight Training again today and he is really good of course.  The junior girl always talks about how she has to beat Tyke at Bump in order to make her junior year a success so today she finally did beat him.  And it wasn't like Tyke let her.  She just beat him.  Then in 3rd period they were forced to watch Not Without My Daughter which is a pretty sad movie but Tyke doesn't want to be watching that 2 days after the AP test when he could be watching Rounders or something like that or even just sitting and talking.  But after that class Tyke went to 4th period where he acted out Waiting for Godot and did his Lucky soliloquy.  That shit was weird.  No punctuation at all.  Odd.  Then they went to Pie for lunch.  And in 5th period Tyke had a sub.  So he took attendance and then left.  He went to Kinker's class for a while and they played some Trivial Pursuit trivia with each other and then watched some SNL skits.  Then Tyke took Kinker's bag to his car and put it there so Kinker didn't have to carry it.  Tyke talked with a few people before seeing Purdy walking back to school so he went over to here and they walked around together.  Then they saw Haras and talked for a bit before walking to the senior courtyard and sitting together in the sun.  Karla came out and made some friendly chit-chat (sounds funny) but then class was over.  So they went to 6th period.  Tyke pretended that he was HoChyt for attendance and said he was here and then he was himself also, if that makes sense.  Then he called HoChyt and told him he didn't need to come to class cuz they had a sub.  Later on in the most boring of movies, HoChyt came in and said that he was from ASB and needed to get out Tyke Turner, Purdy McHot, and Kinker for some reason that Tyke doesn't remember now.  So the sub let him and then they just left.  Then Tyke and Purdy walked around more and dropped her bag off in Tyke's car for after school.  Then they went back into the sun and sat in it for the rest of the school day before finally leaving.  And then Tyke went home to change and go down to South Cove for some bball with Amed, Maniak, Jew, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon.  It was cool and Tyke seems to be starting to get a little bit of a tan from playing so many basketball games without a shirt on.  That is a good thing cuz Tyke is pretty white.  Then Tyke came home and basically was asleep until 8 with dinner in the mix there and watching some NBA games on TV as well.  Then he was so tired he didn't want to do anything at night but tomorrow he is gonna go tux shopping/searching with Amed among other things.  So time for ice cream, milk, and ESPN now.  Bye all.  Hope all those in Lake Wenatchee are having fun, like Purdy."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"So to start off Tyke is going to divulge some information that was going to be secret until the end of this blog.  But Tyke's plans changed.  He was going to do an April Fool's joke-blog where he made up this story of a girl he met Thursday night and hung out with and exchanged numbers with, etc.  He was going to be very detailed and intricate but still be fun and then give his readers some false beliefs.  Either he was going to do that or do a blog where he sets himself up as being suicidal and extremely depressed (which he could pull off pretty well in this hell week he has had).  He also decided not to do that.  Instead, he is just going to say what he has already said and say ha!  So that is pretty much what Tyke's joke was going to be.  He thought of it last night and thought it would be good.  But Tyke doesn't really feel in the mood to do so.  Nor has he been in the mood to do it for quite some time.  That's kind of interesting.  Tyke had a lot of fun at Refuge this past Sunday and he was very giddy then.  Excluding Sunday though, Tyke has not been very happy since Saturday evening.  Late night Saturday he wasn't as happy either.  So basically this week has been depressive.  Not exactly sure that 'depressive' is a word-most likely isn't-but it was used strategically to convey his message.  Not depressed, not depressing, just depressive.  Like it could be depressing if it got worse.  Which it won't.  It's just another phase.  Which is kind of random to Tyke.  He really doesn't know why he has been so down this week.  It's not like this week is that different from any other.  Tyke has had to do a little bit more homework than usual but that isn't that big of a deal.  He knows what is making him sad but it isn't like he hasn't always felt that way.  For some reason it is taking it's toll on Tyke this week.  Being sick and not of healthy body must have some effect on his mind.  It is just annoying mostly.  Oh, and Tyke has also missed something for the last 2 days but he hopes to get it tomorrow.  At least once.  Let's see.  What was fun today?  Sanders (yeah, using her name for once) said poop.  It was funny.  Then Tyke kept saying poop.  Poop poop poop.  Tyke was the King in english.  He was drifting asleep after he thought he was done with his lines for the day but then he opened his book a bit as they began to read again and he realized all of a sudden that he was supposed to be reading.  So he jumped in and read.  That woke him up.  It caught him by surprise to say the least.  Actually had to stay in class 5th period for most of the day again.  That was too bad.  Did go to the bathroom though at one point.  That was a great #1.  It felt really good.  Just like the one Tyke just took.  Mmmm...good feelings.  Today is the first day of April.  Which means only 2 more months of school...after this month that is.  But yeah, that is not going to take that long either.  Which is just a mixed bag of emotions.  But you all know what that is like so no need to talk about that topic here.  This is just for brand new topics of conversation.  Yeah, right.  What a great title for a play/musical/opera/whatever the hell it is.  Les Miserables.  Less Miserables.  Tyke would like to be that right now.  Less miserables than he is now.  Ok, only one way to change that, at least that Tyke can do on his own.  And that is to eat.  Eat a lot.  And then just poop it out later.  Poop poop poop."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Tyke is now in Edinburgh, Scotland at an internet cafe in the train station.  It will be a somewhat quick blog again as he is on the clock for money but thats ok.  Yesterday Tyke and the family got on a train in King's Cross Station in London and headed northward for the great Scot-land.  It was about a 4 hour train ride and Tyke spent the first hour playing cards with his dad and then he listened to music for the next 3 hours.  It was really a pretty easy little train ride and even though it was wet and rainy outside the scenery was pretty nice too.  It had just poured earlier apparently so it was a bit surprising that the train tracks weren't flooded.  Once they got into Edinburgh they took a taxi to their housing.  It is really an incredibly nice place to stay.  The place is an apartment that some guy rents out and it is a really great flat.  He has made it pretty nice and modern as it has a great LCD screen for the TV, DVD player, CD player, CDs, DVDs, new furniture, and just so much great stuff.  There are multiple rooms and 4 beds too.  Tyke is going to go out and film the place when he gets back so you can see it later.  But last night Tyke just watched some football and went to sleep.  If you didn't know, it gets darker later on at night here as well as getting light earlier on in the morning so the days are of course longer.  That means it is still light out pretty much whenever Tyke goes to bed at night.  Then again, the latest Tyke has gone to bed is like 10:30.  But today Tyke woke up about 9 and then got himself all ready and took his Erythromycin.  He still isn't fully recovered as he has a runny nose and still can't hear out of his right ear very well, although the left one isn't too bad.  But he'll hopefully be fine soon.  Tyke came down to the train station in the morning and got breakfast, came here to scope things out, and then his mom got a few things checked out for traveling.   After that they went up to Edinburgh Castle which was marvelous.  The views were spectacular and he really loved the visit there.  He began to walk around on his own and then just went off separately.  He decided to go down the street his apartment his on and look for The Royal Palace at Holyrood (or something like that).  But he didn't quite find how to get in so he walked all the way around it and then past this huge mountain and took some pictures and then found himself an hour later on the other side of the bridge from his flat.  Needless to say he was lost but he found out how to get back and went to the flat.  He doesn't have a key to the house so he buzzed the place to see if his mom was back yet but she wasn't so he had to wait around for her.  She didn't come so Tyke came down here and has been here for 20 minutes.  He'll go back to the flat after this and hopefully he will be able to get back in soon.  But if not oh well.  This city is really beautiful.  He stays here one more night after tonight and then leaves on Tuesday.  Then he goes to Dover, Calais, and Paris before heading back to London for one more night.  Then he travels all of Sunday and gets back Sunday night in Washington.  So maybe he will see you then but if not, later yo."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"A long and eventful day without the sadness that accompanied yesterday.  Some might say this was a very good day.  It started (Maniak caught Tyke mid-type by IMing him and having the window pop up) off by going over to Macaroon's to begin the Hamlet questions that they need to have done by Wednesday.  They just about finished 1 question before heading up to Amed's to play bball with Tyronious, Maniak, and Piggy J.  It were fun times.  Then the gang went their separate ways for just a little.  Tyke and Macaroon went to Costco and were joined by Maniak and DUI.  This 4some would be the group for most of the day.  And what a group indeed.  Two hot studs leading the way with their two hot lady friends behind them.  You know which is which.  Macaroon was of course messing everything up and he just couldn't do anything right which posed problems for the dinner they were going to make later on in the night.  The gang went to Sunset to drop off Tyke's car and then Maniak drove the murder (group of crows, or in this case the ""gang"") down to Bell Square.  However, on the way there they stopped off at University Bookstore and got some, you guessed it, Cougar shirts.  Tyke and Maniak will match when they wear them on the first day back from break.  You just wait.  After that they went in to many a store while Tyke wore his cowboys shirt (with scotch tape magnificently holding together the torn pocket) and a cowboy-ish hat that Maniak had in his car from Tolo.  It wasn't really a cowboy hat but it looked enough like it.  Tyke saw this one guy wearing cowboy hat and tried to tip his hat to the guy like they had a special bond but everybody in his family but him looked at Tyke and they all gave him weird looks.  It was fun though.  Speaking of fun, Tyke decided after leaving A&F that he was going to flex for every girl that walked by him from then on.  He got some nice reactions for quite some time until one girl decided to talk back to him and said, ""You wish, maybe if your 11-inch biceps grew a little.""  Or something along those lines.  The you wish part she definitely said and Tyke thought he heard something about 11 and inch.  Tyke does not have 11-inch biceps though.  12 inch right bicep.  So prolly like 11 for the right.  Or 11 and 1/2.  Sumting like that.  The murder left Bell Square after Tyke tried on a $100 girl's jumpsuit at some store and then they went to DUI's for their stir-fry dinner.  The whole murder made it together although Macaroon seriously blew at doing anything.  So Tyke and Maniak hid a onion that they accidentally dropped down a hole into his rice along with a green bean.  That was fun.  And Macaroon had been making racist and sexist comments all day but he kept making more as he tried to eat with chopsticks and then made another comment to DUI that was totally uncalled for.  He needed to learn some manners.  Then he called up Amed and they told him they were coming over.  But Amed wouldn't let them use his hot tub like he should have so they kept arguing with him but he was being a hairy stubborn jackass and just wouldn't do it.  He brought out the whole ""My parents won't let me use it cuz I'm too hairy"" excuse but nobody was buying it.  It was just cuz nobody else was Russian.  That is the real reason.  After that whole fiasco they went up to Dr. Phil's house as he was coming back from Factoria.  So they chilled there and watched a show on MTV before going outside and leaving.  Maniak drove DUI and Tyke back to DUI's house where Tyke's car was and Tyke then said his goodbyes to the lovely couple before heading back to Dr. Phil's to join Doc P, Amed, and Macaroon on a walk around the loop.  Tyke joined up and then when Amed and Macaroon had to leave Tyke and Dr. Phil kept walking.  They walked past Tyke's car and then just kept walking and walking.  They talked about great stuff and it was a really good time.  Something that Tyke rarely gets to do.  Which made it great.  It was nice weather out too so it was pleasant.  All in all it was a great capper to the night.  As this blog should be.  At least for Maniak.  Tyke and Maniak hung out a lot today.  Good times.  Good times."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Yeah, are you serious indeed!  AYSI!!!  Today wasn't that exciting of a day.  It started off terribly.  Tyke woke up at 5:58 today and noticed his throat was extremely sore.  Extremely.  He thought about, for the first time all year really, staying home from school.  He knew he wasn't going to but this was one of the worst he has felt all year.  In his car after he parked in the lot at school he just leaned back and nearly fell asleep before school started.  He got to that point where he suddenly realized he was falling asleep and he knew he had to go to school.  How funny would that have been if Tyke was late to first period cuz he fell asleep in his car in the parking lot.  That would be a great story to tell.  Speaking of sleeping in the parking lot, Tyke's 1st period teacher is going to be gone all week after spring break so Tyke is trying to devise a way that he can pull a 5th period, 1st period.  Just skip.  He would like to be able to just sleep in an extra hour and then not even come to 1st period at least one day but he doesn't think he'll be able to do that.  But if he does, he could hang out with Purdy when she gets to school for 2nd period.  It would be just like 5th period but earlier in the day and colder.  Well 5th period today was like 5th periods of old.  Tyke got to skip.  He walked in with his backpack on, saw the sub, turned around, dropped his backpack off outside the door, went back in, did attendance, left.  It was great.  He walked around and talked to 2 fine blog-nameless ladies that he is seeing and talking to all the time now and then he continued his journey.  Went out to his car with Macaroon for a little but it was gameday so Macaroon decided to play it safe and go back to class after a few minutes.  Tyke waited for Purdy and they went to Physics.  Oh yeah, Tyke barely said a word until 2nd period today.  That's how sick he felt.  Pretty sick.  His throat hurts quite a bit but it is a weird feeling.  If he eats a lot it makes him feel better.  The more he swallows stuff, the better it feels.  And not that Amed-style of swallowing.  Yeah, you know what kind of swallow techniques Tyke's talking about.  Nudge nudge.  JIB lunch.  Good food and it is fun talking with Amed and Doc P about stuff.  It is a great way to spend lunchtime.  Well after school Tyke took some sleep and went to some soccer game at IHS.  It was a fun time even though the guys lost.  They got quite screwed though.  Quite.  They didn't play all that well but the refs had to be joking.  One of them was.  But really, how could they be serious?  It was a joke.  And not a funny one.  Kinda like a teacher joke.  It's supposed to be funny but it has no comic value at all.  Poor delivery is a big part.  These refs sucked.  Speaking of sucking...nope, can't transition that into going to bed without making it gay.  But Tyke just did actually.  Sort of.  Zzzzzzzz..."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"So, here Tyke goes again with the second blog of the night.  This one will be a little tedious cuz if you don't know it is tiring and somewhat boring writing these extended blogs night in and night out.  But they do ""cause pleasure"" for Tyke in the long run.  Ok, Tyke wrote that last line 15 minutes ago cuz Macaroon just called him and they were talking for a while.  Tyke had to sorta defend himself cuz of one of his decisions during the day.  Even though it wasn't his fault but whatever, you'll hear in a bit.  1st period=gay today.  It wasn't too bad but the teacher is a fucking douchebag.  She is soooo stupid.  2nd period was fine and Tyke was owning everyone in his groups in squats and other leg stuff.  He was just pounding out the reps like it was nothing.  Sure he was only repping 165 but still, he does have pretty good legs.  That's why he can get up on his leaps.  3rd period was cool and the rest of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was pretty good.  At least the ending was funny.  And the Boy Rangers part.  Man, that is pretty messed up what those guys did to the Boy Rangers.  4th period was fun.  It was poetry reading day.  Tyke read 3 haikus.  He read his first two after Amed went.  The former of Tyke's two poems seemed to get a nice outcry from the peanut gallery as it was about his wanton.  Then he decided to just read those two and sat back down to savor the intellectual stimuli that were to be read.  Some were pretty good he thought.  After everybody went Tyke was pressured into reading some of his dirtier ones.  He read the ""Elongated Shaft"" one and right after the teacher said, ""Tyke, I think I feel a theme in your poems.""  Tyke took this as a hint that she was trying to censor him so he left the ""Virgin tongues in lust"" haiku in his pocket and was pleased with the reactions of the class.  He at least showed more of his creative side and humorous view on life if nothing else.  For lunch Tyke went with the gang to Pie and got some damn good cheese pizza.  That ish is hott!  Ekul was there and Tyke talked to him for a bit and he challenged Tyke to another game but this time they had their original player back on their squad so they wanna play.  Well, Tyke said he would be willing to play as he just loves the game.  So this time Tyke is going to pick the court and he will probably pick a new third player to join him and Kinker.  They are definitely going to play on a 10' hoop though.  Tyke stipulated that at the girls basketball game he went to with Purdy at night.  For some reason the Sly Lioners are afraid of the 10' monster in their face so Tyke is going to have to whip it out and beat them with it.  Such a great line right there.  Who knows who the Quah will pick for their final member of the Trio of Dominance though.  It could be most anyone.  Tyke has already improved since last time and his skills on the 10' hoop are much better than a wet 8 footer.  So the game will be a classic again.  Perhaps the comm center for the locale.  It worked well for Tyke last time.  He would like to play on a different court though.  He would love to just play at the court by his house.  That would be something.  The rim is super freaky hard.  It bounces everything out but Tyke knows it pretty well.  And the court is decent too.  And it is by Tyke's house so that makes it better too.  But all will be decided soon.  After school Tyke was called by Macaroon and he offered a game of hoops up on Coug Mount but Tyke didn't really want to drive up there knowing that he would have to come all the way back in not too long and he still had to write a paper.  Even though he didn't think he was going to the girls game that night he still wanted to get it done.  So he declined.  Well then Purdy told him that she was in fact going to make it to the girls game so he decided that since he already had like 5/7 of it done he might as well get out of the house and hang out with some girls (mainly just to hang out with a bunch of girls).  The game was fun even with the freaky Sly Lion dads sitting in front of Tyke, Purdy, and Tina.  This one guy had mad dandruff (mandruff) and not to mention he kept licking himself like he was a cat.  It was freaky.  Purdy kept putting her finger like right by the mandruff and it was freaking out Tyke.  Then she got elbowed by the Cat Man when he started jumping up and down and feeling up some fellow fathers around him.  It was a scary time but still fun.  Scary=fun in some cases.  Other times it equals horrible.  But not often.  Or like maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the time.  Somewhere in there.  Tyke came home though at 7:02 and this was the first odd revelation to him.  He opened the door and all of the freaking lights were out!!!  And it was only 7:02!!!  His parents had already called it a night at 7.  That is just weird.  Tyke goes to bed around 11 every night and gets up at about 6 every morning.  And he is still sorta growing so he needs sleep way more than his parents.  However he will acknowledge the fact that on many occasions his mom gets about 2 hours of sleep cuz of work.  That is a frequent occurrence.  The other odd thing was that Tyke saw a message from Macaroon saying something along the lines of, ""thanks for ditching me you ungrateful bastard.""  Along those lines.  Well, Tyke not only didn't mean to ditch him but he didn't even make an effort to ditch him like he will occasionally do if he is really trying to ditch someone (which never happens).  But really, there is nothing there as the two are still friends and all and they hang out like all the time.  But anyway, Tyke still needs to finish his paper and print it off so hope you enjoyed double blog day.  Maybe it was even better than double stamp day!  Probably not though."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Blogging, again.  Like always.  Every night.  It's quite commonplace.  Today was very slow too.  Tyke woke up at 12:40 and didn't get out of bed til after 1.  Then he didn't do anything all day.  He played some video games, watched some tv, and just took it easy.  Really he did nothing.  He talked a little bit online but that was pretty much all.  So he had a very slow day after a string of really busy days, or just tiresome days.  He did have that feeling of missing the fact that prom was over.  It was just so much fun.  And now Tyke graduates in a week (whoa, one week from today Tyke graduates high school) and he leaves for Europe in just over a week meaning he will not get to see anyone for a long time.  Then he gets back on the 5th and has his wisdom teeth out on the 9th.  So he is a busy little boy.  But it will all be fun.  Damn, Tyke feels a little hot right now.  Hopefully it doesn't mean anything.  Tonight Dr. Phil, Kinker, and Macaroon came over to Tyke's house.  They played a spirited game of Risk.  Tyke probably should have won.  He made a few miscues, like allowing for Kinker to take out Dr. Phil and thus get his cards which meant that Tyke lost his upper hand.  And then he just got pwned on some rolls which hurt him later on.  The cards also weren't in his favor as he had 5 of the same card and 2 of another so instead of having two sets, he only had the one and couldn't turn in 2 sets of cards at once, thus getting a humongous bonus.  But in the end Kinker played it well and won.  Then they played MOH and hosed some Bromley's and then finally finished the night off with ESPN.  Trenton Hassell and Luke Walton are better than Allen Iverson and Chris Webber.  That was proven.  And Luke Walton is better than Shaq too.  Just so that you know.  Tomorrow Tyke gets to go see Harry Potter and hang out which will be fun.  Hopefully he has his car though as they might be taking it in to get an appraisal.  But that will come later.  Now Tyke's bed is calling."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Yessss, break is here.  Ahhhh, its going to be nice.  Just sit back and relax for a week.  Not have to do anything.  Soooo nice.  So here's how the day unfolded.  1st period there was a test and it was really stupid cuz the dumb teacher put a problem on there that was pretty much impossible.  Tyke talked to others in the class and they said the exact same thing as him.  They knew how to do the problem that was like the one on the test but the one on the test was made so that it was pretty much impossible.  It was just really gay.  2nd period was cool cuz Tyke found out he has a new student in there.  He won't name him yet cuz if you only get mentioned once then there isn't much reason to have a name for you.  But Tyke didn't really work out much other than having a mini-competition on who could bench the bar the most times.  It is pretty tough to do for a long time.  The bar doesn't seem heavy but the arms get so tired that they can't go up anymore.  That is when you stop.  3rd period was a total change from what was supposed to happen.  It was supposed to be a party-atmosphere but it sucked.  They ended up watching more of a stupid movie and Tyke and Purdy definitely weren't happy.  4th period was easy.  Talked about something.  Tyke doesn't actually remember what it was.  But they had 2 sing-a-grams and then also they listened to a few more songs, including Doc P's.  Lunch was fun; went to Costco for it to save some money.  Good hot dog today.  And the warm sun was very nice on Tyke's neck.  Very nice.  5th period was fun.  Just cuz of Tyke's little mini-escapade.  Tyke went on his usual bathroom trip past Skippy's class and talked to him for a little bit.  That was cool, then he went to the bathroom.  He walked around a little and said hi to some people and then he saw Shawna.  So he said hi to her and walked and talked with her.  Then she said she needed to find Tina and another girl to have a picture taken.  Well of course Tyke knows what class they have because he is always out during 5th period so he sees where everyone is.  So he went and they got Tina out of class.  They walked over to the Yearbook room and stood around.  Tyke was going to take the place of the other girl in the picture.  But they ended up not taking the picture :(.  It sucked!  So Tyke had to settle with just talking a little more and then leaving for his class.  It turned out that Macaroon needed to go to the bathroom the whole time Tyke was on his journey.  Whoops!  Oh well.  6th period was fun.  Tyke popped out some more accents and read from the Physics textbook.  His funny voices were adored.  Anyways, after school Tyke said goodbye to Purdy for a week and then the gang headed up to Tyke's to play bball.  It was a lot of fun this time.  They played at this court kinda by Tyke's house and it was really weird.  It was a nice little place but the backboard had no backboard.  It was missing the glass.  So the ball could go through the ""backboard.""  That caused some trouble.  The team of Tyke and Big Twigg lost the first game to the 3 undersized players but then won the next two thanks to Tyke's inside dominance and driving abilities...not his outside shooting.  He also drained his free throws, which came in handy the next games.  They played some 21 and Tyke won every time.  Then they played bounce 21 and Doc P managed to win that Tyke believes.  Whoa, he actually forgot.  But Tyke did dominate.  Actually Tyke might have won that game, shoot he doesn't remember.  Oh well, then they played a game of T-I-G.  Doc P shot the gayest shots ever.  One hand, no jump shots from everywhere.  He wouldn't stop.  Tyke hit a few but couldn't hit them with the insane luck that Doc P had so he ended up being the first out.  So then they went home.  And at 6:30 Tyke met up with Macaroon and Dr. Phil at Subway and they had a great dinner.  Then they went into GI Joes before going to Dr. Phil's work.  The manager guy kept following them around at GI Joes.  It was super stupid of him.  First he told them they couldn't ""use the frisbees inside.""  How dumb is that?  They couldn't toss them 2 feet (literally 2 feet) to test them out???  Reaaaal gay.  Anyway, to make a long story short...Tyke, Macaroon, and Kinker hung out at Tyke's.  They played some games and then Dr. Phil came over after work and he joined the festivities.  It was a gay ol night of fun.  Tomorrow (today should be fun too).  The girls should win.  Tyke, the number one fan will be there for sure.  But he will be sleeping through the boys game.  No doubt about that :)!!!"
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Funny how Your Song is playing right as Tyke begins to blog for tonight.  The lyrics start off pretty well for relating to Tyke.  Hence the great title of this first post in which Tyke actually uses titles.  So today was a day off for Tyke.  Just cuz he is a senior.  But really it seems like there were quite a few seniors who didn't skip today.  Maybe it was a normal amount though.  Tyke wasn't a senior other years so he can't tell ya.  Maybe if he doesn't graduate he can tell you next year.  But don't hold your breath, cuz holding your breath for a year is a long time.  You'd most likely die.  But in the rare chance you didn't die, you'd most likely come to find out that Tyke graduated so you were holding your breath for no reason anyway.  So here's how today went for all of you Tyke-heads out there.  Tyke got up at 10 and planned a poker game with Kinker for 11 at Tyke's house.  Kinker, Dr. Phil, DCups, Skippy, and Macaroon came.  Skippy came for only a little but he still left with a few bucks.  Tyke ended up losing 15 but then got a one dollar bonus for using his house and such.  So he only lost 14 in the end.  Once everyone left Tyke went to Dotti's house for some lunch and they planned to see Harry Potter.  However, not many people ended up coming apparently so they just went to lunch.  Purdy, Karla, Dudely Doo, Big Poppa Booty were all there.  They had some good Red Robin chow and stayed there for a while.  Then everyone dissipated and Tyke and Dotti went and rented a movie before going back to Dotti's and splitting there.  Tyke came back home and was just kinda like, damn.  Mainly cuz he wanted to hang out with the girls for longer but then he knew his parents wouldn't be too keen on him hanging out with them later at night like he could have so he ended up not doing anything really for the rest of the day.  He did re-burn some of his lost mixes and he wrote a nice note as well.  That was something he just needed to do.  He just needed to get some things out and since he has been struggling with writing songs for a while he just wrote them in words in a personal manner.  Then he listened to some good music, mellow music that is, and played some ESPN.  And now he is listening to American Pie while the M's play in the background with mute on.  And ""this'll be the day that I die..."""
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Today was it.  The last day of high school (thanks Hun for your ever-so-kind post) is already gone.  Tyke had his one final today in math to start off the day.  He didn't think it was as bad as it could have been but he still probably didn't get what he needed in order to keep his grade static but at least it wasn't that hard to actually do.  Tyke either knew how to do the problem or had no idea so he could just skip it or make up an answer.  He finished his test pretty quickly so he still had time to go pick up his graduation tickets and get his english teacher to sign off the sheet saying he would pass (ha, Tyke finds it funny he has to do that).  But then once his 1st period was over he went to weight training to finish off his high school career.  He did his bench rep test today and tried his dots but wasn't even close so he knew there wasn't a chance of him passing that.  He talked to Nene some and sorta said goodbye for a while as they most likely won't see each other for a long time.  Even though they haven't known each other that long, they've become pretty good friends.  After weight training though...it was over.  Tyke went to the commons to meet up with his row for graduation but that was it.  They got together, all 11 of them, and then they got seated.  The senior hall of fame and the I"
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Anyone see dead mummies this episode. I sure did, but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in Egypt. I mean, when you’re not going to be going to the airport, and you’re in a poor country like this, how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier?  So, the teams left the pit stop in Catherine’s Palace, and found that they had to take a train to St. Petersburg’s Hermitage museum. There they had to find Rembrandt’s “Return of the Prodigal Son”, something that sounds vaguely familiar. I kind of think I chanced upon it while doing my OM research, because Rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem. So anyway Chip & Kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting, while Colin & Christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the Prodigal Son was Jesus. I’m left wondering whether God neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge. In the meantime, Charla & Mirna, unlike all other teams who took cabs, “choo-chooed” their way to the train station on foot. A great display of Race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting.         Once the teams found their painting, they found that they had to go to Cairo, Egypt, for this leg of the race. Chip & Kim stupidly rushed to the airport, while Colin & Christie, a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements, walked to a travel agency. A travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight. In airports, their access to flight information is limited, and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly.  Kami & Karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency, but they were too late to catch Colin & Christie’s flight.  Colin & Christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to Egypt, and the others had been duped by the Lufthansa lady. They had a stopover in Paris, for quite a number of hours, I presume, since they had time to find another flight. This flight, instead of 2.25pm, landed at 2.35 am, about 12 hours earlier than expected. They got to Egypt and the Tower of Cairo, but found it closed. The poor things had to sleep in the Egyptian streets. I mean, even the poor Egyptians don’t sleep on the streets, and they had to?!  All the other teams stopped over at Frankfurt, except Linda & Karen. They were found to be with the lying Lufthansa lady, who informed them it was possible to catch up in Frankfurt. She turned out not to be lying for a second time around, cause they really caught up. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, cousins Charla & Mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out. It turns out that there was a better flight, and our little pink panthers, complete with the tiptoeing scene, left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other. That scene, coupled with Lance stirring in his piggy-wiggy slumber, was one of the most hilarious scenes in TAR history.  In Cairo, Colin & Christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 “Fast Forwards” in the whole race. In a way it was a good option because there are only 2, and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small. Might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race. They had to carry this sarcophagus, one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies, from somewhere to a temple. Colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding Christie’s advice. In the end, Christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple. At the temple, Christie refused to shut her gap and wanted Colin to admit he was wrong. Bad move! I should know since my father’s a Colin (same name, same character…). When they reached the temple, Colin halted and started bickering. The priest started shaking his head in disapproval… Hey! These clue holders aren’t supposed to display emotion! Well anyway, I was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple, but he didn’t and sent Colin & Christie along to their pit stop, The Sphinx.         Colin & Christie arrived at the pit stop at 11.27am, and I have to fast forward 3 hours to when Charla & Mirna arrive. They go to the Tower of Cairo, and found that they had to go to the Giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue. They went there, had a little trouble, and then finally got themselves to the Roadblock. From what I see, this was the most time consuming thing in this leg. It might have taken even longer than the Detour!         The Roadblock: one team member had to enter Osiris’ shaft and grab a artifact bag. Citing claustrophobia, Mirna asked Charla to go down. I’m left wondering what Mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters. Poor little Charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her “littleness”, and after a while, with the bag as big as she was, she had to take little rests on the ladders. Those producers sure aren’t thinking too much about her still being in the race…         Anyway, Charla & Mirna were given a map as their next clue, coupled with the contents in the bag. Puzzling for a little while, they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location. They found the Detour as other teams started arriving at the Roadblock. Kami & Karli, however, were easily dumfounded by the puzzle. Not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesn’t have corners…         The Detour this time involved Rock & Roll, and Hump & Ride. In Rock & roll, nice play on words to the producers, teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks. Ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it, apparently across the length of a football field. It is, according to Phil, “physically demanding, but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones, it can be completed quickly.”         In Hump & Ride, which only Charla & Mirna arrived in time for, teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant. This task was entirely up to the moods of the horses, whether they went fast or not. I have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by Charla’s side, even helping her to get on the horse, they managed this task pretty fast.         And all the teams went to the pit stop, where the moms got last place. It isn’t a big surprise as there’s a Fast Forward. The producers wouldn’t want the Fast Forward to determine who gets eliminated, especially since they’re trying to downplay and eliminate the Fast Forwards. Anyway next week the mummies have to beg. Will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb? I don’t think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys!"

UNZUVPX,male,14,"Ok... Here's the comments on the teams that I bring every reality show I watch. That is if we here at Singapore aren't too behind... I titled the post perky underdogs cause the underdogs seem to really be having fun on the race! Go the underdogs! Here's the whatever I promised stuff...  Brandon & Nicole -- I said last week that much was expected of this team, but they underperformed last leg. This leg, however, was a totally different story. They showed no negative signs, no whining, and no complaining. Nicole, however, may be a little too inactive for my liking. Poor her getting shagged in a foreign country, and all her boyfriend did was look for his balls(pun!). Bad Boy... They got a little lucky with the cemeterys, having their taxi driver correct them...  Charla & Mirna -- GOGOGOGO the little one! I love you Charla! She absolutely rocked the episode with her punk dancing, her ballerina twirling and her ""stick your hand up the cow's behind"" comment. It wasn't exactly fair that they got on the common ferry, but who cares right? It does make up for her inability to run, and she paid for it again at the foot race to the pit-stop. All I'm afraid of is that Mirna will feel like she's doing everything for the team, which is so untrue. I think Charla helped more with the slab of beef in the first leg. Nicole & Brandon are getting along well with them, so maybe, hopefully, the mentioned alliance next week is them. Then Brandon can carry Charla during a foot race! Ahh... I sense the first working Amazing Race alliance even before I see it! And did you see Mirna's face when she hugged Phil? Hilarious!  Jim & Marsha -- Wowzer! This team shocked me with their 3rd place finish. Who would expect the weakest team last leg to come out so strong this leg. Victims of the bowling moms? LOSERS! Ok... it was really bad of the moms to play so dirty, but who would believe that a middle class country like Argentina doesn't accept US currency? Even we in Singapore accept US currency! I really like it, however, that they finished in front of those moms. Rub it in their faces people!  Linda & Karen -- Who would expect the moms to be such home-bred bitches? Firstly, they've not heard of a foam party... Superbly stupid... And then they, like those bloody cowards in class, bully those weaker than them. How low can you go? I really, honestly, hope that these 2 go down next week. Who knows? we may get to see Charla jumping on her trampoline tummy... Btw, I thought the ""You outsmarted a cow"" comment was serious on their part. And I still don't know which is Linda and which is Karen...  Marshall & Lance -- Who? What? Where? After a fluke showing on the first leg of the race, this team proved that they teams cannot be judged on just 1 leg of the race. They are so insignificant because they are humourless and entirely serious. Who was it claiming to be the Ken & Gerard of the race again? This team needs to go soon... They are of no interest to us viewers.  Bob & Joyce -- Really, really horrible leg for these 2, and they still managed to stay in. First, the wrong cemetery... A little luck was involved of course, but they could have simply told the driver Evita Peron and he would've known where to go. No... I have to speak in their native style... Chacarita! Chacarita your way home soon people! Oops... Sorry if I just cursed you... Anyway, really bad call with the detour. Just because you like dogs doesn't mean the dogs are easier. Matching the face is much easier than walking one mile!  Colin & Christie -- Same comments as last week. This team definitely has chemistry together, and a lot is expected of them. However, they have failed to show us any of their outstanding abilities. I really wouldn't be surprised seeing these 2 eliminated the next time. I wouldn't be too upset either! They're getting monotonous and are sinking into the depths of Marshall & Lance's oblivion. If they don't show well the next time, I will have absolutely nothing left to say...  Chip & Kim -- Chip's a bastard. Need I say more? Yes I do! They sank as low as the bowling moms this time, playing it absolutely dirty. I have to say though, the stand off in the cab was a very smart tactical move, and it was absolute fairplay, even though some might not admit it. I'm sure that everyone rather him be nicer and let the bloody taxi go. Well these 2 have got to take a taxi and go home soon, cause I have a feeling next episode Chip will show more of his torrid qualities that I will surely hate.  Kami & Karli -- Poor little babes got stood up by that bloody Chip. Really respectable that they managed to finish the dog walking task even though they hated dogs. Maybe it's because they're so catty... There seems to be a significant twist in the detours this season; one is much easier than the other. They're enemity with Chip & Kim will push them to use the ""Yield"" next episode... I hope! These 2 teams will continue to battle for the last team in, I can feel it.  Alison & Donny -- What a bummer. Donny's a strong guy, but maybe he's too dimwitted. Alison's a weak girl, but she's smart. These 2 make a really dynamic duo, but queerly they were booted so early. Alison confirmed she's a bitch by walking away so defiantly from her partner after getting eliminated."
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Yeah... I was forced to buy tickets for the Festival of Arts. If I had to spend my time and money on something, it would definitely be Drama. Even though I knew that the storyline had no backbone, it was still better than going into a sleeping room with the music teams. So yes... My very professional comments on the performance:     Storyline -- The storyline is a failure. Anybody and everybody could see that. But this was meant mostly for inter-school fun, so the storyline doesn't exactly matter. The author of the script is definitely not a thinker.     Script(dialogue) -- Amidst a sea of puns and witty comments, the script wasn't exactly too smooth flowing. It was really good enough for a school performance like that, just that it wasn't perfect. The witty asides are what's best in the script, and this is where most of the Drama Club sriptwriting skills shine. For the simple and nonsensical storyline, the script was almost too good.     Characters -- The characters in the script are absolutely perfect. Each one represents the typical, overboard NS men often talked about. The Nerd, the Macho, the ""on"" one, the totally queer one, the ""good future"" one, and the ""cannot live without home"" one. Sadly, the very interesting subject of Malay logic was not touched on.  Malays are one of the main components of army life, without whom the NS experience is not complete. With a repetition of the ""nerd"" and the ""good future"", I really don't see why they couldn't do a dim-witted Malay. Super extreme cliches work well with the nonsensical storyline, but incomplete experience just makes the cast a little less than perfect.    Entertainment value -- Why do people watch comedies? To let loose, and have fun. With the flimsy storyline, the entertainment value had better be up there above perfection. Yes... Very much laughable, but definitely not high-level humour. After a while, the humour became very much corny and overused. I still do like the parts where the actors break into absolutely ridiculous and out of point dances. Their ability to incorporate a little musical influence really impressed me. It was the most highly intellectual humour in the whole script.   Overall rating: Good, but not rememberable. 3/5!"
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Ok, there's this friend in my OM team called Muthusamy. Since I have nothing to talk about today, I shall talk about him, and my Indian Physics teacher. As in Indian from India... I mean... You know what I mean...  Haha... Muthusamy is going to get the ""Diane(Survivor 3) Award."" Because that's exactly what he does, boss people around with his big fat mouth... Actually it isn't fat, but it's black. So anyway he is a guy that does all the slack jobs by opening his mouth to boss people around, and when people stand up to him, he cries. There was one particular time, when the rehearsals for OM were to be done in front of the Vice-Principal, and Diane here whined about having to go for a uniform group thingy. So naturally everyone protested and yadda, the case was brought to the teacher. In the midst of puberty tempers and very uncalled for tears, Diane revealed that what he wanted was rank and power in his uniform group. Oh my heck, how many people have an attendance like you... I mean I don't even go! We were lucky we protested and the case was brought to the teachers, because normally he would brush away protests like they were nothing, and just go on doing what he wants to do...  Actually it's pretty sad that I'm probably not going to do OM again, because I really loved the experience of staying in school till late, and all the bonding through ultimately fattening foods... Haha... Go OM!"
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Yes, I told you that all the animal titles would be my comments on the teams. The sphinx can be counted as an animal right? Even though it has a human head. Argh.. Nevermind! Let’s get to it shall we?  Colin & Christie – With a display of great wit this leg, they have gained a 13 hour lead over the other teams. They, however, seem to lose it next leg as Charla & Mirna steal their cab. They really deserve for their cab to be stolen, after all that bickering this leg. Going to travel agencies seems to be what Colin does best, but always remember, when there’s a flight that’s going to go soon, and you cannot afford to waste time, it’s not always the best option. Colin has a really bad attitude, and instead of Christie bringing down the team, Colin will succumb easily under pressure. I thik they have what it takes to go far, most probably to the final 3 teams.  Charla & Mirna – I can’t make any excuses for their neglecting to check with the trusty travel agencies. Like I said before, the safer option is the airport. Their not being able to find a taxi was stupid, even though they did save a bit of cash there. Finding the 50 min earlier flight out was one of the best tactical maneuvers I’ve seen on this season so far. I kind of think if Colin & Christie had gotten the same tickets as everybody, they wouldn’t have performed as well as these 2, because they would’ve succumbed to “peer pressure” and went with the others to eat, drink and be merry. Mirna better start doing something for the team, cause now it isn’t exactly balanced. With 2 people o the team with an equal number of plus and minus points, balance is very important.  Brandon & Nicole – Funny how the expected Final 3 teams come in 1,2 and 3 this leg. Of all the spoiled final 3 teams, I think this one is the worst as they succumbed to “peer pressure” to fellowship with the other teams instead of trying to find better options. Getting Chip to help, was it a show of manipulative powers? I don’t know. Not much shown on this leg about them really…  Chip & Kim – Where was Kim? I don’t even recall her speaking in a confessional this time around. Chip seems to be the brains and brawn of this team, and Kim is just there to fulfill the ‘team’ requirement to get into the race. I kind of think that they need to start bickering a little bit to make more of an impact on the show. Chip surely went up in my ratings this week. Although helping people is not so much a good tactical maneuver, I’ve said it before that I’d rather someone play Mr. Nice Guy than good player. He better not help anyone if they get any further, cause he may just ‘help’ himself out of the race.  Marshall & Lance – All I remember of them was that Marshall’s leg was hurt. I don’t see how he got that injury, unless he was so dumb that he injured himself during the 12 hour break. Oh yeah… He is dumb! I really don’t know why they didn’t ask help from anyone for the Rock & Roll thing, since one of them was injured. They actually showed a little race skill by checking in with the Air France office. Unfortunately, it was closed. When a team is rumored to be eliminated next round, I don’t think it’s exactly viable to support them.  Kami & Karli – They really don’t seem to have any brains. You know that you’re more physical than the bowling moms, and when you don’t know where to go you might as well wait for them and then beat them at the Roadblock. It was risky for them to go walking around like that, without a clue as to where to go. If they weren’t helped out by Chip, I think they would be roaming the desert for 40 years.   Linda & Karen – Domestic airport mistake, again! These people never learn, do they? I’m just wondering how they’ll cope next week, because this week was all that was shown of them was mistake after accident, and mistake after accident. Again, the blonde one didn’t do anything, and what’s worse, now she has an excuse to let the other one do all the work. I was hoping they didn’t catch up to the 3.15pm flight to Cairo, because they really didn’t deserve to. Getting their money stripped of them was entirely deserving, but what would’ve been better is that they got eliminated."
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Yes... I'm pissed again! That Jenna I was telling you about is rally becoming the most irritating and impetuous bastard I have ever seen. Samuel See Boyao, a mention of that very name and I feel like puking my existence out of myself. He is a friggin deperate asshole who laughs like a bloody Hyena. He is such a desperate wuss that he needed a loser last year to introduce him to a loser girl. One look at his screwed up face and you'll know why he's so bloody desperate. Stupid, low class and unhumouring idiocracy is what I will describe his life as...  Well, he's really not as bad as the bitch of the class I will term as the 'Deena Awardee'. Being a secretary of the class he seems to hold more power than anybody else in the class. For some reason he doesn't dare face the class, has absolutely no confidence and charisma, but in front of the teachers... Ooh, that's a totally different story! ""Oh Mr Deven, so and so didn't do duty yesterday..."" ""Oh Mrs Toh, can you ask them to donate $2 to the class fund?"" Wanna be responsible boy? Start doing your own Maths homework and handing it up on time first! Hypocrites are those I hate the most...  Oh yes... Have I added that he's a bloody faggot? He flirts with that German student in the class only because he has influence over teachers. Definitely a good person for his re-nomination bid next year. Well kid, if it is a re-election bid, say bye bye to your power, and guess who moves in to your place? Haha... ME! No one supports your ""It's against the school rules..."" (in a whiny voice) stand.

UNZUVPX,male,14,"Amazing Race's Sports Injury by  Ethan Alter    The Amazing Race's father-daughter duo, Jim and Marsha, got off to the roughest start of any team. After Jim took a tumble on the Santa Monica boardwalk and ripped up his knee, they were forced to go to the hospital, and nearly missed the first airline flight of the race. But they never gave up, battling their way into third place on the second leg. Their luck gave out Tuesday night though, as plane problems grounded them for good.     Ethan: So Jim, how's the leg?     Jim:  Oh, it's fine now. The stitches actually popped out five minutes after we were on the airplane. At that point, I was just concerned about infection, so I was taking antibiotics. Eventually, it went away and now I've got a nice souvenir scar.   Marsha:  He doesn't have feeling in the top of his kneecap though. He never mentions that part. But that's my dad, I guess.    Ethan: I'm still impressed that they were able to sew your wound up so quickly.     Jim:  That's actually a funny story. The nurse was taking her time, and I knew I had to get her on my side. She said, ""I don't understand why you just can't take the next flight to Uruguay."" So I said, ""You don't understand, I have to get on that flight. I didn't want to tell you this, but I'm a producer and I'm filming a show in Uruguay. My camera crew is already on that plane. It's going to cost millions and millions of dollars if we have to delay the production."" And she goes, ""What kind of show are you making? Is it some sort of animal show?"" I saw a spark in her eye and said, ""Yes, it's an animal show."" She said ""Oh, really?"" and then ran and got another doctor and a paramedic and all three of them did the procedure together. And then she said, ""Okay, you go ahead and produce your show, but no running and no jumping.""   Marsha:  She gave him a narcotic for pain and Dad threw it away because he didn't want to have a fuzzy head. All that injury and no pain medicine, I was so proud of him. We felt so victorious walking to the flight — I could hear the Rocky music in my head!       Ethan: Settle another issue: Did those bowling moms lie to you?     Marsha:  We still don't know. We overheard them talking to some locals, but they weren't discretely talking to them. It was like they were trying to lure other teams into listening, and I totally fell for it. After we got to the exchange booth and no one else was there, we figured they had tricked us. But then we wound up beating them to the pit stop and we thought that maybe we were just so wrapped up in the race that we misunderstood. We never confronted them about it and they probably had no hand in it. I can't wait to talk to them and say, ""We're sorry for saying such nasty things about you!""    Ethan: What happened to you at the Buenos Aires airport? That was confusing.     Marsha:  I told the woman behind the counter to book us on the 9:10 flight, but there was only one seat left. So I had her book me on that flight and put Dad on the standby list. I also asked her to confirm us for the 10:30 flight. I think confusion arose because Brandon and Nicole — whom I never should have helped in the first place after they screwed us over on the first leg — asked us to buy their tickets, too. So now I'm asking for a lot of tickets, and I guess the lady got confused. In her mind, she said, ""Well, Marsha's got a ticket for the 9:10, so I'll put Jim and Brandon and Nicole on the 10:30."" So I think we're set and then Dad sees that I don't have a ticket for the 10:30 flight.   Jim:  She made the mistake of not giving us the tickets that we asked for and I made the mistake of not checking the tickets at the counter. Once we got back to the counter and realized she wasn't going to admit her mistake, we got the airport manager in on it and even she couldn't do anything. But we still didn't think we were sunk because we were first on the standby list for the 10:30 flight. So we get to the gate and they start calling out all the standby passengers, except us. We asked what was going on and the guy didn't even look at us. It was very apparent that we were not getting on that plane. He took Kami and Karli ahead of us, even though we were first on the list. I don't know how that happened. They may have done something behind the scenes that we didn't see.  Marsha: Or maybe he just thought blonds were cuter than brunets. [Laughs]    Ethan: You got on the 11:30 plane instead. Did you have any hope of catching up?     Marsha:  The episode didn't indicate this, but our plane was actually delayed for another 30 minutes. Once we landed, we ran a really quick race. If it wasn't for those 30 minutes, I think we could have caught up to Marshall and Lance. The producers even told us later that we were really close to beating those guys."
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Today at school was a huge mess up. Yes it was P.E. again, and I realised I could actually play Badminton... Well that wasn't really the highlight of the day, because I started to step up my little gameplan.   As I said in the earlier post, I need so badly to step up into Fairplay's shoes. Guess what people? I'm already on to it! I initiated a whole chain of jokes about Mr. Mad Devendran. I'm telling you, by the crowds that surrounded my table, I think I may be even better than I thought.  Today was also the 10th year anniversary for boarding school. Ironic really, that I announce my leaving on this day too. Anyway it seemed like a farewell party all for me. The starters were really great... Prawn salad or something like that. The clam chowder, though a far cry from my mum's standards, was far better than I expected. The rest was ok... until the horrid dessert.  Away from the food, the tiki torches outside really gave me a wierdly comforting feeling. I guess it's because there are now torches for the Survivor: OM in December. Something in the hall really didn't feel right, and it was because I was sitting next to a bunch of people that I used to be comfortable with, but I am not comfortable with anymore. I was sitting with none of my friends cause they were all serving... And I just didn't feel good. I really don't know whether it's because I'm leaving, or because I found that I had no real friends."
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Ok... Singapore just broadcasted ""World Idol"" and I'm wondering why Asians could not vote. Racist people! Anyway only the first 6 people were shown, with the last 5 due next week. So here is my commentary for this week's show.  Ok when the German guy came out I was like ""What were you thinking? With that sleeveless shirt?"" He is quite a good-looking guy though, but his song choice is really bad. Up-tempo songs don't usually go well with the public's taste, and he will not have an audience large enough to win. For his limited English, I would actually say that was good enough, just not enough to win.  The Aussie Idol had a great voice, but his flamboyant style really puts me off. What's worse, he picked a well known song, changed the arrangement totally and destroyed the song. He was like talking melodiously, creepy. For the Pan Arabic Idol, who am I to judge? But anyway all I can say is that I thought her to be very brave but maybe her target audience is not huge enough to win World Idol. Right from one of the judge's mouths, funny he was reading my thoughts...  The Dutch Idol is another super geek turned superstar. And I really like his sense of humour, banking on his geekiness to give him the cool look. And this is emphasised greatly on the spectacles! He was quite good, but not outstanding, and like I said before not outstanding, means not winner. I'm still wondering however, how he got through the second auditions when he forgot his words. I don't think American Idol would have allowed him to.  A law student with a big face. Sy whatever you want but his voice is really good. His performance however really pitchy. I don't know if he uses English frequently, but anyway not good enough to win. But anyway I don't think anyone was paying attention to his pitch problems because of his good looks.   The Polish Idol... Ok, first things first, BRACES? Oh my god, Simon is never going to use the phrase ""Too young for the competition"" anymore. Well obviously she had a lot of pitch problems and an awkward sense of volume control, but like the German judge said, she has a big voice, and an even bigger personality. I love the personality and the dialogue between her and a few of the judges. I especially like the one where one of the judges said something about her being as bad as the Polish judge, and she had a look of pure horror on her face as she answered ""No, not him!""   Hahaha... That's all for today, I'll bring you more next week!"
PYF6X0V,male,23,"The other day I asked my significant other a question that had been bugging me for ages.  "" Ian...""  "" Yes dear...""  "" What if I hadn't told you that I liked you? Would you have told me by now that you did too?""  "" No. I don't believe in spoiling friendships.""  Apparently, he had tried before on some other girls he had liked before & of course... failed.... So just when he thought that it was pointless to even hope or ask at all, I had asked him. God is not without a sense of humour.   My point is- If you live life wondering about the ""What if""s, you might as well try to live it without regretting anything. I mean I'd rather wonder ""What if I hadn't told ian about my feelings?"" then ""What if I had told ian about my feelings?"" ... because believe you me... they take you down 2 totally different paths.  Life is about choices. You can't just sit on the fence.  You fancy your mate, you tell her. You want to study this instead of that, you tell the folks. You don't just sing ""que sera sera what will be will be"" and expect it all to be served right up to you. That is not being positive or optimistic or realistic... that's called FATALISM... Being fatalistic sometimes mean you don't get what you want or deserve. You get what people think you want or you deserve.  I'd rather steer my own ship than let someone else steer it for me. I'd rather charter my own course.  Of course, it is also God willing and all but the thing is you need to be active about choosing and doing stuff... you need to be vocal...  sure things are sometimes about luck and fate and all that BUT every thing in life revolves around CHOICE. You can choose to take or not take the gamble. You can choose to try for the top prize in the Sweeps or to pass on what's possibly the winning ticket because you don't want to give it a shot.  So stop whinning if you don't get that present you've always wanted or the girl you've always fancied if you didn't open your mouth.  Kate Winslet says it best in her song ""What if"" ... "" If I'd stayed... If you'd tried ...If we could only turn back time...  But I guess we'll never know  .""  In choosing to be with ian, i chose to forgo other paths/choices... i was proactive in choosing and taking that jump...  and i am glad i did. I won't know what happened if I hadn't but I am glad that I am not regretting that I hadn't keep quiet because we all know his answer to that question. Grins.  BS   *Love you dearest...*"
PYF6X0V,male,23,"When love beckons to you follow him,   Though his ways are hard and steep.   And when his wings enfold you yield to him,   Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.   And when he speaks to you believe in him,   Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.   For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.   Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,   So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.   Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.   He threshes you to make you naked.   He sifts you to free you from your husks.   He grinds you to whiteness.   He kneads you until you are pliant;   And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.   All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.   But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure,   Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,   Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.   Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.   Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;   For love is sufficient unto love.   When you love you should not say, ""God is in my heart,"" but rather, I am in the heart of God.""   And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.   Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.   But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:   To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.   To know the pain of too much tenderness.   To be wounded by your own understanding of love;   And to bleed willingly and joyfully.   To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;   To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;   To return home at eventide with gratitude;   And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips."
PYF6X0V,male,23,"Then said a rich man, ""Speak to us of Giving.""   And he answered:   You give but little when you give of your possessions.   It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.   For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?   And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?   And what is fear of need but need itself?   Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable?   There are those who give little of the much which they have - and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.   And there are those who have little and give it all.   These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.   There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.   And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.   And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;   They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.   Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.   It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;   And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving   And is there aught you would withhold?   All you have shall some day be given;   Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.   You often say, ""I would give, but only to the deserving.""   The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.   They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.   Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.   And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.   And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?   And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?   See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.   For in truth it is life that gives unto life - while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.   And you receivers - and you are all receivers - assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.   Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;   For to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for mother, and God for father."
PYF6X0V,male,23,"Heigho one and all... we've moved. At last. After an all-nighter packing session which saw my very very exhausted ian falling asleep in a foetal position on the floor after i myself conked out from feeding Kae. Luckily, I woke up at 4.50a.m. and resumed packing hahahaha.  Managed to get the essentials ready. Think I had the most number of cartons for my personals. lol.  The best part of the whole compulsory spring cleaning was that I found a total of around $160 that I had stashed away in bags and pockets and unopened CNY angbaos! I once was broke but now I'm ""found""!  The new place takes getting used to. Whilst dining together, Ian and I felt as if we were at the chalets at East Coast or something. It was probably the scent of BBQ food wafting in the air (our patio faces the BBQ pits), plus the kindof- rustic landscape (well one glorified drain-river and a nature reserve across from us) and the sight of aeroplanes taking off and landing in the sky.  I guess I'm still not used to living in a condo... hahaha. Itz all nice and funny at the same time. As if I were on a long trip away from home aka TPY.   Oh well... once we've settled in, I'm sure it'll be ok ^.^  For now sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep... need it... all of us do... moving house sure is one mad experience..."
PYF6X0V,male,23,"I was listening to the wma files on my Muvo and when it got to this one, I felt so touched. It's a lovely song by John Denver. The CD version I had was sung by a lady and the CD was The Best of Audiophile.  What hit me were the thoughts in brackets as I listened to it:  Perhaps love is like a resting place  A shelter from the storm (Finding Ian was a respite from the choppy waters my life's been) It exists to give you comfort It is there to keep you warm (Ditto... thought of the times Ian's been there when I was suicidal, sad, cold, depressed,...) And in those times of trouble When you are most alone The memory of love will bring you home (whenever i am down, i think of ian and he brings me home... like Dory told Marlin "" When I'm around you...It's like I'm home."")  Perhaps love is like a window Perhaps an open door (ian and i both turned away from ""closed doors/windows"" to find each other. As the saying goes- When God closes a door, he opens the window) It invites you to come closer It wants to show you more (Will you let me do that my dearest?) And even if you lose yourself And don`t know what to do The memory of love will see you through (Nods nods... I hope Ian feels the same)  Love to some is like a cloud (I used to believe in it being ephemeral) To some as strong as steel (Not any more) For some a way of living  For some a way to feel (I live and I feel loved and I give my love... I hope it is enough compared to the abundant love you give me dar') And some say love is holding on  And some say letting go (how true...) And some say love is everything (you are so important to me dearest... u dunno how.) And some say they don`t know  Perhaps love is like the ocean Full of conflict, full of pain (oh yea there will be bad days right? but we'll pull through) Like a fire when it`s cold outside (yea you keep me safe and warm... seeing me home the way you do.) Or thunder when it rains  If I should live forever And all my dreams come true (most of them have the day i found you) My memories of love will be of you (always)  And some say love is holding on And some say letting go And some say love is everything And some say they don`t know  Perhaps love is like the mountains Full of conflict, full of change Like a fire when it`s cold outside Or thunder when it rains If I should live forever And all my dreams come true My memories of love will be of you   Words and music by John Denver"

PYF6X0V,male,23,"And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, ""Speak to us of Children.""   And he said:   Your children are not your children.   They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.   They come through you but not from you,   And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.   You may give them your love but not your thoughts.   For they have their own thoughts.   You may house their bodies but not their souls,   For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.   You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.   For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.   You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.   The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.

XKAXHN1,female,24,urlLink This  is my new favorite website.
XKAXHN1,female,24,"So, we called the plumber back about our sink issue yesterday.  It turns out that sometimes when a plumber does really intense work, such as replacing a bunch of pipes, the disruption can cause rust and deposits to drop into the lines, and when you turn on the water, all of that stuff gets flushed to the end of the faucet, blocking the water flow.  Sure enough, Matt removes the end of the faucet, and there's a bunch of crusty crap in the filter.  This is a good thing to know, considering the calls I get at work!"
XKAXHN1,female,24,"I think that I'm more aware of the people on the bus now that I'm posting my thoughts online...They provide such great material!  Yesterday someone moved from their spot 2 seats down from me, to sit right next to me.  For no particular reason - he didn't even try to start a conversation.  He was a really sweaty bike-rider, and it grossed me out.  This in turn prompted me to hold onto the metal pole, so as not to accidentally bump into ""sweaty biker guy"" if the bus lurched to a stop.  A few moments later, someone else boarded the bus.  We'll call him ""sweat-pants man"".  When ""sweat-pants man"" got on the bus, there were tons of empty seats.  He opted to stand right in front of me, and lean against the pole, in such a way that his ass was  right above my hand .  I was wedged between ""sweaty biker guy"" and ""sweat-pants man"".  Ugh.  Now, I'm not overly sensitive about personal space.  You really can't be on public transportation.  But  c'mon  people!"
XKAXHN1,female,24,"Matt took me to a very nice dinner for my birthday on Saturday.  If you're ever in Seattle and want a treat, go  urlLink here .   We were walking across the street to the restaurant, and I had a highly entertaining conversation with a woman who was walking in the opposite direction:   Her - Nice dress.  Me - Thank you.  Her - You're welcome, Bitch!   The moment that last word exited her mouth, I recognized her.  I looked right at Matt and said, ""Wow!  I've run into her before!  I remember her complimenting me on something, and then calling me a bitch!"".    That moment totally made my birthday."
XKAXHN1,female,24,"Matt and I keep the bedroom door closed, so that the cats don't molest my clothing and bedspread, leaving a trail of cat hair behind. This morning I learned the dangers of having a push-button lock on your bedroom door. We're still trying to figure out who is responsible, but I  do  know one thing: After my shower, I couldn't get dressed because the bedroom door was locked. I tried jamming a pen in the little hole on the outside, and I even tried sliding an old atm card down the space between the door and the frame. Nothing worked. It was time to channel  urlLink MacGyver .  Our house has 2 bedrooms, which sit side by side, and they ""share"" a closet. When you look into the closet for one room, you realize that you're looking at half a closet. You can see over the wooden barrier, into the other half of the closet, and into the other room. I think at one time, the two bedrooms were a walk-thru of sorts.  So, Matt boosted me, wearing only a bathrobe, up to the shelf in the closet of the room that we could still access. I managed to turn myself around so that I wouldn't have to dive face first out of the other side, and did this cramped scoot sortof thing until I got to the other side. I looked down - man that's a ways up for someone who's afraid of heights! I started to slide down, and about halfway there, I realized that if I were to continue, I would end up with a bunch of hangers in my face, which could prove painful. I actually managed to pull myself back up onto the closet shelf, leaned over, and started removing clothing from the closet, and throwing it on the floor. I found a  box  on the shelf, which I proceeded to drop on the floor, so  I  wouldn't have to drop as far. Then I turned around again, and braced my feet on either side of the door frame. I scootched myself down with my feet, until my arms and chin were the only thing holding me to the shelf, then dropped.  It was a good morning."
XKAXHN1,female,24,"An email from Mom:    Later in the day I headed out to the garden to see how it was going. Out came the kids all excited. Adventure Cat was going to have babies and Daddy was having problems. I came back in and found Daniel on his hands and knees trying to extract Adventure Cat from a less than desirable area. We finally, after much coaxing and rearranging convinced her to settle for a better spot. That poor cat had one heck of a time! At one point, shortly before popping the first one out somehow managed to jump out of her box and come looking for me. That poor cat could barely keep her hind end off the floor! She was squatting, having contractions and begging me to help to help her. We managed to get her back in the box then the kids and I took turns keeping her company. Lindsay saw the first two being born and Nathan and I saw the last one being born. A most painful experience for the new Mama. Last night she kept trying to take little breaks but every time she'd take a couple steps away the kittens would start crying. She was actually grumbling (almost a growl) on her way back a couple times. LOL Grrrr, durn kids! She was thrilled to see us all emerge from the bedroom this morning and immediately came out to get us and lead us back to her box so we could take turns keeping her company again."
XKAXHN1,female,24,"I finally broke down and ordered a Frappuccino at Starbucks today. I used to get the vanilla ones on occasion, but I stopped when I was forced to admit to the nutritional value of them. Well, today I decided to try the new vanilla bean creme frappuccino, and wow is it yummy! Remember when you were a kid, and you would eat frosting straight out of the plastic container? Well, I don't. I don't think we ever had store-bought frosting as kids, but I can imagine what it was like. The vanilla bean creme frappuccino is  even better  than eating frosting straight out of the plastic container! (or what I imagine it to be like) Props to Mom for making store bought frosting something that I have to imagine, and props to Starbucks for their tasty beverages!"

XKAXHN1,female,24,"Below is an excerpt from an email that I received from my mother.  She is remarried with two small kids, whom she is teaching to read:     First stop was the cigarette store. Daniel ran in while the kids and I waited in the car. While he was in there a pickup pulled up and parked next to it. It had a decal on the side which Nathan immediately set to reading. ""GGG Go-o-o-od, God! BBB-Bl-Bl-ble-ble-bless,Bless! God Bless! Aa ammm-ammmeee-amerrriiii-amerriic-amerriic-amerriicaaa-America! God Bless America!"" He's an American! Lindsay then chimed in ""He's an American! He has an American car! See! He has an American Flag!"" They were both so excited to be parked next to an American with an American car! When he came out I was tempted to thank him for keeping my kids busy :-)"
XKAXHN1,female,24,"My eight year old nephew is staying at our house for the weekend, and we're having a great time sofar. Last night Justin took a shower before bed, and came out to say goodnight wearing khaki shorts and a button up dress shirt.   Me:  Justin, why are you wearing that?  Justin:  This is what I'm wearing tomorrow.  Me:  I get that, but why are you wearing it now?  Justin:  Mom didn't pack any pajamas for me.  Me:  Huh. Well, you can't be comfortable in that; why don't you wear one of Matt's Tshirts?  Justin:  No, this is fine.  He then proceeded to pull the blankets back and crawl into bed, wearing belt and all. My nephew is a freaky kid.  This morning Justin came out of bed ready made! Matt made blueberry pancakes for breakfast. Afterwards, I mentioned something about brushing teeth, and Justin just looked at me.   Me:  Lemme guess, you're mom didn't pack a toothbrush for you?  Justin:  Yeah! (giggle)  Me:  Well, we just need to pick one up for you today.  Justin:  She packed a sweater for me.  Me:  Yeah, I saw that. A nice knit sweater - perfect for winter, but no toothbrush. Next time I'm sending your mom a checklist."

They have friends who they can share their innermost secrets. Friends whom they can ask about their crushes and maybe have a crush on one of them. I wonder how somebody got to have girl friends, how they become barkada, how they become ease with each other and hang out with each other. I on the other hand had no girl friend. Only acquaintances who know me as the brother of their former schoolmate and batch valedictorian, his brother who did not choose to go to the same school and the guy who is a huge torpe. It is in being a girl friend that one becomes a girlfriend. The long relationship as friends developed into something more intimate and special…   So the practice today was canceled, my glasses are missing, and I\m getting depressed again.

However, if one chooses not to treasure it, then this chance may just slip away... even without one noticing it.  yup yup yup... soooo lots of mix feelings today... haha... all these friendships and interpersonal relationship thingy... can be quite bothering to one's life at times. How do you differentiate between these two issues? hmn~ I think there's no definite answer to this. However, I'll not let it affect me...

On a higher note... as I was walking home I passed by my neighbours house. Then I realised some giglings and some kind of mini 'concert' going on. I saw 4 cute little girls acutally trying to set up a small stage outside their house. Creative enough... they actually used 2 hanger post as barriers. ANd one of these sweetie pies started to sing aloud..."" I'm Falling in Love... di da da da..."" . haha~ but my sudden apearance caused that girl to blush immediately. I pretended not to take notice of them and continued my journey. Then I heard some giglings behind me... when her friends actually asked her why she stopped singing... she went like ""wait a while lah... there's someone...."" Upon hearing this... I could not help it but to burst out in laughter. wahaha... these girls really remind me of my childhood days.  I was no different from them. There I wore my big fluffy ""keng keng"" dress with huge agogo round dangling ear rings... slipped into my mum's high heels... borrowed her lipstick to touch up a little. And there I go... my little mini fashion show. hahaha... okay okay... I know it's pretty lame. But still it was really fun... amusing and 'self entertaining' ... hahhaa =P  Hmn... there's CO tomorrow! haha~ this CCA makes my day most of the time... unless when I'm not in the mood. Not forgetting my CO 'FamiLy'... they are the ones that really brighen up my day. There's this magnetic thing between us that can never pull us apart. Hopefully... we will always remain as united. Hmn... lately did not really have some time for a mini congregation... but I guess some things can be felt. It's felt in the heart and actions can't say it all. Yup...I guess we can understand each other...  Anyway... a super long day tomorrow. Up to 7 plus... goodness me... I think I'm going to fall asleep half way through the rehearsals. Hopefully everything will go on smoothly...  Through this cca... I can see my passion for music growing day by day. Really! I'm proud to be from co. Yesh~ so let's pray that it rains heavily tomorrow too... nice weather to escape from P.E. wahhahaa... that's all then. WIll blog again when I'm free. Really wanna make a chatbox and to load some music onto this blog. Guess I'll try to get it done asap... ciao~"
LB1DE6M,female,17,DisaPpointed... forget it... I'm sick of everything.
LB1DE6M,female,17,"hehe... finally managed to squeeze out some time to blog. Have been waiting for the mood to come by... Anyway yes.. Lately alot of things have been occurring simultaneously. So I'm trying to balance things up a little and to try and keep up or to even increase the momentum. Did some serious self reflection too... to see how I can improve myself.  However, that's besides the point. Recently I made some new friends. That's interesting~ hee... these ppl didn't look friendly in the first place, but surprisingly they made the first move in approaching me. So, as usual... I'm definitely ready to reciprocate to this friendship! haha... =P This shows us that we should never judge the book by it's cover yah?  hmn... feeling slightly better too... guess I've learned that we should try to let things go at times. By accumulating them bit by bit... I'll never be able to handle them. It's just too much to worry about. Sometimes, by worrying too much about every little single thing... we tend to forget the most important stuff that we have yet to handle. So... we should try not to allow our overwhelming emotions affect us too much. All these should be set aside for the time being. I believe there will be plenty of time to solve all these problems later.  Feeling more lerthagic than usual lately... I'm not sure why either. Maybe I should try to synchronise my body clock again...  I've lots of questions in my head too... but I guess the answers will come by as time passes..."
LB1DE6M,female,17,"..:.. endless road ..:.. (By JJ)       the truth is tearing up my heart i can't recognize this place the endless road without a stop sign can't even find a stranger this time...   why am i still holding back my tears in this loneliness there's nothing to fear every chord still seems a wonder how we could be together every time i ask if this would be the last...   why am i still talking to myself hoping that you will have the keys to my cell every song might calm the weather but it draws me deeper how do i get out of this i think i never will...   a crystal forming in the eye maybe this would be the last the winding path down my face till i begin to taste the bitterness inside...   why am i still holding back my tears in this loneliness there's nothing to fear every chord still seems a wonder how we could be together every time i ask if this would be the last...   why am i still talking to myself hoping you will have the keys to my cell every song might calm the weather but it draws me deeper how do i get out of this   i think i never will...     Hmn... just bought this cd by JJ. Wonderful music...by chance I found this song. The last track of the cd. It was 'love at first sight' kind of thing when I heard this song. haha... it can really describe my present feelings... my thoughts... my troubles and everything. The lyrics say it all...  Have been feeling really down lately... guess I'm quite a weak person.. although I keep reminding myself to stay strong regardless of any setbacks I face or any problems that comes into my way. However still... I can't help it. A person who drops tears easily... that's all I can say. But I'll recover... I'll stand up again. I will show them that I can make it. I will exceed their expectations of me. I'll tolerate everything... I'll definitely pull through.  Another pondering qns... is it wrong to accept the love and care from another person knowing that you may not be able to return the same amount. I know that such things cannot be measured... but in this case isn't love unfair? Or we should always shower our love unconditionally? there's a weird feeling running through me lately... Although I'm a perfectionist... but I realised that the world is not so perfect after all. I can try to make it one... but it takes 2 hands to clap and not everything will go according to your wishes. No one is perfect... yes... true. However... have I found the one that seems so perfect? Well, time MAY tell... I believe that alot of things are felt and words can never express it any better..."
LB1DE6M,female,17,"Drowning sadness...sinking heart. Experiencing some domestic conflicts lately. Feeling quite upset but all I can do is to tolerate and to swallow down this unhappiness. I wonder why can't they understand me better?    Anyway... I'm having lots of complicated feelings recently. I'm a little confused... Sometimes... I think that there's no point waiting for the answer to my qns... it's really testing my patience and I'm tired of it. Maybe I should try to accept the love and care another is willing to shower on me... or maybe I should persevere and wait for time to tell... these things are happening too quickly... too fast for me to comprehend.  My heart is a little lost too...  However, I think that  this could be part and parcel of our life... and inexplicable feelings just pop by... I believe that I'll be able to walk out of it soon.... yes."
LB1DE6M,female,17,"Our life revolves around love... true? I believe so...   Sometimes, I wonder it's better to be loved more than you love the person or it is better to be the other way round? Many people often say that it's better to experience the former... I used to think so too. However, sometimes I think that I may experience the latter in a relationship. I guess when one is in a relationship, alot of time and effort is needed to maintain it. But when do you ever know that you are ready for it? How do you know that he is the right one for you? Are you willing to give the other party a chance? Is it a risk in the first place? Or if you really like someone, are you brave enough to make the first move? I guess these all some common questions that lots of us who are less experienced ponder on.      Personally I feel that feelings is such an ambiguous thing. It's subjective thus there's no definite defination to it. It's something difficult to juggle at times... However I think that feelings will live with us throughout our life, so it's something we cannot escape from. It can be something that we live for too.      Sounds scary yah? But I think it's quite true. All these emotions and feelings will help to mould one's character... which makes up the most of us. ""Feelings"" is so powerful that we are controlled by it unknowingly at times. So should learn to control it well.     Anyway, I  have been experiencing lots of mood swings. Alot of things puzzles me at times. And words can't express it all...     Whatever it is... troubles and unanswered qns will always linger around... so perhaps it's a normal thing. Guess no one is trouble-free right? hee~   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Had CO performance on Friday night!!! hehe~ what a roaring success it was. Oh yah~ I received a rose from my senior! so sweet~ it's definitely a pleasant surprise! haha... thanks for all the support [=*_*=]    I felt quite nervous on stage initially. But what deterioriated it was the freezing cold surrounding. Gosh~ I could feel it penetrating into me like a thousand needles... giving me 'frost bites' everywhere. haha~ okay okay that's a little exaggerated. But still, my teeth was already chattering badly. haha...     Yup... what a wonderful day. However the sad thing is that shi jie will be leaving co then. I'll definitly miss her presence! But I believe that will still be lots of time for us to congregate again. We have our whole life! so no worries... all the best in whatever you do! Must take care...      Yesh! Friends are very important to me... especially those close ones.(u know who you are... =P) yeah... although I don't say it often, but still... You guys are very VERY important to me k!!! *shouts* haha... will treasure you all!"

LB1DE6M,female,17,"60 plus is what he is at the point of this time in his life. Today, then I realised how much he had aged over the years. Going through thick and thin with us and being the head of the family. I'm glad to say I have such a wonderful him around. Although domestic conflicts do occur all the time... and I would say that it is like a daily affair... but through these misunderstandings and disagreements, we have got to know each other better. Do not think that within your own kins... you do not need to make the special effort to understand them better... actually the truth is that they are probably the ones whom we have always been taking for granted and we may tend to neglect them subconsciously. Sometimes he makes me cry... but I know the reason why. That's not a need for him to say much when he is annoyed or unhappy with me. A few words... a little change in his facial expression will send the message clearly right to the bottom of my heart. I realise how important my dad is to me...   He was there to guide me along and I can proudly say that I'm glad to be from the Leong Family. I really do not know how long all this time and precious moments will last (not as though I'm trying to be pessismistic)... the fact is, life is definitely unpredictable. We do not know what will happen next. Only someone of a higher power up there have things planned for us... what we can do, is to try to comprehend them and to deal it with the best of our ability. My dad just told me something today... which I felt truly touched... he said"" Let me fetch you when it's late... I do not know how much longer I can do so.""   Of course upon hearing this... I said all those stuff like 'touch wood!' and all. He tried to rectify his statement by saying that he may be going overseas soon... but anyway the point here is, whether I misinterpretated his remark or not... what he said had really struck something in my mind. Guess it's time I really learn to spend more quality time with them... and to manage time better so that I will have enough to spent with my studies and my love ones (family and friends...and all).   Although we don't say it often but as long as you sincerely use your heart to listen... you can definitely feel the love those dear ones around you are showering you with. There are times we feel very insecure... very uncomfortable... very lonely... but as these fears accumulate in us... it will gradually subside because we know that there's someone always there for u to give u the moral support! yup... had the sudden inspiration to write all these after hearing what my dad told me. yeah! He is my role model... and I try to remember the precious advices he gives me each time... hopefully things will continue to sail smoothly... =P Hee~"
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"I have really bad timing.  Like when to oversleep.  I was supposed to be at work an hour ago, but didn't wake up until 12:45.   Joe  is there right now.  I feel like shit because I was up all night working on this new blog.  I still have to get in the shower and leave for work.  I wish I was the cat.   Spencer  is just relaxing now.  Screw him."

8ZVKKWF,female,23,"Yea.  That was number four on my search strings for my webstats.  What the hell??         See what I mean??  Very odd.  Today is the first day of my three day weekend and I am sickly again.  I was supposed to go to cemetary today, but that is out of the question.  My eye was glued shut when I woke up.  I hope it's not pink eye because that would royally suck.  I am hungry.  I don't think there is any food in the house though.  I hate that.  Sorry I am being so random ADD like.  I have a lot on my mind.  Well I am going to get going.  I want to do something.  Something other than type."

Bake at 375 degrees until fully aggravated. Serve.  Now you can have your cake and eat it too.
8ZVKKWF,female,23,There’s a letter on the desktop That I dug out of a drawer The last truce we ever came to In our adolescent war And I start to feel the fever From the warm air through the screen You come regular like seasons Shadowing my dreams  And the mississippi’s mighty But it starts in minnesota At a place that you could walk across With five steps down And I guess that’s how you started Like a pinprick to my heart But at this point you rush right through me And I start to drown  And there’s not enough room In this world for my pain Signals cross and love gets lost And time passed makes it plain Of all my demon spirits I need you the most I’m in love with your ghost I’m in love with your ghost  Dark and dangerous like a secret That gets whispered in a hush (don’t tell a soul) When I wake the things I dreamt about you Last night make me blush (don’t tell a soul) And you kiss me like a lover Then you sting me like a viper I go follow to the river Play your memory like a piper  And I feel it like a sickness How this love is killing me I’d walk into the fingers Of your fire willingly And dance the edge of sanity I’ve never been this close I’m in love with your ghost  Unknowing captor You never know how much you Pierce my spirit But I can’t touch you Can you hear it A cry to be free Oh I’m forever under lock and key As you pass through me  Now I see your face before me I would launch a thousand ships To bring your heart back to my island As the sand beneath me slips As I burn up in your presence And I know now how it feels To be weakened like achilles With you always at my heels  This bitter pill I swallow Is the silence that I keep It poisons me I can’t swim free The river is too deep Though I’m baptized by your touch I am no worse than most In love with your ghost  You are shadowing my dreams (in love with your ghost)

8ZVKKWF,female,23,"So I spent 70 bucks on albums when I was on iTunes.  I have been turned on to some great music as of late.  It all started with Postal Service.  Postal Service's CD ""Give Up"" is a must own for anyone.  I mean it is one of the few CDs where I love every single song.  Truly amazing shit.  Postal Service was formed when the lead singer of another great band Death Cab for Cutie got together with Jimmy Tamborello of Dntel.  The called the band Postal Service because they recorded everything through the mail.  Everyone should buy this album now!!!  Another great Indie band is Architechture in Helsinki.  They mix brass with great vocals and percussion.  Very mellow and chill.  Finally there is Belle & Sebastian.  Same mellow kind of tones.  Leave comments of bands you think deserve a download and I'll check them out!  :-)"
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"Yea.  I said I was going to be typing a lot.  I inadvertently lied.  Work has been so hectic and crazy these past two days this is the first moment I have gotten to sit and actually gather my thoughts.  I am sick still.  I am such an idiot.  I stop taking the antibiotics once I feel better.  I need to finish out the entire course of them.  I will begin that tomorrow.  I have a mystery rash on my chest.  I don't know where it came from, but it's weird.  I thought it might be and allergic reaction to my meds, but alas, it's still there.  If that doesn't clear up, off to the doctor I go for more prodding.  I swear.  I need to take better care of myself.  So how have all of you been?  Good I hope.  I have been downloading shitloads of music off of iTunes.  It is really amazing and for any of you who don't own an iPod, go get one.  Now.  I will give you $20 towards one if you take that money and actually go and get it.  I am serious.  I think everyone on this planet should have one.  I have over 900 songs on mine and still have ten gigs left.  That's a lot!  Well I am off to go download some more music, so leave your comments and suggestions as always.  Which is never lately so get posting!  I will type more later when I am not so bajang."

8ZVKKWF,female,23,"My visit went well today.  I had a pretty good rapport going with the RM and ZVP.   Joe  was being a jerk.  I know what I have to fix.  Just let me do it.  I took a three hour nap before.  It felt good to just relax.  Now on to my topic today.  People.  It's funny how when someone gets called out on their shit, someone who is exposed for their true intentions, acts so differently like nothing ever happened.  You know what I mean.  It's like night and day.  First they live in their fantasy world.  Then it's back to fucking reality like their little ""fantasy"" never existed.  You know it's there.  It's like an old saying my therapist once told me.  There's an elephant in the room and nobody wants to talk about it.  I learned a lesson yet again from all of this.  Don't give yourself to somebody when  you don't even know what they are going to do with you.  I miss  Danielle .    She is in the Poconos right now.  Lucky her.  My vacation is the first week in August.  I have no idea what I am going to do.  I know one thing.  I am not going into work at all!  I am going to wrap this one up for tonight.  I think I am going to play some video games to get my mind off shit.  Comment or something!"
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Number of days until my thesis draft is due: 25.    Semester 1, Week 4, Day 4.    Classes today.  I am printing out one of the articles for Value Theory.  Discovered the printer works better if I take the cover off (it is having trouble sucking up the paper) but I need to supervise it to make sure it doesn't re-suck what it just printed on.  Which is less frustrating for some reason that it printing a few sheets and then going offline.  As soon as it finishes printing I will go to uni, get some food, go to class.  I need to read the second article for Animals Minds still, but I don't think it will happen before class.  Number of words I anticipate writing on my thesis today: 0.  But this isn't too detrimental because I was very productive yesterday.  My thesis is looking so much healthier and I still have many ideas that need to go in it and many connections to draw (write about.)    Oops, just got distracted my blog and had to rescue a bit of paper, sacrificing two pages in the process.  I don't understand printers.  Disgruntled creatures.  I guess I'll let you know how classes go after I have them...  Invention for the day: Toothpaste that doubles as lip balm."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Yesterday.   I watched a lot of cricket.  I also watched  Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion  while waiting until 11:00 for the cricket.  They go to their 10 year reunion.  It's 2004.  I finished high school in 1994.  And what am I?  A philosophy student.  I think I'd be making something up too.  Something believable.  Something like, ""I'm a Analyst Programmer for a multi-national corporation... no wait! I quit that job.  Nope, sorry.  I'm a philosophy student.""   Today.   Less cricket.  Mostly in doctors waiting room.  Went to the doctors to have check up and potential fibre glass cast - as recommended by doctor on Friday.    He wasn't happy about something on the x-ray, (might be additional fractures or just a glitch).  So I have to have another couple of x-rays (including my right hand for comparison) and see him on Thursday.  At this rate I could become Fallout Boy! He took off the cast by cutting it twice and manipulated my hand for about half an hour and compared it to the right hand a lot.  I now have two sore wrists.    In the mean time my arm is now in the same old plaster cast with new padding and a bandage wrapped around it.  Joy.  At least it's firm - before I could move my arm up and down the cast by a good inch.  Tomorrow I go to have x-rays.  Thursday back to doctors.  On the plus side, if it's just the little fracture that the x-ray shows for sure, I may just have to have a splint - there is no need for the cast.  If, on the other hand I have additional fractures, it's bad bad news.

Recently   More of the same... few less snoozes.  My big news is that I have written thesis like words.  About 1500 of them.  My thesis topic is coming into creation.  When last asked what it was I responded:  ""I am postulating that Lucretius is the true Avatar of Love and has a theory that is so original and has such great explanatory power that it has escaped the minds of philosophers throughout the ages.

6DJZE6K,female,26,"I'm at Dave's place and his speakers for the computer aren't even here, so I decided not to bother trying to get music going.  At least he has a heater.  After I wrote yesterday, I went home and re-read Brown and worked a little on my synopsis.  Then food, aerobics, more food, bed.   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 2.   Got up at 8:00 and walked into uni (which takes about 25 minutes).  Chatted to Dirk about Brown and Nussbaum.  I think he is feeling a bit guilty that he's as lost as I am.  He keeps saying that if he was a good supervisor he'd be suggesting all this stuff to read and suggesting questions to ask to base my thesis on.  That he doesn't recommend things to read is okay, because I am so over reading.  I never want to read again.  I have so much reading to do.  Met Dave at uni and went and had lunch with him.  Went home and worked on my synopsis for like almost an hour and a half before giving up.  I am sending it to Dirk to read so he can comment and I can edit.  I should have done this two weeks ago.  I read it this time and it didn't seem so bad.  Eek!  It's supposed to be 3000, it's 4400 and I think I've got to add about 250 for it to be complete....  I used to be so precise in what I wrote.  I think I may have read more than I can summarise (bitten off more than I can chew).  Now I'm here typing this.  I am going to send off my email to Dirk with my draft.  The last paper (of 5) isn't finished yet and has big ""Under Construction"" warnings around it.  I meant to do it today/tomorrow.  But I have to re-read one of the chapters in Soble (about 30 pages) and... and... and I just can't.  Okay?  So instead I am going to trawl through the database for any journal articles on Lucretius and love.  Main problem is that there is lots of Classical works on Lucretius and love (like Brown, really he's a classical scholar... anyone with that kind of knowledge of Latin must be) but not many philosophical works.  Which could be good, means I can write about stuff without treading over trodden ground.  To write boldly where no philosopher has written before.  I don't mind writing.  It's better than reading.  Only problem is that if I find journal articles I might have to read them.  It's my brain, it's full.  Overflowing.   Pop !  (Or should that be  splat ?)

6DJZE6K,female,26,"Cigarettes - 0 Alcohol Units - 0 Weight - Once a day, just before or after shower.  In an effort to stop sounding like Ms Jones, I have decided to use the first person singular pronoun a little more.  Last night I couldn't be bothered going to bed (as I have to invest a lot of energy into heating the sheets) so I stayed up and watched James Bond videos (Tomorrow Never Dies and The Living Daylights).  After I had heated my snuggle blanket (a small flannelette patchwork number made by my mother) with my body heat and the heater (which can only heat the lounge) I took that to bed with me and went to bed about midnight.  This may seem a little weird and lazy, but you have to understand that I have recently taken a voluntary redundancy from my job of about three years.  (Incase you are aliens, I will explain.  Voluntary Redundancy is where they (them that you work for) give you a lot of money not to work anymore and you'd be mad not to take it, because who wants to work anyway.  Unless of course you have a mortgage or are bad at your job and think that no-one else will give you money for being bad at work.)  Great, now I just sound like Ms Mole.  (Kylie Mole, from the Commedy Company, big hit show in the late eighties that I was allowed to stay up and watch even though it was a school night.)  (School is where you work and they don't pay you at all, but you learn a lot.  A School Night is betweeen Sunday and Thursday where you have school the next day.  It is also an excuse your parents give for not letting your friends stay over.  ""No, not on a School Night,"" they'd say.  This meant that Friday night was the best night in the world.  Obviously you wouldn't have your friends over on Saturday night because then you would have to miss them between school and Saturday morning, plus there was Church on Sunday mornings....)  Anyway (where was I) ah, yes.  So I have been staying up late and getting up later.  I am beginning to have a little bit of sympathy for people who seem to become instantly nocturnal as soon as the weekend or any kind of holidays roll around.  Good for them.  Personally, I like seeing the sun and if we ever have some in Melbourne again, it would be just great.  At least Melbourne weather is currently better than Perth.  WE'RE not having hurricanes and unlike Adelaide, WE'RE not having floods.  I saw on the news that the drought was over.  Maybe I'll be able to wash the bugs off my car now.  Bugs on my car (quick explanation) - After being paid lots of money to leave my job a friend and I drove to Perth (we avoided the hurricanes and flooding, but it was a little cold sometimes.)  Perth is a LONG way away from Melbourne.  We drove 8626 km in twelve days and my little car collected lots of little bugs in the front of it.  Hopefully there are no dead roo remains around my wheels.  Ew.  (My friend and travelling companion on this epic journey, Jeanie (the Jeans), kindly removed the bird feathers from the grill after I ran into a bird.  RIP little birdy.)    Run over the birds and what do you get?  Flat birds!  So, now I'm doing a lot of nothing.  Which is great.  Not entirely accurate.  I have applied to do Honours in Philosophy (a bit of an about face from what my Computer Science degree got me) which will go for a year and live off the buckets of money they gave me not to work anymore.  Invention for the day: Coating similar to teflon on front of cars that facilitates very dead bugs being wiped off really easily rather than cooking on the front of your car and the number plate."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"An Indefinate Wednesday    It's comforting to know that although 1/7 of your life is Monday, 1/14 of it is Friday night and another 1/14 is Saturday night.  Yay!  But when every day is like the weekend, except none of your friends are around (they seem to go to work...) you still have something to look forward to.  I had a spell at cleaning some of the things that weren't going to be packed - such as the bathroom, kitchen floor, bits of carpet.  On the weekend Benji and I had moved a smaller temporary fridge into the kitchen so that the older (in the been there longer sense of older), larger, fridge could be moved without disrupting Hannah's food, who's staying a bit longer.  Anyway, turns out that many things will come off walls with a damp sponge.  However the larger fridge is a rusty hunk o junk.  Went to clean the layer of slime that had developed under the rotter (aka vege crisper, but nothing gets crisper in there!  You should have seen the sentient life I had to dispose of!  Actually, it wasn't too bad.)  Spent some of today researching fridges.  So I went to The Goody Guys and Retrovision.  Retrovision was very helpful and not too pushy (I played my ""must discuss with fiance"" card to new shames to leave and have a think) but the Good Buys almost completely ignored me.  The first time I was there, the guy only asked if he could help when I stuck my head in between him and a fridge while he was talking to someone else and the second time no one even said Hi.   Maybe it's too aggressive to front up to a shop with a catalogue and a pen and paper, but if a purchase is more than say $50 and is not clothes/shoes related, it's worth shopping around for.  (Retrovision will give me free delivery, planning on going back tomorrow.)  I thought one where the fridge would be on top would be ideal (I also wanted one that's left handed, open fridge with left hand, remove milk with right makes sense to me!)  But they're more expensive than ""normal"" fridges... and don't get as many stars (chew up more power).  This seemed a bit odd at first, seeing cold air sinks, so surely you would want the freezer at the bottom.  But I figure that normal fridges work by freezing air and letting it sink.  Must must must get frost free!!!  Also minor dilemna over old fridge, but new municipality is having a hard rubbish collection day in early August.  But as it's technically my brother's fridge, I shall contact him first.  Invention for the day:  Self cooling food.  Duh."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Thing I have done.   Reduced the number of times I use the word ""consider"" from 93 to 20.  Phew.  Such replacements include:  Assert, claim, say, state, think.  (I have also taken Simon Keller's comments into account.)   Things to do:   1.  Be more charitable to Nussbaum by outlining the ""mystery"" in the dignity account nicely.  (Vomit.) 2.

6DJZE6K,female,26,"Weekend Alcohol Units: Far too many and enough to make Alex proud.  (Mmmm, Black Russians.)  (WARNING Lists)  I woke up in a bit of a panic this morning.  (This may have been to do with the fact that I kept dreaming I was Hitler's daughter after watching that stupid miniseries on seven last night.  I won't be watching the conclusion because there are better things on tv plus I will be going to aerobics.)  I have decided that as there is less than a week until Semester starts, I'd better get my butt into gear.  Fast.  Made a list of what I want to achieve.  Have already crossed off several items and it's only lunch time Monday.  So far I have:  Made list (bonus item) Bought a computer chair (yes, it is purple.)  It has arms and swivvels and is adjustable and not bad for $125. Bought tea, milk, bread Found my car keys (they were in the bags from Adelaide which I should unpack) Handed in my boots (my fave books) to be repaired.  They'll be ready on Wednesday.  They need new heels (again.)  At present I am working on: Blog and check mail  I tried to: Look up time table  But it occurs to me that the philosophy deptartment will have its own time table and I should go check with them.  Unfortunately I am finding going to uni a bit of a pain and this is while there is free parking!  What am I going to do DURING semester when I will have to walk (coz I am not paying for parking - I can't justify it).  I am thinking I should ride my bike because it will be much quicker and it is all down hill (on the way back) but it does require things like:  Carrying helmet (doesn't fit neatly into bag) Tucking pants into socks to prevent greasing pants Helmet hair (less of an issue as my hair gets longer) Dealing with securing bike  My list also has things like: Read abstracts from Metaphysics book Read Nussbaum (she is an author who is writing about Epicurus and Lucretius).  Nussbaum has led me to only one conclusion so far: That being prolific is not a virtue. Fix bike seat (it's too low) and attach lights (which I took off to go on  urlLink Bicycle Victoria 's Great Vic Bike Ride so they wouldn't get nicked) but the problem is that my handle bars are too short to have all the neat stuff I want to put on them.  You know?  Two hand grips, one bell, one set of gear changers (one on each side, one spedometer, one light)  Invention for the day:  Computer chairs where the arms automatically contract when you swivvel them under your desk so they don't make your whole desk move and you don't knock over your ""Cubicle Sweet Cubicle"" sign.  Very important."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Height: Hopefully the same as usual, but who can tell these days. Weight: Don't know, didn't think of it.  Was distracted by some deep thoughts that didn't concern the amount of matter I consist of. Pages of Nussbaum read: 20, plus some scanning to find a quote I was sure existed but failed to find.  Today I have not watched tv (yet).  I have discovered (re-discovered) Civilization.  It's a great game that fits on two floppy disks.  My highest score ever is 123% and I challenge you all to beat that.  Just so you have some hope, you need to be on King Level with 7 Civilizations.  Evil laughter.  I have not done a lot today and it can be summarised quite briefly:  Slept crap, up at 10:30 Played Civ until laptop crashed (was going quite well too) Had shower Read Nussbaum until finished chapter Went into uni and borrowed book (and re-borrowed Nussbaum).  Thanks to Hannah for initial borrowing of Nussbaum. Went to Dave's and updated blog  Who knows what the future holds.  You can't change it.  Saw this recently - in Adelaide at Philosophy Conference (from Prof J C C Smart)  ""Think you can change the future, raise you left hand or your right hand"". Raise a hand.  ""Have you changed the future?  No, that's in the past.""  I am becoming more and more convinced of presentism and relativism, for time.  But I don't know how this relates to space yet.  In case you are aliens (or not very philosophical) I will explain:   Presentism  is just that only the present exists.  So Napoleon doesn't exist, but he did and Prince Williams children don't exist (but they might). (As opposed to  Four-Dimensionalism , which is what Prof Smart is, I think.  That is just that space-time exists constantly in four dimensions - people argue about it because it tends to lend itself to a static universe (if the future exists you can't change it)).   Relativism  is just that thing that Einstein goes on about with trams and clocks and the speed of light.  (Time is relative to the observer).  (As opposed to  Absolutism  which is what Newton might have been and his little minion Clarke had big words with Leibniz.  Newton and Leibniz were having a fight about who had  priority  on calculus ( priority  is pretty much who published it first and therefore ""discovered"" it) but why they got so nasty about space is beyond me.   I reckon Newton was annoyed because of the Rise of the Apples*.  If he had called it something better than ""method of fluxions"" people might have taken him more seriously and students wouldn't be making fart jokes during his lectures.)  See  urlLink Newton vs Leibniz  Celebrity Death Match (not in clay).  *Rise of the Apples:  What happens to nasty vegetarians when the Civilization of the Apples began to fall (one fell onto Newton) and then the Apples took their revenge by rising against people who refused to eat meat.

04D7121,female,23,"throughout my life, people have asked me whether i get lonely being an only child, and i always told them that i've never really experienced loneliness. i was being completely honest because i was content with and fulfilled by my own little biosphere of intimate friends and loving parents. in innocence and ignorance, i was easily-amused, easily-satisfied. then one day, i carelessly tossed it all away and became someone that i don't know and can't quite reconcile with yet. and now, even though i'm experiencing more things and surrounding myself with more ppl than ever before, i feel really lonely for the first time in my life.   a line from the bell jar:   I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of the tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.  i feel like a huge gaping void has been born into my life, and because i don't know what else to do, i continue to do the exact thing that created it in the first place. it's like the biblical analogy of the garden of eden. once you take from the tree of knowledge and bite into the forbidden fruit, what you lose can never be retrieved. you are aware of your nakedness for the first time, and your first instinct is to find cover and cower in shame. i guess this is what happens when ppl go from one extreme to the other. the question is: how far can the penduluum swing before the ball goes careening off into space?   i am trying really hard to find the lessons that i'm supposed to be gleaning from all this. all that i've come up with so far is that people are not that different from one another after all. no matter what you look like, how you dress, how old you are, where you're from, what you do, what you've experienced, beneath it all, deep down, we are subject to the same blueprint as human beings. ultimately, we are insecure creatures, subject to moments of vulnerability and weakness, and we all want to be loved and accepted. it is the hackneyed fallibility of the human condition, but for the first time in my life, i'm coming to realize the truth of it and really, really starting to believe in it.   everyone has needs, whether they be physical or emotional. i am not beyond that. i can no longer categorize ppl into the ""good"" and the ""bad,"" because if i were to do so, i wouldn't be sure where to place myself. despite my aggrievement, i can find no contempt in my heart, not for anyone else and not for myself. i think there is always a legitimate reason for why someone is the way they are and why they do what they do. i call this my jean-valjean theory, and adhering to it is a simple means to my own salvation. deep down inside of everyone, i know that there is a good heart, even if they themselves do not believe so. no matter how chipped or broken, i truly believe that there is always a way to mend it.   i wish i could form a coalition of healing and recovery from the shock of self-discovery. i want to tell ppl who are just as lost as me, and i truly believe that almost everyone is or will be at some point in their lives, that i understand, because in the past few days, these are the simple words of compassion that i've been craving. i just want someone to embrace me emotionally and to say to me that they understand what i am feeling, even if i'm not so sure about it myself.  i feel like life is a game of pinball. as a player, you should be able to guide the course of the ball while working with some immutable power like physics and gravity so that what appears to be chance collisions is actually the result of skillful manuevering. somewhere along the line, an anomaly occurred in the game and the ball with my name on it hit a wrong button that sent it bouncing offcourse. i can only wait and watch with numbness as the ball meanders through all the wrong channels before i am able to flip it back up. this is the best way i know how to describe what it feels like to momentarily lose control.  somebody once told me that i need to stop dreaming and start living. i've definitely started doing a lot more of the latter, but i am extremely saddened by the concurrent loss of the former. my second question of the day is: is it not possible for dreaming and living to exist in conjunction with one another?"

MNJEEKW,female,26,"Just the other day, I saw 2 primary school boys smoking and swearing. Profanities were all over the place.   There was another time, I saw a very young girl (think she is barely 5 years old) shouting “I hate you!” at her own mother.  How many times have we seen children behaving like little rascals? Worse when you find their parents to be the grown up versions of their children?   I was brought up in an environment where we were told to be respectful, courteous, and considerate. My parents believe that you have to teach the right values when the children are young by setting the examples. Pretty much like the Chinese proverb, 上梁不正下梁歪，if the upper beam is crooked, the lower beam will not be straight. Children, after all, have impressionable minds.  Let me share my experience with you. When I was coaching part time in a neighbourhood secondary school during university days, I made it a point to be there 10 or 15 mins early to ensure that things are in order. My players however, seem to like wasting my time, always strolling in 5 or 10 mins late, sometimes, more than half an hour. They were like a bunch of monkeys, ill-disciplined and inconsiderate. I had a hard time pulling the kids together, especially the 15 yr olds. Being their coach, I had the chance to speak to some of their parents and there was this striking resemblance, which was unfortunately, not limited to the looks. You know, someone once said, “For rarely are sons similar to their fathers; most are worse, and a few, are better than their fathers.” I think it’s quite true.  I tried all ways, from scolding to persuading to denying them the chance to represent their school, in order to instill discipline. I had to resort to strict ground rules. One of the rules I had, was that they have to apologise to everyone if they were late. Likewise, MC has to be produced if they are sick.   I remember a girl who was giving me particularly more problems than the rest of the girls. She was one of the better players, yet she would either turn up late, or go missing in action. After the rules were set, she was missing for 1 week and when she came back, she was late. In fact, she sashayed in 45 minutes into the training session. Obviously, I waited for her MC and apologies but she didn’t produce any of those. I was pretty irritated by then. The conversation then went something like this:  Me: Why are you late?  Her: Overslept.  Me: What happened to u last week? Her: Sick. Me: Haven’t you forgotten something? Where’s your MC? Her: What?  Me: Didn’t I say if you are sick, you need to give me your MC and if you are late, you have to apologise to the team? She kept quiet and stared defiantly at me. Furious, I lashed out.  Me: Where is the basic courtesy? Don’t you have my number? Why didn’t you call me? Why do you think I give my number to you? For fun? If you know you can’t wake up in the mornings, you jolly well go to bed earlier the night before! If you are not interested to come on time, why should I waste my time and everybody else’s time to go through what I’ve taught again? Since you want to behave like a princess, you can go home now. I don’t need a princess in the team.  With that I turned back to the rest of the team and continued coaching. She shouted from behind, saying that I was being biased and she was not in the wrong. I couldn’t be bothered. The rest of the players suddenly behaved more like human beings. Guess what? The following week, she was early! In fact, everyone was there earlier than I was! She apologized to me sheepishly saying that after thinking about it, she realised I was right and she decided to be punctual for all the trainings.  Be it parents, mentors, teachers, or friends, we are all influential people in some ways, believe it or not. It is very important to set an example and to lead by example, whether you like it or not.  I have seen parents with children in tow, jumping restaurant queues, being rude to elderly and punctuate every sentence with a profanity, sometimes a whole string of them. Imagine how the kids will grow up to be! A friend, who incidentally is a discipline master in a school, smokes like a chimney, gets drunk every weekend and does the most absurd things.   In summary, children and in fact, every single one of us pick up things very fast especially the not so good ones. We should try and set good examples for the people around us. A gracious society? Or a malicious environment? I’ll leave it to you to decide for yourselves."

MNJEEKW,female,26,"It used to be this way.   Doors wide open, children running in and out of the house, chasing after cackling hens, laughing merrily.   Women chatting in the open air kitchen, with the aroma of freshly cooked dinner filling the air, occasionally yelling at the one or 2 children who messed up the place.   Men sat by the table drinking ice cold beer, talking about the work day that just passed. That sheer warmth and joy of feeling free… that sense of community.  Nobody worried about anything...  That was simplicity. That was innocence. That, was life. But somewhere down the line, life changed.   People sealed up their homes and replaced the warm home with a cold house.   People stopped smiling at others and when they talk, they talk behind others’ backs.   The world suddenly became more dangerous. Unkind thoughts sneaked into our minds. The sense of community eroded and things became complicated.  Slowly, people started to feel the difference and tried to make up for the difference by filling their lives with more activity. Planning, organizing, goal-setting… and then, stress crept in.   People became so stressed out, that life would whiz past them, without them even knowing.   Emptiness became like a black hole. It just kept sucking life out of them, never returning a single cent.  Title chase became a norm, and soon people were “killing” each other, over the search for power, and money.   After that title chasing, tiredness overcame people, and some shrewd businessmen came up with the idea of stress management.   The businessmen built beautiful resorts and came up with fancy stress management tactics like reflexology and spas.   They painted pictures of flowing water, soothing sounds and beautiful sunsets to people.   They created that vision which many looked forward to. It was a paradise. And the people were sold to that idea of a paradise.   The price, however, was not cheap. Therefore, people went into the vicious cycle of finding more money to find more calm. Greed took over and people became slaves to money.  It became a status symbol, to buy that lifestyle that was once available to them. The lifestyle that was innocent, charming and full of laughter. What an irony!  The things that people took for granted, became a luxury. People lost sight of who they really were. People lost track of what life was all about.   One fine day, they came to the end of their lives, and realized with a rude shock that their lives were nothing and have full of regrets.  If any of those things strike home for you, it’s time to take stock, and go back to the basics.   Before I end, I just have something for you. In Buddhist monasteries, it was the cook’s duty to make the most sumptuous meal possible out of whatever ingredients that was available, rather than complaining about what he didn’t have.   Life, is what happens to you, when you are busy making other plans."

764TLFV,male,26,"Not for me, luckily. No the 15 minutes of fame belongs to my new friend Edward. It's not every day that you can read about Mongolia on BBC's website. Actually I check their Asia-Pacific section every day to see if there is something and today for the first time they had an article from Mongolia. So what was it about? The election which was held in June but still undecided as the result has stranded in a legal battle? Or the rise in oil prices which effect poor countries like Mongolia so much perhaps? No. The article was about a bicycle theft!!!!!!!!!! A bike was stolen and it made BBC's website along with the websites of practically every British newspaper, a couple of Dutch newspaper and probably a good few more around the world as well. Edward was on his way from England to Shanghai by bicycle. He had to stop in Ulaanbaatar for about a week to get the visa situation for China sorted. Instead of staying in the city he rode his bike about 20 kilometers out of town and pitched his tent there. He locked his bike to the tent and went to sleep. All of a sudden half of his tent was gone and so was his bike. He couldn't see anything, but he could here a horse galloping away. Someone had tied a rope around his bike, attached it to a horse and had set off. So now after five months and more than 15.000 km he's stranded in Ulaanbaatar. He wrote a friend of his yesterday. The friend works for a news agency and made a press release about it and that's when it all went out of control. The British tabloid ""The Sun"" called his mother before he had had a chance to inform her about it: ""So what do you think about the horrible mugging of your son?"" I met him this morning for an interview. He's a very pleasant fellow and i feel sorry for him. However there might be some hope. He's already getting e-mails from people in Britain who want to help him out.  Special message for Michael Andersen: He described the road between Ulan Ude and Ulaanbaatar as being of german quality!"

Tomorrow I'm going out to a farm outside of town. A German butcher lives out there. It was just supposed to be me and a friend of the butcher going out there. However, last night I was at a birthday party and the plans were changed slightly. Everyone got invited to the farm, so what started out as a quiet trip where I was going to write an article about the butcher, has now turned into a barbeque where he will supply the meat and we are supposed to bring a keg of beer. Will I get any work done? We'll see. Stay tuned...."

764TLFV,male,26,"What the hell has happened to me? My eyes are red, my tongue is dry and it feels like something is squeezing my brain (or what's left of it)! Could this have something to do with the fact that I was supposed to meet Horst, a German chef, for a beer at 2pm yesterday? It's not easy to retrace your step from the even before in Mongolia. You have no receipts in your pocket to help you out. However, after a breakfast consisting of two asperin and a cup of coffee, it all came painfully back to me. Met Horst at the bar where he works. Was supposed to have one or two beers, but ended up staying there until midnight. A few friends of his arrived as well, and that's when someone got the brilliant idea that we should start drinking vodka. By the way, a shot in Mongolia is 4 centiliters, not two!!! Horst (who has spent five years in the French foreign legion!!!) and Werner (a German butcher who drove to Mongolia in a mobile-home six years ago!!!) gave me some friendly advice on how to survive in Ulaanbaatar. Here are the main conclusions:  You have to hit him before he gets a chance to hit you, Soeren. Even if you are not 100 percent sure that he has any hostile intentions. It's better to be on the safe side. Keep hitting until he goes down. And once he's down, don't be a gentleman. If there's still a bit of life left in him you should hit him over the head with an ashtray or a chair. If you don't, he'll get beck on his feet and pull a knife on you!!! This should only be done in bars, though. If on the street, you should give him everything he wants. Shoes, jacket, everything. Because on the street he will always be armed and have at least two other people close by. When taking a taxi, always sit behind the driver. That way you can grab him in a choke hold and force him to stop if you sense that something is wrong.  Horst has only been in Mongolia for a month. They needed a new chef as their former one, a man from Switzerland, was murdered!  Not too worried, though. It seems that the foreigners who are murdered here are all somehow mixed up in some ""dirty business"", so I'm sure I'll be fine. Besides, now I know what to do if a drunk approaches me in a bar!!! Honestly, I thought their advice was a bit too much, but i must admit that I did sit behind the driver in the taxi home."

764TLFV,male,26,"The fight continues. The paper was done on time yesterday yet the printer refused to print it. The reason? Well, officially it was because two of the children(!!!) working for the printer needed to leave early to go to SUMMER CAMP!!! Unoficially, the printer wants a higher salary and has therefore effectively taken our paper hostage. The thing is that our media group produces a daily called Onoodor. That obviously has first priority. Our paper is then printed on Wednesdays (or so I'm told) after they finish printing Onoodor. However, the printer now wants more money because printing our newspaper on Wednesdays requires him to stay until after midnight. At the moment there's absolutely nothing we can do about it as our boss (a.k.a the Mongolian Berlusconi) is on holiday.  Don't know how it's going to end, but it's really frustrating. What's really annoying is that no matter how good the paper is, we're still going to seem like a bunch of amateurs who are not even able to get our paper out on time."

Har moedt en dansk noedhjaelpsarbejder som har boet i byen i tre aar. Hendes mor havde laest artiklen om mig i Jyllandsposten, fundet mit navn i telefonbogen og ringet. Da var jeg dog allerede i Mongoliet, men hun forklarede Beate hvad det drejede sig om. Hun ville gerne have at jeg skrev en artikel om hendes datter. Pudsigt at blive kontaktet paa den maade. Vil da gerne skrive artiklen, men det virker som om gadeboernstemaet er lidt ""brugt"". Vi faar se om nogen vil vaere interesseret.  Skal spise sammen med en amerikaner som hjaelper lidt til paa arbejde i aften. Gad vide hvad vi skal have at spise? Naah ja, faarekoed. Chris, amerikaneren, var vegetar foer han kom til Mongoliet, men det er simpelthen umuligt at faa noget at spise hvis man ikke spiser koed. Mongoliet er et af de faa lande hvor koed ikke er en luksus - det er simpelthen grundstenen i alle maaltider. Og som regel er det faarekoed. De kan slet ikke forstaa at vi slagter faarene foer de er udvoksede. For det foerste er der jo ikke naer saa meget koed paa og for det andet slaar man da ikke unger ihjel! Pudsigt at de skulle have etiske overvejelser paa netop det omraade, samtidig med at de gladeligt lader alkoholikere, som er faldet i soevn udenfor om vinteren, sove og dermed doe!   Naa, men maden smager nu fint. Den er meget ensformig og mange udlaendinge har svaert ved at klare den. Det er nok en fordel at komme fra et land som Danmark, som heller ikke ligefrem er kendt for sin blaendende gastronomi. Det er gode solide maaltider med masser af koed. Og de er billige. Et maaltid paa de mongolske steder koster cirka en dollar! Til sammenligning koster en kop kaffe paa de europaeiske/amerikanske steder halvanden dollar. Det kan faktisk overhovedet ikke betale sig selv at lave mad. Af og til laver jeg lidt nudler, men det er kun hvis jeg har haft sent fri. Ioevrigt kan det naevnes at jeg bor cirka tre kilometer fra mit arbejde. I taxi koster den tur 50-70 cent afhaengig af trafikken. Saa det er jo ganske udemaerket. Jeg er paa SU,men spiser ude hver dag og tager taxi overalt. Ikke daarligt..."
764TLFV,male,26,"I now have internet in my apartment. It's going through a 56k modem and it's slow, but it's unbelievably nice to be connected to the world again. So now  have abathtub, internet and the pricy but very, very nice UB Deli has started doing food deliveries. BRING ON THE WINTER!!! Not much going on at work. We have a new English Editor and he's doing a great job, so quite happy with that. I've been asked to join a new charter of the Rotary Club here in Ulaanbaatar. Don't think I'll do it, though. It would be good for connections, but i'm not a huge fan of that kind of club. Furthermore they might let me be a member here at the end of the world, but I doubt very much that the European charters will accept a 26-year-old student as one of their own. Speaking of connections, they are really easy to get here. In the beginning i was wondering how to build up a network of sources, but it has been no problem whatsoever. Ulaanbaatar is like a village. It seems as if everyone (within the expat community) know that there is a new journalist in town. Quite often when I meet new people they say ""oh, so you are the new guy at the UB post. i've heard about you."" This definitely makes my job a lot easier. One thing you definitely need in Ulaanbaatar is a business card. At first I didn't want any when a colleague offered to makwe me some, but after a while i had to change my position. Everyone here carries them. Every time i go anywhere, no matter if it's for work or pleasure, i end up getting loads of cards and giving just as many away. And it's really nice when people then call you later on with suggestions for articles etc. Furthermore it's proved to be useful on other occasions. When a drunk wanted me to leave the sidewalk in front of the North Korean Embassy, he stopped shouting at me when i showed him my card (which is in English and Mongolian). And policemen and security guards don't care about my press card at all, but when i show them my business card they leave me alone."
764TLFV,male,26,"There's quite a few customs here that can seem strange to the outsider. For instance it's considered very unlucky to write with a red pen! Furthermore, it's also unlucky to leave your bag on the ground. If you are carrying a bag and you sit down to eat or anything like that, you should place your bag on a chair. If there's no chair you will have to leave the bag on the table or simply have it on your lap. When I have lunch with my colleagues I have to sit at the table in the guanz (sort of a cafe) with my bag on my lap. Can't leave it atthe office as it might get stolen!!! I still don't know why it's like that, but it is taken very seriously. Also, if your feet touches someone else's feet you have to shake hands with that person. I never realized how often I accidentally kick someones feet under a table until I came here. It seems like I do nothing but shake people's hands all day.   One last thing. The Lonely Planet guide book is a good thing, but shouldn't be used as a bible. The writers are only human, so they do make mistakes as well. An example:  ""It's very rude to wear your hat inside a ger (nomadic tent)""  So the first time that i got into a ger I took off my hat straight away. After a while I noticed that everyone else were still wearing theirs. I asked my colleague Sumya about it and he laughingly told me that taking off your hat actually means that you want to spend the night there! - I managed to get out though."

In between the hot, humid, and rainy days this week and me being so lazy and refusing to bathe since I'd just start sweating badly anyway, I sat and watched a lot of TV.  I don't have cable, but there are a surprising number of free channels here.  One of them is an all-Korean channel.  I've been watching a bit of that trying to understand what they're saying.  It's been another reminder of how much my Korean sucks.  I've also been watching some Cubs baseball since you can't get away from it here in Chicago.  I used to be a baseball fanatic when I was in elementary school, but I've lost a lot of interest since then.  However, I took great satisfaction in watching the St. Louis Cardinals bitchslap the Cubs for their two-game sweep at Wrigley."

DNCWQGX,male,27,"Last Wednesday I went to Duke for their annual free end-of-school year concert, which is on their campus in which thousands of Duke students get drunk on their wet campus in celebration of their last day of the semester.  This year was Kanye West and Dilated Peoples.  But DP never showed up.  The sound sucked for Kanye West, but it was still a fun show.  It was weird feeling buying and drinking beer on a college campus.  Members of Carolina's basketball team were there as were members of Duke's.  I saw Damion Grant, Rashad McCants, Jackie Manuel, and Melvin Scott for UNC.  I saw Shavlik Randolph, Daniel Ewing, and Sean Dockery for Duke.  Everyone except Randolph wore some sort of basketball throwback jersey.  It was weird seeing Rashad and Randolph embracing and acting as if they were friends.  Before Kanye went on, somebody near the stage held up a McCants #32 Carolina jersey.  There were more cheers than boos, which was odd considering we were on the Duke campus...probably because there were many North Carolina Central students, who I presume prefer Carolina over Duke.  I did hear a ""Fuck Carolina"" behind me, though.  Friday was the Six Organs of Admittance show at Nightlight, which I enjoyed very much.  Before Ben Chasney amazed me and everyone else with his guitar playing was this local old time band.  After Six Organs was local sludge metal band, Face Down in Shit, who I'd never even heard of before...but their ferocity and headbanging made an impression on me for the 15 or so minutes I stayed.  I just couldn't take the heat and the stench of metalhead body odor.  Plus, I was a little too high for my comfort.  It was a good (or bad depending on how you look at it) reminder for me to not get high when there are a lot of people around...since I get very self-conscious then very paranoid.  Perlmutter and Coach D kinda freaked me out, but I swear they had to have been fucking with me.  Bastards.  WXYC played WXDU in our annual kickball bragging rights game.  I think XDU had a three game winning streak or something like that before last year, when we crushed those bastards.  This year we had approximately 30 DJs or so show up in comparison to their 15 or so.  So our talent was diluted, and also since they invited some of their sports show nerds to play.  They got off to an early lead, although there were some questions on how many runs they scored early on.  We made a furious comback late (helped by a 2-run RBI double from yours truly), but we ended up losing 7-6.  Basically, they just cheated better than we did.  They must have learned from Coach K...they know how to work the refs to their advantage, i.e., cheat."

I'm not even sure if this entry will make my gay-ass blog.  I guess I'd forgotten exactly how hot and humid this state is until I arrived last night.  This is even worse than North Carolina.  Chicago's weather is weird...one day it'll be 90 degrees, and the next day it'll be 70.  Personally, I prefer the 70 degree weather even though it's weird wearing a jacket in June and July.  Of course, the trip from Chicago to St. Louis via I-55 was fucking boring as hell.

I like Edwards, although I prefer that ""crazy radical"" Dennis Kucinich and the ""ultra-leftist""Howard Dean over all others.  Oh yeah, I also like Al Sharpton.  I also would prefer Edwards as the presidential candidate and Kerry as the vice-presidential nominee, but this will have to do.  I think Edwards was a much better choice than Gephardt, and this will only help Kerry.  I'm not a huge fan of Kerry, but anything's better than Bush.  I'd rather have someone with mental retardation as our president than Bush...but then again, Bush may very well be mentally retarded.  I've never blamed Nader for Bush winning in 2000 but rather the incompetence of the Democrats coupled with the Republicans cheating.  I sort of wish Nader wouldn't run this time, but I personally am not mad at him for running nor will I blame him for Bush winning again should that happen.  I do understand, however, the anger some feel about Nader running.  But I think if Kerry, Edwards, and the Democrats do what they're supposed to do, they should win regardless of the 5% Nader holds in recent polls.  Despite Kerry not even being close to my ideal candidate, I'm voting for him for sure.  I've been telling people that having Kerry as president is like being kicked in the balls, but Bush again in office is like having testicular cancer.  I'd rather be kicked in the nuts than have testicular cancer.  When I started this stupid weblog, I was going to write whatever was on my mind, including politics.

U6TEGNU,male,34,"If you don't know, it is OK. You likely got lots and lots of company. Even though Krar was arrested during what appeared to be preparation for major terrorist activity, his arrest attracted minimal attention from the media and caused no press release by the Department of Justice, which under John Ashcroft, as of the press time for this  urlLink UPI report , had ""found at least 2,295 occasions to toot its own horn that are apparently more newsworthy than the Krar arrest"".  According to this report,  Krar, who is affiliated with several anti-government, white supremacist militia organizations, was apprehended after mailing a package containing false U.N. credentials, Defense Intelligence Agency IDs, phony birth certificates and a forged federal concealed weapons permit to a co-conspirator in New Jersey.   The package came with a note that read, ""We would hate to have this fall into the wrong hands."" It did. It was delivered to the incorrect address.  An alert citizen contacted the FBI, which led to the arrest of Krar and the discovery of a mind-numbing weapons cache: fully automatic machine guns, remote-controlled explosive devices disguised as briefcases, 60 pipe bombs, nearly 500,000 rounds of ammunition and enough pure sodium cyanide ""to kill everyone inside a 30,000 square foot building,"" according to federal authorities.  Krar consequently  urlLink pleaded guilty  to possessing a dangerous chemical weapon and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Sounds fair enough to me, and I am satisfied that Mr Krar will be away for awhile and will get a chance to cool his heels and maybe revise his attitude.  What I do find astounding is the near silence surrounding this case,- which is most likely why you are first reading about this gentleman here, if that is the case. One would think that, quoting the same  urlLink UPI report , both the administration and the media would pay more attention to a man whose ""arrest by federal law enforcement in the small town of Noonday, Texas, last April may have stopped the most devastating terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11"".  So, what is the reason for that near silence? I don't know, but I think part of it may be that the story would not sell, that it lacks the sensationalist value, that maybe after 9/11 the non-Muslim Americans were supposed to be ""good guys only"" and writing about this sort of individual would be disturbing news that would in turn drive down ratings. Once again, these are just some thoughts of mine, I do not have any serious research to back it up with.  However, be that as it may, the following seem to be some of the lessons from this story. Firstly, not all terrorists are Arab or Muslim. Secondly, not all Arab or Muslim people are terrorists. Thirdly, the evil of all kinds can be found anywhere, and when it is found among us, the worst thing for us to do would be to pretend it is not there,- which is pretty much what the media is covertly trying to get us to do through their biased and incomplete (and, in most cases, outright missing) coverage of the Krar case."

I tend to think that Americans are yet to understand that being brutal to somebody,- whether at home or at war in a foreign land,- is something the nation pays for as its citizens come back home traumatized, confused and violent. And not all problems can be addressed by way of war and aggression alone. Neither the issue of drug abuse, nor the issue of terrorism can be resolved that way."

She may be given to exaggerating facts, she may be bitter, but I do not believe that she is given to either lying or hallucinating. While a lot of facts are still missing, I believe that the story of Sibel Edmonds is an important one, the one to stay on and follow. And, like I said before, what Daniel Hopsicker is describing may indeed be factually correct,- and directly related to Edmonds' disclosures."
U6TEGNU,male,34,"""Friendly fire"" is an unfortunate part of pretty much any war. The fog of battle sometimes leads to soldiers firing on fellow soldiers wearing the same uniform. All of the world's militaries work towards developing procedures to avoid such tragic and wasteful mistakes but none have thus far completely succeeded in this quest.  However, according to  urlLink  Body of Secrets  , a book authored by the investigative journalist James Bamford, in the 1960's the US military considered attacks on Americans disguised to appear perpetrated by the Cuban forces. The objective: convincing the American public of a necessity of going to war with Cuba. As David Ruppe writes in  urlLink his ABC News article ,   Code named  Operation Northwoods , the plans reportedly included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and even orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. That was not merely a thought that popped up in some general's head early in the morning after having a few too many drinks at an Officers' Club the night before. That appears to have been a detailed set of military plans.  America's top military brass even contemplated causing U.S. military casualties, writing: ""We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba,"" and, ""casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation."" ...   The Joint Chiefs even proposed using the potential death of astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbit as a false pretext for war with Cuba, the documents show.      Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, ""the objective is to provide irrevocable proof … that the fault lies with the Communists et all Cuba [sic].""     Fortunately, none of those fiendish ideas were to become reality as they were rejected by the Kennedy administration.    Many Americans think that no one in a position of power in the US would ever even contemplate intentionally harming his fellow Americans in order to create a pretext for promoting their agenda. That assertion appears to have little foundation. Some pretty powerful people within the defense apparatus are  urlLink clearly documented  to have been thinking along the same lines as those at many other times and in many other places throughout history who had intentionally attacked their own populace in order to convince the public of the perceived enemy's aggressive intents."
U6TEGNU,male,34,"We have heard it time and again. The drugs are destroying our communities. Young lives full of promise are snuffed out by the scourge of drug addiction. Vicious gangs force our children into doing their dirty work,- selling drugs on street corners. Young girls are forced into prostitution to support their addiction. We have all seen pictures of cocaine babies. The pundits, the politicians, the executive officials have spoken and told us that this is a plague that must be destroyed. And if it takes a war to eradicate this plague,- so be it, we will fight the war on drugs and we shall prevail.  However, there are different ways to look at it. One perspective would be that some view some drugs considered illegal in the US perfectly safe and even useful. I once met a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan who credits hashish with saving his life as, according to his description, this was a way to get rid of stress and get oneself together without the drunken stupor caused by alcohol. The medical use of marijuana is another area where the drug's positive effects are well documented. Cocaine makes one extra-alert; I suppose there are situations when that could come in handy,- to help an exhausted soldier or firefighter stay focused, for instance. Of course, for drugs to have a positive effect they must be used in moderation, but the same is true of pretty much everything. One needs to just walk the streets of pretty much any US city to see the results of our failure to know moderation when it comes to food consumption.  Another view of the situation is that the drug addicts are sick. They can no longer control their urges, thus they can not be held responsible in a court of law, nor can they be expected to avoid committing crimes if these crimes hold a promise of their next fix for them. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that demand (the addicts) brings supply (the drug dealers) onto the scene. Hence, according to this model, the solution ought to be registration and treatment for drug addicts, with the distribution for those who have not yet been weaned of their drug of choice.  Yet another view,- the one I favor the most,- is that drug use is a matter of personal choice. It should be completely decriminalized. It is officially considered a crime, while, so long as you merely consume drugs you harm no one but yourself. If you commit a crime, whether while intoxicated or not, it is this crime you ought to be prosecuted for. I favor that view. Yes, there are holes in it. Of course a drug addict does not merely harm himself as it is also his family, friends and the community that suffers. But the same is true of a person who eats unhealthy food, incurs heart trouble as a result and dies of a heart attack at a young age. Or of a person who becomes addicted to alcohol,- which is legal.  These views likely do not even begin to represent the whole spectrum. They should suffice to show, however, that the narrow view accepted by several consecutive US administrations is not the only way to look at the picture,- likely, not even the correct way. But let us stop our lofty flight into theory and come back to the reality on the ground. And the picture there ain't pretty. The war on drugs is going apace.  In his recent  urlLink Denver Post article  Walter Cronkite correctly characterizes this war as an utter failure and also correctly notes that,      Much of the nation, in one way or another, is victimized by this failure - including, most notably, the innocents, whose exposure to drugs is greater than ever.   He then goes on to elaborate on the scope of the war, the sheer numbers of those affected,- 500,000 behind bars exclusively for drug offenses. The article is also an excellent summary of how unfair the system is, with, among other things, the lowest-level offenders often getting the toughest sentences as they do not have infromation they could trade for a reduced sentence. As for what is in the works to change this reality, according to Cronkite,    The Alliance [Drug Policy Alliance] and other organizations are working to reform and reframe the war on drugs. And they are finding many judges on their side, who are rebelling against this cruel system. We can expect no federal action during the congressional hiatus in activity ahead of the November elections, but it would be of considerable help if, across the country, campaigning politicians put this high on their promises of legislative action, much sooner than later.   I think this may not be going far enough. We should not reframe the war on drugs,- we should stop it. Those who have committ drug-related violent crime should be prosecuted,- with the war on drugs stopped, murder is still going to be murder, racketeering is still going to racketeering, and both will still remain crimes.  Boris Grebenshikov, one of Russia's leading rock musicians, wrote in one of his songs:  We have been fighting this war for 70 years, They have taught us that life is combat, But the new intelligence report just came in And it turns out all this time we fought ourselves.  ( Translated by me, on the fly ) Well, he said it. Let's just not allow the war on drug to decimate our society for 70 years,- the roughly 20 years we've been fighting it is more than enough.

There certainly is quite a number of people who move between the two countires on the regular basis so it may be hard to tell which one they really call home.  But overall this data is not surprising.   The exodus has stirred up a discussion in Israel, said Boruch Gorin, head of the public relations department at the Russian Federation of Jewish Communities, which commissioned the study. On the one hand, millions of Jews already live outside Israel. On the other hand, ""living in Israel is an ideology, and that the people who sought a shelter in the country have been leaving is a blow to the ideology,"" he said.   Maybe it is indeed time to address the issue of the ideology Mr Gorin is talking about."

P6LH97X,male,24,"OK, one of my favourite subjects: i hope there's someone here who understands Russian. Compare the sites of  urlLink the president of Bulgaria  and  urlLink the president of Ukraine . Which one do you understand better?  According to linguists, Ukrainian is supposed to be more closely related to Russian than Bulgarian -- both Russian and Ukrainian are Eastern-Slavonic, while Bulgarian is Southern-Slavonic. The closeness of languages is usually explained by grammar, and indeed, the Ukrainian grammar -- cases ( падежи ), word formation, verb tenses etc. -- is nearly identical to the Russian, while the Bulgarian is considedrably different -- the verb tenses are more archaic, and there are no cases at all. Despite that, when i read the Bulgarian text i understand it more easily than the Ukrainian (i am not fluent in either of these languages and i have never learnt any of them). How can it be explained?   In the Ukrainian alphabet there are letters which are not present in Russian, such as  ї, і, є ; in Bulgarian, however, there are no additional letters. I know how to pronounce the ""strange"" Ukrainian letters, but it seems to me that on some more subconscious level they interrupt my thought.  There seem to be more words in Bulgarian which are identical to Russian. Not similar -- 100% identical. Of course it can be proven only by a thourough philological-statistical analysis, but that's the feeling i get. The possible reason? Bulgarian is a direct descendant of Old Church Slavonic, in fact ""Old Church Slavonic"" is just a fancy name for ""Old Bulgarian"". Linguistically, Russian is  not  a descendant of Old Church Slavonic, but it was heavily influenced by it through, well, the church. Literary Ukrainian, however, is, at least in part, a fruit of political intervention that favoured non-Russian but rather Polish or dialectal Ukrainian forms. Bulgarians, who never had to prove their national identity and uniqueness to anyone, did not need such political adjustments to their language.   The observations above are not very scientific, i never studied the subject academically. These are just ""hunches"". I want to study the subject thouroughly some time in the future."

Also a notable note, I'm the ONLY guy going on the trip, I'm the only male, all the rest are of the female species....I haven't decided if this is good or bad.  Last night was fun though, I got home from my mom's house about 9:00ish, and I got online*of course* and instantly I was told to go to the Song Garden, so I asked my dad if I could, and I could, so I went.  When I got there, only Ervin was there, and then Brittany showed up very close*time wise* behind me, and then Kyle showed up like 5 minutes later, how was he so slow?!?!?!?!?  So we sat and ate sum food, and by we I mean Kyle, Ervin, and me*Brittany didn't eat any, how come girls never want to eat around us....especially at the Song Garden?!?!?!?!*  I didn't finish all of mine because it was pretty spicy, so I got it put into tiny boxes and brought it home and my dad ate it for lunch today.  Either way, after we wre done eating there, we decided we didn't want to go home yet, so we drove over to Conor's and played ding-dong-ditch on him....except his doorbell didn't work...so we just hit it instead, and then we were walking and this SUV drove past us like 8 times just yelling things at us, then they drove past one last time, and Brittany and Ervin ran to the side of the road*pansies* and me and Kyle just stood there, oops, Kyle and I just stood there, and they just drove past, but then they jsut drove past and didn't do anything, then like 50 feet away they threw a cone out the window....so I went and picked it up.  Then another car came past and i threw the cone to the side so that they wouldn't see it.  Then I remembered that I had to piss really really bad, so I went and pissed off in the trees, meanwhile Kyle, Ervin, and Brittany just walked away.  Then when I was done, I went and grabbed the cone, and walked over to Kyle, Ervin, and Brittany, who were contemplating ding-dong-ditching Mr. Rohl.  I just took my cone and started walking back to Brittany's car, and this guy came out from this near-by house without a shirt, and when he got close to us he yelled ""Oh Shit!"" and ran away back to his house, and halfway there his phone fell of his buckle, and I yelled ""You dropped your phone!""  Then I continued to walk, and I was soon joined by Brittany and Kyle.  A while later Ervin came running after us and he had ding-dong-ditched Mr. Rohl, and it was all good.....then we got into the car, and were dropped off at our cars, and we drove home, and I slept....and then i woke up and went to my meeting, leaving me here, writing this......well....I've taken up enough of the internet, I'll go....PEACE-OUT!

K, so I'm getting a D in Japanese*big frickin' deal* and so I'm not allowed to stay out of skool all day to help Mrs. Loney, instead, I have to go to Japanese and learn a bunch of worthless CRAP!!

Then my dad took me and Ervin home, and I got to take the car and go to Ervin's, where I stayed for a while, and then Ervin took me and I got to go get a new Bionicle*which made me happy* but before that, what made me even MORE happy, was that I talked to Tina for quite sum time...and it was really kool to me.....MAN I LIKE DRIVING!! Then after that we went back to my house*me and Ervin* and ate dinner than went to Mutual, where we went to a jail, and it was really scary...the people were creepy there.  Then I got to hang out with sum hot chicks *apparently one of whose friends thinks I'm hot...which is pretty kool*  Then I drove Ervin home and I am here now talking to you people....this would have been longer and even MORE detailed....but I really gotta get my beauty sleep....PEACE!!!

I didnt have to shop around, find a store that sells the ""big"" clothes, nor did i have to shop around these precious few stores for the best prices or what looks moderatly fashionable.    Its been such a pain, all the ""big"" clothes are like something farmer fred would wear. and the colours are bland, and well they are just horrible.  the freedom of just going to a great big store (and honestly, im anti mega store for ethical reasons)  but going to that store and just buying a pair of nice cute shorts was just the coolest thing!  ;-)  Well, this is jax signing off"

DBTRABH,male,26,"Well, im down to 395 pds. yay!!! yippee!!  now, the bad news, things are slowing down a tad. not really slowing down. but getting more difficult.  ive reached a spot that people dread.  the spot where my body likes to be weight wise.  now its well below what my goal is, and its not a good aesthetic weight.  SO I have to work a tad harder.  Right now whats typifying whats happening is a series of stalls.  Luckily Ive been responding well to carb loading when this happens.  The proces is to take a day and load up with carbs, and then go on induction the following week.  this usually gets the loss going again.  which is good.  After this hump things will go back to normal, but until then its carb loading/induction.  which i dont mind at all.  although a lot of the old food i used to eat I kinda find gross now. im going to have to see what i can do. -- Jax, signing off."

Like the stars in the sky, You still keep on shining down you're light on me, But out of reach, And I know that in time, You will come back to your senses,  See the signs, And change your mind, I try to look the other way, And keep my heart on hold,  But everytime I'm close to you, I lose my self-control, Why can't I laugh? Why must I cry? Everytime we say good-bye, Why does it rain, Here in my heart,  Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see, Why can't I laugh? Why must i cry? Give me just one good reason why... Why does it rain Here in my heart, Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see...  great song, although i know a lot of others would disagree...like christy...and alex...and pretty much everyone...what can i say? i have a unique musical attraction...lol I LOVE YOU SWEETUMS...AND EVERYBODY ELSE TOO! moo ~ lauren"

IGADI8I,male,16,RARRR STUPID BLOG DELETED MY POST THATS SO NOT COOL  rAr ~Christy
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I spent like 5 hours at the King Albert Park McDonalds today. Did only 1.5 hours worth of work. This was interspersed with chatter with Leon Toh and him trying to hook me up with various girls. Oh! I charmed them alright. Charmed them out of their seats and away from me is what I did. Ho..  Have created a picture gallery. It's at  urlLink http://oracion.mypicgallery.com . Will put the link up on the sidebar soon. There's only a few photos us coz it takes hell long to upload them. The first album is about my happy days. It's not all the photos that I've got, but these will do to bring you the idea.  Will be in a play by drama soon. I'll get stripped and kicked and tied up. No darlings, it's not raunchy. It's a comedy of words. Don't expect elaborate songs, dance, lights, sounds, or props coz you wont get any. If you wish to place orders for tickets, hold your horses. I don't know the details but I think it'll be staged in late July. Will supply further details when I am furnished with them.  Yesterday I asked you to go love your Parents. Today I'm going to tell you to appreciate grass. Seriously. It's under-appreciated, but is so vital to our survival. If you don't buy all that, just get in contact with Ma Nature.  Began to think about Zel again. This cannot be. There has to be a solution. But really, cutting helps for a while. I stood in the dark and watched you brush your hair. Hurrah for 62A. Meet me there."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I've forgotten what I wanted to say. You know that feeling when you forget something that was just on the tip of your tongue or when you forget a dream and you want to get it back. It's frustrating. Cracked my knuckles and toes all at once. Still, they agitate me further.  Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. Songs are my life in more ways than one. I find solace in melody and the beach. On the waves and in the breeze. Zephyr.  I listened to Eunos play today. I watched the multitudes gather to hear this prodigy. I'm green. I don't like myself and I feel inadequate. I wish to study music theory and piano. Why am I vexed so easily? I love the boy, yet I feel competitive towards him. That's not right.  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I have a few things to say today.  I am not tired and will be working throughout the night again. Yes.. well, but that's not what I wanted to say. Too many Singaporeans, especially the youth, complain about Singapore. Lets talk local. I am local. I complained and mocked the system. Sure there may be faults within our political system, but which country is an exception to this? Faultlessness is an impossibility where mortals are concerned. Singapore, for most of us is all we know. ALL... that we know to be home. Too many times have we seen snazzy journalists with their ironic wit scoff at and mock the government subtly. Too many times has the older generation done the same. Our parents, grandparents, Gen-X. Would you pick a fight, or find fault with your parents to look cool coz your older brother was doing it? It's the same thing.  This is my call. That we edify instead of tear down. Sure, an individual won’t destabilize the government. But many ants can lift the elephant. Let's not mock our Government and it's policies unless we have genuine reason. And even then, there are appropriate avenues to voice our discontent. I've said it once, hell, I've said it a few times. You never know the value of something till you lose it. Friends and countrymen, we have good governance. Treasure it.  Now, the next thing is something that I'm really fired up about. NDP was good. The commentators, especially the male had no idea what he was talking about. He was rambling. The ""choir"" was actually a dance troop and the script was ridiculous. Come on! The golden bird-men coming onto the field was an indication of how Singapore was a high flying country? And a couple of soldiers shifting from a standing position to a kneeling position in a wave was an indication of how we work together harmoniously? I mean, at LEAST link the repeated Singaporean catch phrase to the appropriate formation. I must qualify however, that the NDP was valuable. Yes. It gave me a good laugh.  IDOL! ARGH! TRASH! BULLSHIT!  Dick Lee, well, he's just a dick. The girl has the freaking lamest, driest humor around. And the dude sitting at the end of the table? Shit man, he's so freaking stoned, if I hit him with a stick, he wouldn't look any worse or more dead. And you know what he said to the overly emotional nervy-crying girl? ""Don't worry, there's all the time under the earth."". UNDER THE EARTH? HE SHOULD FREAING BE FREAKING UNDER THE FREAKING EARTH! That's an UNFORGIVABLE linguistic error on the part of a judge. And what was that about the maat having an attitude problem? Bullshit man. He sang well. What's YOUR PROBLEM? A couple of judges behave like they've got a cactus up their ass, the way they behave. Dick Lee? He's got a dick up his ass. He was soooo totally jacked by that dude with the flower. He was like ""You're lucky that that flower on your jacket's artificial coz if it were real, it would have died"". And the dude went ""but the flower IS real"" to which an embarrassed  dick  made a  small  attempt to save his  skin  by qualifying, ""oh... no wonder it looks  bent "". BBBAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Dick got jacked. Fool.  Olivero dissed me the least. I hope there's hope in him. If not, the panel's just made up of a flopping dick, a barren bimbo, a has-been rockstar, and a linguistically deficient zombie."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Hi. I'm upset. I'm invisible. I'm not in ACJC. I'm loosing my dreams of becoming a star.  It will go soon. However, exactly what will go is highly subjective. Will the depreciation go or will the aspiration? time will tell. If only it'd open it's fatass gap earlier.  PJC is a bore. The orientation thing was ill planned and they had us in the hall practically the whole day. Then, they made us play very very stupid and POINTLESS games. I mean it. I shan't elaborate. I made the best out of it. Didn't wanna say anything to offend the nice leader boy...  Help... God... Help"
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I'm now semi-messed-up and semi-releaved. Had a good talk with her and she understands now- about why I did it. I'm not sure if she believes me though. It'd be a crying shame if she didn't. She knows that I still love her. However she donen't wanna tell me if the sentiment is reciprocated. Wonder what that means.  I will let time take it's course. Thy will be done.  I have to stop swearing, but the more I do, the more I tend to see Christianity as following blindly what an old book says. Believing in something that cannot be proven. I don't know lah.  Think about this. Because I'm Christian, I'm saved eternally. Eternally meaning timeless. Therefore, when I go to heaven, I'd immediately got to know who made it there Coz everyone would be there already. However, for everyone to be there already, time would have to have passed for everyone to be there already wouldnt it? And even then, when would judgement day be? So is heaven still timeless. Heaven is devoid of time and space. But then, where would the roads of gold go? If they're only descriptions of whatheaven is like, then how much of the bible is comprised of mere ""descriptions""?  I don't mean to sway anyone, but I was just thinking."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"FMSS team lost to the NJC juniors team in our final match yesterday. I felt bad coz it would have been a bad way to end your core CCA's career. Especially if you're the president. Poor girl.  She was cold over dinner and even let out a ""YEAH RIGHT"" when the topic of boys treating girls well came up.. Miss Luah and I spoke on the way home and she told me that if I felt she was the one, I should wait. WHICH, dear reader, I've already concluded.  I've left FISH (My Sunday school class). Am not especially close to anyone there anymore, and hence, I'm not under any obligation to stay. Not growing there.  Desiree tells me to move on though optimism may be nice, coz it'll only last for so long. She questions its possible ""one-sidedness"". I think, while my love may be unrequited, that's how it is in fairytales too. I will wait coz I think she's the one. Which in itself is questionable coz I haven't dated anyone else yet. She is the one person I look forward to meeting every night online. I shan't say more lest you think I'm falling in love with you love.   Reader, reader, reader, you must be getting tired of my love and thoughts about Zel. Too Damn Bad. It's MY blog and I'll bloody white what I wish, Nevertheless, I think it's time I started something fresh. So keep checking for new and exciting updates which will engage you more (I hope).  P.S. My daily blogging schedule will probablly be hampered by my new routine. I get tired easily now. ACJC is not a forgiving place. Goodnight."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Hi. Went out with F.I.S.H. to east coast beach today. Good time with the boys. Piling and all.  I sat there alone, wrote her name in the sand beside me to my left and spoke to her in an audible voice. The first word I said was ""Zel"" and I felt... different. I've always wanted to go to the beach with her, and she's always been too busy. Always.  Steph Yap's changed a lot. She's a know it all now. My theory is as such. People in SRJC generally aren't as competent as those in FMSS. As such, the opportunity for her to take control there is prevalent. What pisses me off is when she tries doing that with FISH. Wake up lah. She was everywhere. ""I'll only help you start the fire, but I wont cook coz I'm wearing contacts."" Please lah! Starting it involves more smoke. But of course she knew that already since she's the authority on such matters. You know something, this is not worth it.  I wanna be motivated. Started gymming today. Happy with that. Yong's a bro. I wanna stick up on my wall ""You WILL be there! Make it soon!"" I wanna judge the standard of Singaporean competition before I enter Idol. What I'm afraid is that Singapore Idol will trigger an unprecedented increase in the general masses interest in improving vocal technique. To put it simply. I'm not sure if I can handle more competition.  Encourage me."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"The most queer thing happened today. Couple of people from minds come down to school to sell things today. I was at the void deck doing lit with a couple of other acquaintances. I wish I could use a different word, but they don't deserve it. Anyway, so this lady walked up to our table and quietly set her basket down and looked blankly at us. But she was pulling me, or I was pulling myself, so I got out my wallet and have her everything I had... And I picked one $1 bookmark and it read something. I cant remember what. Btw, this lady's got down syndrome. So anyway, I looked at this bookmark and said, ok... I like this one. But she took another one out of the basket and placed it on top of mine. Like she knew it was meant for me. Weird. It read, ""don't tell a woman that you're unworthy of her love - she knows.""  OH MAN!!! FREAKING LITTLE INDIA PARROT TYPE SHAT!!! I took it - needless to say.  I listened to Zel's voice 2 days ago over Joe's speaker phone as he spoke to her. I could have  cried. I miss her voice over the phone. She was nice. I tried calling her that night at home, but her maid picked up and tried to communicate to me that she'd gone to the clinic. I couldn't call back later. Next day I messaged her asking if she was ok and told her that I'd called. She killed me for calling, saying that she didn't want her parents to think that we were still together. However, she did acknowledge that she knew I cared. Well, that's enough for me. She told me never to call again.  Listening to her voice reminded me what I was around for. I'm going to get her back. It's just going to be a very long wait. Her having a crush on some jock and all. Good things come to those who wait, and fie to me for thinking about drug addictions.  I miss Hazel."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Fairfield. There is no word more appropriate than this now. Fairfield. Yesterday, I graduated. It was not a happy thing. It's leaving ten of the best years of my life behind. I remember the very first day I heard the word. Pati took me to register for primary one. We got off at the ACJC bus stop and walked all the way to the primary school. There's so many things I remember. Oh God, it's overwhelming.  I cried yesterday. When we did worship. When my choir sang. When we sang the school song and when we sang bless this school. God bless Farifield. I may be leaving it's gates just as I did after the O'levels, but Mrs Tang, and I'm sure her predicessors have said, ""Once a Fairsian, Always a Fairsian"". I will take solace in that. I was proud to be a Fairsian. Proud.  Today was it. The last time the 2003 batch would ever be together again. The founders day dinner. Everyone who came, came dressed up. It was good to see everyone happy. That's what gives me peace. We had some sort of a dinner today. I paid $60 but I couldn't have eaten more than $6 worth of food. The rest of the time was spent wandering about watching people smile and pose for photos. I took snapshots of them in my mind. It's a real pity that my family doesn't have a solid video camera or a good camera for that matter. I will just have to sourse for photographs then.  We ""worked"" with Leon on eating baby Octopuses.. octopusses.. octopi? He was, well... apprehensive.  Throughout the night, we watched pictures and memories projected on a wall. They did not evoke much, but we did take an N*Chink photograph. That was good! I miss my 2C. Someday I will tell you about 2C. We did many things and if only we could get together to reminisce. That would be wonderful. I will set it up.  The band consisted of Jireh, Pow Wee, Chris Ong, Eu Liang, Samuel, Leon and I. We practiced twice before this. We're all pretty good at what we do. God was with us. On monday, I'd fallen ill with the flu. Though the sniffles were clearing up, there was another problem. A singers worst nightmare. Soar throat during the period of the gig. I was careful. Drank a gallon of magic juice and took plenty of losenges. It still wasn't better. Today was quite the rush. Fun rush. Dad picked me up at home. We went to pick Cheam up. We couldn't find Cheam. We turned around to scour the roadsides. Cheam called us and we picked him and his sax up after that. We went to Eu Liang's school to pick him and his piano up. We were en route to Leon's when I remembered that I'd left the mikes behind. My father's language was interesting and my friends were amused. We decided to come back for the mikes later. On the way to Leon's we picked Pow Wee, his amplifier and guitar up. Then we paid the chouffer for the night's revels. Picked Leon up, went to Reiner's and broke in. Now I know how to break in to Reiner's place. Took the drumset and sent the boys in a cab to Pan Pac. Jireh and Chris were instructed to do the same. Leon, I and Daddy went back to get the mikes afterwhich we headed to Pan Pac. Oh boy... That was tiring.  The music, when performed thrilled the noisy croud. I asked Zhu to help back me for ""This love's"" chorus. Other than that, I held it alone with the boys. Heaven was good too but the best song, without a doubt, was Friends. I sang it. The whole cohort stood, arms around each other and swayed. Teachers cried and friends cried. I cried watching them. I think my voice wavered once or twice because of emotion. There was such meaning in the song that I was one with it and I spoke through me. It was the language of emotion. I don't think I've ever done anything quite like it. I've performed more times than i can count now, but this one was special. I was not exceptionally prepared. I had the lyrics on the floor. I can't explain it. It's like, you cry because it fills you and you feel the beauty and meaning of the music. I dare say, it was the most powerful performance I've ever given.  There is so much I cannot even begin to express it. No, I can express it.   Fairfield"
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I'm looking at my hand now. I can see the veins. They are green. Green through my skin. My skin is brown. When I raise my hand, the veins go back in, when I lower my hand, the veins slowly pop back out. I think it's because there's more pressure of blood in my hand when it's down. My blood is red. Is yours, and are you sure? Ca you be positive? Coz some people I know don't behave like their blood is red. I'd like to believe that people with red blood are human. Animals have red blood too. Maybe they're animals.  I feel talkative and inquisitive tonight. Now mix that with a sad playlist of old memories and you have me sitting here doing this. I remember that I wanted to be a scientist when I grew up. Mummy bought me a book with an acorn on the cover. I lost interest in it quickly because its contents did not interest me that much. Oh! I do remember crystal growing and things like that. Mummy and I, we did the coolest things.  I pulled out of school early today, I did feel down in the morning but that soon left me. I think I convinced myself that I was sick. I climbed out of the back gate and walked to Buona Vista MRT. I passed the primary school. Flashback after flashback. I began to talk to myself. HEY Casey! Help me fold my aeroplane. I brought nice white paper today. You could fold the one with the jaggered wings or the one with that special hole for stability. Wow Casey, Where'd you learn how to do that? When the end of recess bell rang, we'd all run to the porch. I remember I used to have trouble remembering the word porch. I called it the place with the holes in the walls. I used to chill out in the holes. Lean back on the curvature and shut my eyes and watch the light turn red through my eyelids. Oh Gosh! The more I think about it now, The more of the place I can see in my mind. We left the paper planes everywhere. The green grass was littered with white planes of all types. Some were in the eco-pond too. We used to have monkey bar fights. Opponents would start from either side and try to bring the other one down by preferably wrapping their legs around the opponents’ waist and jerking them downwards. Lynnette with the down syndrome was the queen and Able George was the undisputed boss. He got his pants yanked off one fateful day though. Fateful because he was conveniently not wearing underwear. We used to dab out hands in the bald batch of ground so that we'd get more grip. We were not like the adults with all their chalk and all. So messy, that white powder bowlers and boxers used. We used what was around us. Childish ingenuity. So who ever said being childish was all bad?  My first fight was there, at that volleyball court. Something about Aruna Mohan and Butts and a bitchy Chikgu. I was sent to the ominous Dorothy Ho and she taught me that it took two hands to clap with a practical demonstration. Dorothy Ho is not so scary anymore and the old infrastructure has been changed. The monkey bars are gone along with the paper aeroplane place.  God was good. How ever did he come up with the concept of memory? When you're alone, you're not really alone coz you have characters like Dorothy Ho and Casey to play with over and over again. Like a video archive. A very extensive video archive.  Cheers to all the small things."

(and she heard it already) I was like.. 'nah...'   so we.. like yesterday.. lepak at the perhimpunan place whjile the school are saying BUH-BYE to some teachers thats retiring.. BOH-RING!! so basically we just talked and talked and they still kept nudging me to sing my song.. especially diana.. I was all.. 'guys its at the perhimpunan place.. people will hear..' and they were like.. 'takdelar.. cptlar cptlar..' so I got outnumbered and HAD TO sing my song.. and afters they made me sing again.. like 5 minutes after that.. I opposed.. I did get to hear gG's song 'have you ever'.. its nice.. as usual..   after that.. it was time to get back to class and we were invited to give the teachers a hug.. WOO-HOO.. I wanted to go but teh gals were like.. ' GO ajak SC lar.. he wants to go too..' and I was like 'no way!'.. but I went to say goodbye to her with melisa.. (pn. yap looks happy to bid us goodbye) [I.. bid you goodbye.. I cry.. with tears in my eyes.. ok ok!].. so we just went back to class.. we just was hanging out there..   nothing biggie event happened then.. we just went to kH where i got to finish my JAHITAN!! alleyluyah! but on the way.. the girls were like pestering me to sing my song again.. i was like ..' ok you guys.... ' in a sarcastic way..   so then thats basically just it.. then we went to recess.. where I gave nasriff the card.. he was thanking me and stuff.. and I was like.. ok happy birthday.. then I went back to our table where I sang my song to miza coz she didn't hear it the first time.. diana was bummed she didn't get to hear it when I sang it to miza.. so then we just hang out.. and had our recess.. masa balik.. I was SURPRISED!!   Bryan was sitting at my place.. I was like 'WHAT THE'.. he said that it was time to change.. I had to sit at the first row.. and guess where they put diana and zaty? ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD!! OMG!! I swore I freaked out!!.. It was soo far.. MANY people were not happy with their new seats.. haih.. teruk giler..   so masa agama.. we just hanged out together.. diana made me sing my song to zaty and melisa.. and I was like.. alar nanti lar.. then I went to do my hafazan.. then they asked me to sing again.. 'OK OK!' so I sang it to them.. melisa stopped me halfway and I was like.. 'lemme finish first!'.. turns out she couldn't hear me.. and we were laughing coz we should've let her say it.. hahahah..   so diana made me sing it again for melisa to hear it properly.. and I did.. it was tiring but fun.. they kept asking me to sing it louder and I was like..'but this is loud'.. so blar blar blar.. 'but you.. pretend that I'm invincible..'.. then agama class was over but diana made me sing it again to nadhirah.. OMG! seriously.. I thought that I could actually get muak to that song.. but I did sing it.. diana was singing the chorus part a little.. parts that she knows.. it was kida fun to her mouthing it out coz it felt like.. wow.. people know my song and they're singing it.. so it was kinda cool.. and then diana wanted me to sing again.. and I freaked out.. I said 'diana! I sang the song byk gila kali already.. and you've heard it like 4 times..' so I went back halfway round the world..   sejarah.. owh god! farah and sangeeta was joking around while the teacher is teaching and I cracked up gila gila! it was soo funny what they were doing.. then we just went back.. I said hi to shzlee on the way back and cair again at the sight of lai vi chian.. haih.. basically we just walked back home cam biasa..  the whole day was just.. biasa.. I tried writing another song.. but my brain wasn't working.. so i tried to study! so much for that! I called up shahir and asked him to help me with the guitar.. he played all the chords for me.. SUSAH NYER!! and we met up with ashraf and they volunteer to help me with my song.. so basically we just got hooked up on it.. I sang my song and the 2 of them just played to guitar to match up with the song..   then tonight we met again and we really concentrated on the song.. we made a rock version of the song and changed some of the lyrics.. its soo fun.. we were goofing around with the song.. but at the end.. we came up with a song.. I'm proud of it.. then we just hang out summore and we played our song 'diabetes' and the guys played 'last kiss' whilst I sing it.. then we had to go in.. so we did..  so basically.. I end up singing my song 6 times just today! whoa!  -I can actually get bored of MY song.. but so far.. I'm enjoying it.. its fun singing it.."
NC8XISX,female,14,"It was brutal.. ok ok! so maybe this is what I get for doing it to my friends but it came as a shock! I didn't even see it coming! it was like.. a flash of thunder and tiba-tiba..I'm wet all over! OMG! I mean.. wheres the rain you guys! They've been trying to get me for months now and ok ok! safe to say!

NC8XISX,female,14,"ho weird is it.. I'm suppose to be reading my books and doing my sejarah folio.. but no.. I went and made another song.. haih..

NC8XISX,female,14,"10.  I don’t have to go on tour. I can stay home with my internet. Plus see       shahrul at school all the time.. well, that is if both of us actually come to       school.. and theres the whole, PJ and KH thing..  9.   Between school, tuisyen and music lessons, and my social life, I really don’t have        time to put that much thought into my wardrobe. Dressing whimsically is actually a       lot of responsibilty.  8.   Gwen has stuff written about her in the tabloids and stuff. Some are not even true.       I don't think I want the whole world to know where I live, whats my number or even      what I had for dinner. Nor am I ready for the whole world to judge me base on my      music (which is not very appealing) and my style (which is also not appealing)   7.   Gwen don’t have time, or don’t even stay in one place that long to be able to go on        a date or catch a movie with friends (or boyfriends).  6.   Gwen wears a lot of navel bearing outfits. My navel isn’t exactly my best feature.       Fortunately, my mom told me if she ever catch me wearing navel bearing outfit, she       would never let me go to anymore dates or jamming as long as I live. Besides I have       the whole ‘tudung’ thing.  5.   According to my sister, who reads a lot of girl beauty magazines, if I dyed my       hair as often as Gwen has, it would all fall out.  4.   Gwen has to hang out all day, everyday with the rowdy boys in her band. The only        boys I ever have to hang out with are shahrul, my friends, my brother’s       friends and my friend’s boyfriends, and none of them, so far has expressed any       interest in playing the drums wearing nothing at all, which, if you ask me, would       be totally embarrassing.  3.   Gwen may not be aware of this little known fact but geeks make the best       boyfriends.It sounds surprising, but it is true. You know those little smiles of       Shahrul’s, the little secret ones he always seemed to have on his face? Those       smiles, he says, are on account of me. Because, he told me, he never thought he’d       meet a girl like me.  2.   Gwen’s sister, though she’s probably nice and all, can’t possibly be as cool as       mine, who, even though she can be a real pain sometimes, is actually pretty       righteous the rest of the time. I mean, she totally forgive me for the whole me       playing guitar (when its something she really wants to do) and the time she helped       me looking really pretty on the Setia night (at least I think I did). Does that       tell you something?  And the number-one reason I’m glad I’m not Gwen Stefani:  1. Because then I wouldn’t be me."
NC8XISX,female,14,"again.. we had to sit for another 2 hours of 'all-time-with-rosemary'.. I'm telling you.. spending you're saturday, in school, tengah hari, panas, rosemary, 2 hours.. is actually kinda fun! haha! It was pretty ok the last time (only that then was 4 hours).. so we got there.. don't know why I was so keen for melisa to come! but she got here eventually.. then off we went to the class.. as usual.. we have the 'sitting' problem! I HATE THAT! why can't they have chairs and tables in 3-s..   its evil I tell you.. so masa tgh.. am I to sit here or here.. I got malas (coz I don't want it to spoil my mood).. so I keluar class and asked them to pick sendiri.. when I got back, zaty was sitting next to diana.. typical.. so I sat there alone.. then got my mood down.. so the whole time everybody is taking their places.. the chair next to mine remains empty.. like it has always been.. (is this a sign of sumthing??)  so for the whole time I was just masam jer.. I didn't want to talk.. I was sad! tgk semua org ada all their little friendsies next to them.. how I wished atikah's (and mine) sarcasm was with me then.. give mercy! it was soo boring..  and then the most shocking thing happen! plus embarrassing! shahrul and omar came late to class.. like 30 minutes late or sumthing! AND THERE WAS NO OTHER PLACE LEFT TO SIT! to make matters worth! everybody (particularly melisa and farah, diana and zaty) kept asking the teacher to put him next to me.. at the empty chair NEXT TO ME! OMG! he hesitated.. I neglected! it was such an embarrassing moment! and when he sat down next to me! EVERYBODY CHEERED OUT REALLY LOUD! (since we played truth-or-dare, a few number of poeple know about my crush) so tehy cheered loud! LAMA! I was BLOOD RED! nad shaking.. I felt like exploding! we were both embarrassed and can do NOTHING about it! ARGH!!  then the tecaher asked omar to sit one table with him.. making him shift more closer to me! OWH MY GOD!! I'm just like.. 'o..k.. omar.. ur not fat.. right?' omar kept nidging him to go further inside.. I was just sitting there.. feeling like the main attraction of a show in the zoo! everybody laughed and cheered for me! one more time and I swear I'll go KA-BOOM!  nawal said that omar was only 'kacau daun'.. what! no way! so it just got really awkward at first! I was staring at my book, pretending to read.. but my mind is still frozen after the shock! need gumballs!  after a while or so.. we got ok.. we started to talk.. not like.. 'so hows ur day' talk.. more of a 'have a read pen?' talk.. but its ok I guess.. after we finished.. he wished me luck for my jamming and like.. ARGH! naik giler! I was happy when I got home.. (not becuase of the fact that he sat next to me ok guys.. the fact that he said things to me)  ok so thats it! it was a happy day for me! honest! more over after the jamming! IT ROCKS!  - 'cikgu.. letak dia kat situ cikgu!','cikgu kat situ kosong!','cikgu, dia nak duduk situ cikgu','cikgu, tu makwa dia cikgu!' PUH-LEASE!!"

KAFTLPZ,female,25,so who wants to talk some spiritual talk?
KAFTLPZ,female,25,"Check out Brian's link. He is going to be with Immersion on Saturday June 19th and the 26th as host for the evening. He has a wealth of knowledge we need to glean and be challenged with.  Also, below is the link to his book recommendations.... some of them look really interesting for me, I thought you might like to check out what the emerging church leaders are reading to inspire their passion.  http://www.anewkindofchristian.com/recommendations.html"
KAFTLPZ,female,25,"Okay, so after digesting our most recent (and very weird) Immersion session, I wanted to blog something.  Isn't it interesting how, depending on the group of people we're with, we seem to shift back and forth between being ""conservative Christians"" to being no-good-dirty-hippie-liberal-heretical beatniks. Hmm. It seems as though we all had someone in our small groups (did I mention I hate small groups?) that really believed the best way to spend 50 billion dollars was to translate bibles into every language and then set forth into the world converting people, in hopes that before the poverty-stricken, homeless, starving, 3rd world peoples of our globe  DIE , we can convert them to Christianity. HMM. So.... Okay, I get it. We should also make sure that the money is spent nourishing the good Christian missionaries who do this, so that they are healthy and fed and physically ready to take on this task. THEN, when they get there, they can dangle their foot-long meatball sub in front of bloated ethiopian children and tell them that if they promise to believe in Jesus, they'll get a sandwich!!   Wha? Alright, so I  don't  get it. I argued with my mother about this when I explained the service (and the aftermath) to her. I often argue with my mother about Immersion. She's disappointed in me because I'm into all this ""new-age crap.""  Isn't a better example of God to care for the needy without putting requirements on it? To love unconditionally? Wouldn't it represent our Most High God BEST if we let our beliefs shine through our actions? I'm not saying we should never mention Jesus or pretend that we're something we're not. But wouldn't someone who hasn't eaten in weeks and sleeps in the mud rather see random foreign people giving away food, clothing, medicines instead of listening to strangers preach at them about a God they've never heard of? Look how pretty our God is... he has blond hair and blue eyes and speaks with a lovely british accent.  But then, I guess that's just me JUDGING these other Christians. Now its someone's turn to judge me for judging them. Then I can judge you back for judging me for judging them.  What would Jesus do with 50 Billion dollars?  neohippie"
KAFTLPZ,female,25,"After digesting the discussion on saturday I thought that I would give my perspective on the topic clip.  When I first saw the Animatrix, Matriculated jumped out as something that was just ripe with Immersion-style content.  In fact I felt that the clip was a handy metaphor for the Immersion dynamic.  The first important factor which may not have been made absolutely clear in the selection itself was the setting.  Being that it takes place in the world of The Matrix, the machines and the humans are in a state of war.  Those humans we saw in the clip were only in their position after having escaped imprisonment by the machines.  They all had existed in a world that was FORCED upon them by the machines in order to keep them enslaved.  Even with this in mind they still choose to try to create a dialouge with their mechanical counterparts as a means of creating resolve.  The basic form of interaction between the human and the machine is to seek to kill the other for their own survival.  The idea that this small renegade band is struggling to find peace in the midst of such chaos was a worthwhile discussion in and of itself.  We the viewer witness one encounter between these humans and a pair of scouting machines.  It is implied that the machines are scouting for the purpose of eradicating the humans (the transmitter being placed to summon reinforcements).  When the humans gain the upper hand, they manage to take one of the invaders hostage (with the help of a machine fighting and giving its life on the side of the human cause).  This begins our focal point for the story.  What follows is an attempt on the part of the humans to communicate with (not reprogram) the machine mind.    The director specifically states in an interview that the method used was that of the human dream state.  He also clarifies that the machine represents a 'rigid mind', an unbending mentality rather than simply a 'robot'.   The protagonists of the story had to create a common ground in order to inact a constructive dialouge.  They had to envision a 'language' which they could use to reach those who would seek to destroy them.  The war metaphors being used here are to exagerate the problem at hand.  How do we communicate with someone/thing different from ourselves?  They make the point that coersion is ultimately useless because to force is just another way to destroy.  If they can find a common ground with the machines, only then will there be hope for peace.   The peice is concluded with a very important image.  It is the machine waiting on the shoreline in same place where it first encountered the woman in the beginning.  To me this was the most telling part.  After all was finished, and everyone on both sides lay dead, this lone machine carried on the same vigil of the humans he had destroyed.  There can be no more certain way to show the decision made by that machine.  No one was left to pressure, coerce, threaten or controll him and he still chose to wait on that beach to show the next one the things he had learned.  I thought this was so applicable because as christians we fall into the same patterns.  We tend to try and fight or reprogram those who believe differently than us rather than find a common ground and share experiences in order to communicate and find peace."

KAFTLPZ,female,25,"I was sitting with my thoughts one day, thinking about some of the different paths I visited and these thoughts started rolling something like this...  What would you say if today was the day that you didn't see tomorrow? Where would you go?   How do you know?     Who would you see?       Did he hang from a tree? Some people say there's a shiny white light up at the end of a tunnel. Now let me see the opposite would be getting sucked down a black funnel. Others have said your tied to a thread, your going to get recycled. A princess   A queen     A jellybean? You can't really mean things that aren't seen, go and get you frightened. Orange and red, a Lama once said ""time to get enlightened"". Follow your bliss was really a miss, addictions get real boring. Try follow your fear, for it draws you nearer to the lessons that are adoring. Nirvana was the scene, if you know what I mean. His music led to disaster. Don't waste your time standing on a life line, shortcuts are always faster. If you are cool, yogas the rule, stretching isn't traggic. Be a goddess instead but don't lose your head, witchcraft is really magic. The prince of thieves is disquised as these, laughing all the way to the bank. All you must do is get a clue, assurance is what you seek. I know there are times, TBN signs, people that look like freaks. Don't be misled, the book should be read, the contents may surprise you. It speaks of a man, who walked the land, parables were his bag baby. The headlines read, 5000 fed, he rose the dead, he also said,"" I am the way, the truth, and the life"". With his healing touch, lepers lost there spots, the blind were made to see. The message was clear for all to hear, he'd come to set us free. The court of the day, in a media way, just like today, had their way.   They said that he lied.     Let him be crucified!       Hammers fell,         pungent smells,           crimson tears fell on deaf ears.              They pierced his side.                 He let out a cry. Forgive them Father, for it was no bother, I'd do it again to save all men. My blood on the cross, was no loss, it has set things straight. In three short days, I'll stand at the gate and wait. Now that you know, will you go with the flow? Take the time to bust a ryhme. Or won't you please,    fall to your knees,      and take hold of the hand,       the hand of the man,         the Holy Lamb of Galilee."
KAFTLPZ,female,25,"How did you first hear of Immersion (Saturday night meetings/community)? When did you decide you wanted to be part of it? What does it mean to you? What do you look forward to when you go? What do you dread?   This Saturday night we want to think about the Immersion narrative. In a way, it is many different narratives, because we all have different stories. But what is the one common story that holds us together? Granted, we are now writing the first chapter, but still something is beginning to emerge. We love each other, enjoy being together, and sometimes even find as much fun and benefit from the things that fail as the things that succeed.   If you have a story, email it to me or else respond to this blog. It would be really nice if I heard from you by this evening (Friday, or tomorrow morning at the latest).   Thanks!   obg"
KAFTLPZ,female,25,"I have an idea that when longblogs (I mean it as one word) show up ... like the last one of mine,  Emergence-y!  ... some people may take it as though the writer's intent was, ""Well! That about sums it up. No more to be said. (And don't even try, please.)""  Even if that were so (it shouldn't be), I hope everyone would see  any  posting as never really ""done,"" more like an opportunity for thought and reflection, tasting and sampling; if it's a long post, then it can be a buffet table, a sort of smorgasblog where you can select any little tidbit that strikes your taste. Maybe none of it; maybe only one word or turn of phrase, or a single illustration.  But you can add to the thoughts, as many do, and surely you have insights that no one else has. A painting is always more than the artist intends, music more than the composer or musicians express, words more than writer may think is being said. One person may offer some thoughts;  you  have opportunity and insight to open any of those and take others still deeper, a door whose inside is bigger than the outside.  Is it about who has the last word? Maybe it's that  no one  has the last word, there's always more to explore and express. If I go on for pages, you could take the smallest phrase and open it for others to your own insights, wider and deeper than all of it together!  the well's mouth is small, the ocean's face so endless. but how deep? immerse.  ---seussac"
GQ4CPVF,male,24,So guess what?  Well guess?  Hello take an effin guess?  Anyway I got a 99% on my law exam!  I am the top notch b'otch!  So anyway I get a letter saying that I am past due on a medical bill.  Whatever I pay my bills.  I had to not go to school to take care of this.  But I overslept to until like 2pm.  They are greedy evil troll whores who work at the hospital.  Now I am on a payment plan and have to pay interest to the billing trolls they use at the hospital because they are too cheap to send out a bill each month at the hospital.  I have to pay some company that is somehow crackwhore troll related MCS...they are a third party billing company.  How come they get to get monies and aren't even involved.  I didn't agree to be paying another company for my surgery.  Show me the monies.  Shit...I'll send my own self a bill for 1.5% interest a month.  But get over it Paul it must be paid.  Sick em'...sick em'...sick em' and kill em' Joan Crawford.....beat them with wire money...never with wire money.  I want to write you a po em' about Joan.  I will improv.   Wire Hangers are the bomb   Joan Joan you were the best You could beat with a hanger and past the test.  Never with a wire hanger is all I remember Like a winter memory in December.  Comet Cleanser was your fav Wire dancer at a rav.  Bondage baby was your thing Tying people up with string.  Though crazy you had been Wire hangers were your sin.  Tried to blame it on the maid You seriously needed to be laid.  Anger anger is all we saw Hoping you would get lock jaw.  Everyday a little sicker You really needed a coochie licker.  Frustrated with the idea of sex Caused this wire hanger hex.  You should have gotten it on much sooner Did it to you reached the lunar.  Then all would have been good No wire hangers just fire wood.

GQ4CPVF,male,24,"I'm so going to Cleveland   Because Patrick is there and he doesn't think I'm hideous as does the rest of the internet population.  Damn chatrooms.   Does anyone remember...   The show with Muffy the Mouse who lived in a penthouse inside a department store.  There was a magic maniquin and the security guard was a puppet.  And there was this black lady with really bad jericurl taking care of the toy department.  If so please leave the name on my comments because it drives me crazy that I can't think of the name.    Aside from that Muffy rocked!  She was a cute little gray puppet rodent with blonde hair and buck teeth.  She is my hero.  Plus the vact that she had an elevator in her house...damn now that's living.  It is so frigid outside.  I have a feeling mother nature isn't going to be so sparing with the ""coming of the precipitation.""  The newscasters say that it should most likely be rain on the local weather.  (Note:  The local weather in WV is basically a really fat and middle aged man guessing).  The weather channel says however, that there will me ""muchos de hielo"" or a lot of ice.  Anyway you look at it tomorrow will be shitty.  I'm not expecting more than the ""dark and gloomies.""  And yes I have to travel in the bullshit to get a CT Scan on my sinuses.  That should be buckets-o-fun.     My two cents...   So I find that a lot of people find 50 Cent attractive.  Am I the only one that thinks he could be the fourth ""Chipmunk?""

No your mouth is not bigger than the Mississippi is wide...keep that pit closed. 3.  No you actually are the ugliest monster I have ever seen...Beauty and the Beast is touring...have an audition?  I am really being hard on these people.  I mean yeah they must have something I am lacking...""looking fucked up in public.""  Whooo!  Jesus I know I should not be judging people but holy hell Batman these people bring me some night tremors.

GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Feet of Stone   Last night I headed out to Baltimore to see my Aunt Velma and help her make a diaper cake that is actually made with diapers and baby stuff.  Also we were making shower favors.  I love making chocolate.  So I have redeemed my ""doing of something stereotypically gay"" card for the month.  Anyway on my way home I got a damn speeding ticket.  I was clocked going 87 in a 65.  But I was clocked 2421.3 ft away from the actual cop car.  What the fuck?  Anyway, I have to go to court to try to fight the damn thing.  It is a $275 fine and 5 points.  I hope that points don't transfer from Maryland to West Virginia if they don't let me out of the ticket.  I am buying a radar/laser detector.  I am feeling much better.  My mouth is still a little sore but that did not stop me from going to Rockville to China Canteen to get Shrimp Chow Foon...yummy indeed.  I spent almost $40 at the Asian Market.  I am falling in love with that place.  I bought guava juice, herb green tea, milk tea, some flowery tea, roasted duck (for my father), chopsticks, chow foon, Taiwanese candy and cookies, tea eggs, and some other things I can't think of but all in all I'm set for a while.  Other than making a diaper cake, chocolates, getting a speeding ticket, and eating/shopping asian style nothing has changed.  Oh...and...um...I'm going to write soon about what happened in the Blazer last Saturday night.  Let's just say it will take some courage to spill the beans on who was involved...I was there, Cheri was there, Michael was there, and another guy was there.  Out of the four two couldn't believe what they saw before them and the other two had fun.  What type of fun you will just have to wait to find out.  Lata people."

GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Hello my little Christmas elves!  Hoping everyone was able to get what they wanted for Christmas and some more.  I made out pretty well this year.  I got perfume from Ms. Pat, a bonsai tree from Samantha, a baset from Tricia, 300 dollars, two shirts, movies, an alarm clock, bed spread, curtains, and pillow cases from my parents.  I'm redoing my room in Aaliyah.  It should be nifty!  Black, white and turquoise.  I am sooooooo tired.  I have to work today but the money is good so I'm not complaining.  It's snowing bundles outside.  Guess what I have a story that is quite funny and I think that you would enjoy.  So April is bringing me home last night on river road and we pass what looks like a dead dog.  Well she goes in reverse and we find that it's a baby deer.  So we leave and trudge on down the snow covered road.  Then we pass another animal dead and covered with snow.  You guessed it it was a deer again.  So I told April that we were in the frozen food isle.  Get it frozen food...deer meat!  Ha...aha!  So I am totally in love with Lilo and Stitch the Disney movie.  It is fabulous!  My love that one!  My favorite part is when Stitch claps and laughs when the one guy sets the stage on fire!  Darien, the little boy April takes care of on the weekends reinacts that scene everytime he sees it.  It is hilarious!  I don't have much to say today because it's Christmas and I'm tired and need to take a nap before going to work!  So I talk to you all later!  Bye bye....and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!"
GQ4CPVF,male,24,Rule of thumb   Never think anything is easy to do.  Especially raising a 7wk old puppy.  While she has lots of energy and love she is a handful.  I've been so consumed with her that I haven't done much of anything else.  I haven't talked online to anyone (Ralphy) or even called anyone to see what's up.  So a big I'm sorry to those of you who I've been neglecting.  Last night I made the mistake of letting Prissy go to sleep by 9pm and we were up by 5am.  Plus the fact that we slept all day because my sinus' are still a mess and I'm just not feeling too well.  Other than that I do enjoy having Prissy with me.  I need to learn how to let her stay alone for a while like in another room so she doesn't get too attached to me.  It breaks my heart to hear her yelp or cry but she stops in a matter of like 10 mins.  Mom said I have to do this so when I'm at work she isn't going crazy looking for me.  So I'm hoping that Ralphy will be online tonight and Prissy will let me talk to him for a while.    If not there's always tomorrow.
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"You make me want to...   Fucking scream at the top of my lungs.  Who could this person be?  Hmmm.  My supervisor J.  Jesus Christ man give spying on people a break.  Everytime you are doing something crazy (i.e. the cabbage-patch, the running man, the roger rabbit, droppin it to the floor) there his ass is.  But if you need to see him to have him do something for you he is MIA.  And aside from him being grotesquely Peppy Lepewish (black hair, grey line running down the middle...serious here) he has the humor of a bundt cake.  Although a bundt cake tastes good.  I really need to form my plan for world domination now...or it will never do anything to help humanity of people so colorless as him.  Ugh.  I have officially become a veggie-tarian again.  No animal in this body.  I have done very well today.  I had my Snapple tea this morning and water the rest of the day.  A rice cripsy treat, a garden salad, and some brocolli and cheddar soup.  Yay me.  See I'm planning on get my ""rock hard body"" on by this spring.  So I'm finally fed up with being Mr. McPlumpy.  Last time I was a vegetarian I lost 25 lbs in a month.  Hopefully history has learned to repeat itself in this instance.  Once again the fingernails are long again.  Have I cut them....NO!  But I did file and buff them today at work.  I'm the cliche of the ""California Receptionist.""  Thinking about getting a new tattoo Friday.  I took the day off so I'm calling to make an appointment tomorrow.

I'm just bored with thinking.  It would be great of me to think nice things all day but lately I've been at a loss.  Good God the song I'm listening to is ""Cry Me A River.""  Well I just need to build the bridge and get over it.  Right?  Anti-depressants just don't seem to work.  What is it with being depressed anyway? It's like I'm happy for so long but it just fades away and I'm in that shell again.  I don't know exactly what drags me down but something does.  Wether it be lonliness(companionship), my health or realizing what a big old addict I am.  I just don't know.  I told my mom today that I was attracted to another guy.  I have no clue how I had the courage to do it but I did.  I expected a ""click"" but she was okay it with as much as one can expect.  The thing is I don't want to define my sexuality.  I mean I find myself attracted to all kinds of people.  Male or Female it just doesn't matter to me.  I don't really want a relationship, which my parents say would do me wonders.  I wish I could just pop out of this mood.  Today has been an awful day of feening.  It's amazing the cage drugs builds around your thoughts.  When you try to concentrate on something you always seem to be distracted.  What I wouldn't give for some mental clarity.  I almost feel like I've been on a binge and I'm strung out.  But I'm not.  Pain management or the better word rehab starts on October 27th.  Hopefully this will have a positive effect on me.  Mom told me today that my doctor knew I was addicted to pain killers or what have you before she even told him.  See I knew people could tell it's just I didn't want to face it myself.  But time changes and I guess you finally ""wake up"" or whatever the quote is.  I'm really glad I'm lucky enought to have woken up at such an early age.  I couldn't imagine being a junkie in his late 30's and be worth noghting or ever worse dead.  But such is life...sa la vie.  At least I know I have friends and family that are cool with being there for me.   They have been there for a long time it's just that I've ignored the problem.  No more hiding this time...right?"

LLWIYFP,male,43,"The Gap is Wide...and Expanding, I'm Afraid!  Yesterday, I talked about fellowship, connecting with the Body of Christ, belonging, etc. I made the statement that we in the ""modern"" church world focus almost primarily on ""going to church."" That is, we measure faithfulness by how often/how long you are physically in the building. I used Andy Stanley's great illustration of ""sitting in rows, looking at the backs of other people's heads"" and how the New Testament doesn't emphasize that. At the conclusion of the service, one of our ladies came by and said, ""I guess I won't see you Wednesday, since we don't have to come to church anymore, huh?"" I said something like, ""Don't come if you've got some real ministry to do. That would be a whole lot better!"" I'm not so sure she ""got it"" - or even wanted to."

I thought - maybe naively - that we'd be a little closer to achieving our objectives by now. Just a hunch, a gut feeling - totally uninformed, of course - but it seems to me if it goes on like this much longer, we're going to be in a real quagmire that we can't easily get out of. If we're going to lay siege to Baghdad, as some seem to think, and not go in and take it swiftly, we're setting ourselves up for a whole new slew of problems. Then what are we going to do? Just pack it in at the end of a long, drawn-out campaign, and say, ""Oh, well. We didn't really mean it this time, either. Thanks for playing. What's the consolation prize for the Iraqis, Johnny?""

I know, I know...I blogged about it a couple of weeks ago! I should have finished it way before now, but I didn't. So sue me!  Anyway, at the end, in the ""acknowledgements"" section, he talks about some guy who challenged him to ""write a page a day."" I Googled for  urlLink ""one page a day,""  which led me to Roberta Jean Bryant's    urlLink Anybody Can Write   .  She talks about starting and using a journal to hone your skills for writing. She challenges to write a page a day. At the end of the article, she says...   ""Write honestly. Risk nakedness. Originality equals vulnerability.  I like what Jessamyn West says about being a writer: ""To be a writer, you have to first stick your neck out and take a chance and then be willing to make a fool of yourself and give yourself away."" A journal provides a safe place to practice doing just that.      A journal is a place to detail all the little happinesses and document all the large delights of your unique life. A place to have fun. And a place for magic. Magic happens when one engages in regular and long-term involvement with oneself in words on paper. Journals need not be grim or boring. Expressing the joys of your life, appreciating what's good today, playing with ideas - all are potentially magical.""   I think she could be talking about bloggers, except bloggers kind of hope people will find their blogs. I guess, don't you?  Imagine the potential (but probably not the reality!) of millions of people - some you know, some you don't know; some close by, some halfway 'round the world - reading the stuff you thought was important enough to throw up there. You do have to stick your neck out a bit and make a fool of yourself.   I used to enjoy writing, just for the sake of writing. I never had any grand illusions (or is that delusions?) that I was any good at it. I just knew I enjoyed it. I remember writing a silly little poem called ""The Turkey from Albuquerque"" when I was in about the second grade. I don't have any clue now what the New Mexican turkey did. I just remember writing it.  I remember ""publishing"" the ""Odd Sane Dog,"" a pencil-driven newsletter for third-graders.  I remember in the seventh grade, getting published for the first time! The  urlLink SBC    Youth A   Sunday School quarterly published my poem ""Behold the Man."" Woo hoo! Big stuff!  I remember writing a screenplay - of sorts, based on George Orwell's    urlLink 1984    for a video project in my senior year in high school. (Oh, did I mention I acted in the film, too? Yeah, cool!)  I remember finding the two errors in the college-writing exemption test. As I took it. The summer before my freshman year.  I remember getting the job as the assistant news editor at my  urlLink college paper . I remember the first time my byline appeared. I even got a check for that bit of writing.  I remember sitting in the shoe store in the mall, on slow days, writing about ""Christopher Michael Sinclair"" in my version of the next ""Great American Novel."" Uh huh, right.  To write truly is to stick your neck out, to risk being laughed at, humiliated, or worse, ignored. To blog is, in my mind, much the same thing. What starts out as being ""cool,"" or ""the thing to do,"" ends up lighting the fire, or stoking the embers, whichever is the case.   I'm going to commit to ""a page a day.""

I'm gonna be loudy.  I'm loudy.   (screams)  Loudy.   (screams again)   I'm gonna be loudy.  I did be quiet but now I'm loudy.  My teddy bear's not here. He's at home.  We're not going home. We're going to the clinic.  We're going to get my stomach out.  Brother's not going to get a shot.  I'm getting a shot.  Are we driving?  Are we driving in the rain?  Mama?  Are we driving?  I wanna get down.  I'm done.  I wanna get doooooooown!  (whining now)  I'm DONE!!! I'm DONE!!!  I'm DONE!!!   Me:  You can't get down till the car has stopped.   RK:  The car is stopped.  The car is stopped.  Is the car stopped?  We're driving to the clinic?  Mama?  I want some fruity snacks.  I want some fruity snacks.  (now singing)  I want some fruity snacks.  I want some fruity snacks.  (getting louder)  I want some fruity snacks!  I want some fruity snacks! I WANT SOME FRUITY SNACKS!!!   Me:  We don't have any.   RK:  I want some.  I want some fruity snacks. We have some.  We have fruity snacks.  I want some.  Whatchya talk to, Mama?   Me:  Bad drivers.   RK:  Bad drivers?  Them's bad drivers?  Where?  I see them.  Bad drivers. You talked bad drivers?  Mama?  I see them.  Them's bad.  I have a tummy ache.  I have a tummy ache.  I want some fruity snacks.  I need some.  I want some.  Where's Daddy?   Me:  Reilly, you need to use your ears more and your mouth less.   RK:  Yeah,  I need to use my ears.  I use 'em.  Them's there.  I can't eat them.  I can't eat my ears.  I can eat my lips.  I can eat my boogers.  I can't eat my ears.  I have ears, though. I can't use 'em.        Need I go on?    The funny part is when strangers come up to the cute little thing.  Like at the clinic.  A woman came up to her and started a conversation simply by saying, ""Is that your brother?""  And Reilly Kate says:   ""Yeah.  I have an eyeball.  I have an armpit.  Brother has poops.  Mama got a shot.  Did you get a shot?  It's a boo boo.  The doctor's gonna take out my stomach.  I can't take off my fingers.  Them's stuck.   (pulling her fingers)   I can't get them off.  I can't get off my head.  My neck is stuck  (pulls on her neck)   I can't get my head off my neck.  I have a throat.  And a stomach.  I have fruity snacks but my pink teddy bear is at home.  Mama won't drive back home.  My daddy is at work.  His back hurts.  He's got a bad back.  My baby poked my eyeball.  I have an eyeball.""   I'm thinking perhaps she can get a job in talk radio.  I listened to that dick Hannity today and Reilly Kate actually made more sense.  Maybe Hannity ate his ears.  Ya think?"
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"One of the first things that you notice when you become a mother is that while the job has some nice perks (slobbery kisses and soft baby snuggles are just a couple), time off is nonexistent.    Everyone knows there are sleepless nights involved, but no one thinks of getting sick.  If you get sick, you just suck it up and keep nursing, changing diapers, doing laundry, wiping chocolatey mouths and the hundreds of other daily chores that become almost painful while suffering the effects of whatever virus has come to roost.  And those viruses come more often when you have children in the house.    Children are moist breeding grounds with a deeply embedded bacterial magnet.  They are not just germ factories, they are more often than not Patient Zero.  So while you are caring for your sick child, they lovingly share (as you have been repeatedly telling them to do) and within hours you are suffering the same symptoms.   My friend Holly lived this a couple weeks ago.  She was comforting her 10 month old son when he baptized her in virulent puke.  In a matter of mere hours she was worshipping at the porcelain altar, catching quick little naps while laying on the cold tile of her bathroom.  Her son, in contrast, slept in peaceful comfort having rid himself of what ailed him.  He didn't just share.  He  gave .  Holly was less than proud.  The same goes for vacation time.  There is no such thing as a vacation when you are a mother.  Say you spend thousands of dollars on a tropical family trip.  Do you honestly think there will be any REST or RELAXATION for Mom in that R&R?  Nope.  In fact, family vacations are actually MORE work for Mom.   First, a mother must pack up everything packable.  Let's just talk clothing for example.  If you are gone 6 days, you'll need 9 pairs of pajamas per child (one for each day plus three extras in case of accidents).  A minimum of fifteen daytime outfits per child (that's 2 per day plus three extra in case of accidents).  Then you'll need several bathing suits per child and swim diapers if you are putting your little ones in the water.  Oh, and don't forget the shoes.  A pair of gym shoes, a pair of beach shoes, a pair of sandals, and their slippers.  That's four pairs -- per child.  Undergarments.  Well, just bring as many as you own if your child is not way, way, WAY past potty training.  Accidents always seem to happen when they are least convenient.  A hot, sticky, sandy beach with only a filthy 60 year old public bathroom used mainly by vagrants sums up inconvenient.  And that is just for clothing.  Then there are diapers and burp cloths, wipes and ointment, pacifiers, strollers and a sling, the Pack and Play, carseats, a breastpump and bottles, the baby food maker, sunblock, floaties, toys, toys, books, and toys, blankies, baby shampoo, a first aid kit, and DVDs.  Let's not forget Dad's golf clubs, either.  He is, afterall, on vacation.   Who ever set the airlines' 50lb per bag limit never went on vacation with children.  Wanna know what Mom gets to pack with that strict limit?  A frumpy skirted bathing suit, a toothbrush, and a t-shirt that reads, ""I [heart] Mom.""  This past week, I've been both suffering from a cold inherited from my generous children and packing up 30% of our household goods for a week long R&R.  Jail time with Martha Stewart is looking better every day."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"Ya know, when one person in the house is sick or in some way incapacitated (such as Mike with this back thing), it throws everything off in the household.  It is like getting lost in your own neighborhood and you're not sure where the map is.  That's how I feel, at least.  Laundry piles up, dishes sit in the sink, and the kids are restless.    But we're plugging along.  Mike's back is still pretty bad and he's losing patience with it.  I feel for him.  I do.  Reilly Kate is... well... Reilly Kate.  Her newest bizarre thing is slapping my stomach and saying, ""Fat belly.  Fat belly.  Fat belly.""  I guess that is supposed to be motivating.  I downed three pints of Ben and Jerry's this weekend, though, so I'm not sure how effective she's really being.  She's started learning to steer her tricycle which is a huge relief to me.  I was starting to think she'd be 27 and still on training wheels, crashing into garbage cans while singing Twinkle Twinkle and wondering why the bike doesn't steer itself.    Roman is just about ready to crawl.  He's on the cusp of it.  He's mobile now with his scooting and rolling.  But the crawling is just a couple weeks off.  It seems he was slow to start, but he's exploded in development all of a sudden.  I'm convinced he is going to be painfully shy.  Today when faced with a baby girl a couple days older, he responded to her infant wails of joy with true, fearful tears.  He just cried and cried.  After comforting him, I sat him back up near her and he put his head down to his toes and cried some more.  Poor thing.  Girls scare him.  Of course they do.  Look at his sister.  I'd be scared too if she was the only girl I'd ever experienced.    Anyway, like I said.  It's hard to get back into the swing.  Hopefully, we will soon and I'll be back to regular posting on this here blog.  Oh, I might have made a new friend this weekend.  Stay tuned for that story.  It's a good one."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"There is little doubt, in my mind at least, that motherhood is fattening.  And as far as I know, there is no low carb version.  I was never really fat until becoming a mother.  Sure, I had had an encounter or two (more like 23) with unfriendly scales before, but it took motherhood to get me my membership in the Obesity Club.  It all started when I got that plus sign on the pregnancy test.  I was so excited that I simply had to celebrate with my two best buds: Ben & Jerry.  I didn't toast with champagne, instead I ate two pints of Chunky Monkey with a Chubby Hubby chaser.  Afterall, I did need to increase my calcium intake.  Strong bones and teeth and all that.  I quit smoking cold turkey so I also quit running.  The way I saw it, if I was no longer slowly poisoning my cardiovascular system with tobacco, then there was no need for me to kill myself on a treadmill.  I was even steven.  Besides, pregnancy has it's own aches and pains.  Why add to it with all that needless exercise?  When the queasiness of morning sickness popped in on me, I treated it to a full on banquet.  I stuffed everything in my mouth.  Nothing was too heavy or greasy for this sufferer.  Most people when sick to their stomach refuse to eat or they eat lightly.  No, not me.  When sick, I must eat, and eat  good  food.  I once spent the night in the ER hooked up to IV fluids since I couldn't keep even water down.  When discharged, I went home and demanded my mom order me a pizza.    ""No,"" she said incredulously.  ""You can have some broth and saltines.""  I negociated my way up to a package of ramen noodles to which I added some ham and two slices of cheese when she wasn't looking.  I also grabbed several Pop Tarts, a box of Little Debbie brownies, and some Cheezits for dessert.  Hey, I was sick!  I needed to feel better and some shitty hot water bullion and crackers made of dried paste just wasn't going to cut it.  It didn't cut it when I was a kid with the stomach flu and it didn't cut it when I was (almost) a mom and miserable from the HCG poisoning my body suffered from for the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.  I basically ate nonstop right through the first trimester.  Oh, and forget diet pop.  No way was I going to expose my precious unborn child to potentially harmful chemicals.  Instead, I drank so much high fructose corn syrup that my pancreas went into shock I and developed Gestational Diabetes.  No surprise then, that precious babe was born so fat that she didn't need to gain any weight for 6 full weeks.  I gained 10lbs every month.  Month after month, for nine full months.  You do that math.  I was so big that when my friend Holly came to visit us, her husband Ron took one look at me and said, ""Well, I guess we don't have to go anywhere for whale watching.""    When I went home for my baby shower, my great, great, great aunt Doris (thin as a rail since she never had children) greeted everyone as they walked in the door with, ""Look out!  She's as big as a house!"" whispered as loud as a lion's roar.  She later embraced me in a fragile hug and said, ""Don't worry, honey.  That weight'll come right off.  I've seen 'em all blow up like you.  Well, maybe not that big.  But they lost the weight.  You will, too.""  And that's where they get you.  Everyone tells you that the weight will just ""melt right off"" after the baby is born.  Especially if you are breastfeeding.  Weightloss is touted as one of the magic benefits to breastfeeding by that lying Le Leche League.  Yeah, right.  And my tits are the size of mosquito bites and produce White Russians after 9pm.  The truth is that a nursing mother's body holds on to fat ""like a bulldog to a bone,"" as my friend Michelle puts it.  You could eat nothing but lettuce and egg whites, exercise like an Olympic athlete in training, and pump yourself up on caffeine.  The only results you'll see is stomach upset, shin splints, and a cranky baby that only sleeps 10 minutes at a time due to the caffe latte coming from your udders.   It's some kind of evolved protection mechanism, to safeguard against famine.  Fat is like money in the bank and I got lots of twinkie investments stored up on my ass just in case the locusts descend upon Safeway.  My offspring and I could live off the interest of Doritos and Cherry Garcia for six complete months.  I guess I can take pride that in a ""survival of the fittest"" world, I would beat out Deborah Messing or Gwyneth Paltrow.  They and their offspring would shrivel and turn to dust since they didn't bank their food.  Silly ninnies.  There are those who encourage mothers to embrace and celebrate their new, softer, rounder bodies.  I will admit that if I were my child I would love that saggy piece of flesh that once was my abdomen.  It's so soft it's almost fluffy and makes the perfect pillow for watching Dora the Explorer.  I, however, am less than pleased.  I am not a pillow, I am a person.  I may be a mother, but I am also a woman who wants to be attractive.  I am human and I seek approval from society.  I need to be a normal weight.  I need to be a normal size again.  The time has come to buckle down.  All this extra baggage around my middle is only going to come off one way and it will be a hard road to success.  I know if I just stay the course, be persistent, unrelenting, and determined, I can achieve my dream.  Our dream.  The Fat Mamas' Dream.  We overweight mothers need to band together and work toward one goal:  Government Funded Plastic Surgery!!!  Ha.  You thought I was going to say ""lose weight.""  Like I said, that ain't happening.  Been there.  Done that.  Got the stretchmarks.  That weight isn't going to just melt off.  As long as I'm still nursing, the only thing that is melting around here is my Ben & Jerry's Half Baked.  I need to learn to eat quicker."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"Tonight, before saying night time prayers, Reilly Kate and I lit up a guardian angel candle that I'd bought Roman for his christening.  We had some extra special prayers to send up tonight, so the candle was important.  And Reilly was very impressed.  Immediately, once it was lit, she began singing Happy Birthday.  In her years of experience (2 years to be exact), candles are lit when birthdays are celebrated.  No matter I had been telling her that we would light the candle to give our prayers that little added something.  She still thought ""Birthday.""  I stopped her and then said, ""Ni-Night prayers, Baby.  Let's start...""  The she clasped her hands together and put her chin to her fingers and began:    ""Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep Angels watch me through the night And wake me with the morning light.""  As always, she closed with:  ""God bless GG.  Make her well.  Amen.""  Then I told her we had to say some additional prayers for GG since she is really not feeling very well.  For those that don't know, ""GG"" is my Grandma Mallow (""GG"" stands for ""Great Grandma""). And GG is quite ill with a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome heading into leukemia.  She's been in the hospital for a week and we will find out tomorrow whether she'll be able to go home and continue with her current medicinal regiment or whether she'll be staying in the hospital for a month long mega-chemo session.   When I talked to her today, her sole request was to ""keep those prayer wheels spinning.""  So as promised, here I knelt with my young child in front of a burning candle, rusty on prayer, rustier on faith, and feeling a bit awkward.  ""Please, God, help GG feel better,"" I prayed and prodded.  ""Reilly, would you like to pray for GG, too?""  ""God bless GG.  Make her well,"" was her response, eyes wide and focused on the candle's flame, looking a little unsure.  ""Yes, make her well.  We love her and want her around for boat rides and golfing, buttons and the chicken dance, vacations to the far East and Ireland and snorkeling, gardening and quilting, floating in the lake..."" my mind drifted off and I paused for a moment to choke back all the things still left to do with my daughter and her GG.    ""God bless GG.  Make her well,"" she repeated with familiarity and uncertainty.  She saw my eyes welling up with tears.  This certainly was not our usual night time prayers.  I took a deep breath, then, and searched for words to explain to Reilly Kate that we had one more important prayer to add.  My friend Tami had just attended a memorial service in a labor and delivery room.  A baby boy whose family attends Tami's church was born still.  He never saw the world, the bright lights, the vivid colors.  He never took a breath.  He never cried.  Or laughed.  He never would look up at his Mama with a milky smile and a poopy diaper.  He would never grow to be a man.  How do you tell that to a young child?  ""We need to pray for Baby Louie, Reilly Kate.  Baby Louie had to go to heaven to be with God and his mama and daddy and sisters are very sad because they miss him,"" I explained.  ""Uh huh.  Them's sad.""  Reilly Kate, hands still clasped in prayer, nodded.  ""Yes, they are.  But we need to pray that their sadness goes away because baby Louie is in a good place with God.  Even though they will always miss him, we pray that their sadness goes away.""  I felt like I was fumbling.  Not sure what to pray for or how to relate it to a child as young and tender as Reilly.  ""Uh huh.  Them's sad.""   I had her then bless herself and blow out the candle.  I thought she would be excited about blowing out the candle, but she remained somber and quiet.  As she hopped into bed, she looked at me and with a huge smile asked, ""GG feel better now, Mama?""  ""Oh, I don't know, Reilly Kate.  I hope so.  But I'm not sure.""  ""Yeah.  Yeah, she feels better.  She feels better.""  She responded with a confidence that one could only describe as faith.  Pure and untarnished faith.  A faith I haven't seen or felt in a long, long time.  ""And Baby Louie,"" she added, ""He's with Jesus now.  His Mama Daddy not sad anymore.   He's with Jesus.  Them's happy.""  With her faith wrapped warmly around her, she cuddled her dolly and snuggled down into her bed.  In minutes she was peacefully asleep.  To her, all is right with the world.    And really it is."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I hate bad drivers.  Before I had kids, bad drivers only irritated me, eliciting a string of profanity the likes of which would make a rapper blush.  Now that I travel with my most precious cargo every single day, I hate them.  And I mean ""hate"" with all that goes with the word.  Not as in ""I hate swiss cheese"" or ""I hate my hair.""  I mean ""hate"" as in I wish a pox upon their house.  Do you realize that every car passing you on the road, or traveling along side you, or behind you, even if for just a split second, has your life in their hands?  I cannot help but think of that.  I cannot even see their face, but I appreciate them driving responsibly so that my children can see another day.    When I was a teen, I used to make fun of those stupid ""Baby on Board"" signs that were so popular with parents in the 80s.  What the hell is that supposed to mean? I wondered.  Should I actually be more careful around that car than I normally would?  Ummmm... HELL FUCKING YEAH!  There's a BABY in the car!!!  Kids just don't get it.  I wasn't paying any attention when I was driving.  I was too busy checking the mirror to see if my AquaNet was withstanding the wind from my open window.  Or wondering which of my Swatches had the correct time while cranking up my Beastie Boys tape.  Or spritzing myself with Giorgio perfume despite the lit cigarette hanging from my mouth.   I'm sick of the drag racing. I'm sick of seeing cars with kids in control, driving out of control, at 90 or 100 miles an hour.  Fuck the Fast and the Furious.  I'm FAT and I'm FURIOUS and I'd like to kick some puny little teenage ass every time I'm forced to plead to GOD to spare my family from a fiery death.    The fact is the legal minimum driving age should be raised to 18, with an automatic suspension till 21 for anyone getting a moving violation.  Even for just 5 miles over the speed limit.  End of story.  And while we're on the topic of age, let's talk about the living dead out there behind the wheel.  With all due respect for the elderly, they should not be driving.  How many times have you been stuck behind a Cadillac the size of a Hummer doing 25 in a 55?  Or been cut off by a tiny ancient barely peeking over the steering wheel?  If they cannot read the menu at Denny's because they forgot their reading glasses at home, they shouldn't be driving to the Denny's in the first place.  Look, they raised their children in a much safer, more secure world than I'm raising mine.  Their grandparents weren't out careening through the neighborhood while their kids were riding bikes.  They should relinquish their license with dignity rather than have it forcibly taken from them after they mixed up the brake and the gas pedals.  Make the maximum age limit for driving 75 and give them all free bus passes.  Especially before those baby boomers all hit the road in their 80s.  I dread the thought of my parents cruising in a convertible with the Beach Boys blaring, unable to see the signs or the road or even the speedometer.  The worst offenders, however, are those that drive drunk.  Many of us have done it.  I did it once and will never, ever do it again.  I only drove less than a mile away but it was the scariest thing I've ever done.  No control whatsoever.  No matter how hard I tried to stay within my lane, I swerved.  And I wasn't even that drunk.  A couple of months ago, we took Reilly Kate and Roman to the zoo down in Waikiki.  As we were walking back to our car, a drunken man walked by.  He was so inebriated that he could not walk.  He fell down, stumbled on the grass, and criss crossed his feet as he went.  Mike and I said it was a good thing he was walking and not driving, but then we saw him reach into his pocket and retrieve his keys.  I was in such a state of rage I had to stop myself from stomping my hooves and charging him with the full force of my weight.  The only thing that really did stop me was Mike.  He kept insisting that there was no way a man that drunk would actually pull out and drive.  But then he did.  Drunk man started his car, pulled it out of its parking space, and drove off.    I called the cops with his license plate number and the direction he was heading.  They didn't find him.  Of course, they didn't.  I doubt they even put much effort into finding him.  You know if I hadn't put the full buck-25 into the meter, I'd be sitting on a ticket.  But the drunk, he drives home to sleep it off, free and clear.  People who drink and drive should be punished.  And the punishment should fit the crime.  It should be so stiff that no one would ever consider it.  The police officers should be more concerned about drunk drivers than prostitutes and johns.  Whores and the middle aged, fat, bald men that enjoy them are amusing.  Drunks and cars are lethal.   Everyone wants to get rich quick, right?  But very few people rob banks.  Wanna know why?  Because you go to jail for a very long time if you rob a bank.  There isn't this, ""Oh, it's a first offense"" crap.  You go to PRISON for even just TRYING to take a bank's money.  So why the excuses for drunk drivers?  Why are they allowed to go and do it again and again?  Why is robbing a bank a bigger crime than driving drunk, I ask you?  This is what I propose:  First offense, you lose your license for 5 full years automatically.  Second offense, you go to jail for 5 full years, no parole.  And the third time you get caught drunk behind the wheel of a car you go to jail for the rest of your natural life.  So that's my rant.  Driving.  The young.  The old. The drunk.  I've been young and drunk.  I plan on being old and drunk.  And I plan on robbing a bank to pay for my chauffeur driven Lincoln Continental."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I'm on day three of my house cleaning reformation and I think the program is working to some degree.  It's actually fun to go downstairs in the morning and walk through the livingroom without embedding a child's toy in my foot.  And I love pouring my morning coffee while gazing at my reflection in the shiny, clean sink.  Well, my morning reflection isn't all that to gaze upon, but the clean sink... it's enough to make me think about brushing my teeth before 9 am.  I've made a few discoveries about myself so far on this journey.  I have discovered that I dislike lemon scented furniture polish and prefer instead the old church smell of oil soap.  I have discovered that it takes exactly 52 minutes to dry a load of towels.  I've also discovered that my fridge is an evolution acceleration chamber.  Things go in there mere vegetables, but after several months have passed, they come out sentient beings.  I had a conversation the other day with a 9 month old carrot who sounded astonishingly like George W. Bush.  It kept saying something about weapons of mass destruction hidden in the meat drawer.  But when I looked, all I found was a half eaten bologna sandwich trying to date a two year old cheese stick with a PhD.  It's a wild, wild world in there.  Most importantly, however, this journey into the realm of order and organization has brought about self-discovery.  I have determined that I am a lazy perfectionist with a mean obsessive-compulsive streak thrown in for color.  Let me explain.    Basically, it is in my nature to have a clean, perfect house.  When I mean perfect, I mean Better Homes and Gardens' cover perfect.  But who can accomplish that with two kids, two dogs, a late working husband and only 24 hours in a day?  Well, I mean besides my friend and fellow mom, Amy.  Her house is so clean you could lick her carpet and come away without even a single fuzzy on your tongue.  Her house screams ""clean.""  I've never actually been there to see it for myself, but I hear it screaming ""clean"" in the background when I call her.  While we chat, Amy usually scrubs her floors.  On the other hand, I play hamper hoops with dirty socks or pull dog hair out of the baby's mouth.  But the reason I act like this is because of my perfectionist nature.  If I do it, I  want it to be perfect.  But I don't want to work that hard because I'm lazy.  So, I do nothing.  Today is a perfect example.  I was told by the almighty to do list that I was to vacuum the upstairs bedrooms, loft, and hallways.  In order to do this, thinks I, all toys, books, clothes, the occasional mixing bowl and grapefruit spoon and the rest of the miscellany cluttering the floor must be picked up and put away.  I did this for over an hour and then looked into my daughter's room. The place looked as if it were an airsick bag for a Toys R Us on a turbulent flight.   Toys and clothes intertwined with books and bedding.  Had I picked it all up so I could vacuum, it would have taken me the remainder of the day.  I couldn't do that since I had promised Reilly Kate I would take her to the pool.  Now, I can't go back on a promise like that, can I?    My natural inclination was to scrap the vacuuming idea altogether.  I do this kind of scrapping often, in fact.  If there is just too much to do to make the job perfect, I scrap it.  This is why with two shedding dogs, my Berber carpet feels more like a dog skin rug.  I can actually pet my carpet.  My daughter offers it milkbones.  It either needs to be vacuumed or sent to the groomer.  And so, I took one more look at my ever present to do list and vacuumed around all the junk.  I just made a path to her bed and hoovered that.  Then I hoovered all the other rooms that I had already picked up.    My upstairs is so much cleaner now.  No, not perfect.  But cleaner.  I feel better despite the episode still playing in my mind obsessively.  I still want to go in and pick up her room then hoover what remains in there.  But at 11:30 pm, I'm sure to wake her.  I guess I'll just take a nice cleansing breath and go downstairs to talk quantum physics with the eggplant living in the crisper."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"Yesterday, I paid 30 bucks so my kids could sit on a giant bunny's lap and I got the pictures to prove it.  It's like seasonal insanity.  Some holiday hits and I completely lose all grips on reality.  In reality, a teenage girl puts on a big fuzzy yellow bunny costume and lets my children sit on her lap whilst her girlfriend snaps crappy pictures with her digital camera and then prints them out on less than premium photo paper and I pay an outrageous sum of money which is sure to end up buying a Britney Spears CD.    So basically all I did this weekend was contribute to Britney's megamillions which supports her lavish lifestyle including trips to Vegas where she marries some poor sap only to divorce him hours later.  It all boils down to the destruction of American marriages and how the Easter bunny at the mall is, at least in some small part, responsible.    Falling prey to the Easter-Bunny-at-the-Mall trap isn't all I did this weekend.  I also dressed my kids up in pastel outfits with little duckies on them and forced bunny ears upon their heads.  Then I put them in various poses and bribed them to smile.  Reilly is easily bribed with candy or some such forbidden sweet.  Roman is harder to bribe.  Basically, I have to flash him a boob since breastmilk is the only thing he eats.  Picture it if you will:  My two kids in bunny ears and me shaking my bazongas and making yummy noises while dangling candy with one hand and snapping pictures with my other.  Yet another example of my maternal holiday insanity.    I also dyed Easter eggs with Reilly Kate.  She has quite the future in egg dying.  Straight away, she picked up an egg, eschewing the dipper and instead used her hands like an eggy Jackson Pollack or something.  Dip in here, dip in there, dip dip dip.  I really thought they'd turn out horribly.  Much to my surprise, however, they looked like a psychodelic, tie dye job.  Really quite colorful.  I watched her carefully for several minutes and tried to imitate her moves.  Every egg I made turned brown and ugly.  It's all in the wrist, I'm sure.  The problem with Reilly Kate and egg dying is really the drying part.  She thinks that once you finish with the dying you then pick up the egg and either throw it on the floor, crack it on the table, or just plain take a big old bite out of it, shell and all.  We now have a dozen beautifully colored but cracked and bitten eggs as well as the dozen ugly brown eggs I made.  We'll be eating a lot of egg salad in the next few days.    I am trying, though, to impart the spiritual meaning of Easter on my kids.  I want them to know that it is more than just giant fuzzy mall bunnies, psychodelic cracked eggs, and Mama's boobs.  Being that it is Palm Sunday, we took the kids to the local Lutheran church.  As I was busily snapping pictures of them in their bunny ears before we left, I must have told her we were going to God's house to see Jesus.  Reilly loves Jesus.  She's a big fan.  When we walked in, Reilly announced, ""Jesus isn't here.  I don't see him.  He's not here.""  I assured her that he was, that indeed this is Jesus' house.  ""No, it's not,"" she stated most matter of factly, ""I can't see him anywhere!  Where is him?""  ""He's up there,"" I pointed to the altar.  ""He's up by the cross.""  ""No, he's NOT!!!  Wheeeeere is heeeeeeeeeee?!?!?!""    She was starting to get agitated at this point and I didn't want to have a scene.  So I said, ""Ask your father.""  Mike answered without even looking up from the hymnal, ""He's thinking.""  Now, I'm not sure if it was Mike who was thinking or if it was Jesus, but it shut Reilly up for the moment which was the goal.  We all settled in and I thought the subject was forgotten about.  However, as soon as the processional began and she caught a glimpse of the pastor, she shouted, ""There he is!! That's Jesus right there!!!""  ""No,"" I corrected her.  ""He works for Jesus.  Jesus is his boss.  Just like you are Mama's boss.""  I let out a little chuckle at my snide witticism, thinking myself quite clever.  She nodded.  She is clear on the concept now.  Jesus is too busy thinking to actually appear in church and pastor is his Mama.   I should have just stuck to eggs, boobs, and bunnies."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I know I've already discussed my intense dislike of shopping with children in tow.  But for the sake of entertainment, let's review using yesterday as a prime example.  Yesterday morning began as any morning does around here:  Roman awoke at the crack of dark and I tried to persuade him into sleeping a little bit later.  My method is to lead by example.  While he lays there and babbles and pulls out my hair strand by strand, I doze in and out of an unfulfilling sleep.  What finally finally woke me up on this particular morning was a rather loud thud followed by a scared little boy's cry for his mama.  Yes, Roman is crawling now and crawled right out of the bed, did a double flip (I can only speculate on how he accomplished this) and landed flat on his face.  Good morning.  Reilly Kate woke up soon after and we proceeded downstairs for breakfast.  Much like Old Mother Hubbard, I went to my cupboard to give my poor girl some milk.  When I got there, the cupboard was bare and so the poor girl asked for some juice.  No juice.  Toast?  No bread.  Pancakes?  No mix.  Eggs?  None.  Nothing.  My poor girl got some dry Cheerios, an apple, and water.  She wasn't happy.  Time to go to the grocery store.  I began getting the kids and myself ready.  Never mind the fact that it was still just 6-ish and the store wouldn't open for another three hours.  I know how these things work and if I start the preparations early, I'll get to leave early.  No distractions.  Stay focused on the goal.  Heck, I figured, we'd be back for lunch and then do an afternoon pool break.  What a wonderful day I had planned.  Three loads of laundry, two baths, and a early morning nap followed by a major poopy blow out later, we were loaded up into the van  and ready to go.  It was ten o'clock.    As I drove through our pristine, brand new neighborhood I contemplate the recent rash of burglaries that is forcing us all to batten down the hatches.  This leads me to think about our own home and whether I actually accomplished the battening.  I couldn't remember if I'd hit the garage door button.  I racked my brain but came up blank.  I turned the van around to make sure.  Of course, the garage door was closed and I'd just made an extra turn around for nothing.  Better safe than sorry, though.  The time was then 10:05.    I head out of our development a little more hurried, trying to make up for those lost five minutes.  I sped up to three times the legal limit of 5 mph and out of no where something white hits my windshield.  I immediately thought it was a bird, but as I peered through it to view the road, I see that it is not a bird but a pair of panties.  Reilly Kate's panties.  When I was doing laundry I had put a pair on the hood of the van so as to remember to bring a spare pair for accidents.  I had forgotten all about them and with the additional speed, they flew off.    I rolled down the window and turned the windshield wipers on to try to catch them while driving.  It didn't work.  I'm no catcher.  They flew off and landed in the middle of the entrance to our complex.  I turned the van around and doubled back to pick up the panties.    With panties in hand, we were finally on the road.  The clock read 10:12.  I laughed to myself that is had taken me almost 15 minutes to get out of my housing development.  I laughed until I realized that I'd left my debit card and the grocery list sitting on the kitchen counter.  For the THIRD time, I pulled the van around and back we went.  This time a groundskeeper stopped weedwacking and waved at me.  I'm certain that the construction crew working on the last of the new houses must have thought I was lost.  I was frustrated and feeling foolish.  Back at the house, I left the car running and the kids safely buckled in their carseats as I popped in and grabbed the card and list.  Time of departure was now 10:18.    I put the van into reverse and then I heard, ""Mama!!  I need my donkey!""    Without uttering a word, I put it back into park, ran inside and upstairs into Reilly Kate's room, grabbed her donkey and ran back down.  I handed her the donkey, put the van back in reverse and sarcastically asked, ""Is there  ANYTHING  else we need before we go to the store?""  ""My sun gasses,"" (not a typo, that's how she says it, ""sungasses"") Reilly Kate replied quite matter of factly.  And since I had asked, there was no way I could have said no to her.  Back in park went the van.  Back inside went I.  I grabbed sunglasses and decided to make a quick check around the house for any other item that just might be needed.  Nope.  I was confident this time.  We were going to be on our way.  And we were.  The time was now 10:24.  Almost a full 4 hours from when I started getting us ready to leave the house.  Not bad, eh?"
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"My kids are breatharians.   urlLink Breatharians  don't believe in eating.  They think that they can exist on nothing but some kind of light they derive from air.  Hence the name: breatharians.  I'm quite certain my kids know nothing about this light from air business, but I'm just as sure that they are practicing this form of nourishing oneself.  How else would I explain the amount of poop exiting two bodies that nothing but air enters?  Tonight, I tried to employ the old reverse psychology technique recommended by my friend Dana to get Reilly to eat some broccoli.  The trick, according to Dana, is to get the toddler to think that broccoli is something special, not to be had by the toddler.  Liken it to candy even.  I made a big to-do about the broccoli.  I talked out loud to myself as I washed and cut it.    ""Mmmm... I love this stuff.  Broccoli is so good.  I like it almost as much as I like chocolate.  Yum.  I can't wait to eat this.""  I was smacking my lips and licking my chops.  Even I knew this technique would not work without a healthy, or rather UNhealthy dose of good, old fashioned, full fat, homemade ranch dressing.  I put out a big bowl of the artery clogging concoction on the coffee table, where we munch snacks while watching Animal Planet.  ""Don't touch this,"" I warned.  ""This is for Mama only.  You can have some cheese and crackers while I eat this with my broccoli.  Don't touch it, please.""  She didn't even look up from her beloved Crocodile Hunter (pronounced ""crock-a-doddle"" for those of you who don't know).  Steve was in the midst of getting bitten by a snake and Reilly Kate was enthralled.  ""Hmmm... I can't decide if I want some chocolate or some broccoli.  I think I will have the broccoli.  You can't have it, though.  It's not for you.  You just eat crackers.""   Still I got no response.  I sat down with a plate of broccoli, artistically presented in a pattern somewhat reminiscent of a star, and started noisily munching with the ranch as dip.  I was quite dramatic with my slurping and crunching and yummy yummy noises.  ""I know you shouldn't have this till you are at least six.  But today is a special day.  It won't hurt if you have just a little.  Would you like --""  ""NO!!!"" She didn't even let me finish.  I was cut off before I could even finish making my case.  Not to be deterred, I forged on.   ""Just as well.  It's not good for you anyway.  I just thought a little bite wouldn't really --""  ""No!!!""  She interrupted again.  ""I can't like that at all.""  She gets her ""can'ts"" and ""don'ts"" and ""won'ts"" mixed up.  ""I can't like that rrrrrrrright NOW!!!!""    She has picked up some of my speech habits.  I use ""right now"" quite often apparently.  As in ""Come here right now,"" and ""Put that down right now,"" and ""We're leaving right now.""  It gets reflected back to me and with the same tone of voice as well.  It's not flattering, let me tell you.  ""Just try a little piece.  It's better than chocolate.  Much better.  Mmmmm..."" I slowly wilting like a salad gone bad.  My ranch dressing ploy wasn't even working.  She had now put me on ""ignore.""  I sat silently crunching broccoli florets with ranch dressing as I contemplated my next move.  I waited till a commercial break and then I went and got her Easter candy off the kitchen counter and sat it down next to me.  ""I'll tell you what,"" I was about to make a deal with my two year old, ""You eat a few bites of this broccoli and you can have a piece of your chocolate.""  Her little ears perked up.  I had gotten her attention.  ""If not, I'll eat all the broccoli AND all the chocolate.""  And to prove I was serious, I popped a ranch drenched floret in my mouth along with a fat chunk of chocolate Easter bunny ear.  I clenched my lips into what I hoped looked like a deliriously happy smile rather than the repulsed sour puss the combination was eliciting.  Reilly Kate leaned over me, picked up two big broccoli pieces, dredged them through the ranch dressing bowl and held them up in front of her face.  Before I could even suggest she take smaller, bite sized pieces, she shoved them both in her mouth. She chewed and chewed as I sat and fretted over the choking possibilities posed by that large an amount of roughage.  When she finished chewing, she turned to me and announced, ""I did! Chocolate now, please.  May I please have my chocolate right now.  Rrrrriiiight NOW!!!""  ""One more piece and then you can have some chocolate.""  I was still wheeling and dealing, so I thought.  I extended a much smaller, toddler sized piece to her.  She again soaked it in the ranch and popped it in her mouth.  She chewed this piece for a much longer time.    ""Isn't it good?"" I asked as I crunched on some myself.  ""Isn't it as good as chocolate?""  ""Mmmm hmmmm,"" she agreed.  ""You can't have too much, though.  It's for Mama.""  I was still playing my game even if she didn't want to go along.  ""Mmmmm hmmmmm,"" she nodded and began looking at her Easter basket.  ""You want your chocolate now, huh?""  I needlessly asked and dug to find a nice small chocolate egg.  ""Mmmm hmmm.""  I handed her the chocolate and she merrily skipped away toward the kitchen.  I sat and watched Steve handle another snake on television while I grabbed some more of the green stuff.  I too was engrossed as I watched that crazy Crockadoddle Hunter take on a spitting cobra.  It was making my palms sweat.  Just as the cobra started hooding up to take a swipe at Steve, I hear the sinful sound of a toddler's delighted giggles coming from my kitchen.  I get up to take a look and this is what I see:  Reilly hunched over, as if she were puking, spitting out globules of gooey green sludge onto the floor where the awaiting Truman (our perpetually dieting dachshund) eagerly lapped them up.  It would seem that she hid the chewed up broccoli in her cheeks, fooling me with her bright smile and the ""Mmmm hmmm.""  I started to say something, but before I could even formulate a response, Reilly spat out all that was remaining in her mouth and shoveled in the chocolate.  Score one for the toddler.  She won that round. But I'll get her.  I'll get her tomorrow.  I'll fool her into eating eggs.  I'm going to hide them in a chocolate cake.  I have a recipe that calls for four large ones.  Roman's food refusal story tomorrow..."

WVESAHK,male,27,"March 6, 1982   His Excellency, Ronald Reagann The President of the United States of America The White House Washington, D.C.  Dear Mr. President,  When the Spanish author Vicente Basco Ibañez landed for the first time at the port of New York, he enthusiastically exclaimed: ¨The United States is the Youth and the Hope of the World¨.  Mr. Reagan, your election as President has served to revive that feeling.  In your eloquent and clear-sighted speech delivered before the Organization of the American States, a speech which bears the stamp of your personality, you have set forth--given the Communist menace facing the Third World the geographical importance of Central America and the Caribbean to the social and political future of the American Hemisphere.  The Carter administration in its foreign policy set a match to the Central American isthmus and induced countries such as El Salvador to violate their constitutions. El Salvador is notable for its guarantees of right to private property.  Unquestionably, the political, social, and economic restoration of Central America requires a climate  of peace and tranquility, which can come only with the disappearance of Soviet-Cuban penetration, operating from the platform of Nicaragua.  El Salvador, the smallest of Central American countries, is outstanding in its vigorous industriousness. Despite bad military governments since 1960, the initiative and dedication to hard work of its private enterprise has enabled the country to offset the inefficiency and many failings of those governments.  But factions with Sooviet-Cuban ideology, made up mostly of university students, Jesuits, a few military men disguising as ¨Liberals¨, funded by the proceeds of kidnappings and bank robberies, not disuaded by the progress and production increases achieved by the country, irresponsibly set about promoting anarchy. Successive national governments, specially that of General Romero, tolerated their terrorism with the excuse that they feared being mistakenly said to violate ¨human rights¨-- the false banner waived to such good effect by the communists.  With the regrettable approval of the U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Frank Devine, the coup d´etat of October 15, 1979 was staged. Brandishing an Army proclamation, in fact drafted at ¨UCA¨, the Jesuit university, the present government, styling itself the Revolutionary Governing Junta, proceeded demagogically and without calculating the economic consequences, to promulgate laws imposing: a)Agrarian Reform b)Nationalization of the Country´s private banks c)Nationalization of the Export of Coffee, Sugar, and other key products.  In your brilliant speech, Mr. President, you mentioned that in El Salvador there has been an ¨agrarian reform without precedent.¨ It was indeed without precedent in that it consisted of the confiscation by military force of rural properties that were achieving the highest yields by reason of their exemplary cultivation. That was also what Fidel Castro did at the outset, foreshadowing the nature of his rule.  I wrote a long and informative letter about the agrarian reform some time ago to the honorable Congressman of the State of Maryland, Mr. Clarence D. Long; for your convenience, I attach a copy of this letter.  With regard to the nationalization of Salvadorean private banks, one asks oneself what would have been gained in the United States by the nationalization of the Bank of America, Citibank, Chase Manhattan and so on? In the banking field, what was in fact needed in El Salvador was a reorganization of the Central Bank (Banco Central de Reserva), which since the year 1961 has been directly subordinate to the President of the Republic, an arrangement which clearly iss not constructive for a free economic system.  The nationalization of exporting has served to displace qualified exporters, making way for incompetence and corruption in the bureaucratic offices put in charge of these activities.  In sum, the results of the aformentioned reforms imposed by brute force have been: a)Reduced agricultural production b)Poor administration of Bank Credit c)Drastic reduction of international monetary reserves  It was encouraging to hear in your speech your affirmation that freedom is our common destiny. This is undoubtedly the noblest of all causes. This is why I consider it opportune to add that:  The guarantee of private property is what mosst strenghtens the liberty of man. Where this does not exisst, as it does not exist in communist countries, there disssapears the freedoms of expresion, religion, press, and all of mankind´s liberties; discouragement prevails.  I remain, Mr. President, with esteem, admiration and respect.  Luis Escalante Arce Founder Banco Agricola Comercial"
WVESAHK,male,27,"Antes de ir a dormir, y haciendo de mi vida un Truman Show con los BLOGS destaco lo siguiente:  Acepto que mi cualidad/debilidad mas destacable es mi sarcasmo. Quisiera que fuera algo mas, pero al final agradezco que soy sarcastico y no un snob, geek, narc, o algo asi.   No se si los defectos de caracter se forman a traves del tiempo, pero segun me explicaba alguien el otro dia la personalidad de una persona esta completamente desarrollada a la edad de 7-8.  Bueno para no entrar tanto en detalle, si recuerdo de manera explicita la primera vez que sembre polemica a nivel de padres de familia. Nunca fui muy reservado pero este comentario marco el principio de la persona que soy ahora, ""Hecho mierda"" como decimos.  Recuerdo que celebraba mi cumpleanos no. 11 en la casa de mis abuelos Escalante y mi familia me habia preparado una bonita fiesta con todo lo que se puede esperar que estimule la ilusion de un nino. Ya me advertian que era un adolescente pero supongo que era para que me portara mejor! Y mi abuelo Luis ya me habia regalado por segunda vez el libro: Como Ganar Amigos e Influenciar a Las Personas de Dale Carnegie, el cual no he leido aun.  Recuerdo que el dia de la fiesta habiamos terminado de corretear por el jardin jugando Ladron Librado y 1,2,3 para mi y los invitados y companeros de clase seguian llegando a mi fiesta.   Aproveche para comerme unos panesillos sin orilla con jamon y queso con un vasito de orchata cuando decidi ir a la entrada de la casa para recibir a algunas visitas. Al menos eso pretendia yo con este gesto! A distancia logre identificar junto a su papa a un companero Jose Roberto Samour quien venia entrando con un regalo en forma de cilindro cubierto con papel y una enorme chonga. Yo me acorde que Jose Roberto anteriormente le habia regalado un basurero de G.I. Joe a otro buen amigo para su cumpleanos y que ahora se repetia conmigo.  Pues cuando se acerco a mi con su papa Don Roberto Samour, en vez de decirle muchas gracias por acordarte de mi o algo nice, decidi responder asi:  Puya, vos solo basureros regalas men!    Fue tan polemico pero tan gracioso ese momento que mi papa quien se encontraba a mi lado se tiro a reir a carcajadas.  Buenas noches a todos......."

WVESAHK,male,27,"More tha 500 years have gone by, since our ancestors used ""cacao"" as the official coin. The evolution of the salvadoran monetary system has progressed through time alongside the transformation of our economy, our society and the way we see the world in the different stages of our history. The ""trueque"" was ordinary trading, and the use of ""cacao"" as a payment method dates back to the Maya civilization. That is how the pre-colonial ancestors used the ""cacao"" as currency, they considered chocolate to be the beverage of the gods.   The spaniards introduced the use of their currency: the ""real"", however, ""cacao"" continue to be used with an exchange rate of 200 seeds of ""cacao"" for 1 ""real"".  The birth of the coin   The first coins used in our country were stamped in engraved in Spain, until 1731 were in Guatemala the first House of the Coin was founded. The most frequently used coin during the colony were known as ""Macacos"" or ""Morlacos"".   The ""MAcacos"" were odd-shaped silver pieces, the majority engraved in Peru and Mexico and were cut with pliers. They had engraved in them the columns of Hercules with the words ""Plus Ultra.""  Contemporary to the ""Macacos"" the tin farm chips appeared, circular in shape and they were easily identifiable because they had engraved the name of the farm. From that time period is were some of the names such as ""plata""(silver), morlacos, ""fichas"" (chips) or maracandacas.   The Central American declaration of Independence, also marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the coin. The silver ""peso"" continued to be the oficial coin, but the first regional coin was engraved and its primary objetive was to conmemorate the independence.   The first changes ocurred several years later when the government approved the engravement of a national silver and gold coin. The silver pieces had a letter ""R"" for reales and the gold coins had a letter ""E"" for ""Escudo"" or shield. The Macacos continued to be used after the independence to the point were in 1846 they were legally adopted as currency.  It was until 1883, under the government of Dr. Rafel Zaldivar, that the first monetary law was put into effect adopting the ""peso"" as the official coin and the spanish exchange rate of 1 peso for 8 reales modified.The new Law of the Metric Decimal System was adopted were 1 peso was equivalent to 10 reales.   In 1892, The House of the Coin in El Salvador engraved coins as following: 1 cent in copper, and five, ten, twenty, fifty cents, and 1 peso in silver. 2 and a half, five, and ten pesos in gold. After a short period, to conmemorate the IV Centenary of America, a legislative decree changed the design of the coin. Instead of having the national flag, the face of Christopher Columbus was engraved into the coin. The same change took place in the  fifty cent coin and the Salvadoran coin was baptized with a new name: ""Colon"".  The Salvadoran coins changed designs and contents once more in 1915, during that year the coins were made out of nickel as following: 1, 2, and 3 cents displaying the breast of General Francisco Morazan. In 1921 the 10 cent coin was introduced displaying the same design. The Chest of General Morazan was used in every coin used during the XX century and in the 25 cents coin used in 1943 and 1944.   In 1953 a new design was introduced for the 25 and 50 cent coins, these coins displayed the image of Father Jose Matias Delgado and the coin's value surrounded by laurels on the opposite side. The coins were engraved originally in silver and during the 70's and 80's the coins were re-edited in nickel.  The bills are born  At the end of the XIX century a new currency was introduced in the Salvadoran monetary system; the first bank paper bills are born. The name ""bank bills"" was used because local banks authorized by the government printed and issued the bills. The first paper bills were issued by the International Bank, founded in 1880.   Later two other banks were established and were able to issue bills: Banco Occidental and Banco Agricola Comercial at the time. At the end of the XIX century it is worth mentioning two significant events: the first, the inauguration of the House of the Coin, the 28th of august 1892 during the government of President Carlos Ezeta. The second important event took place on the October 1st 1892, when a during a tribute to Cristopher Columbus at the 4th Centenary of the discovery of America, the Legislative Power reformed the Monetary Law in 1883, changing the name of our currency from Peso to Colon. The decree stated that the value of the Dolar was 2X1 Colon.   The first family of paper bills in El Salvador   The Central Bank of El Salvador had as its main objective, maintain stability in the monetary system. That is how on the 31st of august in 1934, the BCR (Central Bank), issued the first family of bills in Salvadoran history. The issued bills were as following: one, five, diez, twenty five, and one hundred colones and later in 1979 the fifty colones bill was added.   Since 1934, the year in which the Central Bank issued the first bills, modifications started to apply to each individual bill changing the design, or the removal and addition of certain denominations.  The second family of bills   In 1997, seventy three years after the first bills were issued, the Central Bank prints and issues the second family of bills, these respond to the modernization of the State and to the country's needs.  The new bills are fabricated with safe paper and high quality, in order to preserve a good appearance as time goes by. They are also issued in compliance with the highest safety standards preventing falsification.  The U.S. Dollar Arrival  On January 1st, 2001, in El Salvador, the Law of Monetary Integration was put into effect. The law permitted the free circulation of the U.S. Dollar at an exchange rate of 8.75 Colones for 1 U.S. Dollar. The Law stated that the Central Bank would not issue more colones in bills or coins and eventually the local banks would begin to pick up the Colones and trade them for U.S. Dollars. Eventhough the law states that both currencies can cisculate freely, it is obvious that soon the U.S. Dollar will be the new currency in El Salvador.

WVESAHK,male,27,Que partido mas malo.... decepcionante!.   Ahora me dolio pagar $15.00 y sentarme en la tribuna norte disque apoyando a la Seleccion Nacional en la eliminatoria hacia Alemania 2006.  Fue un partido para el olvido y espero que la gente le recuerde a nuestros muchachos que jugando asi vamos a llegar a hacer el ridiculo a la hexagonal.   *Este parrafo lo ecribo lleno de decepcion y enojo.

OX45YLS,male,13,"""Richie-Rich!"" D hollered at me as he discovered me waiting for him for my weekly trip to get my haircut.  I go to the black barbershop because white people don't know the proper technique for giving a fade.  D always calls me ""Richie-Rich because he thinks I'm rich.  Actually he knows I'm rich.  He has no other choice but to think so since I'm always well-groomed, fresh and clean.  Also we've discussed my current situation and he is aware I don't pay bills.  He prompts a response, ""so whats it feel like to be so rich, Richie-Rich?""  I can feel tension in the air.  ""Bills, bills, bills,"" he always says and I can picture what it feels like to service a white ""rich kid""  with no worries every week or at least watch my casual demeanor when I sit and talk with my usual barber, Rob.   I said ""it feels like shit.""  He laughs and calls me modest, then explaining how I can trust him to tell what it feels like to be so rich.  ""Money ain't everything baby"" I say.  He replies, ""oh yeah but you got it good, I can see you got it good, man I wonder what it feels like, no worries, no bills, no kids to take care of.""  ""Materialisticlly I'm okay at present but I bet it's a lot of times I'd rather be in your shoes, you just can't tell.  I look comfortable?  Thas good man.  Thats the desired effect.""  He says, ""Oh yeah- real comfortable man, you got the Mercedes and the big crib and all that man, no worries.  Parents gon probly give you a jaguar, like ""here son go drive.""  I said ""but I bet you got a family that gives you emotional comfort and you got people you can depend on though right, brother?  You ever wanted to kill yourself?""  It went on like this, him trying to prove how much better I had it and me trying to give him somewhat of a glimpse into my reality, underneath the image.  We compared stories of jail, family abuse, depression, loss and death the entire time he was working on my head.  He might have me beat in that last department since his mother was murdered during a robbery, but I had to point out that at least he knew his mother would be there for him if she was alive, where as mine chose to vanish from my life long ago and we barely stay in contact.  The lesson is that I should be grateful for what I have, because there are many who would love to be in my position, however I must wonder if they would go back to their previous lifestyle if they could experience mine.  Or vice versa.  I continued to meditate on the subject as it was obvious D never quite understood the other side of the cards I've been dealt and the point was reinforced, almost like divine intervention as soon as I left and crossed the street on the way to the five points Marta station.  A beggar in a wheelchair took one look at me and moved right in front of my path, blocking the sidewalk so foreward momentum was immediately halted.  ""What a dick?""... ""I need to give him money?""... ""I need to change my life?""  What was the message here?  Two incredibly prominent encounters pertaining so greatly to the fact I appear to have it well off must mean something.  Not every white person who travels along decatur street in downtown Atlanta gets the same reaction.  I've been walking back and forth on that street every day for five years and getting a fade at Raw Cuts for three.  Dress the way I feel?  Feel the way I look?  The questions never stopped coming and I feel an immense drive to divulge the emotions to the world.  The best means to communicate the poetry is thorugh my one true love, Hip-Hop.  A black mans game.  A game many don't want me in.  An endeavor where the tables are turned and the caucasian is the minority.  Like American status, we are looking for our own civil rights movement within the realm of music.  If my mic is low on stage and no one can decipher the message then I just look like another cracker who thinks he can rap.  Even if they can understand many turn a deaf ear simply based on principle.  Talent remains unrecognized.  Meanwhile, the same recycled marketing schemes, shallow gimmicks and negative content remains at the top of the Hip-Hop charts with a serious void of intellectual and emotional inspiration.  The opportunities I've been afforded due to my color aren't without an equal and opposite reaction.  Learning disabilites, personal demons and unfortunate circumstances continuously contaminate school, employment and relationships.  So I start at the bottom, always looking on top and feeling like the worst of the best is yet to come.   ""time is dead and I need a beat where the divine is bred and I'm hittin the street it would seem that with the discman i'm just ignoring but the truth is that this damn world is just boring elders say I'm makin my perception restricted but you don't ever see a fuckin stride like this, kid sprung from that state of mind thats been invicted focused on the moment with eyes depicted when that theme drops it freeze blocks  perceive clocks in complete knots the beat knocks to all my studio gods: recieve props how else could I make it from five points to GSU slide into the sequel of a decade like PS2 and bring my visions with me nightmares with precision, swiftly but thats covered in the song- bounce to it can't cope if emotion don't announce to it feel my pain and my loss when it rains what it cost  but see if I'm side tracked  I'm skippin through life tracks yeah I notice that glance at me like ""damn he's so care free"" I wish you knew everything and where I wish I could be but I'm there as long as the beat don't lose power you can stare, I don't care if the street don't cower good till i'm gone, chico I never let the street go extinguish me early and observe how well the streak go the star that burned out but ya still see next week though say my battery's low I'll let my flattery show full blast my favorite track until the beats go then I'll be with my idols, all of em fouled ya screw back in the lightbulbs and feel the nostalgia your battery's cool but can you see my vision? when my fuel runs out I'll be reminescent  how'd ya miss it? a large fable- I won't rot- face it  they're rechargeable and I got replacements""                                                 -Invictus  2001"
OX45YLS,male,13,"The ability to clone and develop a conduit between other peoples minds had always been a strong desire for me.  In an ideal universe we would be able to come in physical contact with another individual and connect with their mental process and ever after posess the ability to learn from thier previous mistakes and become inspired by their experiences.  Creative endeavors would be expanded when the perspective of other people could be drawn upon and an entirely different view of the world captured.  One could, therefore, consult with any previous relationship from the past, even if they were on the other side of the world.  The idea seems reasonable to me because I believe we are all one consciousness experienceing itself subjectively and in the end we all come back to our original united soul.   Perhaps there is a reason we are unable to feel each others minds and we must have an independant  life process, but thus far, it's impossible to tell what that may be.  Perhaps a cosmic accident but perhaps when we do return to our original consciousness we will be enlightened in a way that allows for an infinitesimal empathy, considering we already did it all without each other at one time."
OX45YLS,male,13,"Chris Rock is by far the best person to deligate the future of our country.  For one, he's black which just must happen.  He already said there will never be a black vice president because someone would immediately assassinate the president.  ""I couldn't wait to kill the president!""  I believe were his exact words.   My kinda guy.  In response to the consequences, he said ""What are you gonna do, send me to jail where I'll be a hero for the rest of my life!?""  ""Probly get pardoned by the black president!""  Secondly, he's the most competent of anyone we've ever had in office and his vision of the world is clear and without corruption.  He is well aware of the hypocracy in America and has a plan for change.  Drugs that kill motherfuckers every day are legal if white people make the money.  Can't deny that.  Everybody in politics wants to be down with a gang.  Before they've heard the issue.  That's why I've never been able to be republican or democrat.  That is why I will trust president Rock.  He actually thinks!  What a concept.  ""Some things I'm conservative about, some things I'm liberal about...  crime- I'm conservative, prostitution- I'm liberal.""  -Sounds like a form of government we've never had the opportunity to experience before.  He even played the president in a movie, Head of state, which should be acceptable since just being an actor qualifies people nowdays, even if they just shot a lot of guns in their films.  If you watch Head of State, you will find many halarious but obvious solutions to enormous problems in America.  If not, you will at least be able to see a man who has the right type of mind to make unselfish decisions and make the world a more just place.  ""Rock"" the vote.

OX45YLS,male,13,"Rectumali is a game that inmates play during longs bids in prison, usually for murder, robbery or drug posession.  Contraband, such as a baggie of heroin is injested by an inmate and passed, cleaned and reinserted into another inmate.  That is how the ""ball is passed.""  Teams are divided on each side of the living quarters.  The baggie must pass through every one on the tier.  Referees are designated to watch the insertion of every bag when it is placed into an oriface and again when it comes out to ensure no one is cheating.  The time limit for each team is half a day for each player.  Whatever means necessary to move the object as quickly as possible through one person to the next is permitted, so long as the judge agrees it actually went through.  If a person on your side of the tier refuses to play it will count against you.  The next cell will not be able to pass the ball until the refusing prisoner passes the contraband through their intestines.  One can see what interesting dramatic circumstances will insue if refusal is abundant.  The main rule is: ""Pass the ball. Don't get caught."".  If a guard or member of the prison faculty becomes aware of the game you are automatically disqualified.  All paid guards must be registered with the judges before the game commences.  Winner gets an extra serving of Jello."

OX45YLS,male,13,"The zippo product was actually chosen because the attraction to Victoria Secret was too obvious.  It just seemed too much like me, so I opted for something more challenging since opportunities for sexual depiction will probably be abundant.  I then realized how much of a challenge I was facing.  Zippo is a product that has been around for sometime.  It's very difficult to introduce a new interest in the product because of it's familiarity.  It only has one basic use, to ignite flame and isn't quite popular compared to shitty, plastic lighters.  The challenge would be to remind people who are familiar with zippo lighters just why they are useful and worth the money.  I instantly saw a benifit which could be solutioned visually.  The durability and masculine association with the product could be exploited in a variety of ways.  Personify the product and depict various situations which call for a harder, more dominant type of person and the desired effect will be attained.  That proved to be an unacceptable approach.  Now faced with the same delimma, obvious, in-your-face visuals of the lighter in comparison to things of lesser value or merely displaying grandiose aspects of the lighter seemed to be appropriate.  Those proved to be oversimplified and uninformative.  Now for a third approach, I find myself looking for verbal seducers for an everyday object.  I've described ""fire"" in every way imaginable and am searching for an appealing way to attach the terminology to a visual.  When this marriage is discovered, certain flourishment shall ensue.

The natural chemical reaction which makes life possible.   One fourth of the elements which represent all natural activity.  It runs your car, your house, a factory, the planet earth.  It explodes from the earths core as the most powerful energy known to humankind.  It mutates the body and inflicts great pain.  It is an insturment of torture used to control and punish.

It is a horrible demon that extinguishes life and simultaneously provides nourishment for life to be possible.  It can be enormous or portable, beautiful and hideous.  It is an emotion, a sensation, an action, a noun, a descriptive, an insturment, a revelation and a dread.  Battles have been fought with it, wars have been weakened by it and patnerships started with it.  It provides employment and serves as entertainment.  Some have a compulsion to let it breathe and stare into it's emmensely captivating aura.

0C3YRSQ,female,25,"I went on a date tonight...with someone other than my husband!!!  It's not as exciting as it sounds.  Well, I mean, not as...scandalous...as it sounds.  I'm just trying to fool you into thinking I do scandalous things. :-)  It was a date with my ten-year-old piano student, Maddie.  I play this little game with some of my students in which they have to reach a certain amount of points--32 to be exact--and when they get to 32 we go out to dinner and to a concert or show or something, no matter how remote, music related.  Usually the way they get points is by answering a trivia question I give them to research for one week.  Not always trivia, but music history, theory, all sorts of things.  It was really fun.  The final question for Maddie, as she neared the 32-point goal was ""Why exactly is the goal 32 points? Isn't that a weird number?  There is a musical reason why I chose 32.""  Other questions were ones they have to look up if they don't know, but could easily find (they all have a list of fun music websites) like ""What is Alberti Bass"" or ""What was the relationship between Beethoven and Czerny"" or ""How does the standard blues scale pattern differ from a major scale pattern?""  And some of them were bigger projects like one student created a music resume, another memorized finger four for all scales.  Stuff like that.  Pretty varied.  At first I tried looking online for music trivia-type stuff but didn't find anything very useful so I had to get creative all on my own!  I think I did okay.  I think I'm pleased with myself with this little experiment.  So tonight Maddie and I went to Hometown Buffet (100% her choice!)then to the jazz ensemble concert at SOU.  As always, it was a fantastic concert and it was so fun to be there with her.  She's a very cool kid.  Very interested in all aspects of music.  AND we both in for free, which makes me happy too.  Yes, I want to support the music department, and scholarships, and blah, blah, blah but, whatever.  There are philanthropists to do that.  I'm too poor actually  being  a musician.  I've been feeling more and more lately like I don't know anyone in the music department since I've graduated so when I went to the box office tonight I totally expected to have to buy our two tickets.  The people working the box office I sort of know, not really, just by name and face (Nick and Kate) so I was so pleased, surprised, honored, and all those good things when I whined ""Do I really have to pay?"" and they gave me two comp tickets!!  Yay!!!  Thank you Nick and Kate!  All Poco does is sit in his water these days.  I'm slightly concerned about him.  He's going to get moldy.  love Meagan"
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"Oh, my sadly neglected blog.  It's been over a   week!    Over a week since I've written anything.  That's because Mike is in town.  When he's home I don't get to spend any time at my computer without him around.  It's not that he wouldn't want me to have this silly little blog or anything like that.  And it's not that I'm crazy-distracted when he's home by all the crazy-love (hee hee).  It's just that I know I'd be embarassed by it if he knew.  So I don't write anything when he's around.  And when he's home he's always around.  That's not a bad thing.  I like having him around.  I love him.  I think we have the perfect marriage. I know that sounds conceited.  Oh well, that's the way it is.  I was talking with Jacob about it yesterday; he was asking about Mike and I and how we get on, and I was explaining things to him I was realizing once again that, yep, our relationship is pretty damn healthy.  Except that we really like hitting each other.  Hitting. Slapping.  Pinching.  Biting.  Whatever.  If you know us, you know that that's not as bad as it sounds.  It's all in fun.  I met Eric at Chadwick's tonight.  Yay!  My long-lost-friend Eric.  There was a time when we were really close friends.  Like practically the best of friends, I'd say.  But I guess a lot of that friendship was just based on the amount of time we spent together.  With jazz choir, musicals, piano, etc. there were several months there when we were working together practically every day so that's how we became close.  When he moved away I really think the only reason we stayed friends was because of that duo-piano recital we were working on.  Since that ended (exactly a year ago now) we haven't really had a   reason   to be friends.  I don't like that.  I like to be friends with someone just because it's worth sharing your life with that person.  And he is worth that. But I guess we both have to make the effort.  Tonight was a good time.  Lots to talk about.  Nothing real deep, but not shallow chatter and idle small talk either.  Since he got divorced we are in such different places in life and I worry that will separate us even more than the physical difference of his moving to Chico.  I hope not.  It's not like I can only socialize with married people.  Not at all.  Mike and I have   never   had that kind of relationship.  warning!!!! subject change!!!!  Poco loves baby food!  That's exciting because for the last two years of his life he hasn't eaten anything except pre-packaged ""Turtle Food Pellets"" and bananas.  And one of the fun things about turtles is that they should be able to healthily eat anything that people eat.  But he refuses to eat any fruits and vegetables besides those bananas.  So I bought some organic baby foods at the Ashland Food Co-op on Sunday.  And he loves it!!!    We had our meet-&-greet for   The Fantasticks   tonight.  It went pretty well.  It's a great cast that I'm really excited about.  Also, I love working with Ed.  It's such a relief from the time spent with Daniel in casting for   Les Miserables  .  They are just two very different men.  With Daniel, life is a struggle and art (theatre) is an escape from that struggle.  With Ed, life is what you do and the art (theatre) is inspired by life.  At least that's the way I feel about the two.  It's very weird working with these two   very   different directors at once.  Even weirder is the fact that Daniel is in the cast of   The Fantasticks  !  Already he and Ed have butted heads over vision, blah, blah, blah.  Oh boy.  I just make music.  That's all I like to do.   Madeline is the noisiest goldfish in the world.  Good night.  love Meagan"

0C3YRSQ,female,25,"""Little Shop of Horrors"" is officially finally over.  It must be.  We had our cast party last night.  Now the show has to end, right?  I loved doing this show.  It was definitely the best band and the most...drama-free...cast.  I know that sounds funny to call a group of actors drama-free.  But if you work in theatre you know what I mean.  There were a few oddballs but no one totally whacko or wanker.  No wankers.  That was nice.  And the BAND ROCKED!  Even when the sound system was acting possessed and the singers couldn't be heard during some songs the band was entertaining enough on its own (don't EVER tell the actors I said that!)!  Anyway.  Good music.  Not difficult music, it's just that we had seven skilled and relaxed musicians that honestly love to play.    Ladies and Gentlemen!  Introducing.... Matt Dorris on guitar!  Jacob Fatooh on bass!  Ruby Reese on winds!  Kevin McKern on drums!  Aaron Blenkush (and David E Weck!) on keyboard!  Meagan Iverson on piano!  Gary Berlant aka wino #2 on harmonica!    There.  I just thought I should introduce us all.  The party was good.  Pretty mellow with much singing and not much wine.  Unusual.  With some parties much wine comes and   then   much singing!  We did all the gay-love songs from ""Rent.""  Lots of ""Into the Woods"" and ""Godspell"" songs and a couple songs shamelessly promoting our upcoming ""Les Miserables""!  Tanya sings On My Own so amazingly.  Sadly, none of the guitarists pulled out my guitars.  :-(  Poor guitars.  They only get played when we have parties.  So I know they'll get tuned at least every few months or so.  My student Aaron was our keyboard player for this extra week of Little Shop.  He did an awesome job.  I knew he'd be good, but I wasn't sure how free he'd feel to just really jump in and fit with the band.  But he jammed with them way better than I do.  It was fun, while slightly awkward at times since he is in high school and I am his teacher, having him around.  He even came to the party and stayed for four hours and played for a lot of the songs.  It was nice not being the only accompanist at the party.  I think he has a very different view of his teacher now.  I haven't quite decided yet if that's a good thing or a bad thing.    Katie gave us a little book for people to write or draw in whenever we have parties.  Everytime she comes to visit she reads it to see what she's missed out on.  So sorry, Katie, we forgot to have people write in the book again!  And this would have been a perfect setting to have it just circulating around the house.  Bush is talking about mass graves on TV right now. :-(  It is not fitting with the light-hearted nature of my blog.  Perhaps I will talk about more serious things next week.  love meagan"

It was a big formal banquet in Eugene for the Oregon Fire Chiefs Association.  So basically a long program of boring awards and stuff I know nothing about but that is very important to him.  And since my mum is way too sick to even leave the house he asked me if I wanted to go.  It was fun to have a reason to dress up in clothes other than black performance clothes and schmooze with a bunch of people I don't know.  that's all for now.

0C3YRSQ,female,25,"I thought I'd be good at this blog thing.  But I guess I'm not.  I can't even get a picture on my blog! :-(  If I could, I would put a picture of Poco a Poco up!!!!  Because he is huge and you should all see him!  He's awake right now.  He is so cute I could eat him up.  But that scares Mike when I pretend to put him in my mouth.  Hee hee.   Halle Berry is so beautiful.  There is an ant crawling on the wall behind my computer right now.  It is not so beautiful.   I'm going tonight to work with the Central Point Teen Actors again for their production of  Into the Woods .  Man, those kids need help.  I can't believe they keep attempting these major musicals without a musical director.  Well, not so major.  They've done  Grease  and  You're a Good Man Charlie Brown .  Kids musicals.  But still.  Both of those were...not so good.  I applauded them for their guts and their effort.  But they were so painful to watch at times.  So when Aaron (my student who is playing piano for them this time) told me they're doing Into the Woods I said PPPPPlllllllleeeeeeeasssssseeeee let me help out. You need me. (which he did, since he had fallen into role of musical director and had no clue what he was doing) So I'm donating my time.  Time I don't really have.  But I have one week right now between  Sweet & Hot  and  Fantasticks , so why the hell not?  I mean, really, what else would I do in the evenings this week if I wasn't going to rehearsals?  Relax?  Practice?  Yeah, that'd be smart.  But I'm not usually smart.  And besides.... I HAVE to do this.  Being a musical director for community theatre is something i NEED to do.  Why I have not quite figured out.  Certainly not for the pay.  Oh dear.  I am $400 overdrawn right now and my  Sweet & Hot  salary check bounced.  Nobody's makin' money here.  So sad.  But this time will pass.  I have strong support for  urlLink Connect the Dots  (the company I am resident musical director for) and feel they will pull out of this current hole.  Stupid  Little Shop of Horrors  for not making any money. Gggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!  Thank God for my sweet husband Mike and his lovely stable career.  :-)  If it weren't for him I'd still be living in my shed in Jacksonville.  But that's not why I married him.  I don't know how it works when two musicians or artists or actors marry each other.  Besides just the financial aspect, there's so much....drama...tied up in the artistic world.  Emotions are so close to the surface.  They have to be.  And I like it that way.  I wonder if anyone reads my blog.  Maybe I should tell more people about it.  But that would be weird.  It'd be like ""hey, come read about me and my random ramblings!""    love Meagan"
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"It's been a few days since I've written.  That's okay.  I promise not to be one who updates this blog every hour.  Those people scare me.  Besides, I still don't even know if anyone really reads this ever besides David and Erin (by the way, how did you guys get links to other blogs on the border of yours?)   A day off?  A day off!  That's what today's been!!  And it's been oh so lovely.  I have not even had a little bit of a day free since the beginning of March, let alone a whole day.  So I took great advantage of it.  No, I didn't do anything exceptional; I just relaxed.  I was supposed to be doing   Fantasticks   auditions from 11-4 and   Les Miserables   callbacks from 5:30-9 today and that was my whole day filled up.  But     both     of those got rescheduled for next Saturday!  Yay! Yay!  My excitement is not an exageration.  This was a day greatly needed.  So here's what I did (since I'm sure you want to know...I hope my sarcasm comes through okay throughout this blog!):  I slept in until 8:30 and then I read a magazine in bed until 9:30.  Then I sat at my 'puter for a bit doing nothing really substantial and ate a muffin and drank lots of 100% juice organic orange juice that Mike went all the way to Fred Meyer just to get for me this morning because last week I was moaning the icky 10% juice they sell at Starbucks.  At 10 it hit me that   Fantasticks   rehearsals start in a week and a half and I haven't even looked at the music at all.  So throughout all day I spent a lot of time working on that.  So yes, I was working, but not really because new music is always exciting.  It's just when you've been working on a show forever that it gets tedious. At noon Mike and I went to my parents house since my mom is still housebound I try to go whenever I can.  We brought over   The Fantasticks   movie since I needed to watch it (yes, still sort of like work.  Oh well, that's the way it is) and I knew my mum would love it.  FYI The Fantasticks movie sucks.  It is so not like the stage musical.  If anyone has seen the movie and not the live musical please don't judge it by that!  Anyway, continuing on the journey of my lovely day.  On our way home we saw a bunch of kids from our church doing a car wash at Food 4 Less.  They were washing a huge tour bus. Poor kids.  We didn't help.  We just stopped to visit.  Ha.  I had Poco with me because I'd taken him for my mum to see, so the kids all loved that too.  It was cool (yeah, I know, I'm just being so literary and fascinating with words tonight, aren't I?).    Well, there was more to my day.  And more that I could write.  But I just realized how boring this probably is.  So rather than delete and start over (it is 1:41 a.m. after all) I'm just going to stop there and leave you wondering in suspense over what I did for the rest of the day and evening.  Big secrets.  love Meagan"
0C3YRSQ,female,25,I had my wisdom teeth removed today.  Ick.  That's all I have to say about that right now.  love Meagan
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"I'm thinking my blog needs a name.  When I created it I didn't realize MAGN would be like a big bold title at the top every time.  I just thought it was the name I'd use to log in.  So MAGN is boring.  I tried to take a quiz online (at quizilla.com...stupid website, rarely works) titled ""What Kind of Obscure Latin Phrase Are You?"" or something like that.  If the silly website had actually been working, perhaps that would have given me a fun title!  Obscure latin phrase.  Whatever could that mean?  Sounds fun.  ""Muchos Gracias"" Restaurant aka ""Big Thanks""  I guess that's not obscure.  But it was really funny when Tanya said it last night.  Then there's the other local Mexican eatery--""Si Casa Flores"" aka ""Yes House Flowers"" Thanks Shane for that enlightening translation. ?????????  So I sent out a bunch of text messages last night to some of ...ummm...internet-savvy friends (as opposed to those who are like ""blog?  wtf?"") telling them about my blog.  So dear buddies vanessa, eric, david, katie, jacob you all should leave me at least one comment so I know if you're looking at this.  You know, so I know how to best censor myself.  :-)  If needed, that is.  FANTASTIC!  I mean FANTASTICK! Now's the time to go to my beloved Petrof and learn ""The Fantasticks"" score before we hold the auditions for it in one week.  Good bye.  love Meagan"

364ERKD,female,24,"ew.  it sucks to be sick.  maybe it's the heat, maybe it's the fact that i AM sick, maybe it's because finals are around the corner and i'm still up to my eyeballs in drawings/paintings/projects that need to be done, then again, maybe it's because jes left and that feeling of incompleteness has found its way back to me again.  we were talking earlier today.  it seems as if being away from each other has become more difficult lately.  i wonder why.  you would think it'd get easier, once the initial honeymoon season was over and done with, but it's quite the opposite.  it's interesting.  i am completely fascinated with her, it's great! =)  i can almost hear you guys gagging out there.  haha.  ok ok, i'll stop talking about her.. lol.. sorry, can't help it!  this semester is almost over and i'm crossing my fingers that i get a 4.0.  all of you should too!  it would really REALLY help out my overall GPA since it SO TOTALLY stinks as a result of my inability to get focused the other times i went to various colleges.  this year is different though.  i had a 3.75 last semester and i'm aiming high this time.  and if i get it, who's buying me drinks?!?  it'll be something to remember because it'll be the FIRST TIME GETTING A 4.0 IN COLLEGE.  that's right!  finally, right?  ay... but let me not get ahead of myself.  there is still so much work that needs to be done.  let's see how this next week goes.  if i'm productive--REALLY productive--this week then i think i can pull it off.  if i'm slacking off like i have been the past few weeks, then uh ohs, we're looking at a couple of B's. =X    anyway, as for the summer, i'm taking a critical thinking class, a graphic design class (to keep me busy and to learn how to use a couple programs), and a portfolio prep class.  eeks, looks like i'm going to be stacked this summer.  thank goodness we have a pool so on my days off i can relax and enjoy the sun.  anyone who's interested, just call me up! =P  on another note, i am so broke again.  it's sad.  well i really don't want a job (who does--true--but there are people out there that actually don't mind it (my babe)), but it's the not having money part that's depressing...haha.  then again, that's at the bottom of my list.  school is definitely first at least until november because i REALLY need to do something about my grades.  hm.  we'll see...    btw, like the drawing?  i'll try and post more every now and again, esp. since i have this AWESOME digital camera i absolutely adore. ;) (whispers:  thanks love! )"
364ERKD,female,24,"Tis the second week of school..    I'm finally done with crashing/adding/dropping classes.  Actually, I just have to submit this for with Admissions and I'm all set for the semester.  Now the only thing I have to worry about are the art supplies I need because they're already costing a GRRRRIP and I haven't even bought half of what I need.  Worth the classes?  ..every cent.   Have I told you the girlfriend is an Art student too?  Isn't that tight?  Ahh it's so weird and nice to share my passion and admiration for art with someone.  I love it.  Anyway, she's in this photographic imagery class and had to take two rolls of film worth of pictures of people.  It was pretty fun.. lol.  And NO, get your mind outta the gutter, it's for her class. lol.  She even let me take a few, I enjoyed myself. ;)  And watching Suzie and Mark take pictures was entertaining.  They're cool peeps.. very funny and cute together.  I especially liked the 'ghetto' pose, yup, that one's a keeper. hah.  Saturday was fun.  Suzie came in and showed us like three pairs of shoes that she bought that day. lol.  OH and how can I forget, Jes cooked up a bomb ass dinner--from scratch EVEN.  Can you believe it?  Yeah, neither can I.. haha.  j/k =P  Hm, what else.  Ahh, it was a  long  night filled with endless, and I mean  endless  talk.  It was great.  Learning people is so much fun, especially when it's someone you've fallen for.  But yeah, fun fun fun night on Sat.  Sunday was all recovery and dinner at BJ's.  mmmmm calzones are great.  ooo and the desserts.. but for the life of me I can't remember the name of it (what's new?).  So, that's my weekend in a nutshell.  I'm actually REALLY looking forward to this semester.  Things are just going too good for me right now, it's almost like the too-perfect scene in a horror flick and I'm waiting for tragedy to strike.  Maybe it never will, but all I know is that life is good.  Fuck the stress, money, and drama...       Life is good .

364ERKD,female,24,"never have i seen so many lovely ladies with beautiful bodies, wearing so little clothing,  conglomerated by the pool.  did i mention there were practically no men?  man, it was quite the experience.  not only was the atmosphere soooo comfortable, everyone was so nice to each other (saying hi to and conversating with random strangers in passing).  i think what did it for me was that for once, i could be as affectionate as i wanted with jes and no one gave a fuck.  things heterosexuals take for granted.  and there were no obnoxious males getting off on it, not that that's a bad thing sometimes, but other times it's just annoying, know what i'm sayin'??  needless to say, i had a good ass time.  next year we're planning some shit cuz this time i want my own room! =D  only downfall to the experience aside from all the drama (not worried cuz it didn't involve me--well for the most part. lol.) were the insane prices of not only the drinks, but the events.  who charges people to cram into the pool area and listen to AIIGHT music anyway?  but hey, they can, and us womens will pay to see girlies half nekked, so i guess whatever goes right?? haha.  oo speaking of half nekked, there was this beautiful lita-lookalike (according to jes, but i agree) chick who frickin worked it like nothing else.  i was mesmerized.  then jessica was over it and so i had to be too. hahaha. 0=)  amber and i were stunned though. =X  a chain of events are going to keep me busy the next couple weeks, but i'll try and update this thing.  if not, happy spring break to me!  and my apologies (though i'm sure you guys don't mind) for not posting any words, guess you're going to have to put your vocab learning experience on hold.  for now anyway..  peace outties."
364ERKD,female,24,"allo allo...  Ahh, the first week of school is almost over.   Can you believe it?  Man is January flying by us like nothing.  Or at least that's what it feels like to me anyway.  Well let's see, quick update..     **I didn't get into the Stat class I wanted to crash, but a really sweet guy offered me his spot.  And of course, after complimenting his thoughtfulness, I denied the offer.  Wasn't that nice of him though??  I thought so.  **My books and supplies are OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive this year.  I should be more stressed than I am, but I'm relying on a financial aid check to roll on by.  And it's going to be so sad to watch that thing withdrawn just as quickly as it was deposited.   **Anatomy class is a MAYBE.  I'm the next one down on the list, but I gotta say, it's a pretty intimidating class.  First class meeting we were already jumping head first into a plethora of medical terms and observing (for my first time) a real-life cadaver!  Where's Cece when I need her?? HA! shyeah.. right..  **I'm really SUPER excited about my art classes.  It's exactly what I need to determine whether or not this is something I want to pursue.. but from the looks of it, my mind's already made up.    I love my girlfriend.  We haven't even been together a month, but she already makes me feel like I can do anything.  And it's so weird because .. I don't know, maybe it's the distance.. but the attraction between us just seems to grow..  I love it!  ..and I love waking up next to her, it makes my day (whatever it may hold) so much more bearable."
364ERKD,female,24,"good morning.  are you bored?  nothing to do?  curious?  miss me?  is that why you're reading?  why thanks, i'm flattered you care.  or wait, are you here to pry or judge or post hate tags?  haha, either way, that STILL shows you care, so HA!  anyway, i've decided to post a few words every now and again to aid in our quest for a powerful and extensive lexicon.  sound good?  i've always been fascinated by people who can speak--intelligibly, and since i feel like my vocabulary isn't quite up to par, maybe doing this every post i make will keep the learning experience more consistent.  yes?  besides, this president's term, and realizing his ignorance clearly by his inability to articulate, alone inspires me.  well, i was going to post some now, but it seems i've run out of time.  eeks.  gotta jet, school awaits me.  say good luck on your quiz.  thanks."
364ERKD,female,24,"Hm.  So.. I was sorting through my crate.  And I stumble upon an envelope that I hadn't noticed was there before.  And inside it is the sweetest, most reassuring note.  ..already a month later and I just now find it.  I just wanted to say thank you, I will cherish it..  that's all..    [ side note ]: I am so lucky to have experienced so much love in my life.  I dread the dark days because I feel like I'm pressing my luck with all the times love worked in my favor; bad luck will find me eventually and when it does I wonder what I'll do.."
364ERKD,female,24,"oh my. what a day.  last night was pretty bad, this morning too.  i was about to post a conversation that caused a lot of people involved a lot of heartache and anger, but then i thought to myself.. publicly humiliating anyone, especially family, is never something people want to see.  not only are you hurting them, but you're making yourself look like an ass too.  i hate fighting with family, especially sisters.  i think i get so upset because i love them so much, and there was one point in my life where i felt like i had lost them and i hated it.  so now, anytime i feel threatened, i flip out.  in other words, sorry for my last post.  emotions get the best of me sometimes.  things are somewhat resolved now, talking talking talking always helps.  for those of you non-talkers out there, remember that!  TALKING ALWAYS HELPS!  i am the strongest advocate of open communication--no holds barred.  it's the answer to everything, trust me.  i guess of course unless you're cece and you insist on hating me for the rest of your life..haha.  ay.  so this is how life should go:  something hurtful is said, he said she said stuff happens, pain is felt, miscommunication is to blame, issues are talked out, people are forgiven, things resolved, and bata bing, bata boom.. life is good again.  life is too short to have it any other way.  simple.  done.  lesson learned?    family is and always will be family   and nothing will ever and can ever change that.    p.s. i pity you who pity yourselves."
364ERKD,female,24,"i honestly believe that       TRAFFIC CAN DRIVE A PERSON TO KILL!!! grrrrr...  this frickin' lady practically helped herself into my lane with me still in it.  what the heezy?  i mean i know blind spots are tricky and all, but if you're not absolutely sure, don't pull a cece lane change!  i'm sure you all know what the heck i'm talking about too! lol...  sorry, traffic is a pet peeve.  ESPECIALLY when i'm the one in the driver's seat.  so anyway today was the first day of school in LA. it made me long for the city scene.  i'm not that type of person though, i think i can't handle being in the fast lane for too long, but it'd be a nice experience.  ...maybe someday...  ok well i better go because boobica might read this and wonder why i wasn't working on my essay.

O77EEHN,female,25,"There are  urlLink free movies in Bryant Park  (on 40th between 5th and 6th - 42nd/Bryant Park station) on Monday evenings in the summer.  This week's movie was  urlLink American Graffiti . Boy, Harrison Ford must be old now if he was young then.  I acquired a tasty roast beef sandwich at the Pea Soup Deli (on 5th near 39th) and picnicked in the park."
O77EEHN,female,25,"We managed to get tickets to the next to the-next to the-last performance of Assassins.  I was greatly amused to hear that it was first performed in 92 when the first Bush was elected and was recently revived in the past couple of years (hmmmm.....).   It's a great dark comedy and indictment of social inequities.  They focus on the sad lives the assasins lead before killing or trying to kill the president.  It's very much about the dark side of the American dream.  I swear some liberal millionaire must have decided to fund the revival of this play just to spite Bush Jr.    Got to go get lunch,    Bye"
O77EEHN,female,25,"On Saturday, I went to the  urlLink Frick Collection  (1 E70th Street, near the park).  It's this gorgeous old mansion where Henry Clay Frick put his personal art collection.  Every available surface is covered with art, plus there are free-standing statues.  It's smaller than a regular museum - it was house, if a big one - but all the art is good. You know how sometimes you go to  urlLink some museums  and there's a whole room with nothing in it but a toilet and a sign declaring that it (the toilet, not the sign) is Meaningful Art? There's none of that here. Henry Clay Frick had good taste. (Or, possibly, 'modern art' meant something different in 1900.)  They said that almost half the stuff is from his original collection - the directors don't replace pieces often.  One of the unique things about this collection is that it's mostly ""happy"" art, like it would be pleasant to have hanging over your dinner table. (My dad once bought a painting depicting a battle scene that somehow involved bleeding horses, and insisted on putting it in the dining room.  Eating steak became much more difficult with the painting there.  Eventually my mother relegated the painting to the basement.)  One room has a lot of landscapes and portraits of very serious people - but in the middle of that is Jean-Baptiste Greuze's ""The Wool Winder"", which is of a girl trying to wind up a ball of yarn, except a kitten is tugging on the loose ends. That's my favorite. The kitten looks so playful, and there's a remarkable amount of detail that brings the painting to life.  There's also a self-portrait by Rembrandt. And that got me thinking - how did artists do self portraits back then?  Did they even  have  mirrors in the 1600s? I guess they probably did.  But still, it seems hard to hold a pose and paint it at the same time. So maybe he was guessing about what he looked like, or painting the picture to be the way he wanted to look.   Some of the artists did really clever things with light.  In  urlLink The Education of the Virgin , the candlelight casts sharp light on one subject but a softer, diffused light on the other subject.  But it all looks really accurate - better than 3D rendering programs do today.  My favorite portrait is the one of Thomas More.  In most portraits, the person is usually looking off into space sort of blankly, or maybe smiling.  In this one, Thomas More has this profound look of resignation, like there's a really good baseball game on but somebody has told him he has to sit  right there  until the painting is finished, and he's tried very hard to argue his way out of it, but finally given up.  This is a fabulous collection all around, and the century-old mansion is a great comfy setting for it."
O77EEHN,female,25,"Today I edited my first film.  I was a little nervous about working in Final Cut Pro as I had so much trouble trying to work with Adobe Premiere.  Final Cut Pro feels like iMovie+.  It's so intuitive that I was able to finish editing my movie 3 hours ahead of schedule.  I'll get a link to it up as soon as I get my DVD player out here.  It's been great to put all my energy into film again.  I even find myself getting back into photography.  I'm collecting pictures of all the anti-Bush graffiti I can find.  I've put some of the pictures I've taken on-line at www.bixel.org/pictures/  Fortunately (and unfortunately) my school is located in the middle of a bunch of the best restaurants in town and they are all still offering cheap prix fixe meals for lunch.  I've been torn between hanging with my film school friends and sneaking off to eat at some of the nice restaurants.  Today, the cuisine got the better of me and I had some great gazpacho, steak fritte and a peach napoleon for lunch at Steak Fritte.  Together it was just $20.  Lexi promised that she would sneak off one day and join me for lunch one of these days.  Maybe next Thursday.  We've got more shows lined up for this week.  Thursday we're off to see Jai from Queer Eye in Rent.  Then on Friday we're seeing Sarah Jones one woman show ""Bridge and Tunnel"".  Well it's getting late.  Good Night."
O77EEHN,female,25,"You have to get up pretty early in the morning to get tickets to anything in New York.  I've got to stop trying to show up when the ticket office opens.  You need to get there atleast 2 hours ahead of time to have any chance of getting anything.  I spent yesterday chasing tickets that were already gone.  From Shakespeare in the Park to the Theater Development Fund, the lines were blocks long right at the moment the office opened.  So in desperation, I started wandering around, looking for a theater that had any tickets left.  I found some tix to Movin' Out.  After that I spent the afternoon lifting weights.  Then I met Lexi at Central Park to rollerblade.  My stride has been getting a lot better.  This complicates things as my ability to brake has yet to catch up.  The problem is that just as I'm right handed, I'm apparently right footed too.  I can keep balance on my right leg much longer than on my left leg.  As the brake is on my right foot, I have trouble keeping balance on my left as I stick out my right to stop me.  It's going to be a while before I become ambifootstrous enough to stop when I want to.  We ate at the Heartland Chop House.  They had the most enormous Prix Fixe.  Lexi got three times the steak she could eat.   We also had their beer sampler.  There was an unfortunate prevalence of fruit flavored beers.  This wouldn't have been a problem, except for the lingering memory of the apricot ale I had along with cold cheese sausage on the fateful birthday fishing trip for Keith.  I'm not totally giving up on apricot ales the way Lexi gave up on Vodka after my 21st birthday, but I have to admit that apricot ale is a lot less pleasant than it used to be.  I found some tickets to Movin' Out, the Billy Joel musical.  Lexi really wanted to see it and I like a few of his songs.  Neither of us expected the new age rock-ballet that we got.  There was no dialogue.  The entire story was told in a combination of the lyrics of Billy Joel's songs and the movements of the dancers.  There was much frantic spinning to demonstrate a whole plethora of emotional vignettes.  They lose the girl, they twirl.  They're fighting paranoia in the jungles of vietnam, they twirl.  They come home and start doing smack, they twirl.  Always, twirling, twirling towards freedom.  We finished out the night by taking another trip on our skates north along the Hudson.  I really love the bike/skate path along the Hudson.  It's nearly perfectly flat and very well paved.  I can really build up some speed on it.  We did about 7 miles round trip and then came home and collapsed in front of the first episode of Babylon 5 season 4."
O77EEHN,female,25,"Our anniversary didn't turn out quite as we had hoped, but we had fun anyway.  We had planned to go to a reading by Kurt Vonnegut, Salman Rushdie and others.  But when we got there, the line went around the block twice.  I hope that my Douglas Adams curse doesn't claim Vonnegut too.  I heard that Douglas Adams was in Santa Barbara while I was there, studying for my masters degree.  I kept putting off going to see him speak.  I found out later that he had died, in Santa Barbara, right before his last speaking engagement.  With our original plans obviously not going to work out, we found a nice Sushi place around NYU.  It was good, cheap sushi and sake and the Manchurian Candidate at a Time Square Movie Theater.  We've gotten a couple of unlimited metrocards so we've been hopping around the city like crazy.  It's nice to decide to have dinner at NYU and then catch a movie in Time Square and not have to worry about how to get there.  Before we met for dinner, I went to the financial district to see the Giscard Games.  It was this interpretive dance show, where women dressed as floor traders danced up and down the steps of the federal building to mimic the violent turmoil of the market.  The music sounded like a tribal techno remix of Pink Floyd's ""Money"".  The dancers woke to the bell.  Then they angrily gesticulated at each other, holding up different numbers of fingers, shaking their heads yes and no.  Then they ran up and down the stairs to show the flux of different markets.  Then the final bell rang and all the dancers ran up to the top of the stairs, except for one who feigned a stumble.  Then in reference (I think) to the sexual harassment cases against major trading firms, the dancer who stumbled was forced to dance while all the other dancers watched, hooting and cat-calling.  It was a really surreal scene in itself, but the extra security in the financial district made it even stranger.   It was another one of those America in a Nutshell moments.  Officers in full body armor watching women worship the market gods in the holy citadel of capitalism.  The pictures that I could get (my battery ran out) are up at:   urlLink http://www.seq.org/~acasteel/newyorkgiscardgames/index.htm"
O77EEHN,female,25,"If you physically show up at the  urlLink Nederlander Theater  (W41st near 7th) on Sunday, you can buy half-price tickets for Rent for upcoming weekday performances.   (I think the ads at the top of this page - for stuffed antelopes - are absolutely hilarious. Go, AdSense!)"
O77EEHN,female,25,"I can't believe we forgot to post about this. On July 28, we went to see ""The Spirit of Django Reinhardt"" at the Lincoln Center.  Django Reinhardt was some French dude who put together American jazz and gypsy music in the 1930s, which means the music sounds like jazz except it's coming from unexpected instruments.  The concert was performed by seven musicians who had studied in that style.  It was like nothing I've heard before.  Not that I make a habit of going to classical concerts or anything - if they're all this cool, maybe I'll do this more often. There was a  jazz violinist .  See, I never would have even put those words in a sentence together, but apparently there is  more than one  (the playbill says that this violinist, Roby Lakatos, is ""one of Europe's major jazz violinists"").   He just wailed on that violin, playing really fast and getting lots of range out of it. OK, that's not a very descriptive description, but I don't know the right words for what violins are supposed to sound like.  Anyway, at the end, after the violinist had finished this really long and complicated solo, the lead guitarist, Stochelo Rosenberg, took the violin from him and played a pretty good solo of his own."
O77EEHN,female,25,"Sorry for the delay, it's been busy lately.  I finished editing my final film which, considering that it is only some b-roll and narrative, is still independent local cable station ready.  Then we went to Maria and Sarah's wedding. It was a great time. Our hotel room was so comfortable or I was just extra tired from quitting caffeine. I found that I was getting back to college levels of diet coke abuse trying to keep up with having fun and school. After a night of insomnia, I decided to cut out caffeine. It was so much fun hanging out with everyone at the wedding that it took care of my caffeine withdrawal headache.  The ceremony was very sweet. Sarah's parents are the pastors of their Baptist church so they ran the ceremony. There was a point as Sarah's father was telling them to repeat their vows, where he got all choked up and had to pause for a moment. Oberlin was the most liberal small town I've ever been to. It was like a smaller, quainter, less consumer, more humid version of the bay area. There are hippies, but they all seem to have a higher time v. money ratio for their utility function than the consumer hippies of San Francisco and Berkeley.  The bachelor party was fun. The only thing was that both Sarah and Maria were there, so I felt like I had to hold back on what I said about Maria. I think it's more fun when each persons friend's can take them somewhere, without their significant other, and really rip into them. It was even harder to tell any stories after Sarah's grade school friends shared grade school stories about her. I couldn't jump from a G-Rated story about Sarah to an R-Rated story about Maria. Finally Sarah''s friend Kramer raised the stakes with a college sex story, opening up the door for at least one of my stories about Maria.  There was some real heavy rain throughout the weekend, but it cleared up just for their ceremony and most of their reception. The reception food was delicious. There was this funky feta-cheese and watermelon salad. Which I thought was OK, but that a lot of other people seemed to really like. I respected the bold culinary clash of fruit and sharp cheese, but I didn't think that the combination elevated the combined ingredients to any higher plane. We snuck out of the reception to mess up Sarah's car before the couple left, but it took Shannon, Catherine and I too long to get back and Sarah's friends had already painted up her car, filled it with balloons and took it to the next level by giving it a flat tire on the way from the church to the reception. Right as the flat was discovered, the heavens opened up for a real deluge. Kramer and others took lead on changing the tire. All the while, the pink writing on the black car was running, making the whole car look like a pile of melting raspberry and strawberry sorbet. Then after the car was jacked up and the bolts were off, the tire refused to budge. It seemed rusted on. Maria's friend from gradeschool in Texas came and finally budged the tire off. In between trying to help remove the tire, I managed to catch a few pictures of the whole affair.  After the ceremony, the Caltech crew came back to our hotel in Cleveland. Shannon, his girlfriend Maria, Kim, Catherine, Rob and his girlfriend Margie were all there. It's really eerie to see one of those life-alarms going off all around you.  Makes me more concerned about the warnings all my 30 year old friends are giving me about the whole child rearing phase.  At the end of the weekend we all talked about the possibility of getting together to do some wine tasting."
O77EEHN,female,25,"Holy Shit!  I didn't expect film school to be this intense.  I suspected that it would be 9-6 each day with no homework.  It's turned out to be 9-6-occasionally-9 and I have to give up a day and a half this weekend to do a continuity film project.  I'm learning a lot, but I wanted to have more time to have fun.  I'm trying to work my personal schedule around my film school duties, but it is going to be difficult.  On the bright side, I like all of my classmates and I've been having a great time with them, when we aren't exhausted.  Rob, Maria and Sarah are dropping by this Saturday and I hope that I can get away from filming long enough to hang with them.  I've decided not to pay the overinflated gym prices and just rely on walking and other exercise this summer as I've had hardly any time outside of school and painting the town red with Lexi.  We went to Hairspray yesterday, which was a blast.  I love live theater because the show can change and respond to current events.  The actors were joking about the possible broadway strike and about how Bush stole the election in 2000.  Gotta go to get enough sleep for tomorrow.  Bye"
RO9SBUW,female,47,"We had some pretty nasty thunderstorms run through here Tuesday night. Yesterday, all afternoon I worked out in the yard and didn't even finish picking up all the dead branches and leaves and stuff. Trees are wonderful things, I love them, but I'm doubting the wisdom of buying a house with 21 trees in the yard. Hmmm. Steve was outside for about 3 hours last night just cutting up the firewood and loading up the truck with wood to take to the dump. After I took a chunk out of my finger with pliers on Tuesday, I guess he doesn't trust me with a chainsaw. I don't know why not.  I'd be nice if I had my computer back so I could post some pictures. Crap. Some guy Steve works with is supposed to fix it for us. Um hm. Right.  Anyway, we had a huge branch come out of one the cottonwoods in the front yard and hit the power line. It snapped off and caused a bunch of sparking and stuff. Cool. Hey, you get your excitement where you can, okay? I thought that kind of stuff only happened in movies, but it happens in real life! Whoo hoo! The police had to come and sit by the wire so no one would come on it in the dark and step on it. I called the police and the power company when the line went down at about, um, 6:45 or so. The police didn't get here until after 7:30 and the power company finally came at about 2 a.m. I was fast asleep, the neighbor saw them.  Ruger is the goofiest dog, I just love him. Steve had given me one of those whatchamacallits that's a little plastic tube and when you bend it the little cylinder inside breaks and then it glows for 8 hours or so. I can never remember the name.... Anyway, Steve had given me one so when the power company came and had to turn off our electricity we'd have some light. (I know, don't even say it.) Needless to say, we didn't need it at 2 a.m., and I don't even think it affected out power, but I put the thing on the end table when I went to bed. Yesterday I was looking all over for Ruger and couldn't find him. I finally discovered him  behind  the couch with his head  under  the couch. Kind of like those little kids - if they can't see you then it must mean you can't see them. I couldn't figure out what he was doing in a position like that, but I quickly found out that he thought the package containing the light was food and had chewed it up. Didn't touch the plastic thingy though, I guess by the time he chewed the wrapper off he had discovered it didn't contain food. What I great dog, I don't even have to find his messes, he punishes himself. Too bad he can't clean up after himself as well.  I guess I've worked hard enough today. Off to today's crossword puzzle and a little relaxation time. TTFN"

RO9SBUW,female,47,"My chauffeur (Steve) took me up to Fremont today for Amanda's baby shower. Her baby is so cute. I can't for the life of me remember his name. I guess it doesn't matter, he'd be cute even if I did remember his name. It was nice to see everybody again. Sometimes it sucks working at home. I'm so darn social (hahaha!) that I miss talking to people. But - I get more work done.  But - if you get paid by the hour, who cares? LOL! Anyway, it was so nice to hold a small baby again. Babies are just so precious. I think it's so neat to think that just such a short time ago they were living with God and now, here they are! It's amazing.    After my chauffeur picked me up, we went to look at a house just outside Fremont. I love it, Steve loves it, but *ouch* the price. It's been on the market since last year so of course Steve thinks they're asking too much for it. Maybe they are.  Maybe nobody is buying it because they think it's going to fall into the river. Who knows? I think it's actually a lot of house and land, which is what we want, even though we can't afford it. With our budget it's either larger house  or  more land. Not both. Not unless you want to live like Green Acres. I actually know the house I would love. The only problem is the yard isn't big enough for Steve. You would think when you work all day during the week and your weekend is filled with gun shows, hunting, cutting firewood, and hanging out with your buds in Beatrice and Lincoln, that a big yard that you're never home to take care of wouldn't be a priority.  Wrong.    Men."

RO9SBUW,female,47,"I can't believe I've neglected my poor lonely blog for so long!  This has been the most crazy 6 weeks.  We finally bought a house - YAY for us!  It's a bigger house, ranch style, and the yard is bigger.  I'm so THRILLED I can hardly stand it.  We're closing on the 25th, but we're moving in on the 19th.  Otherwise we'd be moving, closing, and the people who bought our house would be moving in the same day.  That could be ugly.  We did that when we bought this house, even shared the same moving truck with Barry and his wife.  Never again will I do that!  We even hired a moving company this time to move the big stuff.  Besides, they're insured.  If they drop the 65"" TV we can get another.  On the other hand, if we drop it we're SOL.  And I don't mean ""singing out loud""!    Dad and Pam have been looking at a couple places, they finally found a house they really like, but Pam is having a little trouble finding a job.  I can't believe how rude HR people are.  She was offered a job at one assisted living facility, they offered her a job and told her to let them know by 6:30 if she wanted it.  When she called them back and said she was interested, they told her they had a few other applicants and would let her know the next day!  WHAT?!!  The next day they told her they'd hired someone from within.  Another place told her they had to wait until they signed some contracts - which fell through, so no job.  Why would you even be interviewing someone for a position that wasn't even available yet?  We won't even go into the places that don't even acknowledge a resume.  I know there are a lot more applicants than there are jobs, but a simple note to acknowledge they received the resume would just be common courtesy, IMHO.    Mel and Dan moved to a new place in Elkhorn, much closer than the eastern side of Council Bluffs, I have to say!  It's a really darling house, I love it!    Mike and Amy also bought a house, so the whole family has turned very nomadic this summer!    I'm still working at OPD part-time and working at home doing medical transcription part-time also.  It fits my crazy schedule.  Except, I wanted to work this weekend, but my arthritis or whatever was acting up Saturday, I spent most of the day eating codeine and lying on the heating pad.  I haven't had a day that bad in a long time, and I won't be hurt if I don't have another any time soon.    I was really sorry to hear of the passing of Ronald Reagan.  Alzheimer's disease has to be one of the most cruel diseases ever, for the families and caregivers as well as the patient.  I'm sure Nancy is very much relieved that her burden has been lifted someone and that he is at peace.  I was only in my 20s when he was president, but I think he did a wonderful job!    Okay, I promise it won't be another six weeks before I return!    TTFN"
RO9SBUW,female,47,"I've been sadly neglecting my poor blog.  It really bites to have to work 8 hours a day!  I had a terrible dictating doctor yesterday - man... By the time I quit work I was ready to cry, I was so frustrated.  I just can't fathom how doctors want, no,  expect  their dictation to be perfect - and rightly so, but they refuse to put the effort into it.  They leave off dosages, mispronounce the names of drugs, dictate information under the wrong patient name, talk too fast, chew gum, eat, burp, etc., and we (medical transcriptionists) are supposed to clean it up.  That's just nuts!  We manage (sometimes I don't know how), but we usually manage to put out a good report!  Kudos to the docs who take the time to realize there's a live person who's going to have to listen and make sense out of what you say.  It's always nice to hear a doctor say, ""Thank you transcriptionist, have a good day"".  Makes it easier to try harder with the bumbling bozo who comes next.  Anyway - off that soapbox!   I must be doing okay, I got an e-mail from my mentor yesterday releasing me from 100% QA after a week and a half, so I'm pretty pumped!    On a totally different subject.  Steve and I went to see  The Passion of Christ  last night with Bob and Carole (my mother-in-law and father-in-law).   What an intense movie!  I was totally drained when we left the theater, it was so emotional.  Steve didn't like it.  He thought it was ""sick"".  He thought there was too much violence and it was too graphic.  Hellooooo!  There were times I felt like I just couldn't stand one more minute... like during the scourging and while he was carrying the cross, it just seemed so drawn out and long.  But, to put things in perspective, we watched a 2 hour movie (I'm not sure of the exact time) the entire incident lasted  12 hours !  All we saw was a portion of what really happened, one-sixth of the time that was actually spent.  Kind of put it in perspective for me.  I'll never think about the crucifixion the same.  Never.  I believe it's been sanitized over the years and this really brought home to me how much the Christ really did suffer for us.  When I was a little kid growing up and saw pictures of Jesus on the cross, there was no blood.  The cloth He had around his loins was white and  clean., and then I'd hear sermons about how Christ suffered for us.  Didn't look like suffering to me.  Seriously, I'm not trying to be an idiot here, but it didn't look like much suffering to me.  Obviously, as I got older a realized a little more of what went on, but until last night I can honestly say I never, ever,  imagined  how horrible it was.  How He must love us...   I won't see it again.  I can't see it again, but I know that my eyes were truly opened for the first time.  And the hype about the anti-Semitism - I can see how people would be afraid of raising the issue of anti-Semitism, but if you've ever read the Book, you know the story.  I think the Jews at that time were just afraid, and they were acting on that fear.  They felt very threatened and did what they felt they needed to do.  It had to be done.  It was going to happen one way or another, the Jews were only part of the process.  If it wouldn't have been them and the Romans, it would have been someone else.  Okay, enough said.    Then, the most wonderful thing happened after THAT last night! Sister Brotherson is in town and she came over - of course she's not Sister Brotherson anymore, just Michelle, but it was so great to see her.  And she brought Krissy Weekly with her, and another sister that I never got a chance to know very well, since she wasn't in our ward - Kimber?  I can't remember her last name - Alzheimer's is setting in quickly.  It was so good to see all of them again... They hold a very special place in my heart, I hope they all know how much I love them.  (I have to say that includes Allyson, Amy, Rebekah, Shalese, Natalie, Sister Moody, Sister Winkler, Sister Smith, Sister Jensen, and all the great sister missionaries I've been blessed to know.  Love you guys!"
RO9SBUW,female,47,"To any LDS girls (or guys, for that matter), who think that marrying a non-member is no big deal.  Even if you're inactive now and have no intention of going back to church, it is a big deal.  Even if you never go back to church, somewhere inside you there's a little ""Mormon core"" and when what your spouse believes is  NOTHING  like your Mormon core, even if the your mouth is saying you understand and agree, you don't.   One morning you'll wake up and say, ""What was I thinking?""  And it wil be too late to do anything about it.  Listen to that Still Small Voice.  Listen hard.

24S02MP,female,25,"I read a critic about the movie ""The Day after Tomorrow"" that the scientific facts or hypothesis presented in the movie were incorrect or absurb. So I was a little influenced by that comment when I watched the movie yesterday night at GV Plaza.   Well, it is interesting to use the weather as the basic of the story. However, among the disaster movies such as Deep Impact, Armaggadon, The Core, this one has become so expected. There's always a dog involved, a divorced family (to protray the American culture?), a president, a bad guy who learned his mistakes, foolish people who dont heed advices, a young hero who save his love and they kiss and make out, an older expert sacrificing.. and so on. Plot is too predictable. Special effects are not bad, but not good enough. I'd wish they will focus more on the greatness of the disaster, and protray the fear and how scary they are. I didn't feel anything. There some climaxes but it didn't get me too excited. Really, if its a story about the weather, show more of the hurricanes, storms and tsunamis, how they form, why and how scary they can be. Instead, they could only manage computer simulation used by the meteorologist.   Either acting isn't too convincing or the director fail to deliver the emotions. This deserves 2/5 stars."
24S02MP,female,25,"Why does it hurt the most when you love the most? The deeper you love, the harder it hurt. Love and pain, they go hand in hand. Knowing that it will hurt, you still want to fall in love. If you know that it will leave a deep wound, would you still fall in love?   If you have not loved, have you been missing out? If you had a choice, would you fall in love again? Why do you fall in love? Why do you take the risk? Why would you cry when your love leave?   Maybe my heart is too fragile to take the risk. Maybe I'm a coward. Maybe I'm not adventurous. Knowing the pain, I shut my heart. Am I bluffing if I said I did not shut it? This is probably why I won't be surprise if I'll be single for life. I wonder if I'm too picky or I'm not daring. Either way, it doesn't matter. Love can be given away in many ways.   No matter how you love, you will cry. So love with all your heart. Dry your tears, mend your wounds, get on with life. This is the road you choose. Enjoy the roller coaster ride.   ""I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave, cos your presences still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you 'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I've held your hands through all of these yrs. But you still have, all of me...."" --  My Immortal , Evanescence"

24S02MP,female,25,"3rd sis wanted to shop at Kuala Lumpur over the long weekend on 7 Aug (9 Aug being the National Day). 3 of us and her boyfriend got up at 6am and made our way to the Tuas second link to Malaysia. I was famished so we stopped by to have breakfast. When we reached the custom, it was almost 8 and there was already a traffic jam. I guess everyone was taking advantage of the long weekend to go somewhere. Precisely why we got up so early - to avoid the jam!! But we end up being stuck in it for 3 hours or so. Originally a 3 hrs road trip to KL (at a conservative 120km/hr speed) became 8 hrs, thanks to the jam when entering M'sia and Kuala Lumpur. Well, even the locals drive to KL from other states.  While we were speeding, our driver was in a daze when he over took a traffic police and sped up. Of cos we were asked to pull over and the local police threatened to issue a summon. We knew he wanted $ and the market rate is RM50. So driver bargained with him, ""Sir, help me reduce lah."" ""How much you want me to reduce?"" ""50?"" ""(roll eyeballs) aiya, 50?! no lah!"" ""ah? then? 100?"" ""ok lah. ok lah."" After that, driver was very awake and learnt from his poor negotiating skills.  This trip was quite impromtu. It was impossible to find any hotels. Even the most lousy ones were full! (Including those that are haunted. : ) Lucky for my sis' great network, we bunked in with her friend's friend's condo for a night. We were lucky to find a place to stay, for free too. We counted our blessing when there were three mattresses and water (not hot) to wash up. Good thing we had taken precautions. We brought our own pillows, cushions and warm clothings for the cold night. It was dusty and quite dirty but it sure beats sleeping in the car.  When we were packing and going through our stuff the next morning, we realised that 2nd sis' passport wasn't stamped by the Malaysia custom on entry. This will cause a lot of troubles as we read from previous reports on the news. It usually requires some under table $ too. This was the first time the ""passport-in-charge"" forgot to check for entry stamps when we pass the custom and it had to happen to be the first time one passport didn't get stamped. We called the tourism board and were told that it ""shouldn't be a problem"". We wonder since we had the impression that the Malaysia bureaucrats are difficult. When we reach the departing custom, sis was directed to another office. As the computer had her entry record, and she still had her custom ""white-card"" that had a entry stamp, the officer just made a note and stamped her passport for exit. *phew* It wasn't as bad as we thought.  Interesting experiences. Lotsa lesson learnt.  This will be the last time we make last minute travel arrangements."
24S02MP,female,25,"What's happening? No one is blogging??  I caught Kill Bill last Wed and I liked it! It is not as good as Vol.1 but I still enjoy the martial arts, humour, dramatic effects and the story telling. I must say, Quentin Tarantino is really not that bad. (hahaa althou ugly).   The audiences disturb me. They laugh when it's not funny. Just because the movie present the show in a dramatic, oldies-chinese-martial-art-movie way? So what if the high priest can stand on sword? Qing-gong does exist! They just can't appreciate the way the director intend to shoot the movie. It kills my mood, when I'm enjoying the dramatic effects and martial arts.

The weekend was quite calm.  Since we have white trash tendencies, our house was a wreck.  Let me explain.   We have this huge dining room area (see the pics from the earlier post).  Now, since white trash boys don't like investing in things like tables and chairs, my brother chose to use the dining room as a workshop to build a speaker box.   3 days later, it was filled with lumber, sawdust, tools, and blood.  Oh yeah, he cut his pretty bad.  Then he passed out and bled on the floor.  What a puss.  Anyways, The house is now immaculate for at least a day.  Much like the terror alert scale our dictator uses, I will make one for my house.   We are currently at orange alert, which means a full scale mess is a possibility.  I saw an indy film this weekend called the station agent.  Probably the best movie I have seen this year.  Its a must see.  PS  I get to go see the Pixies in September.  Top that, chief."

7HCUXM0,male,38,"GAY MARRIAGE UPDATE  * A second county in the state of Oregon has  urlLink decided  to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  Following the lead of Multnomah County, the commissioners of Benton County have decided to proceed and authorize the issuance of licenses beginning March 24 despite an opinion of the attorney general of Oregon that a county may be found to be in violation of state law.   With the May 17 deadline quickly approaching in Massachusetts, Multnomah and Benton join Sandoval County (NM), San Francisco (CA), New Paltz (NY), Asbury Park (NJ) on the growing list of local governments opting to recognize same-sex marriages.  * In an interesting analysis piece in today's  The New York Times , Mr. Adam Liptak  urlLink makes  the case that the current uproar over gay marriage at a federal level is akin to constitutional law that once banned interracial heterosexual unions.  It's somewhat amazing to realize that it was not until 1967, that the U.S. Supreme Court finally overturned all bans on interracial marriage.  The piece also points out the flawed logic of President Bush's invocation of the ""full faith and credit"" clause of the U.S. Constitution to urge the need for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage.  Bush's argument claims that the ""full faith and credit"" clause would supersede individual state's rights to recognize a same-sex marriage.  However, many constitutional and legal scholars have disagreed with Bush's premise.  As quoted in Liptak's piece, Andrew Koppelman, a law professor at Northwestern University, begs to differ:  "" No state has ever been required by the full faith and credit clause to recognize any marriage they didn't want to. ""   MORE CASTING COUCH...  01.  The sequel to the Sandra Bullock vehicle ""Miss Congeniality"" begins shooting in April in Los Angeles, New York and Las Vegas.  Directed by John Pasquin (""The Santa Clause""), Regina King, William Shatner and Heather Burns had previously been announced as cast members.  After looking at several well-known leading men to play Bullock's love interest, the producers have chosen a small-screen star, Enrique Murciano ( from CBS's ""Without A Trace"" and MTV's ""Spyder Games"") to fill the role of a Las Vegas FBI liaison officer.  02.  Actor/director John Turturro has begun principal photography in NYC on ""Romance & Cigarettes"", which he also wrote the script to.  The film is said to be a musical comedy and has a varied cast of actors including: Christopher Walken, Mary-Louise Parker, Susan Sarandon, James Gandolfini, Kate Winslett and Mandy Moore.  The catch to the ""musical"" part will be that the actors will lip-synch to songs by other artists.  Tentatively included in the movie soundtrack are songs by Irving Berlin, Connie Francis, Engelbert Humperdinck, Tom Jones, Dusty Springfield, Bruce Springsteen  and Nick Cave.   U.S. PATENT #6,704,116  For some odd reason, I was fascinated by this  urlLink profile  of a Baruch College professor who has earned a U.S. patent for a standardized Arabic alphabet called ""Arabetics"".  His goal was to invent a more standardized form of transcription for many Arabic-based languages in written and computer documents.  Interestingly,  Arabic is written right to left and each letter can take one of four forms. Arabic is also printed and written only in flowing script, never as individual letters.   WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink sedulous    SIGNIFICANT OTHERS  While waiting to catch last night's ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"", I watched an episode of the new Bravo comedy  urlLink ""Significant Others"" .  Two things stuck in my brain.  First, during a discussion of female anatomy, one of the male cast likened the vagina to ""a melted candle with hair on it"".  Second, a pregnant woman who's husband was afraid to have sex in her condition pleasured herself with a Crest Spin Brush Pro.  One only hopes no one from the FCC was watching."
7HCUXM0,male,38,"A WORK IN PROGRESS  "" I don't want my life to begin and end with being gay. ""  This marvelous line comes from an Australian film entitled "" urlLink The Sum of Us "". That screenplay, and the original stage play upon which it was based, were written by David Stevens. The thing about this line is that it didn't hit me until my fourth or fifth viewing of the film. But then suddenly, I was witnessing my spiritual twin (the character of Jeff) on the screen uttering that line to his father in response to queries about what he wanted out his life. He'd just finished telling his father that falling in love wasn't easy and that he didn't want being a gay man to just be about sexual experiences. He enjoyed the company of children, elderly people, women....and wanted them all in his life. It's not all about walking through life with your penis in your hand.  For me, the discovery I was a gay man--.from the very outset--was always more than just a sexual identification or experience. Yes, it served as a frame of reference that would come to color the way the world and other people look at me. It also served as a lightning rod for my own expectations of what I wanted to accomplish with my life.  What I needed--and selfishly, what I wanted. I am now proud to say that I am a gay man.  Sadly, this was not always the case. In a world that is so filled with diversity and change, society at large still cherishes ""sameness"" and lives with conformity and status quo as comfort measures. I wonder if being ""different"", or being gay, will ever be easier? It is my sincere hope that for generations yet to come it will be.  In fairness, my lifetime is much easier than those that came before me. But we live in times where people still frown on the color of skin, fear the threat of the unknown or uncomfortable. We plot our lives over fields laced with ethnocentricity, predjudice, hate, war, and fear...and yet somehow, mankind continues forth. At times learning from our mistakes and in others settling to repeat them.  So, my life is not about being gay. Being gay is a part of my life. It is something that defines part of who I am and what I want. It wasn't a choice--just merely who I am. I intend to live my life as such. Again, this is the viewpoint that my experiences have brought me to. Some will agree and others will not. But for me, this is the essence of who I am.  The man I want to be. Yes, being gay can (and should be) an 'issue' to be politicized. But, just like any other minority group (be it of racial, sexual, political, or religious orientation), I have no more or no less right than any other to expect certain basic human rights. Unfortunately, our society is not there yet.   However,  I must live my life as my conscience, heart, and free will dictate. Every man, woman and child should have the same precious gift.  So do I consider myself an activist? Aah...there's a loaded word. Truthfully, I'm not sure. What I do know is that the experiences I went through--the lack of support, and the lack of an outlet to know what I felt and desired were okay--changed my life forever. Okay--a damned simple word. Okay. I am okay. You are okay. Gay is okay. Simple sentences based on concepts.  Concepts that societal programming, family, morality, religion, mental health, and the uneducated voices will have us believe are the exact opposite of the unequivocal truth.   So I'm not sure it is so much activism that pushes and drives an inner purpose in me. Mainly, it is the fact that I want to lead by example. To teach others who will walk in my shoes.  With equal respect, to be an example of a proud gay man for those who will trample on these worn shoes each step of the way. Instead of repeating disabling cycles that eventually claim the human soul, history should teach us the good and bad. It should also enable us to grow. In the end, it should teach us human acceptance and dignity. Human hope and tolerance. After all, what is this world but the sum of its parts.....the sum of us.  As I re-read the last paragraph, I thought to myself 'nice words....but...'. Maybe there is just a bit of innocence in those words? Maybe a tad too much faith in humankind? Maybe a bit too much self-righteous morality? In the end, I always reach the same conclusion when searching for the meaning in those words. Is that such a bad thing to believe that those words can be true? I believe that we live in a world that has proven time and again that we are a product of our own making. We certainly are influenced by others and forces around us. Perhaps we've come to rely on these influences as an excuse for our behavior? If we were to live our lives by heartfelt convictions and similar actions, then we lead by example instead of mimicry. Maybe then we have lived for a reason.  It is my belief that no man or woman is perfect. Life and living are about growth and expansion.  Fueled by knowledge gathered by our collective experience. I still find myself plagued at times by doubt and misinformed predjudices. It would be much easier for me to take that baggage with me to my grave than to try and find the folly of my ways. To err is human.  To accept error and take corrective action is not always humane. Until my last breath, I shall always be a work in progres.   THESE SOUNDS FALL INTO MY MIND  01.

7HCUXM0,male,38,"CATHOLICISM & THE GAY MAN  I was raised in a devout Roman Catholc family.  As a child, I was never sure what ""devout"" actually meant in the context of religion.  As an adult, I'm still not really sure if I do.  I do know that as a child, my family would attend church services weekly.  I was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church.  I attended catechism classes and went through a communion ceremony.  I detested the act of confession, but participated rather frequently.  I guess in some ways you could say that I was taught to believe in God.  I've always wondered how much of any organized religion is based on indoctrination.  Further, I think I've reached a conclusion that spirituality and organized religion are not the same thing.  Just like growing up, I look at my own spirituality as a journey--perhaps a never-ending one.  But, my relationship with the organized Roman Catholic Church came to an end when I was a freshman in high school.  To say I caused a scandal in my extended family would be an understatement.  It just was not acceptable.  Of course, my problems with the Catholic Church began about the same time I began to face my sexual identity.  But, to say that was the only issue that drove me away from the church would not be a fair characterization either.  As I began maturing as a person, I began to see what I perceived as faulty logic in the teachings of the Church.  I began to question a religion that told me I was unacceptable as a homosexual. I didn't agree with the Church's stand on abortion, birth control, divorce, confession and a host of other issues.  In college that gap just grew further.  I took a course entitled ""The New Testament As Literature"".  It opened my eyes to a whole new world of interpretation and questioning.  In the end I was left with two undeniable truths defining my own spirituality.  I did--and do--believe in a God.  I further kept one tenet of my religious education close to my heart:  God is all-knowing. God is all-loving. God is all-forgiving.  If God was indeed all-knowing, then why did I have to confess my sins to another human?  If God was all-loving, how could he hate me for being homosexual?  If God is all-forgiving, then how could so many things be considered sins?  Now, I realize this is an over-simplistic model and I could probably write a dissertation on the reasons I came to these conclusions and how they affected/defined my spirituality.  But, it does serve as a tangible reference point to some of the questions that led me away from the Church.   In the end, I realized what a powerful force guilt was--and how effectively it was used as a tool by the Church to keep it's faithful in line.  I also realized that (as some have argued) that if I am guilty of selectivity when it comes to my religion and my beliefs--it is no different than how any organized religion uses its texts and figures to interpret a single meaning of a religion.  I tried attending services in several other faiths looking for a place to ""fit in"".  Nothing ever seemed comfortable.  In my mind, it became a question of faith in the literal sense.  Even though I am not a practicing Catholic, I do consider myself one.  That my so-called Church will not accept me is an interesting and troubling paradox.  Yet, religion and spirituality are concepts that are boundless and do not need be confined to one house of worship.  I may have lost my Church, but I did not lose my religion. ------------------------------------  When I went to do today's entry, religion was not going to be the topic.  However, two interesting and thought-provoking articles sort of coaxed me there.  I know that religion is a very private matter and and issue of great controversy.  I actually never thought it would be a topic addressed in this forum.  But, these are my personal viewpoints. I was also not my intent to offend anyone.  My thoughts after reading these two articles shaped this entry.

'Superman' franchise once again has a director.  After a much publicized falling out over budget and location concerns McG ('Charlie's Angels') stepped away from the project.  This came after such notables as Tim Burton and Brett Rattner failed to sign on.  The freshly signed director is none other than Bryan Singer ('X-Men').  While there is no start date associated with the film, there is already a working script by 'Alias' creator J.J. Abrams.  Whether any of that script will be used remains to be seen as Singer is very hands on in the writing of his projects.  The new assignment does however put the future of two Singer projects in flux.  'X-Men 3' has already been given a release date of May 5, 2006.  Singer is also slated to helm the much talked about remake of 'Logan's Run'.  It does appear that the 'Superman' project could take precedence.  According to Singer,  ""My interest in Superman dates back many, many years.  In fact, it was the Richard Donner classic film that was my day-to-day inspiration in shaping the 'X-Men' universe for the screen. I feel that Superman has been late in his return and it is time for him to fly again . ""      02.  Russell Crowe will next be seen on the big screen in March 2005 in 'Cinderella Man'.  Meanwhile, sources report that he is close to signing on to his next project which would see him return to his homeland.  The project would be  Fox Searchlight's   big-screen adaptation of Australian author Murray Bail's novel 'Eucalyptus'.  The film would reunite Crowe with director Jocelyn Moorhouse, for whom he starred in 1991's 'Proof'.   Bail's book was the winner of the 1999 Commonwealth Writers Prize.  The fairy tale-like story tells of a man, his daughter and the stranger (Crowe) who whisks her off her feet. The father plants hundreds of varieties of eucalyptus trees and then decrees that only a man who can name every one of them may have his daughter's hand in marriage.     03.   HBO's  Emmy favorite, 'Angels In America' made a big splash on Saturday at the 20th Annual Televison Critics Association Awards.  Up for 21 Emmys, 'Angels' was named Best Movie or Mini-Series, as well as Program of the Year by the 256 members of the TCA.   FOX's  'Arrested Development' was named Best New Program and Best Comedy.  The Best Drama nod went to  HBO's  'The Sopranos'.   BBC America's  Ricky Gervais was cited for Individual Achievement Comedy for 'The Office'.     04.  'Mission: Impossible 3' has been moved back to a June 29, 2005 opening as director Joe Carnahan ('Narc') has dropped out due to ""creative differences'.  The Tom Cruise picture has already been fully cast with Scarlett Johansson, Carrie-Anne Moss, Kenneth Branagh and Ving Rhames.  Previous directors have included Brian De Palma and John Woo.     05.  'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' was set to begin shooting the upcoming season last Thursday.  However, on-set reports are that only one principal cast member--Gary Dourdan--showed up.  A salary dispute led  CBS  to terminate the contracts of key cast members Jorja Fox and George Eads.  Apparently series star William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger did not show up on-set as a protest of the firings.  Now that's some drama.      RANDOM NOTES FROM A WEEKEND   01.  Summer is sizzling in the Southwest.  02.  'Six Feet Under' was utterly disturbing--and as always, brilliantly written.  03.  I have a crush on a decidedly straight man.  04.  The first season of  Comedy Central's  'Reno 911!' is out on DVD.  Buy it now.  05.  Weekend album pick: Brandy's 'Afrodisiac'  06.  I've suddenly been inspired to work on sketches of dress designs.  07.  Jessica Simpson should be punished for her screeching cover of Robbie William's sublime 'Angels'."

Had you ever really met any straight people?  Carson:  I’d never actually spoken to a straight person before.  Kyan:  Actually, my mother and father were straight.  Ted:  It’s a shocking discovery for a lot of us, but there is a world outside of Chelsea. Some of my best friends are straight. And there’s nothing wrong with them.  Carson:  As long as they act gay in public, I’m fine with it.  Ted:  As long as they don’t talk about it and shove it in my face, I really don’t mind.    COFFEE TABLE BOOK OF THE WEEK  I recently picked up  urlLink "" Pierre Et Gilles: The Complete Works""   and I'd highly recommend it to fans of great photography.  The French duo of Pierre et Gilles has had a great impact on the photography of the human form and pop culture in general.  This book chronicles their work from the late 70's to date.  It is also a beautifully put-together book with a quilted dustjacket.  Pierre et Gilles on Nina Hagen:"
7HCUXM0,male,38,"SECTION 28 EIGHTY-SIXED  The controversial so-called 'Section 28' law in the U.K. will be  urlLink repealed  on November 18th of this year.  This strange little piece of legislation essentially  banned councils and schools in England and Wales from 'intentionally promoting homosexuality'.  Law since the late 1980's, it was never used to prosecute anyone.  However, it deeply divided human rights campaigners and British gay advocacy groups.  Several attempts were made to repeal the legislation, but had failed until now.   CHURCH OF ENGLAND PONDERS HOMOSEXUALITY  In the wake of the controversial election of Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire, the Church of England (which has the largest Anglican church membership in the world at approximately 26 million) has begun the  urlLink process  of coming to a decision on how the church will address the issue of sexuality.  Already having had the largest gathering of evangelical Anglicans in over fifteen years, the church is heading toward a showdown that will take place on October 15-16 at a meeting of the worldwide Anglican church leaders.  Many Anglicans are of the belief that the practice of homosexuality is sinful and was so ordained by God in the Bible.   SOUNDBYTE OF THE WEEK  Senator Ted Kennedy regarding the Bush policy in Iraq (appearing on CNN's ""Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics""): ""This is a failed, flawed, bankrupt policy.  The American people want answers.""   MICROSOFT SEARCHING?  In an effort to out search Google, Microsoft has   urlLink announced  that it will begin investing money and technology into developing it own web search engine.  Of course, plans are to eventually build said engine into the Windows OS. (A side note: Microsoft is already developing the replacement for XP, which is codenamed ""Longhorn"".)  I think they should first worry about fixing all of the gaping security holes in the code of most of their products first.  Is it any wonder I'm seriously considering a Mac?   BOOTY NO MORE  This just in from the National Desk, Ms. Beyonce Knowles would like you to please just get over her ass.  Seems she's tired of the whole  urlLink bootyliciousness  of it all.  Hmmm.  Maybe if she stop shaking her rumpoid in every video and performance until her thighbone is nearly dislocated, no one would talk about her booty....er, um, ass.

7HCUXM0,male,38,"HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM  It appears the  Queen of the Night  is soon to become  Queen of Rehab .  Beleaguered chanteuse Whitney Houston has finally checked herself into a  urlLink rehabilitation facility .  As if we didn't all know what she was carrying around in that little black bag?  Ms. Houston's publicist, Nancy Seltzer, says that Houston  ""thanks everyone for their support and prayers"".  Uh-huh.  Now, normally, I wouldn't make fun of someone's drug addiction--but please.  Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown have each consumed enough illicit drugs to account for the gross national product of three mid-size South American countries.  Seriously, she tried to snort the River Jordan.  She stole her Aunt Dionne's weed.  She wasn't doing all that sweating because she was hitting those diva notes.  You'd sweat too, if you had just muled in 37 balloons of smack.  Hopefully, Nippy will have better success in rehab than Ms. Love did.   CASTING COUCH  01.

QUOTE OF THE DAY  "" Polls suggest that a reputation for being tough on terror is just about the only remaining political strength George Bush has. Yet this reputation is based on image, not reality. The truth is that Mr. Bush, while eager to invoke 9/11 on behalf of an unrelated war, has shown consistent reluctance to focus on the terrorists who actually attacked America, or their backers in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
