3IXQTFO,female,26,"Dihadapan orang yang kau cintai, musim dingin berubah menjadi musim semi yang indah Dihadapan orang yang kau sukai, musim dingin tetap saja musim dingin hanya suasananya lebih indah sedikit  Dihadapan orang yang kau cintai, jantungmu tiba tiba berdebar lebih cepat Dihadapan orang yang kau sukai, kau hanya merasa senang dan gembira saja  Apabila engkau melihat kepada mata orang yang kau cintai, matamu berkaca-kaca Apabila engkau melihat kepada mata orang yang kau sukai, engkau hanya tersenyum saja  Dihadapan orang yang kau cintai, kata kata yang keluar berasal dari perasaan yang terdalam Dihadapan orang yang kau sukai, kata kata hanya keluar dari pikiran saja  Jika orang yang kau cintai menangis, engkaupun akan ikut menangis disisinya Jika orang yang kau sukai menangis, engkau hanya menghibur saja  Perasaan cinta itu dimulai dari mata, sedangkan rasa suka dimulai dari telinga Jadi jika kau mau berhenti menyukai seseorang, cukup dengan menutup telinga. Tapi apabila kau mencoba menutup matamu dari orang yang kau cintai, cinta itu berubah menjadi tetesan air mata dan terus tinggal dihatimu dalam jarak waktu yang cukup lama.  ""Tetapi selain rasa suka dan rasa cinta... ada perasaan yang lebih mendalam. Yaitu rasa sayang.... rasa yang tidak hilang secepat rasa cinta. Rasa yang tidak mudah berubah. Perasaan yang dapat membuatmu berkorban untuk orang yang kamu sayangi. Mau menderita demi kebahagiaan orang yang kamu sayangi. Cinta ingin memiliki. Tetapi Sayang hanya ingin melihat orang yang disayanginya bahagia.. walaupun harus kehilangan.""    ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~"
3IXQTFO,female,26,"Cinta Itu...   Pernahkah kamu merasakan, bahwa kamu mencintai  seseorang, meski kamu tahu ia tak sendiri lagi, dan  meski kamu tahu cintamu mungkin tak berbalas, tapi  kamu tetap mencintainya,   Pernahkah kamu merasakan, bahwa kamu sanggup  melakukan apa saja demi seseorang yang kamu cintai,  meski kamu tahu ia takkan pernah peduli ataupun ia  peduli dan mengerti, tapi ia tetap pergi.   Pernahkah kamu merasakan hebatnya cinta, tersenyum  kala terluka, menangis kala bahagia, bersedih kala  bersama, tertawa kala berpisah,   Aku pernah,.........   Aku pernah tersenyum meski ! kuterluka karena kuyakin  Tuhan tak menjadikannya untukku,  Aku pernah menangis kala bahagia, karena kutakut  kebahagiaan cinta ini akan sirna begitu saja,   Aku pernah bersedih kala bersamanya, karena kutakut  aku kan kehilangan dia suatu saat nanti, dan......   Aku juga pernah tertawa saat berpisah dengannya,  karena sekali lagi, cinta tak harus memiliki, dan  Tuhan pasti telah menyiapkan cinta yang lain  untukku.   Aku tetap bisa mencintainya, meski ia tak dapat  kurengkuh dalam pelukanku, karena memang cinta ada  dalam jiwa, dan bukan ada dalam raga.   Semua orang pasti pernah merasakan cinta.. baik dari  orang tua... sahabat.. kekasih dan akhirnya pasangan  hidupnya.   Buat temenku yg sedang jatuh cinta.. selamat yah..  karena cinta itu sangat indah. Semoga kalian selalu  berbahagia.   Buat temanku yg sedang terluka ! karena cinta...Hidup  itu  bagaikan roda  yang terus berputar, satu saat  akan berada di bawah dan hidup terasa begitu sulit,  tetapi keadaan itu tidak untuk selamanya,  bersabarlah dan berdoalah karena cinta yang lain  akan datang dan menghampirimu.   Buat temanku yang tidak percaya akan cinta... buka  hatimu jangan menutup mata akan keindahan yang ada  di dunia maka cinta membuat hidupmu menjadi bahagia.   Buat temanku yang mendambakan cinta.. bersabarlah..  karena cinta yang indah tidak terjadi dalam  sekejab.. Tuhan sedang mempersiapkan segala yang  terbaik bagimu.   Buat temanku yang mempermainkan cinta.... Sesuatu  yang begitu murni dan tulus bukanlah untuk  dipermainkan. Cinta bukan suatu kehampaan. Semoga  kalian berhenti mempermainkan cinta dan mulai  merasakan kebahagiaan yang seutuhnya.   ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~"

I will always bring the smile you love, Looking for the beauty I lost on the road, When tears flow to your eyes, Just use your hands to wash it out. And even more sadness will come, I’ll just look for the beauty I once lost No one can clearly say when. But no one can replace it.   Promise is much like a butterfly, Beauty Butterflies but then it will disappear, But I believe the promise you gave me, It’s like the spring that will certainly come.

3IXQTFO,female,26,"True friends in our lives are a blessing,  To be nurtured and fed by our love;  For, although we alone make selection,  There must surely be help from above.   Although friends we may have in abundance,  True friends are quite special indeed;  As we feel quite akin to most others,  These fill, in us, a special need.   With true friends there is no sense of envy,  We accept them just as they are;  And ask nought but their love and respect,  But we never must take it too far.   No upset or hurt must be given,  For these things are evil indeed;  And all that we have we must offer,  To true friends whenever in need.   Nothing makes us accept them this way,  But our instinct, our issue of trust;  And our faithful acceptance of them,  As true people, honest and just.   We accept all their joys and their sorrows,    Their burdens we bear as our own;  A most powerful gift of support,  And comfort, to them, must be shown.   So treasure your many true friends,  Enfold them all in your love;  Enjoy them as never before,  With thanks for the help from above.     ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~"

Today went to watch Best Bet...hahaz no surprises lah e movie is still 100% Jack Neo style...e same actors (Mark Lee, Liu Qian Yi etc.), same medium of communication (HOKK|EN!), same style of humour (FUNNY!=>), same producer (Raintree Pictures) etcetc....so yeah if u understand a splattering of Hokkien wif some tolerance for crude humour (got not so crude humour too) this show is a sure hit wif u man...hmmmzz e dialect part is quite important cuz tt's where most of e humour lies...no kick reading e subtitles...den when I was watching e show halfway this senior citizen in front of me actually received a call (unsilent mode) from someone asking him if he wanted to buy 4-D...hahaz real funny...den he was talking so loudly everybody know wat numbers he buying also...den in e end he ended by saying ""Haha Fa1 Da4 cai2"" ah! Wah e whole cinema stunned den all started laughing...after e movie i realized half e pple in dere were senior citizens...  Hmmmzz but actually e show a bit exaggerated...Jack meant to highlight e ills of gambling in Singapore but dun think excessive gambling is really a social problem in Singapore...at least not in the sense of buying 4-D...I mean if u go casino n come back naked den nothing to say lah...but losing ya fortune on 4-D...not v likely lah...pple who bet heavily may have tighter pockets as a result of gambling but I'm sure they still have enough to feed themselves...As long as one gambles in controlled amounts...there is no reason yz pple shudn't gamble...I mean it generates tax revenue...it will make a few lucky winners happy...some industries even thrive on it! (u think horse racing can survive without bookie money meh? where e jockeys gonna find jobs?) Gambling is juz a form of spending...pple spend this money to thrill, to entertain themselves as well as buy them a hope of getting fast money...i'd think it's very much like investments, in fact it is...juz tt it's a different type of gamble...we gamble almost every moment of our life...when we decide whether to buy sth...when we decide whether we shud cross a busy road(not gd gamble!)...whether we shud skip a topic for test den pray hard hard it dun come out(dun tell me your nvr do tt)...so yeah we gamble all e time there's no reason to stop at e lottery? Pple only get harmed when they deal in excessive gambling...which means they continue to gamble even thou they have lost their capital in the hope of winning it back...this is because after u lose ya capital e risk of gambling becomes so much higher (juz like investments u know, risk calculation) tt it's better to keep ya pockets n not dip into the loanshark's 1...if u abide by ya conscience n dun be greedy dere's no way gambling's gonna kill u...Do remember tt! Best is still dun gamble lah...=>  hahaz hmmmzz going to watch Harry Potter wif Sin Yee tml...really looking forward to it...she got a free tic too...shall ask her subsidise a bit of my tic=p hahaz I'm such a badd|e bf=p Going to sleep le...wake up early do some work tml...n|tez!"

33KMQ86,female,26,"“So this is  Barrio Mapagkumbaba .  Hmmm, I wonder where the party is”, Sophia Spaghetti’ s noodle strands stretched as she tried to peek in at the place.  Bright green, red, blue and yellow triangle-shaped objects danced over the big crowds.  There were people everywhere.  Children came running one after another.  Different sounds filled the air – bells ringing, men laughing and women chatting endlessly.  But the loudest of them all were the trumpets and drums of silver-uniformed men marching.  Leading the parade were ladies in golden dresses gracefully twirling batons and wowing everybody watching.  Sophia Spaghetti knew then that she was to be a big hit in this merry happening.  So she twirled in her thick tomato sauce, showing off her cheesy bits.  “My, I always look best in this velvety red gown.  Everyone will say  bellissima  when they see me – because I am truly beautiful… mmmwah”.  Next thing Sophia Spaghetti knew, she was placed on a very long table covered with a huge banana leaf.  She quickly swirled her slightly misplaced meatballs and looked at her companions. What she saw surprised her.  “Who… what are you!”  Sophia Spaghetti screeched.  The others stared at Sophia Spaghetti for a moment.   Sapin-Sapin  who glowed with her violet, yellow and red colors squealed with delight, “Welcome to our fiesta!”  It was the thin noodles with lots of vegetables, which spoke next.  “Hi, ” she curled up shyly, “I’m  Pasing Pancit Bihon  and I am very pleased to meet you, miss --? ”    “Who is she to ask my name as if she does not recognize me!”  Sophia Spaghetti could only mumble.  Aloud she said, “I am So-phee-ya Spaghetti from the great Pasta family!  So, is this the party?  In this small and dusty place?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  shamefully hid under her cabbage bits and meat chunks.  Her brother  Cardo Pancit Canton , who was short, stout, and yellowish, answered instead, “This is a fiesta!  We give thanks to our patron saint who is very good to us.  And during fiestas, we have banderitas, those colorful triangles that you see hanging around.”   Cardo Pancit Canton  was proud of his town.  Sophia Spaghetti was annoyed because she does not know anything about a fiesta.  “We have none of these foolish things in the big city.  What we have are plenty of colorful and blinking lights – everywhere, every night.”   “Wow, you came from the big city!” cried the white round-shaped  Putos  as they bumped into one another.  “We’ve always wanted to go there,” they went on excitedly.  As she curved to look at them, her noodles gave out a loud swishing.  “Huh, what on earth are you!  You are totally black, like mud!”   Beside the  Putos  was the deep bowl of  Dinuguan , which turned even darker.   Dino Dinuguan  grew sad over the rude remark about his color so he kept silent.      Then Sophia Spaghetti smelled something bad.  “What’s that dreadful odor?  Oh, I can’t bear to be on this table anymore!”  The pot of orange  Kare-Kare  bubbled up in anger, “That is my good friend  Bong Bagoong .  Never judge him by his smell because once you taste him, you will surely like him.  We make a good team.”      “ Mare Kare-Kare , control yourself.  Miss Sophia Spaghetti here is our guest.  We should make her feel at home.”   Bong Bagoong  was not at all offended by how Sophia Spaghetti treated him.  “Let us all introduce ourselves so that she will know us better.”  But before anyone could start, Sophia Spaghetti sneered.  “I bet  Bong Bagoong  and  Dino Dinuguan  will be the champion leftovers here because they are the ugliest!  Shee-hee-hee!”  The others remained quiet but Sophia Spaghetti did not seem to notice.  She continued talking and scoffing at the same time.  “Why do you have such funny names?  But then again, they suit you well because you are all so funny looking.  I bet the visitors won’ t eat you at all. Their stomachs will ache from laughing hard simply by looking at you.” Sophia Spaghetti shook with laughter until her meatballs and cheese scattered.  The roasted pig lying on the middle, the King of every fiesta table, has been observing Sophia Spaghetti.  In all his shining glory, he declared, “A-hoink…A-hoink.  I am the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon .  As everybody know, ” and he looked at the others meaningfully, “it is my duty to restore the peace and order on this table.  Sophia Spaghetti…”  Sophia Spaghetti hastily interrupted and spoke in her most dramatic voice.  “I, the fairest of all noodles – the whitest and firmest of them all – is expected to listen to an old dark-skinned hog like you!  My, why don’t you just nibble on that apple in your mouth.”    The rest got angry.  To disrespect the wise and honorable Judge  Listo  was the last straw.  They all prepared to attack Sophia Spaghetti with their vegetable and meat weapons.  A food fight was about to take place when, like the true leader that he was, Judge  Listo Lechon  shook his head slowly and said, “Now, now, please calm yourselves.  Do not ever forget that we are here for the same reason.  Our duty is to feed the hungry and make everyone happy.”  Sophia Spaghetti, who grew scared at the sight of  Pasing Pancit Bihon  ready to hurl carrot sticks at her, now sighed with relief.  She jeered at the others once again, “Don’t be so jealous.  I’m sure that after they finish eating me, they will turn to you.”  “Sometimes, it’s just so hard to be the best,” she whispered to herself.  Finally, somebody shouted  -- “It’s eating time.”  Sophia Spaghetti felt the heat of excitement.  “Now, these dishes will certainly die of envy,” she snickered.  All the people flocked to the long table.  Each one wanted to taste the dishes served.  All the dishes, on the other hand, desired to be tasted.  Elders and children gathered near  Pasing Pancit Bihon .  Everyone liked her crisp vegetables and delicious chorizos.  Pasing Pancit Biho n was glad that she pleased the guests.    Everyone praised  Cardo Pancit Canton  because he was tasteful with all the large chunks of vegetables, pork, and chicken.   Cardo Pancit Canton  exchanged smiles with his sister.    The combination of  Dinuguan  and  Puto  was naturally a fiesta favorite.  So was the popular pair of  Kare-Kare  and  Bagoong .   And, of course,  Sapin-sapin  was the number one dessert.  Each dish had fun except Sophia Spaghetti.  Nobody had tasted her sweet red sauce or noticed her cheesy dress.  She felt like crying.  She never felt so embarrassed in her entire spaghetti life.  She asked herself, “Why don’t they want to eat me?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  glanced at Sophia Spaghetti and saw that she was sinking in her thick sauce.  She coiled into a smile to cheer her up, “Don’t worry.  They’re going to like you, too.  It’s not everyday that people here see something like you.”  Sophia Spaghetti then felt sad as she realized how vain and proud she was.  She remembered how she mocked  Dino Dinuguan  and  Bong Bagoong .  She was deeply ashamed at the way she looked down on the other dishes as if she was the only one beautiful.  She spoke softly, “I am very sorry.  Please forgive me for being mean.  The honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  was right.  We were made beautiful to give happiness to everybody.”  All the dishes gave Sophia Spaghetti a warm smile.   Bong Bagoong  then  remarked, “Hey, arrange your meatballs and grated cheese now.  Your guests are here.”    Quick little footsteps rushed to the table.  Sophia Spaghetti recognized that one of them was the cute girl who grated cheese for her.  The girl asked her two playmates, “Hey, why don’t you both have spaghetti?  It tastes good.”  One of the playmates answered, “We’re not used to that kind of food.  Is it like pancit?”  The other made a face, “Yuck, is that blood all over?”  The girl urged her playmates, “C’mon, just try it.”  The playmates grabbed forks and scooped up Sophia Spaghetti.  They fell silent for awhile and then exclaimed, “You’re right, it’s delicious – it’s sour-sweet!”   The three children called on their other playmates and relatives to taste the spaghetti.  Everybody loved her.  Sophia Spaghetti was so happy.  She did not even notice that only a few noodle strands were left.  She twisted in a wide grin at the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  and he could only wink in approval."

GEKYRZ3,female,13,"My sister came home from boarding school today (George School for anyone who reads this and cares), so she obviously had a lot of boxes (mostly milk crates). So, the family was lugging the boxes in and my sis handed me a milk crate with shoes and food inside it (bout 3 pairs of shoes). I stared at it and said ""why do you have shoes with your food"" and she just said ""hey, they both fit fine."" Later, I took in another box with food and her meds, food and hydrocortizone, and one with just food. Later on she pulled a box out of the car marked ""fragile"" so of course she throws it to me, I mean, literally throws it! Agian, a strange look at her and she said ""well, it's so tightly packed with paper, plus, it's just a few mugs"" The whole thing was very strange and funny."
GEKYRZ3,female,13,"My life is improving. I'm feeling better. I went to the barn for 4 hours and had a lovely time. Stuff is still wrong, but it seems a bit lighter now."
GEKYRZ3,female,13,"Hmm, wow, first blog. Very cool. Now, what to say? I guess I'm wasting my first blog typing aimlessly. Quite boring, I know, but I think people will survive (if people read this at all!). But, that's okay! Now I'm hyper, which is not good. Hehe, mwahahaha! Well, I may talk about deeper stuff later on, just not now. Oh, my sis is coming home tomorrow. What fun (said very dryly (I don't spell well)). Anyway... Mine as well not read this cause I just wasted your time! Haha! Now to take over the world! ::smacks self on face:: Had to get that out of my system. All better."
GEKYRZ3,female,13,"First off: This blog will be changing a little bit now and then, until I get it just how I like. Sorry if it annoys you, but is annoys me more.  Second thing: My name, Skittlish It is not a random name, believe it or not, for I am a fairly random person. It started when one of my friends called me Caittles. I hated this and if they called me that I would ignore them (I'd do the same thing when called Katie). Then, another of my friends thought is sounded like Skittles. I was going to make this my blog name (hence the title, Taste the Rainbow if the whole thing worked...) but the blog people wouldn't let me (probably because it is product placement), so I became Skittlish instead. There's some useless knowledge for anyone who is bored enough to find and read this blog."

GEKYRZ3,female,13,"I gotta wait for breakfast (bannana chocolate chip muffins, mmmm, so good) cause they're baking, so I mine as well blog.     For the past week I've been helping at a camp at the barn I ride at. Let's put it this way, 10 kids no older than 5th grade, 10 horses, and 10 sets of tack (saddles, bridles, ect, you get the picture). Over half of them had no idea what to do, hence they were at the camp to learn. It was from 9-3 (for me it was more 8:45- 3:30, one day I stayed til 7:30, that's almost 11 hours at the barn!), so I was pretty wiped (haven to tack, un-tack, hose down, and go on trails with the many kids). That was from Mon. til Fri. Last day was a horse show (very funny!). Then Sat was my barn day anyway when I stay all day and help with lessons.    Oh, muffins are done, but they hafta cool. Anyway, I had a horse show on the 4th and placed in five classes. I got a 3rd, 2 4ths, and 2 5ths. It was my best horse show ever. I was very happy. Too bad today's horse show is rated so I can't go.    Oh, and before the horse show I went to CCW (Camp Conrad Weiser). Left one Sat. and returned the next (the day before the show). I went to the camp dance in half chaps and boots. Made some friends. Got some nicknames. I was Weasle. Alaina was Twiggy. Molly was Twitch and Melanie was Reggie (new friends). It was a lot of fun. Very tiring to hafta ride 2 times a day, but I enjoyed it. Got to go hand-galloping on Cruz and jump Ebony (only kid in camp to do that!) and everything else on Skip (more jumping and some dressage. Anyway, I jumped a big black horse named Ebony, and as we were rounding the corner for the first jump, the conseler Tiger said ""oh, just so you know, Ebony jumps big"" By big, I thought she men half a foot over to a foot over. Boy was I wrong. He reused the first jump, but I finally got him over it. He jumped about 2 feet bigger than the jump.Wow. That was a feeling. Then I jumped him over the 2ft vertical and he jumped it 4ft. We did it a few times again, but I got over the Oh my God, I'm jumping 2ft bigger the original Jump feeling, and enjoyed my ride.    Yay! Muffin's are done! I'll blog more later."

KHRNMUL,female,25,"A few years ago, Margo and I sat down on a drainage pipe on a beach in South Carolina and argued about state's rights (within the context of the US constitution).  LIke many ideological arguments, we didn't really convince each other as much as we provoked thoughts.    Which is my goal, today, in linking to Lawrence Lessig's latest book,  urlLink Free Culture .  Lessig is one of the leaders on the side of loosing controls; the side which opposes the those fighitng to strengthen the rights of producers and creators (the MPAA and RIAA, among others).  Lessig has argued before the Supreme Court of the United States in his quest to relax copyright controls.  Regardless of whether your adore or revile him, you should read Lessig's book and try to understand him.    Lessig's book catalogs the history of copyright within the system of English law upon which United States law is built.  Along the way, we encounter striking anecdotes from English and American History, and we learn that the United States is built upon a pirate heritage which protects those who 'borrow'.  Whatever side you come down on, whether you agree or disagree with Lessig, the book is telling in its history.  And, in keeping with his beliefs, the book is available (through the link above) online for free.   ~db"
KHRNMUL,female,25,"Today a friend of mine sent me a link to the graduation speech that Jon Stewart made at William and Mary.  There's a lot of silly stuff in there, of course, but something he said struck me as very true.  I'll quote it:  ""So how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this. You wonÂt. And accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience.   When I left William and Mary I was shell-shocked. Because when youÂre in college itÂs very clear what you have to do to succeed. And I imagine here everybody knows exactly the number of credits they needed to graduate, where they had to buckle down, which introductory psychology class would pad out the schedule. You knew what you had to do to get to this college and to graduate from it. But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting thing about your life, is that there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an elective. The paths are infinite and the results uncertain. And it can be maddening to those that go here, especially here, because your strength has always been achievement. So if thereÂs any real advice I can give you itÂs this.   College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. So donÂt worry about your grade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of decency which I imagine, after going through the program here, is quite strongÂalthough IÂm sure downloading illegal filesÂbut, nah, thatÂs a different story.   Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may.""  Indeed.  It's like one big huge elective.  I am currently taking German ;-)  If you are interested in the  urlLink whole speech .  ***  While Matt was visiting me, I got a letter from the United States, the address on the envelope penned in my own hand.  Aha - I knew what that meant - it was one of my SASEs returning from a submission to the US.  This time Ploughshares of Emory college was writing to me to let me know that my poems had not been accepted.  Not a problem - Matt was in town and I was feeling fine.  And sending out poems for publication is like sending out resumes.  Once you start it gets easier as you go.  But receiving that envelope reminded me of an exercise we did in the tenth grade.  It might be a standard thing that high school teachers do.  Our English teacher was trying to teach us that defining your gprecisely precicely helps you realize them.  She told us to write down some goals we would like to accomplish within that year.  She said she would send us the letters during the summer and we could look back and see if we had accomplished what we had wanted to do.  We all laughed at the assignment, but once we got our pens and papers out, we were hushed and concentrated in the heady-aired North Carolina classroom.  I remember what I wrote to myself - something about getting together with a boy - initial P.D. (By the time I got my letter in the summer, his allure had faded and I was on to another crush).  But I found the exercise very interesting.  Not too different from the development plans I am turning in to my bosses these days.  What do you wish?  Define it, hone it, and go for it.    Related to the Jon Stewart speech, I think defining that goal is the most difficult.  It's a rite of passage to come to terms with the uncertainty entailed by total freedom of choice.  ""Great, but it is the  right  choice?""  No one to tell you but you.  ""It's hard to score if you don't have a goal."" (Quoted from a quirky little book by Paul Arden - ""It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be"")  Treading water on dry land won't get you anywhere - but jumping into the pool - well - at least you're treading water in something.

KHRNMUL,female,25,"I have done quite a bit of cleaning over the past couple days.  I washed all my clothes.  I emptied a box of articles and placed them in a filing cabinet, almost a year after I moved, which freed up a whole, huge shelf in my closet for me to fill with crap that is either on my floor or packed in other boxes.  I have done a ton of dishes, some of which were dirtied by me.  I took a ton of empty beer bottles out to the recycling bins.  I emptied all the trash cans and took them to the dumpster.

Their two greatest hits albums have been in heavy rotation in my cd player all week.  I'm trying to decide which song is my favorite right now, and I don't think I can.  I love Just Like Heaven.  And Fascination Street.  But then I also love In Between Days.  And then there are all the poppy songs that are all nearly perfect, like Killing an Arab, Boys Don't Cry, Lovesong, and Friday I'm in Love.  What I want to know is why people don't talk about The Cure as one of the greatest groups of the 1980s and early 1990s, along with U2 and REM?

KHRNMUL,female,25,"Just finished reading this  urlLink article / interview  with J. Allard, head of the Microsoft XBOX group.  First off, I want to give him credit for a terribly clever plan.  He demonstrates once again that Microsoft's strong point isn't software but strategy.  While I am not certain his plan will be successful, for reasons I go through below, I do respect the vision of his plan.  Mr. Allard, from one evil genius to another, I salute you.  Anyway, enough with that, let's get down to brass tacks.  J. makes the argument that the gaming industry will eventually reach a common format for games, like DVD or VHS for watching home movies.  I won't pretend that you don't already know who would control this super-format.   Now I remain unconvinced that any other console manufacturer would support  urlLink XNA  (Microsoft's proposed format), given that a) Microsoft makes its own line of consoles, and b) Microsoft has a reputation for employing what might be called  dirty pool  to crush competition.  But there's another reason for Sony and Nintendo to resist such a move. It's the same reason why smaller console manufacturers might find it appealing, but should resist it, too.  And that reason is the question of  urlLink Fungibility .   If there were a common console gaming standard to drop from the sky and be implemented by everyone tomorrow, the market would become instantly commoditized, and margins would drop to the razor-thin levels seen in consumer PCs.  Only the largest players, or those with deep enough pockets, would be able to afford the economies of scale required to compete.  You would see Nintendo get marginalized and perhaps surviving ala Sega (a console manufacturer turned games-only).    Which would leave Microsoft and Sony...but wait, there's more!  Once a common platform exists, the barriers to entry drop away.  Folks like HP/Compaq and Dell can turn their lean, mean, PC manufacturing engines to producing consoles. So can Samsung, et al, up on the Korean Peninsula.  Sony builds some loverly TVs, but who's going to care what their console looks like, as long as they can play the same games on it?   If this common standard is adopted everywhere, all consoles will be equal.  Except (if this standard is controlled by one company) some consoles may end up  more equal than others .  Maybe Microsoft and/or its partners somehow manage to  magically  build faster, better, smoother-running consoles.  These better-running consoles would sell with the same thin margins, just in larger quantities.   Meanwhile, back at the ranch, once there's substantial market penetration of this new standard, Microsoft can start making money by charging developers more for the tools.   Allard makes a lot of statements about flexibility across a diverse array of devices, but what he means is flexibility across a diverse array of Microsoft-powered devices, much like Microsoft's consulting arm considers ""WindowsXP, Windows2000, and Windows98,"" to be a ""heterogeneous environment"".    I'm guessing that this whole idea grew out of J. Allard kickin' it old school with the big B. Gates.  They were playing a little Halo 2 and then Notorious BG says, ""j0, J--it would be 5up4-1337 if w3 0wn3d gaming like w3 0wn PCs,""  Innovative new software, or old school  urlLink guile  and  urlLink http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/c/c0285400.html"">chicanery ?

KHRNMUL,female,25,"Life is an Elective  Today a friend of mine sent me a link to the graduation speech that Jon Stewart made at William and Mary. There's a lot of silly stuff in there, of course, but something he said struck me as very true. I'll quote it:  ""So how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this. You won’t. And accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience.   When I left William and Mary I was shell-shocked. Because when you’re in college it’s very clear what you have to do to succeed. And I imagine here everybody knows exactly the number of credits they needed to graduate, where they had to buckle down, which introductory psychology class would pad out the schedule. You knew what you had to do to get to this college and to graduate from it. But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting thing about your life, is that there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an elective. The paths are infinite and the results uncertain. And it can be maddening to those that go here, especially here, because your strength has always been achievement. So if there’s any real advice I can give you it’s this.   College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. So don’t worry about your grade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of decency which I imagine, after going through the program here, is quite strong…although I’m sure downloading illegal files…but, nah, that’s a different story.   Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may.""  Indeed. It's like one big huge elective. I am currently taking German ;-)  If you are interested in the  urlLink whole speech .   So, danger boy, what is your current elective?"
KHRNMUL,female,25,"They are, perhaps, my favorite food.  Yes, I think I have decided.  If I were ever to receive the death penalty, my last meal would be this:  1 tall glass of crystal clear ice water.  One bowl of fresh, washed raspberries with natural whipped cream.  One piping hot bowl of Campbell's condensed tomato soup, mixed with 2% milk.  1 large, greasy grilled cheese sandwich.  1 box of Cheezits.  1 box of unsweeted Mini-wheats.  The final three menu items are to be dipped into the Campbell's soup.  After having written such a strange and morbid first entry into this exercise in group procrastination, I feel as though I can only maintain my present level of non sequitude.  And so that brings me to masturbation.  I was watching my dvd of the first season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and at one point, Larry David jokes ""I've never come so close to death as when I masturbated with a 104 degree temperature.""  This routine made me laugh hysterically.  And I'm sure it's because it touched (no pun intended) upon an aspect of the universal human experience with masturbation that, perhaps, had never once been uttered out loud before that moment (captured on video) - the fact that when you're sick and laid up in bed, sometimes you have nothing better to do.  I'm sure it has at least occured to everyone who has ever been sick (and I phrase it this way because I believe it is more likely that there are people out there who have never been sick than people who have never contemplated masturbation)... but Larry David was the first man who was willing to share this thought with others... this willingness to speak the unspeakable is the source of his brilliance.  I don't know if I have much to say about women in skirts.  But I do have a weakness for women in cool glasses."

4HOYZD4,male,23,"Well, I’m back in Seattle. And, what else is there to say, but that the trip was amazing. Not in the super-spiritual sense, or in an uber-Zionistic meaning. But in the simple fact that it all went smoothly, that the people were fantastic, and that everything matched my expectations. It helped that I was tempering my expectations, but I knew that if I didn’t, the trip, the country, my vision of Israel and Judaism in general could have been knocked down or elevated beyond the rational. And I just wasn’t in the mood for either one. So, I keep everything on the level, and had amazing time.   I have a ton of writing I feel like I should do, but with me leaving for Idaho and the river float trip tomorrow, I’m running the risk of not getting it all done. But that leads to the larger question I face regarding this blog and journaling in general: do I want to write about my life, or live it? Thoughts are defiantly welcomed."
4HOYZD4,male,23,"Well, after a nice float down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho, and two weeks back in Seattle, I’m ready to start keeping up with my blog again. This will be short, since I’m working on the job hunt. But so you know, there are new pictures on the   Picture’s page  , and I’m slowly starting to think about getting my Israel pictures up. I’m not quite sure how I want to do it, but when I figure it out, you’ll see the pictures. So many people have been asking for them, I might just put them up and make it look nice and pretty later. But for now, enjoy the pictures of happenings around Seattle."

4HOYZD4,male,23,"This week has just been crazy. The new  urlLink Hillel  building is complete and this is one big celebration weekend. Thursday night, I helped represent  urlLink Jconnect  at the Leadership Donors Building Opening Celebration. It was amazing. First off, these donors all gave over $10,000 to the new building and all, as you can imagine, have a very strong commitment to Hillel at the UW. The best part for me, was towards the beginning. I was asked to uncover the glass panels which bear the names of said leadership donors. Forget my action. It was the time, when I’m standing at one end of the large, central gallery, with 250 people looking in my direction, in anticipation. Some smiling, some serious, some tired, all with a sparkle in their eyes. People packed into the first floor, flowing up the stairs, wrapping around and hanging over the railing to get a look at the brief ceremony. And it’s not that I’m so important, it’s that I’m, at this moment, at the physical center of these people’s love and attention. For a brief moment, I witness how much these people care about the same organization that I care so much about. All I could do was smile."
4HOYZD4,male,23,"Well folks, I’m having a wonderful time in New York. It’s big, and kinda dirty, and the humidity is horrible, but it’s a lot of fun. I’m blown away by all the Jews. I still feel like a minority, but at least I know I have plenty company. It’s fun seeing other people with kippot. I ate at a kosher restaurant last night, and it was over flowing with people. Families, groups of friends, couples on dates, it was crazy.   I also hit the  urlLink Empire State  building yesterday, which was necessary. And in all honesty, I liked the  urlLink Sears Tower  better. Their was a better display of information to read about the history of Chicago and what you were seeing. Move the damn gift shop downstairs. Anyways, I’d come into Manhattan via the subway, and so when I stepped outside, I had no how to orientate myself. I’m trying to figure out which way is north, I’m looking at my subway map, I’m looking at the street signs, I’m looking at the tourist kiosk, and up at the buildings. But I couldn’t get oriented or figure out where the Empire State building was. Hehe, turns out I wasn’t looking up far enough. As soon as I craned my head all the way back, I saw it, a lance into the sky. I was a block away.   I’ve got the better part of today to keep exploring (Lower East Side, WTC, Times Square, maybe the harbor tour), but the fact is, I leave for Israel tonight. It’s starting to dawn on me again, but I’m going a long way away. Sure I’m excited. Of course it will be fun. And once I meet up with the rest of the group (I’ve already met up with Rachel and Charles) I’m sure I’ll be fine. But the fact is, right now, I’m a little unsure about this whole thing. Seems a little bigger then I’m used to. Pushing my comfort zone. Oh well, it’s a good thing.   My next post will be from Israel, so until then..."

I’m both surprised at how dramatic our troubles are, and how much worse they could be."

I like curt cobain i think he was a very down to earth vey cool writter and stuff;but after having to hear nirvana day after day on t.v. the media just killed him again and this time it didn't take courtney love to kill him. THis time the media and magazines killed him. Take for example nirvana it's now mostly focused on curt cobain and whenever it is his death anniversary there's pre-nirvana weekend and then there's the actuall nirvana remembrece day where they play nirvana music all day. and yo u feel like screamng enough. then there's het post after wekend celbration and in the end you wind up not wanting to hear nirvana for ever."

So guess what i forgot to mention a couple of day's it was jim morrison's anniversary on the july the 3th, i remembered yesterday when i was listening to light my fire, when i suddenly remembered hey it was his passing anniversary on the 3d. Today today what a day not really, it's just been bleaker.I spent all this morning remembering a Tragic Fairy tale from when i was younger,yes there are such things as tragic fairy tales,i finally remembered all the datails to it, the story is basically like the little mermaid, but the differences are the sea hag isn't evil, she doesn't interfeare, actually she just makes bargain's, the bargain the mermaid made was that she also had three day's to get the prince's heart and if she didn't onthe mornng of the 3rd day she would turn into bubbles and disipate into the wind. So when she goes to the prince she tries and the prince by his own will falls in love with another girl. And so the prince invites her to go with him and his new lover to go to the sea in his boat.so when her sisiter's find out,(dady doesn't rescue her)so they  sneak into the sea hag's cave and look for how to break the spell, so in the morning on the 3rd day they tell her she must drive a knife through his heart in order to break the spell, so she finds herself in his room with a knife in her hands, she looks at his face nad finds herself unable to and heads up the deck where she waits for morning and her sister's ask her why didn't she, she responds I can't kill him i love him to much, i would ratehr turn into bubbles and be around him fore ever, than never be with him, and so it ends with her turning into bubbles and dissapearing into the wind. This i think was one of those stories that gave me an early belief that there is no such thing as Happily ever after, and this was about when i was 7 or 8, it's amazing what i can remeber from when i was younger."

Now, when you're gettin ready to put on a tux...even if you're not usually Mr. Style...you expect that you'll look pretty good.  So, we're getting all dicked up...and as i'm puttin on my tux...i'm thinking...shit....have i gained like 50 lbs in the last month or something?????  This fucken tux wouldn't fit a 12 year old.  The sleeves came half way down my arm, and the pants were so short...you could see half way up my calf!  Barry and Peterson are laughing at me because i look like a total tool!  When i try to get the shoes on....they're size 9!  Now, I wear size 14...therez now friggen way i'm getting into those shoes!  So, I'm stressin out...wanting to not goto the wedding...and not be up in front of a crowd in a tux made for a kid.  Barry gets to thinking and realizes that his dad wears size 9.  Maybe they switch tuxes!!!  We get to the country club where the transaction (wedding) is supposed to go down.  I'm wearing my dope ass tiny tux as I wait for Barry's dad to get there with what I hoped would be mine.  When Barry's dad got there...he did in fact have my tux (whew..i'll be in the wedding after all) and we proceed to the nearest men's room.  So there i'm standing with Barry's dad...we're both in black sox and boxer shorts shooting the shit while we switch tuxes...was totally funny...fancy place with 2 naked doods hanging out by the shoe polisher in the men's room.  This was the first time I had a chance to hang out with Harry Brinkerhof Doyle III one on one.  We spoke about life...watching his kids grow up and the like.  He expressed how excited he was to see Barry get hitched, and how proud he was of him.

He comes out looking guily....I question him: E: dood, did you turn on the fucken fan? D: yeah man. E: you better have left the door closed! D: i did....  I am comfortable with the damage control, so I drop it....... Yeah..... So I wake up this morning, and my cousin tells me that the Mad Shitter fucken shit on the seat!  Now tell me how that is fucken possible????  This guy is 26 years old by the way, so don't go thinking that I get hight with children, and he doesn't know how to control the beast that is his ass!  My cousin had to treat my house like a porta-potty, because this gross-assed, non-aiming, shit slinging muther fucker crapped on my toilet seat!  Mad Shitter......you need to work on that bro....doesn't bode well with the chicks....or doods, or animals, ect...."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Not sleeping is not a good idea.  Tyke is very sleepy right now.  He has gotten about 10 hours of sleep the past two days and he is pretty damn tired.  He has been sleeping for much of this Tuesday night.  During the day he really wasn't tired though.  Pretty awake in fact.  Classes were pretty stupid and useless but they had their moments.  All in all school is a waste for Tyke now.  His math teacher talked to him about his last test and it was normal for the entire class but she was just saying how he should come in and get help and Tyke just said, ""Yeah, maybe.""  Then she said that he really should and asked him if he would so he replied again with, ""Yeah, maybe.""  She finally took the hint though that Tyke is definitely not coming in.  The worst part of today was just having to drag himself from class to class.  Lunch was great.  They went to JIB and took Tyke's brother's car.  Dr. Phil and Amed liked the ride and of course the music.  Dr. Phil surprised Tyke with the fact that he was not against any of the songs that Tyke played.  So the rest of the week will be filled with sweet tunes and a sweet ride.  Sweet.  Tyke played more ESPN after school and that was fun.  But he got really sleepy doing so.  He basically fell asleep after playing.  Then woke up and watched some of the FLAM-LEHIGH game on ESPN.  Then he had dinner.  Then he fell asleep again.  Then he woke up and got online a little.  Then he just sat there.  And sat.  And almost fell asleep.  Then woke up from his daze.  Then kept sitting.  And finally decided to do a half-ass blog to keep him awake.  And it has worked.  But it isn't interesting so it is time to call it quits.  Good luck with stuff."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Another freaking day has passed.  Shiiiiiiiit.  Well today was another day of Tyke playing with himself (yeah, he meant for it to sound dirty even though in reality there is no reason for it to sound dirty cuz it wasn't dirty).  He did nothing with nobody.  It was pleasing to just sit and watch the silent snow settle on the bountiful landscape.  It just assuages the wishful moods that are muddled in Tyke's tormenting mood.  Whatever.  Actually it makes him more pensive so it has an adverse effect on him.  But for some odd reason he likes to torture himself on these topics.  Yeesh, this isn't a great start for tonight's blog.  He is hoping to actually be able to post this blog before the clock strikes midnight.  By the way, Amed is gay because he won't let Tyke see when he is typing which would make their conversations easier.  So Tyke just had to let everyone know that Amed is stubborn.  Anyway it was cold today as everyone knows.  Still very cold.  In the low to mid 20s right now.  It is fun to play in the snow but Tyke hasn't done that for years really.  He used to make jumps at his old house in the huge backyard they had and he and his brother would have a blast spending hours just getting air and then crashing into the woods and hurting themselves.  The days used to be so much simpler back then.  Tyke seems to recall already saying this in a previous blog but they really were.  He could have fun easier.  Now he is too obsessed with the opposite sex and his desires (not sexual) regarding them.  But as is life.  And at times life is a bitch.  But for the most part life is something that you cannot get caught up taking too seriously.  Just live life as it comes and have fun.  Don't always take shortcuts either.  Sometimes you need to get dirty and pave yourself a new route.  But other times just stick on the road you are on.  Let yourself be the best judge.  Heed others advice but don't get bogged down in it.  Tyke sometimes heeds the advice of other too much.  He doesn't let himself pick his own path, fearful of mistakes.  That is why he was so proud of himself for telling her how he felt.  It was an accomplishment that he can't overlook.  But also, he feels it most important that you don't overlook your friends who have helped make you the person you are now.  That is so very important.  Because friends will not always stay friends.  People change.  People will get angry and not feel the same about you forever.  Keep your friends close.  Don't let a new person in your life become too much of your life.  Because this person hasn't been there for you your whole life.  Now Tyke feels that he must not be a hypocrite and if he is given the chance to be one he must not crumble and fall like so many before him.  Stay strong and stand tall.  Oh yeah, and Britney got married.  First Jessica Simpson, now Britney!  Who's next?!?!?!  Could it be HER?!?!?!?!  Nah, not unless Tyke is the one.  But oh yeah, another thing.  Tyke has realized that hope is not all its cracked up to be.  Sure hope can occasionally be great.  But in most cases in Tyke's life it just causes immense pain and torment.  It is the cause of great evils.  Hope keeps dreams just what they are...dreams.  In order for dreams to become a reality, action needs to be taken.  So remember, action over hope.  Bye.  Damn, didn't get it done before midnight."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Tyke doesn't feel like blogging.  A long, tiring day.  Woke up nice and late and then didn't do anything 1st period other than the test.  Then 2nd period he signed yearbooks with junior girl and other people.  Then came a brief stop in 3rd period where there was a little bit more yearbook signing.  But then came the Senior Assembly.  It wasn't sad this year.  There was still crying but really, it wasn't that sad.  It was still good but not sad.  A couple of bands played and they were alright.  Tank did his rendition of I Believe in a Thing Called Love which was good but Last Dance with Mary Jane wasn't spectacular.  The slide show was fine but it is cool to know that it is really a culmination of it all.  Tyke didn't have any pictures of him for a while, then he had a few, and then BOOM!  He just owned the prom portion of it.  There was like 40 pictures of him there.  One of them was the photo of Tyke slow dancing with Purdy where it looks like he is leaning in for a kiss or something.  It was funny.  Afterwards some of the girls were crying but not all that many.  But Tyke still comforted his lady friends ;-).  Smileys rule by the way.  After leaving school Tyke went to Schlotzky's with the gang.  Once again Tyke got complimented on his pink shirt, this time by the asian girl working the cash register.  She said she liked it, Tyke thanked her, then she started giggling until Tyke left to get his food.  It was cool.  If Tyke had a nickel for every time he got a compliment on his pink shirt, he'd have at least 50 cents.  That is a solid bet in the poker games so he'd take it.  Anybody wanna give him a nickel every time you comment on the shirt?  After lunch the crew went back to Tyke's to play Cranium.  Tyke and Dr. Phil dominated.  Tyke got every single Word Worm question right.  The Gnilleps and all the other spelling ones were owned by Tyke.  He excels at that kind of stuff anyway though.  Everyone left to play basketball at Amed's at 2 and that was crazy.  There were 10 people there to start and Kinker was playing and he went balls out.  He ended up cutting up Tyke with his thumb somehow.  There is a clean rip of skin from Tyke's left arm.  It looks like a hickey that drew blood.  It's Tyke (like tight but with Tyke's name).  But basketball was fun and Tyke didn't get tired.  Later on Tyke went home and ate dinner.  Then at 7 some of the gang came over and played poker.  Tyke ended up losing 10 but he played ok.  He just got rivered a couple of times.  It was fine though.  Now the night is over but tomorrow is an easy day.  Easy easy.  Bye now."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Tyke just realized that.  This is the last blog Tyke does with school the next day.  Or at least high school.  He'll still be doing blogs in college he thinks.  So don't worry about that.  But still, this is something of a finale.  The blog has pretty much been a staple of Tyke's senior year in high school.  He started it in the end of October and now he has kept it going all the way to June.  218 blogs.  218...that's just great.  Tyke is proud of himself for his dedication seeing as he hasn't been able to dedicate himself to keep anything going this long.  This is pretty remarkable for him.  Today was not all that remarkable but fun nonetheless.  Nothing went on in math today.  In weight training Tyke tried to do his bench rep test but on his 8th rep he just hit the wall and was about half a rep shy of getting it.  So he'll have to try it tomorrow.  Tyke also talked with Nene (junior girl) and finished signing each other's yearbooks.  In 3rd period since they have no final they just signed yearbooks and talked.  Tyke started up a little Clark Sharks page in his book.  Yeah, the Clark Sharks ruled the water.  Especially cuz if any other elementary school tried to come attack Clark they would have to do it underwater so they would all drown.  Haha, Tyke is now reading back over some of his blogs and he is loving it.  He just found one post from February where he was talking about Chinko.  Remember that game??  It didn't catch on like he said it would.  Oh well, you can't be right all the time, but most of the time he is.  You know what though, it's a blast to go back and read his old blogs.  He is reading some good stuff right now.  He had a nice writing style back in the day.  Maybe he still does, but he likes how his blogs used to flow.  Tina's mom just called, but not for Tyke.  Yeah, back to school though.  4th period they watched more videos.  One group's was so dirty.  It was just shocking really.  But still funny and one of the best Tyke and Dr. Phil thought.  After class Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed decided that they wanted to go to Mongolian Grill and they did.  Some other people tagged along as well.  Damn that's good.  It was very tasty.  After that the gang went back to Tyke's and they were joined by Kinker.  They played some Shithead and then started up Risk when Big Twigg came over too.  So they started a game and got very close to finishing it (after Dr. Phil raped Tyke in Asia, perhaps stopping Tyke from winning, but it's all good in war) but MormoMan and Skramfejj came over as well.  When Kinker had to leave (after taking over much of the world) MormoMan took over and finished the job.  Then they played a few more Risk games.  They did the Capitals version which is way different.  Tyke will teach you that version later.  There were some hilarious moments when everyone picked their capital right next to each other.  But all in all Risk is one hell of an awesome game.  It is just so great.  Especially the beginning of the games.  That is Tyke's favorite part.  At 5 Tyke kicked everyone out cuz his mom has been getting on his case about studying for his 1 final.  Well he still didn't study at all but oh well.  He did eat chips and Gushers for dinner so there!  Tyke is gonna wrap it up now.  It is time to move on to another chapter.  Wow, so close."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Don't worry, the streak lives on for yet another day.  And it should live on for at least...well, a long time.  Barring any serious typing injury or dismemberment or a total lack of an audience.  That would suck.  Not that it will happen but that would totally defeat the purpose of his blog really.  Cuz without it he would just be telling things to nobody and just reading it himself and commenting on it with different fake names to try and make himself feel better.  And no, he doesn't do that now.  The only time he posts a comment is when he uses the name Tyke.  So don't think that he is making all of those comments.  Not that they are anything important anyway.  Well hey, this is a good sign.  Tyke has already rambled for a good little bit and has racked up some nice volume to this cylindrical spherical cube.  Today started off nicely.  Oh wait, it didn't actually.  He had a stupid 1st period.  His teacher is stupid.  She really is being stupid.  This semester she has tried to teach and enforce rules.  Like, who the hell cares biatch???  Come on, shut the hell up.  Nobody likes you.  Go back to fuckin Denmark.  Go ride a windmill while your there and then maybe you will get crabs or something and then have to live in a cardboard box for the remainder of your pitiless existence of a life.  Eh, the rest of the day progressed alright.  English entailed the denoument of the Sula presentation.  Just answering some questions and Tyke did fine with that.  Mainly cuz he never got asked a question directly so he just got to add tidbits of sensical nonsense.  It was just some good old mumbo jumbo.  Went to Mickie D's today.  Another free lunch thanks to the gift certificates he got there in his stocking over Christmas.  Kind of an odd gift but really, quite valuable.  He loves knowing that he can have a free lunch one day a week if he wants.  That is a great feeling cuz he never wants to make a lunch so he just doesn't.  Even though he can make a mean bagel with cream cheese.  Mmmm...bagel.  Mmmm...monkey.  Mmmm...pistol whip.  Well anyway, thats cool.  So how bout those things?  Doin good?  Nice.  Yep.  Not too bad.  Not sure what this is supposed to be but the possibilities are limited.  Not limitless.  Limited.  After school Tyke returned home to his abode again, just to sit around for nothing.  He watched a nice little double package of Full House though.  The ones where Jesse and Becky get married.  And Michelle, she's so cute :), is being all cutesie and such.  It's really a classic dual episode.  And then the song that Jesse sings as his vows is really good.  Sorta.  It's good.  But it is so fake with his voice and Becky's too.  He loves looking at the show now and seeing all the insane stuff that happens in the show and how he didn't think anything of it when he watched the show as a little kid.  Like what family kisses and hugs this much???  Yeesh, they are like a newlywed couple but related.  It's kinda gross.  Especially seeing Danny always kissing Michelle.  How gross would that be now??  Some like 55 year old geezer (eww my dad's that old) kissing this really hot 18 (almost...) year old on the forehead and blowing on her tummy.  That would be gross.  It would be gross for Tyke to do it even.  But oh would he love it.  Speaking of love it Tyke talked with Tina at the basketball game tonight.  Oh man...he just couldn't pass up that transition.  Don't worry, his feelings have truly dissipated considerably.  Sorta.  But enough of that.  He is going to start censoring his thoughts somewhat on this blog.  However, online and in person he is free to talk about anything.  Oh yeahhhhh.  Sorry, he is just blabbering on now.  But the game was fun.  Guys got hosed but still fun.  Talking with the crew.  Getting a little rub down from Dotti (wink wink nudge nudge tickle tickle).  That had to be resurrected sometime.  The tickle tickle that is.  Can't be overused though.  So stop.  No more.  Tyke is really looking forward to playing some bball again.  He hasn't really played since the game against the Sly Lioners.  And that was fun.  That was a great time really.  It was really cool how Haras and Purdy came and cheered them on while filming.  He wants to have a little get together with them to watch the tape and hang out sometime.  Hey, Tyke's free on Friday.  Wink wink.  Yeah, he's always free.  Go him!!!  They probably won't be but ya never know these days.  If you know what he means.  Do you?  That would be weird if you did.  Cuz he had no meaning.  Ok, seriously.  Stop.  This is just weird.  So...  Umm...bye.  WEDNESDAY!!!!!"
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"25 more days of school.  After this week, 20.  That means 4 more weeks of school.  That is just remarkable.  Tyke has been going to school without even thinking about graduating for about 13-14 years now and it has just begun to sink in that he is graduating.  While he was driving up to Cougar Mountain today he really thought about it when he saw another car.  He doesn't remember now what it was about the car that made him realize it but he did notice it.  But that wasn't the first event of Tyke's day so he better back up for a second.  Tyke woke up a little pooped but he didn't think that he should just sit in bed and sleep so he got out and came online.  Maniak got a basketball game going so Tyke decided to join in.  Dr. Phil, Amed, K-caj, Fejj, and Macaroon all joined the boys in their game.  Tyke certainly wasn't playing very well.  After the game he came home and really didn't do anything productive for the rest of the day.  He saw his mom only once and that was for dinner because she is laid up in bed with what is most likely strep throat.  And folks, strep throat sucks.  If you had forgotten, Tyke has had it at least 2wice and it is just sooo uncomfortable until you get the antibiotics.  But that still takes a littl while.  Well after Tyke's BBQ'd steak, baked potato, and caesar salad he got ready for Refuge (put on shoes) and waited for Dotti to pick him up.  Refuge is winding down now.  Although Tyke hasn't been to it all that much he does like it and it's too bad he won't get to after this year.  But it certainly has opened Tyke up and the social aspect of it isn't too shabby either, ;).  Tyke and Ekul sat next to each other and commented on how the one song was played like 5 different times.  It must have been a 15-20 minute song.  It was funny.  But anyway, Dotti drove Tyke home and he got some ice cream and a cookie and got back online but nobody stayed on so he has just been blogging for a little while.  And watching Harry Potter cuz it's on ABC. Although he does have the movie as well, but that's ok.  This week shouldn't be too bad.  Wednesday is the AP Gov test and other than that he just has to think about Physics and sorta Math.  But English should be a snap.  With Senyohl ya never know though.  Let's just hope that Tyke gets go somewhere he wants to go."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Christmas was fun!  Tyke got his new videocamera.  It isn't perfect as it is kinda hard to use just because of the structure of it.  You hold it like a camera more than you would a regular videocamera.  But it is digital and it gets the job done.  So he loves getting to make movies and, hopefully, his friends will actually be free tomorrow so he can make some movies with them.  He hasn't talked to anybody in quite some time.  And hopefully things went well for Skippy.  Tyke hasn't actually gotten to talk to Skippy about whatever happened but he is assuming it is good.  As long as Skippy is happy, that is good.  And today was fun for Tyke so, it was good.  This can hopefully be a good omen for things to come.  Maybe things will get better now and Tyke can have a fun last 100 days of high school.  The days are ticking by quickly.  Graduation is not far off.  And college too will be on everybody sooner than they can believe.  People will split and drift and some others will get closer.  But most importantly, Tyke will get to meet some fine new ladies.  There is nothing more important than that (SOOOOO JOKING!)  Short but sweet tonight.  Not enough to blog about for now.  To the Gods!  (Adios!)"
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"Friends is over.  No more Friends parties.  Only friend parties.  Haha, Tyke's phunny.  Well, Tyke has one big story to tell for today.  And another mini-one.  Today, the Sanders/Senyohl gang of Tyke, Dotti, Amed, MormoMan, and HeadRed (thanks Amed) decided they would skip English and go out to lunch for a really long time.  So they got a note saying they were working on the Senior Assembly and got that taken care of with the attendance office.  Then they all got in Tyke's car and they went to good old Red Robin.  They were pretty much the only patrons there and they went outside and got a nice table in the sun.  They talked about the whole spectrum of topics and the food was exquisite.  However, they kept on chatting and chatting and forgot that they had to leave.  So Tyke raced them to school but they still got back like 3-5 minutes late.  Which is ironic because they had all of 4th period and their normal lunch with which to use and they still went overboard.  It was something different and fun though.  After school Tyke came home and then changed for bball at Amed's house with him and Willy and DUI's bro.  It was a rousing, spirited hobnobbing affair.  And of course Tyke was topless.  After all of that glory Tyke came home and got cracking on his soliloquy.  He still doesn't actually have it all memorized and he kinda has to go tomorrow but he thinks he can do it under the pressure.  He needs to at least do well on it because of his whole, ya know, grade thing.  But after he did that work and took out the trash Tyke went to the Friends party.  He was initially told it was at Mandy's but apparently that got changed without Tyke getting notified.  So yeah, Tyke got up there and thought he was a little early so he drove around cuz it was nice out and he just filled up on gas so he drove over right past Kinker's house but he wasn't outside so Tyke then turned around and went back to Mandy's.  He still didn't see anyone there so he called Dotti and she told him it got moved to her house.  So Tyke drove all the way down there and met up with Dotti, Mandy, and Purdy.  Tina came over as well and now it is really good between Tyke and Tina.  It is really fun being around her again.  MormoMan and Fiddlesticks came over a little bit later as well.  Well, the final episode was exactly what it should have been.  It wasn't that emotional except for...hmmm maybe Tyke shouldn't say the part but it involves Ross and crying.  Yeah, that was sad.  Well, Tyke sorta needs to memorize lines.  And he is also a little bit tired.  But hey, it's Friday tomorrow and Tyke already has plans for the night which is always awesome.  Pre-planned plans rule!"
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"This is technically the second blog for Saturday, yet really this is the only one that goes into detail of the action-packed Saturday (sarcasm definitely).  Today kinda was an unexpected lax day.  It started off with the Tykester going all night until the late hour of 11:50.  Of course he is talking about sleeping.  What else would he be doing?  Come on.  Apparently the Macaroonanator gave him a call while he was sleeping (he calls early a lot) and first his mom came in while he was sleeping and of course woke him up.  She didn't know that though cuz as she came in she asked in a whisper if he was awake and he opened his eyes to look at her but then quickly realized that he shouldn't do this so he closed them quickly and she then believed he was still sleeping.  Later on though, Tyke's papa came down and also checked to see if he was awake.  So that woke him up also.  So Macaroon basically woke up Tyke twice with one phone call.  Thanks you bastard.  When you don't go to bed until after 1, when would you expect to get up???  He didn't even get that much sleep.  Like 10 hours or so.  Barely even in double digits.  So at like 1 he went over to Macaroon's.  Joining them became Amed and then in an odd twist, DCups came along.  He hadn't hung out with them since summer really.  But it was cool.  They decided to hit up Coug Ridge for some bball.  As they were going outside Kinker finally rolled up on 24s.  Well, not really.  Not even close actually but still.  Tyke was not on in the cold weather when they played 21.  He did pretty well but of course Kinker was going all out compared to the aggressiveness of the rest of the players.  Not that he was going all out but he was playing harder than the rest as usual.  Amed played his usual style.  Which is pretty much indescribable.  Not necessarily in a good way though.  He is just fun to watch.  And he gets a scary face sometimes.  But if you ever want to see some serious arc on a shot...just watch Amed.  That ball goes way up there.  Then they played HORSE and Tyke was off.  He was still tired from 21 and not having anything to eat other than a nAsTy! like protein bar or something like that.  That is still no excuse though.  He got dethroned.  It was a much different game being behind Kinker rather than anyone else.  But he still just flat out missed his shots.  So then he and Amed started their one on one game.  Can you believe that Amed truly believes he can beat Tyke one on one???  Amed is better than you might think at basketball but still, Tyke used to play.  Back in the days of 5th and 6th grade he was pretty much Michael Jordan.  But really Tyke should be able to take Amed pretty handily if he doesn't completely brick every shot.  And if he doesn't just get tired from chasing down loose balls.  You'll hear the results first here though.  Don't worry.  Well, then Tyke, Kinker, and Amed went to BSquare.  Amed finally returned his pants there and apparently argued with them to allow him to get a full refund.  Amed is just like that ya know?  *Here is a little sidenote...Tyke for some reason just had a flashback to about a week ago when he and his mom were talking about their trip to Europe when summer starts (by the way if somebody really wants to go and would be willing to pay their own airfare Tyke's mom would be fine with him/her coming along) and she then started talking about current fashions.  So anyway, she got onto the subject of some of the clothes that girls/women wear now and she said the words pubic hair.  Right after that there was quite an awkward silence.  So then Tyke left and went downstairs.  That is all.  Ok, where was he?  Well Tyke looked at some shoes he wants to get at The Bon.  His bro has ones similar to them or maybe they are the same but he still likes them.  He thinks he would wear them a lot.  Basically loafers.  They had lunch at Orange Julius.  Those smoothies are really quite good.  Strawberry is awesome.  The nachos were pretty spicy but they did the job.  Tyke really wants to just eat stuff now.  Now he is hungry.  He really hates eating at 11:30.  It is just like he should be doing something other than eating, ie sleeping, and then whenever he eats something he gets more energy so he is even less likely to go to sleep.  And then he talks online so he ends up staying up until 1 every night and that is not advantageous.  But he likes to be pensive and was Saturday night.  Seeing as he did nothing and was hella tired (he fell asleep again on his chair watching TV).  So he just sat around and thought about stuff that was on his mind.  He didn't actually accomplish anything by doing this but it is alright.  Nothing was made worse.  Late in the night Macaroon actually got online and he talked to Tyke some.  Not sure what their plans are for Sunday but Macaroon really wants to do anything.  So hopefully they do something fun.  Tyke is planning on making a new mix soon.  Maybe tomorrow if he has time.  He has some ideas for what to put on it but of course he is always up for suggestions of something that is really good.  Dr. Phil probably has some ideas for that.  Well, Tyke's going to go eat some stuff and then probably think about things while he dozes off to sleep.  Here's to the night..."
Y0ZKBPE,male,17,"What up?  Tyke's back fellas and felines.  Nothing much more happened but he is still gonna talk some more.  He told his mom about his ticket.  It was actually a funny conversation when he looks back on it.  He first told her at dinner and she looked at him with wide glaring eyes and he was like, ""Ummm...don't worry it won't go on my record.""  Yeah, that was just kinda like, oh shit say something good now.  But then it was all cool cuz he explained stuff and then explained where it happened.  She actually said, ""Oh, thats good you got it then cuz I even speed there.""  Tyke was like, ""yeah...reaaaaaal good.""  Well, that worked out for the best.  No problems.  Other than the fact that he has to do community service and such sometime.  But Tyke is going to be very happy when his final tomorrow morning is over.  His 1st period final that is.  Cuz then it means a fun 2nd period final (photo) and then off to rest up, eat, and get ready for his big game.  That is going to be a battle.  But the Quah has a serious size advantage and should also be able to dominate the outside game if they can hit their shots.  Fatigue should not be a problem of course.  This is going to be great.  And Tyke, Kinker, and Toxic Old are going to have the fine cheerleading core of Haras and Purdy there.  It may not be right for them to totally cheer on only the Quah-ites but still they should give some good support.  But the time is tomorrow.  And it is late.  This was pointless to write.  He is not even focused on it now.  He really needs sleep.  He has totally neglected that this week.  Earlier today he fell asleep watching TV in ""his"" chair and then he had one of those weird moments.  All of a sudden his body shook violently and then BOOM! he woke up.  It was freaky.  It happens occasionally, mainly when napping on accident.  Not sure why it happens.  But it does.  So he is going to try and get some nappy nap sleep sleep.  So wish Tyke luck!

UNZUVPX,male,14,"Recently blogging has been all the trend, and on the papers it's been pretty publicised. Some blogs have been singled out as good and popular; some of which actually mean something, some of which don't. Today I was unfortunate enough to chance upon one that was a diary of a tormented and life of pure idiocrasy.  If you are bored and want to take a look into the blog, here's the address(http://xiaxue.blogspot.com). I don't know what so special about her blog, cause all I see is daily routine and well, Singapore propaganda. Oh yeah... There's it's own bit of vulgarity as well. At least here I'm refined enough to learn how to control my anger when there's nothing but a blank screen staring at me. How can any proper lady get so crude without any provoking factor? Maybe, in her definition, a ""Singapore Lady.""  Here it's entirely different isn't it? I hate Singapore, I bash Singapore, only because unlike her, I am a highly intelligent person who has prospects outside of Singapore. What's even worse is that she actually generalised people ""Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS"" as those who traditionally quit the country for better opportunities. I don't know what's her bloody problem, probably that she was never smart enough to get into these English speaking schools. She obviously can't see that people in these, by the way top schools, have enough foresight to recognise that honest and long-term success cannot be obtained by those who stay illogically loyal to their country.  From my point of view, even my dog makes more sense than her. I'm just hoping that this extreme will, like her blog, attract the masses, the intellectual masses..."

UNZUVPX,male,14,"Wow! Ok... So today I got caught in ths thing that was shockingly similar to the ""Don't talk to me!"" from Lance last episode of the Amazing Race. As you all know, the one person I really can't stand in class is Kelvin Chen. With his whiny voice and incessant speaking when spoken, or even not spoken to, I have about this much tolerance left for him.  Well, I don't know if he's under the impression that we're actually on good terms, cause he actually dared ask me for help. During recess, I was casually walking to my seat when he cut right in front of me and went ""Have you seen Liwei?"" Really like Lance, cause I don't think he was expecting the person he hated most to talk to him. I honestly thought that ""Don't talk to me!"" was going to come out of my mouth, but instead, I just stood there for a moment and then shrugged. Ahah... That just proves that the ""Don't talk to me!"" was uncalled for! Boo to Marshall & Lance, who are rumoured to go next week. Thank everything on and off the earth should that happen!  Anyway why he asked for Liwei was because the estate office found out about the key. What happened was that the smartest boy in the class, Liwei, was handed the key on Friday to open the door back from the lab. He did the stupidest thing by throwing the key around and it eventually landed in the gap behing the whiteboard. Now it can't come out. Oh the irony that the smartest boy in class would do the most stupid thing! Anyway for a moment he thought he was doomed but ""Oh my Saviour!"" Kelvin turned out a duplicate key. Supposedly he was afraid something like that would happen and took the key for duplication, complete with yellow tag and class printed. He managed to dodge the estate for the weekend but yesterday someone returned late and the estate man took a look at the key knew it was a duplicate.  Ahh... Control freak Kelvin gets into trouble for trying to handle too many things at once. Another person's in charge of the key, but he, with his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) about trying to be all responsible and running the class, has taken over since the start of the year. How much you want to bet he'll push the blame?  Oh yeah, more on class happenings... Toh Siew Tee, my Bio teacher stopped me after class today and told me I got full marks for the test. And she was giving me this toothy grin that reminded me of Dobby the House Elf. To think Kelvin Chen was actually trying to surprise me by studying and attempting to hit me off the Bio topspot! LOSER! I just have a feeling that the ""Don't talk to me!"" is going to come out of my mouth very, very soon..."
UNZUVPX,male,14,"Yes, the ""programme"" I was referring to is the CIP I had on Thursday at Macritchie Reserve. We had to walk 1 hour in and out of the area we were supposed to go to and it was all counted for our CIP hours. How nice is that? I calculated a total work time of 1.5 hours, and it is clocked at 6 hours. Not that I'm complaining, but wouldn't it be better if we walked into an office to do 6 hours of proper community work? Then again, the Physical Education & Aesthetics department has never been known for their efficiency... It was really more fun than work, especially with the antics of the dynamic trio we know as our class teachers!   Mrs Toh was dressed much more formally than she would in class, but maybe it's because she wears clothes that look like a house elf's rag to class. With her age catching up on her, you wouldn't be expecting her to bend down to pick up weeds would you? Very surprisingly, she was actually sppeding up the hill to go weeding. Maybe the biologically enhanced foods have something to do with it. When she actually started weeding, it looked like she was tending to her garden. Staying in one spot, it was as if she was looking after her plot of flowers. When we were done, she beamed at us and told us the huge pile in the middle of the path was her's. Halfway done the hill, she actually started running, as in really running. "" To the aircon!"" she yelled as our incredulous faces looked up at her.   Mr Sham kind of thought he was Tarazan... He was looking for all the vines hanging on trees and tried to swing on them. He really showed a wild side of himself when he joined in the tug-of-war with the tree. Actually, I thought he lowered himself to my class' level of intelligence, which is not at all very high. But I tell you something... He actually has a car! I mean, it was pretty shocking to see a Malay teacher have a car, but his car wasn't even the typical Malay second hand car, it was a nice, middle-class car. Well... Call me racist, but Malays are never known to be rich are they?   Deven was the most embarassing thing ever. He was trying overly hard to be funny, incorporating his little bit of Physics into a weed pulling activity. He was being blatantly ridiculed by Ashok and Anjan, but I have a feeling he really didn't know it. When I told him in his accent to ""apply the force"" on the weed, he threatened to ""apply the force on your face!"" I guess I don;t look Indian enough... Or maybe my imitation was too good. After we went back to home ground to retrieve our bags, Ashok caught a caterpillar meant to scare Mr Sham. Mr Sham managed to a certain extent hide his fear, but when Deven saw it he was totally mortified. He was saved by the ranger asking Ashok to put it back, and later gave the lame excuse of it having the possibility of being poisonous."

UNZUVPX,male,14,"I just peeked into my sister's blog, actually delved into it. I really don't think she expected me to do so... I mean, why would I be interested? Well, I realised that evrything she tells us is what she tells her friends on her blog... So much for family... It really doesn't say much of the complexity of her mind, does it? She is as easy to read as a book... And me being a Literature student, I can read between the lines.   Well, there's a comment on her blog about me having nothing to say. That's just because I've been alone all these years. You always with my other sister, and Mum always with Dad. I've never had a permanent companion. I kind of think mom sensed it... That's why till now I have a maid to ""take care of me."" It's kind of like Survivor isn't it? With two prominent alliances and me as the swing.   I really can't believe my older sister thinks that I'm having problems at school. It's so stupid... Do my results show any problems? Somethimes people like to be left alone, so shut your overly huge trap and pinch your gigantic nose cause I am not having any problems at school! I really hate it that she keeps telling me about prayer and how it changes things. It seems so super artificial and hypocritical, especially with your kind of situation and most of all your detestable character.   I cannot get why my sis is so transparent, when I'm so complex in character. Haha... I'm too complex for anyone to read me, not even my parents. Thinking about it I realise how I never miss her when she's gone... How I never miss anyone but my dad. Could it be that I'm the Kingshaw of this story? Ohh... That's sad... Maybe it's because the girls in the family have never been too highly intellectual, and I'm only able to mix with those people, and in the case of my family, only with my dad..."

Lousy, lousy, lousy, and they all thought it was marvellous... It is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring. Why, why, why? Why didn't they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through. Why did they not accept my script? Because they wanted it serious.   I tell you that if you're being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation, that thing would have been so fine, but hello, in front of a larger audience, the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation.

UNZUVPX,male,14,"Being in my class, as I realized today, is like playing a huge game of Survivor. I find it appropriate, that as a SurvivorFire writer, I compare a few significant classmates to a few of our most loved, most hated Survivors. For your information, I got back my exam results today, and some more emerged as Fairplays, and even more dropped like flies. The first person I’m doing is a guy named Ashok. He sits right next to me, laughing his ass off all day. Any Survivor idiot can tell he’s playing the game, distracting others by ridiculing the teachers. Before the exams, he was on my Fairplay list, one that really had the potential to do well, but was valiantly concealing it. When the results were returned, he dropped to a John (Marquesas) Award. He definitely outwitted the “sheep” of the class, because a countless many fell into his laughing pit, but in the end he was completely outwitted by none other than me… There are 2 Fairplay award recipients, namely Jason and Anjan. Both play a very good game, and end up far, as in as far as top 5 in class. Both conceal their capabilities very well, playing the “I’m a doofus, don’t worry about me role.” What I know is that they definitely go home to mug their heads off. Personally I fell into Anjan’s trap at the start of the year, I thought he was a lazy pig who would couch up and do nothing at home. However sad for him, the Nurse John from above entirely spoiled his game. I got a lot of feed about him right before the exams, and I marked him on my list as a competitor. Jason, because of my past experience with him, I knew his bloody game plan. Sitting next to Ashok and Anjan, I knew I had no choice, I had to step up my game or be eaten alive. I used to be a Kelly W, having no game plan but to win, win and win all the bloody immunities. I knew that once I lost my grip I would go, right then, right there. I slowly converted into a Neleh… I let myself be used as a pawn. I let the 2 believe that “Hey, this guy is falling into my trap” he’s no longer a threat! Even though my test marks were still maintained, they no longer looked there… They only looked at how distracted I was… All I can say is: Wrong Move! Stupid, Stupid People!!  I know I’ve still got a lot of work to do… For all I know, I’m the one being outplayed! Now that they’ve seen through my bloody plan, maybe I just need a new alliance, maybe I need to be the new and biggest FAIRPLAY!  P.S. For those interested, I got 4 A1s and 4 A2s, that makes a total of Distinctions!"
PYF6X0V,male,23,"Hi Dear, I've finally responded to your blog...  Sorry it took so long to do.  I was listening to the CD you burnt for me, and I found so many of the songs I had on my com previously (before it died), or songs I was listening to when I was morose previously.  Things like  Hazard , or  Heaven Knows .  And I have the Robbie Williams stuff too.  And even  Life in Mono  and  Love, Me .  Listening to Sarah Mclachlan now, singing  Angel .  It's such a strange coincidence, speaking of similar tastes, or something more.  And although I am not one for radical speculation, it's a nice feeling -- to be able to hold a CD that my Dearest burnt for me, that feels like I could've compiled it myself.  I love you, my fellow fan of ""The Wedding Singer"".  =)"

PYF6X0V,male,23,"My dearest... some days I sit here and think... and I figured out itz like NAPTFA... God prob wants to me to like go through every obstacle and train like shite for it before I get the gold medal aka you.  Sometimes it feels surreal that you're here. That we found each other when we stepped away from the closed doors and bumped back to back with the other, turned round, found that wonderful magic going between us and began this wonderful dance with each other- which I hope will last for as long as we both shall live.  We've only just begun to tango so I apologise if I've been rushing the whole wedding waltz thing... I guess it is this girl thing. Hahaha...like my future cuzin-in-law Jullie.  We always seek the security and that sense of companionship and belonging. Maybe even more so with me as I have so much more to lose, so much more to make up for and so much more to protect. I've fallen and hurt myself so badly and I never want to find myself in that living Hell again.  I know you want to take time to smell the roses and plan which is good... great. Of course we must leave it up to God but it's just that he can't take action for you- only you can... so you know at least 2-3 years before you want to go on that lifelong journey of love and commitment and claim your 7D/7N ^^"" pleasee let me know. There is so much planning- like finance & budgeting for the life ahead, housing (dad really is thinking of letting me have the TPY flat so that will help i think),insurance, telling the folks eventually, planning for the big day, going for marriage preparation courses, preparing Kaelen, explaining to him (the older he gets, the harder to explain I think? It's like you know you don't remember much of your 4-5 year old days but when you hit primary school, you don't forget stuff that happens from then?) and letting your folks get comfy with him (again harder the older he gets... kids form closer attachments from a younger age I feel.)  I also dun wan Kae to go to school and be teased about being a bastard... something which haunts a close friend of mine who was also born out of wedlock... kids are not dumb... they can be fucking cruel. I remember vividly the way I got bullied in school and I never want my son to be hurt by that kind of shit. I am not trying to be over-protective but my kid doesn't have to pay for my sins. Itz not his to bear- it is mine and only mine.   Then again, you don't deserve to be rushed and to bear my sin for me too. I dun wan to scare u away and neither do I want you to regret any decisions you make about us.   I love you dearly and I'd rather wait than to ever make you unhappy about such an important event in our lives.  I guess maybe you still need to take you time to think... But I know (probably like how Derrick's wife knew about Derrick) that I want to spend my lifetime loving you and standing by your side no matter if it is good or bad times that lie ahead... I'd rather be rich in spirit and in joy than in material stuff... so none of that poor man shite k? I'd rather walk the hard road with you as enduring those hardship will forge a stronger bond. It doesn't matter to me whether my wedding is a lavish affair or just simple & sweet... it is a bonus... but what matters more to me is being able to finally be able to wake up beside you, to spend my life with you as one.  That's what memories are made up of... the little things... and someday when we hit our 25th anniversary, we can do that whole saying the vows again and walking down the aisle thing again with each other. My mum's godma did that and my mum said it was the most romantic thing ever. Their kids arranged it for their mum and surprised her. It was like a second wedding dinner thing... friends and relatives... wedding gown/ evening gowns... dinner in a hotel ala wedding dinner style... and a multimedia presentation by her kids about their parents and their love story. I hope we get to celebrate ours that way too... Apparently, they didnt have a big wedding when they got married becuz of money matters so this was a wonderful wonderful way of making up for it.   Anyway I should shuddup by now lol... longwinded and silly woman... I just wanted you to know:  I love you and I KNOW that IT is you and you're the only IT I need on this mortal coil.  Your silly BS"
PYF6X0V,male,23,"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.   Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.

Anyone who knows me will know that my ambition now is to someday sleep 9 hours straight without waking up- Kinda like in the BK (not burger king but before kaelen) past. If I am a Li-ion battery, my battery fluid should be screwed up by now. Everyone knows that with Li-ion batteries you must max them out to zero and then charge from there till it's full and some more. Well... it kinds of explains my ""battery life"".   Here, I would like to apologise to my poor significant other who has to put up with a girlfriend who falls asleep over the phone suddenly. No, I don't have narcolepsy... my body was just so tired, it threw me into REM straight away. My cicadian pattern is officially kapoot.  I could be awake and all preppy one moment on the telephone and then the next thing silence... then deep breathing... a normal person would put the phone down... a person-in-love-with-geri will wait (thanks hunny) and i do spring to life again sometimes but he'd be asleep.... and being a person-in-love-with-ian, i can't bear to put the phone down. So about 85% of my phone bill is about silence- a deeper and more complex communication than chitterchattering.   What I really want to say is... Thank you dar' for being there even when my ear is plastered to the phone but my brain and mouth aren't there. My heart usually is and it's always touched by your love."

XKAXHN1,female,24,"I bought the coolest toy for my younger brother's birthday! I found a space shuttle with a docking station! It also has two spacemen and a little space truck! The package arrived last week, and I just got around to wrapping it and shipping it off to him today, but not without playing with it first! The other night Matt was making dinner, and I came in with the box, looking for a knife.   Matt:  What'cha doin'?  Me:  I'm gonna play with Nathan's new toy!  Matt:  Wha- No, Kim, put it down.  Me:  (cutting through the tape)What?  Matt:  You're going to break it before you even send it to him!  Me:  No I won't, silly. I think I can figure out how to - wow! The doors of the shuttle open! Ooh, and there's a little arm thing that comes out! Neat!  Matt:  Kim, put it back in the box!  Me:  No! I want to look at it! I'm ""testing"" it.  Matt:  Silence.  Me:  Ooh! The truck has a satellite dish thingie on top!  Matt:  We can get you one of your own if you'd like.  Me:  Actually, it  is  pretty cool...Okay, I'm going to put it away now."
XKAXHN1,female,24,"An excerpt from today's ""Mom"" email:    Adventure Cat was quite upset with us late yesterday afternoon. We decided to change her bedding for her. The kids and I removed the kittens and Adventure cat then I quickly placed a clean sheet in for them before replacing the kittens. Adventure Cat was big time miffed! She mewed and threw quite the tizzy. She then moved the kittens to an undesirable spot where we had plastic bags stored. Then she got mad because we removed the plastic bags and put the kittens back in their original home. After yelling at all of us then yelling real loud at Nathan and chasing him away from the area she moved one kitten to a small box that really wasn't even big enough for just her. She then proceeded to lay on top of the kitten and refused to budge! I got another box together for her and moved it under the chair near where she wanted to be and placed the kitten in it. She hopped in and seemed content until the other kittens started crying for her. She then poked her head out and mewed at me so I brought the others to her. They're all happily abiding in their new home and we will wait plenty of time before attempting to change the bedding for her again."

XKAXHN1,female,24,"Overheard conversation involving two girls walking down the street:   G1: Man!  My skin is totally falling off from the sunburn I got last weekend! G2: Really?  You should do what I do.  I never peel after a burn. G1: Wow...What's that? G2: Well, I always use aloe vera.   G1: Hmm. G2: Okay, so, during the first few days, when the burn is really bad?  You want to cover yourself in aloe in the morning and at night.  Or twice a day or whatever, kay? G1: Uh-Huh. G2: Then, after the burn has gone down a bit, you only do the aloe thing in the morning, or just less than twice a day.  G1: Yeah. G2: So, that's what I do, y'know?    Overheard conversation involving a man on the bus and no one else:   Man: Y'know what that Krispy Kreme ought to do?  Everyone else:.... Man: They should get a sign; one of those signs like McDonald's got, that says how many hamburgers they've sold.  Everyone else:.... Man: They sell over a billion donuts a year, y'know?

XKAXHN1,female,24,"I have the worst breath ever right now.  I can't do anything about it at the moment.  We're short-staffed today, and I can't really leave my desk until Steven comes back from his lunch.  The problem is, I didn't realize how horrible my situation was until he had just left.  Of course, when I realize something like this, I have to try and figure it out.  Lemme see...coffee, Chinese food, mouth-breathing while zoning out to Tetris.  Yup.  30 minutes left of atrocious breath.  Great."

XKAXHN1,female,24,"So, I was in the shower this morning, and thought...  What if I baked cookies for John Kerry?  I could send him a batch of chocolate chip, or maybe peanut butter, with a little note, wishing him luck on the election.  THEN...he would call me up and tell me how wonderful the cookies were, and ask me to be his ""election baker"".  My first assignment would be to bake a   gagillion   cookies for his next public speech.  I would have to decline, ""That's a really great offer senator, but my little kitchen simply can't handle that much business at once"".  ""Not to worry, my dear!""  He would respond, ""You can move into my mansion where we'll build you a large commercial kitchen, and we also plan to provide you with an assistant baker.""    Wow...that was a really good daydream...I just added the assistant part in while I was typing this."
XKAXHN1,female,24,"I was sitting at my desk this afternoon and acquired an enormous craving for cheddar/sour cream Ruffles (they have ridges, y'know).  Of course, the vending machine on my floor was all out, so I ran down to the 3rd floor to grab a bag.  On the way back up the stairs, one of my sandals caught on a step, and I went down with a squeak and a thud.  Two ""suits"" were standing by the stairwell, and they just turned to stare at me while I re-composed myself.    Yes, it hurt a little.  My toes, knees, hands and pride are all a little bruised.  But,  damn  those chips were worth it."
XKAXHN1,female,24,"I once read or heard someone say that we're only making ourselves age faster when we constantly look forward to the weekend.  So what does that say for those of us who simply look forward to going home and drinking a beer at the end of each day?  My guess is that we're making ourselves age,  and  get fat faster.  So, girly night wasn't so bad.  I'm now the proud owner of a little pink purse.  My new purse is so cute!  It even has a little matching coin purse!  I still stand by my previous statement, however.  I am  not  girly!  It was the wine, I swear.  The wine made me do it.   All of the ladies at girls night were so excited about my new purchase.  ""Oh, it's the perfect size for some cash and your lipstick!"".  Um, try chapstick, honey.  My purse comes with two strap options.  There's the short, ""carry your purse in your hand"" type strap, and then there's the ""over the shoulder"" variety.  In my opinion, the best part about my new purse is that the smaller strap is the perfect length to be a little pink collar!  Y'know what's frightening?  I can totally picture the pink collar, with the purse, and some matching pink strappy heels.  Not girly at all...right."

XOGKDFL,male,14,"Experience is the best teacher. What you see around you teaches many things, you just need to  watch ...  1. People don't mind other people's business, unless you are famous, or you are strange. 2. People only read something that interests them, and each person has different interests. 3. Concluding from the statement above, it makes  urlLink our  job more complicated, and the admin wants to put their interest which leads to... 4. Interesting for them,  BORING  for us... 5. Unless you read the editorials and look for an opiion that really rocks...  I'll continue this one later. _________________________________________- I just made this one this week. Check it out...    Division  In our terminal years as editors in our school paper, there are some revisions that needs to be considered regarding the quality of our school paper from the system of the organization to the paper itself:  1.       Each member of the staff should belong to a group for them to have a definite subject to focus on. The editor concerned will lead them. e.g.: Photo Staff, News Staff, etc, etc.  2.       The Editorial Board should be composed of skilled people in the field of writing. Tried and tested in different scenarios.  3.       The Tanglaw office should be extended to give adequate space for many people to work on. The board is composed of many students, but as of present, there is a lack of space.  4.       That we be given necessary equipment (e.g.: camera, ream of paper, computer programs, etc.). It will be of great help to those assigned to cover special events, as it will avoid them from spending extra money for the purchase/developing of film, wasted time for bringing various computer programs to school and the like. The computer must be installed with anti-virus scans to avoid infection of the hard drive to avoid work delay.  5.       To avoid speculations of favoritism, the outgoing Editorial Board members must do the process of promotion of incoming Editorial Board members. They shall nominate editors/staffers to fill in their place, with the notice of the editor/staffer concerned. The editor/staffer may decline the promotion. They shall base their decision from the performance and dedication given by each, the experience accumulated, and the responsibility and time dedicated to the organization.  6.       The whole board should be trained for the enhancement of skills. Remember: skill x training = competitive and talented student while talent – training = average student. If Claret School wants to produce competitive students, then the side of our campus journalists should never be put aside. Claret, as a private school should be able to at least have a stand in local writing competitions.  7.       Tanglaw, like any other school paper/ organization, should have their fund. The accumulated school paper fee paid in the tuition fee may be considered as the fund of the organization. Students, and their parents, may want to get their money’s worth .   8.       The book “Campus Journalism” by Ceciliano Cruz contains useful tips as well as guidelines in the field of campus journalism. Focused on different kinds of writing, cases, scenarios which a journalist/ school paper may face. It is the reference book used by Quezon City Science High School students in their journalism elective, “The Electron” and “Ang Banyuhay” which topped and won many awards in the interschool journalism contest, considered as the battle of the school papers in their respective divisions last school year. It is recommended that we also use this book as a reference to enhance the different elements that comprise our paper.  It is now requested that these proposals may be considered. It is for the benefit of our school paper, to make a stand and be known, and to be competitive, as our alma mater wishes us to be. Given the best, we will definitely produce the best.  We hope for your kind consideration  _____________________________ Enriquito Ramon Rosales Editor in Chief (last year’s Associate Editor in Chief)  _____________________________ Robel Dabandan Managing Editor (last year’s Features Editor)  _____________________________ Roehl Niño Bautista Associate Managing Editor for two years  _____________________________ Tristan Joshua Arcinue Lay-out Editor for two years  _____________________________ Karlo Nobleza Chief Photographer for two years"

This illegitimate post will be gone next year so better stick with it.  2. There's a chance to fulfill my high school dream (and that's not getting a girlfriend)!!! If things will go well, I may be the EIC next school year??? As explained by Ms. Ma. Cristina Anasta. Oh God, I really need it for college. Being the EIC will fulfill my journalistic dreams!!! My dream? to be a broadcast journalist. Think, Howie Severino and Reporter's Notebook.  3. Abel will be trained. He needs it. Being AE means a lot of responsibilities. A LOT!!!  At least hindi na ako ang mangungulit sa staff. Mwahahahaha!!!   4. Memories. Sol, Tj and me reminisced the old times, singing theme songs from Voltes V, Bioman, Power Rangers, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon and the like. Forgive us, we have an unfulfilled childhood.  5. My journal.

Darn, I just found that there is an army of ants under my seat. Time to kill!!!"
XOGKDFL,male,14,"Ok. Just like the title of this blog, I just post one entry for every day that I get online.  First of all, why roninsword.blogspot.com?  ro= Ro ehl Nin= Niñ o minus the '-' above the 'n'. the 'sword' has two meanings:  Ronin's Word: stands for my opinion  Ronin Sword: stands for my weapon  Basically, it means that my opinion is my weapon, and that is all. I do not wish to be held for libel, and I do not wish to open another 'damn' chain letter in Friendster. I promise, from this day on, I will only open those posts from rico, panji, jiguli and other trusted people who post surveys (you can say if it is a chain letter)  5. Stupid chain letter which you will open because it is the spell that killed Harry's parents (wrong thing to open folks, nothing related with Harry Potter, and it will strike fear to your hearts.  Okay, enough of the stupid thing. So what basically made this day different:  4. Noli me Tangere. 15th chapter. Ahead of schedule actually  3. 4. Tanglaw Eliminations Final Round. And they thought they will be eliminated until...  2. Club Selling. I was made to speak for our club (tatak tanglaw, the club of our school paper. I am the associate managing editor for the 2nd year in the row.) and...  1. Tanglaw Meeting. We got suggestions fomr the Photo Editor of the school paper of DLSU, an alumnus of CSQC. We got lots of ideas. We hope the admin approves it.  So that wraps it up. Be careful with opening bulletin board chain letters and be happy.  The campus journalism act of 1991 was great.  P.S.

XOGKDFL,male,14,"This is an essay I just found in my journal...      ___________________________________________________________________     It is the post modern age. It is the era where life is made easier, if not more complicated. It is where people depend on technology, latest gizmos and gadgets and other things Science has to offer. When asked on what things never leave their pockets or bags whenever you go out with friends, classmates, outings, etc, most people would rank their latest cellphone models, palm tops, and MP3 players as an aid in helping them pass by time. When I’m the one asked, my journal and pen never leaves my bag and a tickler and a spare pen to place in my pocket. They would ask me why, and I have a simple answer. I’m a journalist. But wouldn’t it be interesting to know the history behind this reason?  The paper and pencil are two of the products of the progression of human civilization. To date back in history, there were illustrations found in caves, believed to be the work of pre-historic men inscribing what they see during their days. The Sumerians, titled to be the oldest civilization that existed, introduced a formal writing system called Cuneiform. The infamous Ancient Egypt decorated chambers, walls, halls and infrastructures with hieroglyphics, used to narrate about mythology, literature. They also used papyrus, utilized as early paper. The Chinese on the other hand introduced calligraphy. These were the foundation of two of the basic necessities of people of all ages. The rest is history.  As early as the pre-historic era, pre-historic men already took down notes of what happened around them. Putting the things they witnessed into illustrated media. The Bible has eyewitness accounts and stories passed on orally, written down to formalize it. Written accounts during important events that made a mark in history are read in search of more information, referring on what the writer knew, saw, and wrote. Take the Diary of Anne Frank as an example.  The pen is the bullet and the paper is the gun, it aims to shoot information to the readers. With these elements in the hands of a skilled fellow, we can expect exceptional writings from this person. As a young journalist, it is my aim to inform the readers of what I see as how I see it, or of something they knew little of.  The practicality of the trusty pen and notebook arises. Anything you’ve written is written. It is an event, thought, and talent fused to a medium. Writing down events might someday be a basis of the future generation. What happens now will be history in the future.  The center of journalism is life, divided into different branches. From theories and mythology to politics and Popsicle sticks. Compounding my thought in written form is my passion. It has been my friend, my sword and my voice.  We can see that broadcast journalists bring too a notebook and pen to jot down essential information. With this information, they report it to the viewers in another form of media. It is an evolved form of journalism, taking it to another level. Keeping it in my dreams, and having my pen and notebook in my pocket and knapsack will surely help. So as you pack your things for an exciting day ahead, together with family, friends, or even just alone, what item never leaves you?"

LB1DE6M,female,17,"Am I REALLY a happy person? This question just struck me not long ago... I have been pondering over it, but my final answer ""I'm not sure...” Sometimes I think not. I have lots and lots of worries, problems... and it's accumulating daily. At times I feel really tired... tired about thinking too much~ Although some may advise me not to think too much... but I just can't help it at times. I guess I may seem optimistic on the surface, but deep down inside me, I'm quite a pessimistic person. There's this sense of insecurity and fear that's always lingering in my heart.  Sometimes, I may appear to be a carefree person... someone who's humorous, someone who hasn't tasted any downs in life. I think that at times, people are unable to realise when one is unhappy and all these overwhelming worries that’s pulling one apart. Guess I can hide my feelings quite well?! Hee~  Today, I've never stopped frowning ever since I stepped into school. I think I'm not in a very good mood today. So hey guys, if I appear to be unhappy sometimes, it's not your fault, cos it's just me. Anyway, I had p.e today... while strolling on the tracks, I took it as a very good opportunity for me to sort out my thoughts. I recalled all those sweet memories... those times I spent with my CO ""family"" on the Pasir Ris beach, what we did, what each and everyone of us said. Each and every expression on everyone's face was captured and still running vividly through my mind. Guess these are the moments that will be able to brighten up my darkest days. I'm a dreamy person indeed.  I love to picture my future... where will I be, and what will I be doing. It's not bad to think ahead... As mentioned in one of my fav. books ""Who moved my cheese""... Pg 58 (Imagining myself enjoying new cheese even before I find it leads me to it)  Hmn... I may seem to be talkative most of the times. However, when I start to tone down, it's the time when I observe the actions and the behaviors of the people around me. Regardless if you are someone I know or a stranger from nowhere... I'm just interested or I should say curious to guess what's going through the minds of these people. haha... maybe I should consider taking up psychology? hmn.... or maybe law appeals more to me still. ANyway... I think every other human being feels the same... we face lots of dilemmas, thus we must learn to be more decisive in order to overcome more hurdles ahead in life.  Hai~ maybe it's the weather today... that had instilled in me such a gloomy feeling. I think I shall learn to let things take its natural course.  Arrgh…really miss my beloved hairpin too. This precious thing will probably be buried under the sand in the playground forever. Guess~ as what ‘meow meow’ said… treat it as something which holds all the unhappiness and it will be buried there. Recalling what ‘Da Jie’ said… maybe it’s not all meant to be.  Anyway… thanks for making me feel better. I’m truly touched, especially when you guys helped me to ‘hunt’ for that pin.  Yeah! So stay tuned for the next blog then…"
LB1DE6M,female,17,"WaHahaha... had a wondeful... superb day today! Had a tricky listening comprehension exam this morning... followed by an interview by the ex co. of chess club.=X Hope that everything went well. hee~ Anyway, had a nice lunch today with my friends. It was a dramatic one though... with lots of climax in between. Firstly... clumsy Fz here spilled some barley onto her skirt but luckily the material is waterproof! So not so paisei... haha... then I accidentally bumped into an old Auntie behind me when I turned around to 'peep' if my friends were still behind. Wow~ this 'accident' had a great impact on me... I bounced up immediately... upon this collision. haha~  Besides this, I just returned from a gathering at Pasir Ris Park ""Fisherman Village""! Had a sumptous dinner...although the food were quite expensive, but guess it's all worth while. In fact, this mini congregation was specially organised to welcome my friend who came back recently from Australia! Yu Yan... I miss ya man! haha~ not much changes... she's still as jovial and easy going as ever. This friend of mine... we know each other since pri.school days! wow~ so tonight is a 'childhood' friends get together session!  Had lots of fun and laughter... At around 8 plus after dinner, each of us bought a drink and attempted to climb onto the 'breakwaters'... haha~ this was the funny part... as usual we made lots of noise and ended up being the ""BRiGhTeSt"" lightbulb there. hehe~ became a nuisance to the couples who were enjoying the scenic view and doing some star gazing... when the sky is quite clear tonight. haha~ after a while, we decided to get down that platform. As usual.... clumsy ppl like us were all in slippers and we had to 'slide' down the breakwater one by one. ahaha... we looked like 'country bumpkins' man... This commotion we caused had resulted in 1 couple leaving the area. This shows that our 'wonderful' presence is greatly felt! -_-"" hee~ Then... we decided to settle at another corner of the park... facing the beach. We chatted all night long.... had many lame jokes and shared different experiences in school. Goodness... I laughed whole night long... guess I have lost some voice. Oops... better keep quiet and rest my voice box a while before it deterioriates! hehe  At about 10 plus, we left the area. On the way out, I actually noticed a sign board reading ""Beware of falling coconuts""!!! ahahaha... I nearly fainted upon reading the sign! Goodness me... such 'lame' signs do actually exist. The evil thought that someone would be hit by a falling coconut... keep replaying in my mind! gosh... it will be really funny to see such a thing happen! haha... of course that victim will definitely not be ME!  Anyway... when we were approaching the bus-stop just a few km before.. we saw the bus! Then we decided to catch the bus... so all of us ran like a mad person being chased by a dog! We finally got onto the crowded bus... and throughout the journey, the bus was driving at top speed... guess the driver wants to get home in time for a rest! haaha... in fact such a scenario reminds us of the times in pri.school when we had school excursions to the Science Centre! hee~  WoooOo... today's outing is definitely an enjoyable and unforgettable one! AS i always say... CKpS6A'99 rocks man!!! Luv you guys lots~   * Everytime I miss you... a star falls. So if you see the sky and it's all dark...It's your fault coz you made me miss you so much..."" ;P"
LB1DE6M,female,17,"Ah!!! Super super warm weather today! I think I'm going to suffer from heat stroke or dehydration sooner or later... argh... Anyway that's besides the point...      Although school was as stressful as usual, especially when there are lots and LOTS of rehearsals this week. I will have to endure this period of time and hopefully I will pull through. Sometimes I wish I'm invincible and would just suddenly vanish from this world. However, guess I can't... because I'll definitely miss the dearest people around me. hee~      Had an enjoyable GP lesson today! Never knew that GP could be so SO fun man... Our new teacher rox to the max... haha~ although we had current affairs quiz today... we were allowed to discuss in groups. As usual... we came up with lots of lame and crappy answers just to fill up all 35 blanks in time! wahaha~ had LOTS of laughter. I couldn't stop laughing at all... there's this laughing bug in me... haha~ can you imagine... laughing until you feel breathless?! That was what happened... I reached a point of saturation whereby I couldn't laugh anymore already. My laughter seemed to be 'deadly' contagious too~ seems like most of the people around me were affected by it. Ahahahaha... goodness me! -_-''      Anyway, we watched an extremely cute show today during Chinese lesson! The little boy featured was extremely naughty... but on the other hand lovable. haha~ oxymoron yah? The story was about a separated couple who were busy looking for another ideal partner. However... their adorable kids were always there to cause some distruption during their dates and all... hehez~ quite a nice and touching story. Wonder what's the outcome? The story continues tomorrow~ =P     Watched the taiwanese idol show 'qian jin bai fen bai' on SCV yesterday again! haha~ falling in love with that show sia~ so romantic... *_* Finally... both the lead actor and actress are together... hopefully they will be able to cross the hurdles ahead of them... hee~ I'm contemplating if I should get this set of vcd! can't wait to watch the final episode.... hopefully it's a lovely one. Anyway... I only buy idol shows with a happy ending yah? ahaha....     A continuation for today... had some fun and laughter with the ppl in A03... they are really nice ppl... very fun-loving and sociable. Haha~ guess this class have quite a good repore with one another. Anyway thanks to meow meow~, if not I wouldn't have made such wonderful new friends. ('',) Hope to get to know them better in future...      So so so... tomorrow... rehearsals~ dreadful rehearsals. How I wish they can be more efficient and to stop being so draggy... it's so mentally draining... hai~ I think I will have a super 'black' face tomorrow again. haha~ I'm anticipating the worse... so that I won't feel that awful tomorrow. However... guess with the company of my beloved CO 'family'... eveything should go fine. yeah~ so that's all then... will update asap. By the way... there's something wrong with my chatbox... arrgh..."
LB1DE6M,female,17,I'm seeing stars *_*... I wanna faint.Inexplicable emotions running through me... my energy seems to be slowly draining away. Guess I should try my very best to look at the brighter side of life... yes! I will continue to perservere... I hope to see the fruit of the labour at the end of the day...  Anyway words enough said... not much inspirations today. =(
LB1DE6M,female,17,"I'm slEepy... I'm dreamy... I'm dizzy... I'm floating... wahahaha *_*    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     a weird day ... filled with mixed feelings... beautiful windy weather...   Hehe~ had a mini and a little pathetic Racial Harmony carnival today. Was slightly late for the Racial Harmony talk in the audi... Oh my goodness! So paisei...  my friends and I thought that we had to be seated by 10 instead of 9.45. Happily we marched in at 10 plus, by that time almost everyone was seated and the principal had just begun her presentation. Wow~ thousands of eyes watched us like hungery vulgers waiting to attack small little preys... However, luckily we managed to pull through this tiny 'ordeal'. hehe...     Then my friends and I proceeded to the foyer after the talk... I participated in the Indian decor activity. Each of us took some coloured rice grains and laid them out according to the authentic flowery template that was placed on the floor. Wow~ wonderful experience... although it's a rather tedious job.      Following that... hey hey~ we took a stroll around the running tracks in school. So romantic right?! haha... we chit chatted along the way as the wind blowed in our direction. Goodness~ as though we were having a vacation on Cameron Highlands. It's definitely an experience that one should never miss out... I believe that such precious moments will definitely make up part of the sweet memories I have with my friends. In fact, such a scenario reminds me of the tittle of the book '  A walk to remember  ' ... I would encourage you guys out there to read it...    It's a sweet story about family, FRIENDS and the different characters you meet daily. How one gain acceptance by proving oneself... and to stay strong regardless of whatever setbacks you have faced. It's a simple yet complicated love story... Extremely touching~     Yup yup... I'm getting a little worried now... My dad will have to go for another mini op. tomorrow. I cross my fingers and pray hard that there won't be any complications... Hopefully the surgeon of Changi Hospital will avoid medical negligence unlike the last time. I can't accpect another blow... it's too painful to watch your love one suffer for nothing... . Hopefully after this mini op... another round of check up and bi-opsy will carry through smoothly too. I pray that there won't be any undesirable outcome... although chances are low... but there's still a slight possibility. Anyway, what I can do now is to give him the moral support and to provide him with some advices... which may be of some use. yesh...     tata... [=^_^=]"
LB1DE6M,female,17,"A quote:      The measure of love is when you love without measure.   In life there are very rare chances that you will meet the person you love that will love you in return...   So once you have it, don't let it go because it may never come back to you again...     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     hee~ regarding this quote, I think it really makes sense to a large extent. Yes~ love cannot be measured right? How can you ever weigh it... in fact only your heart knows how important that particular 'someone' is to you. Sometimes, it's a little mysterious... the more you know that 'someone' has taken up a large space in your heart, the more we are so afraid of facing the truth. Therefore we end up trying to run away from it...      Hence, we may lose the one we greatly love and by that time it's probably too late to let that person know how much he means to you... the fact is, we can never turn back time. It's an irreversible hypothesis... thus we should hold on to what we have... and to shower it with love and care whole-heartedly..."
LB1DE6M,female,17,"...FaTe...  Fate... this is what I believe in. It works all the time. We can make all the effort to keep our relationships going, but without this intangible 'fate' , everything may not turn out well as expected. Of course there are many others who do not believe in fate. They believe that it's they who control their lives and not fate. true... I agree to what they say. However, there are times whereby certain things are not within man's control, isn't it? Thus I think we should always treasure every moment we spent with one another. It's something amazing that had brought all of us... the different ppl with different personalities and upbringings together. It's not something done deliberately... it's just so ironic and at times we can't explain why this had happen either.  I was flipping through my autograph book... the one I had before leaving pri.sch, when I was preparing to head for a whole new chapter of sec.life back then. Here... was what one of my teachers(CKPS) wrote "" Life is not a bed of roses but it is sprinkled with many learning experiences. Every step we take make us ever wiser! "" . Till now 5 years down the road... I can still vivdly remember the msg he left me. I believe that it had left an impact in my life... and it's an advice that will continue to guide me through thick and thin. I think sometimes we should never take things too lightly... I can't guarantee that all good things will last forever. However... we should always enjoy what we have... a step at a time. It's not a matter of being optimistic or not. It's a matter that one day... you would leave this place with little regrets. Knowing that you have once hold these memories and had shared it with the dear ones around you. By having faith in yourself and the friends you have... only then things will work out. Without basic trust in the first place... I don't see a point to start a relationship. Efforts will just go down the drain... knowing that you may have lost time meeting another wonderful person out there.  We lost a PE teacher (SACSS) lately... and I believe that he will definitely continue to live in the hearts of each and every student he had once taught. He's someone who believes alot in tough love and we were probably still less mature back then in sec.sch, to realise his real intention of disciplining us. He always believes that a school needs a ""Father"" to keep everything going and he has bravely taken up this role of a ""bad guy..."" Often... I wonder why must we wait till the person leave us one day... then we realise how important they are to us. I guess that's human's nature, to take things for granted. Although all of us avoid doing so... but sometimes it's hard, because we are influenced by the things around us...  I think reflections will help to guide us along the right track...and I believe that although time flies quickly... if we truly treasure it... then we won't miss out the ppl around us."
LB1DE6M,female,17,"Arrgh... not feeling very well lately... guess I should drop by the clinic for a check up. Lots of weird symptoms. I feel cold easily... even when the morning sun is shining brightly. My teeth starts to chatter badly the moment I enter audi. I have unusual aches everywhere. Oopps... hope it's nothing serious... I still wanna live a longer life. haha... Anyway, I love the weather today. Although it's a little freezy and you can feel the coldness penetrating into your skin like a thousand needles... this scenario reminds me of the time when I was in Hong Kong. hai~ gone are the days... when will the holidays be coming again? Hopefully this time I can travel to a Western country? Maybe for sight seeing and even for a shopping spree! That would be an extremely GrEaT idea yah...  Anyway... talking about co practice... I think I'm looking forward to it. Because of the Matsuri piece, I'm finally 'falling in luv' with my zhongruan. haha... I miss those percussion beats that I used to play on my kulintang (malay xylophone) when I was in Angklung Band. I miss lots of people... all my juniors, my instructor and surprisingly even the PFA(Performing Arts)Department. Felt really touched when I attended ""Arts Alive"" the other time. I just wanna say... you guys really rock to the max. and I'm truly proud to be an ex-senior of AB. Great music! Wonderful showmanship! it's really a tremendous improvement... and I really hope that they will continue to uphold the excellent reputation of AB. Hmn... but I think that there's 1 thing that's lacking in AB... and that's unity. Some of the members lack the positive attitude... hopefully under the guidance of the next batch of leaders... we will be able to see some improvements. Honestly, I do not have much faith in the next batch of leaders... so let time prove their capabilities. Perhaps, when one is appointed a leadership position... that person will learn to mature gradually and eventually is able to handle all the responsibilities in hand.  Hmn... I've lots of expectations for the next batch of AB leaders. Perhaps it's due to my perfectionist nature again, that may give others some pressure at times. hahahahaha!~  Okay... that's all...hope that I'll feel much better tomorrow... or else... *_*"
LB1DE6M,female,17,"hmn... HoRoscOpes. How many of you believe in it? well, personally I think such stuffs can be quite subjective but after reading all those books about character analysis and all about the horoscope 'Cancer' (Crab! crab!) I think it's quite accurate in my case... the predictions on a daily or weekly basis are quite true too~ This is scary man... I wonder how do these ppl read each other's minds or to even foresee the future.  Received an e-mail regarding such horoscopes... and here it is:   CANCER WOMAN    When she is in love, she will act both ways. First, Shy and polite trembling  to be near you. Second, Attach to you like glue and trying to be with you  all the times. She will try to go home with you after work, or have every  lunch with you. It is O.K. if you like her too, but if is is not the case,  you will feel very uncomfortable.   She hates to be talked about or gossiped by someone else. If she knows she  will be very hurt. In nature she is a shy type, except she has been  influenced by some other Zodiac. She is not a brave or daring type, so if  you like her then you better be the one who start first. She will not accept  her true feeling, so if you like her you better tell her first.   She is like a musical note always change in tunes, so one minute she can be  funny and cheerful, and one minute she can be sad and depress. Other people  may think of her as ""Over-acting"", or ""Over-reacting"".   When she is depress, she will go out and look for things to make it up. She  loves money, and thinks of having ""Money"" as ""happy"", not as ""God"". She will  not look down at you if you do not have a lot of money, but she will help  you make money, save money. She is not an extravagant person and sometimes  will tell you not to buy her expensive and not useful gift.   She is the type who enjoy a long and quiet walk. Cancer woman also  influenced by the ""moon"", so under the moon light she will be fascinating  woman.   She has a constant fear for many things. She fear of not being smart enough,  not pretty enough. Even if she is not fat, she will not be satisfy. Assuring  her of her look would help, because she can change mood 4 times a day.   She is not stingy, but you will not surprise if you see she collecting old  or broken junks. She sees that everything are useful to her. She will find a  way to re-use it again some day. She is not a jealous type,but possessive.   The best part of her is that she will sacrifice everything for her love one  with no limit. Don't leave her in times of troubles, she will never forget  it. She is not a weak type, even she looks like one, Example if you argue  with her, she might cry her heart out. Once you left, she will wipe her  tears and start clean up her apartment normally.   She is a very careful mother and will look after her kids every steps of the  way. If she is a mother of your children, you are at ease, but if she is  your mother in law, you are in pain. Not to worry, this type of mother in  law will not let her own daughter being an ""Old mate"".   She could be moody and argue with you in many little things like many women,  but she always wait and want to take care of you. If you argue with her and  disappear a few days, she will be waiting for you, but not for long O.K.  This kind of testing is risky, try not to do it.   The Cancer woman need 2 things to be happy which are ""Work"" and ""Love"". She  can be live in a dusty house, but she can not live in that same house with  no Love.    Haha~ after reading this results... maybe I would like to take back my words at the start of this blog. erm.. guess this character analysis is only 60-70% true. Anyway that's all then... tata"
LB1DE6M,female,17,"Hmn... read this if you wanna understand me better. I think this analysis is accurate to a certain extent... haha~ why on Earth will there be such a close resemblance? Anyway... yup... A tyipical cancerian here. Yeah~ canCer Rox!                Ruby (Cancer)         You like:  Spending  time  at  home, family get togethers, making pizza with mates and listening   to                 soothing  music. You dislike:  Violent movies, people who shout at u and being let down by those u love.  You're best at:  Making  people  feel good about themselves, listening to their problems and  being  a trustworthy, loyal  mate.  Deep down:  U  want  peace  more  than!  anything.  Home  life is important to u and if  there's domestic squabbling, u become deeply depressed.  Your career:  Become a musician, journalist, interior decorator or chef.  Fashion:  Cancerians  tend  to  have  simple tastes: loose-fitting clothes in natural  fabrics and dark colours. You prefer unfussy outfits, but that doesn't mean  you   don't   like   to   glam  it  up  when  you're  in  the  right  mood.  As a mate:  U are a gentle person who may be quite possessive of ur friends. If someone  lets  u  down,  u  may  brood in ur room for days. But when u feel safe 'n'  secure, ur generous personality takes over and mates get spoilt rotten.  As a girlfriend:  U  are  sensitive  and  moody, so u like lots of cuddles and kisses to keep  balanced  &  chirpy.  Quite  secretive,  u are shy to reveal ur feelings at  first but warm up once ur boyf gets to know u better.  If your boyf's a Cancer:  Tread  carefully,  girl. He's got an ultra-so! ft heart that breaks easily.  Not  one  for wild flings, he enjoys spe nding time alone with u & may even  be a bit clingy when u wanna go off on ur own for a bit."
8ZVKKWF,female,23,I miss him.  I was with him today when he was put to sleep.  Poor fool.  He will be missed.....
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"I have all three.  I am NOT a happy camper.  And on top of it I have three visible cavities.  I am so blah.  Things are better on everything else.  I saw  Danielle  this weekend.  It was good, but I didn't feel good.  We just chilled all weekend.  Work is so hectic.   Joe  and his boss are coming on Thursday or Friday.  Of all weeks for me to get sick.  The store really isn't in bad shape.  I just need to fix some parts of my NR wall and deal with PV overstock.  Sorry this entry is so short, but I am sickly and am going to play a game of Literati with  Danielle  and chill for the rest of the night.  If I feel compelled, I might write something else."
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"The concert was fucking amazing! I enjoyed all of the craziness that was going on. Every performance was great, but Linkin Park was the best by far. When they played ""Breaking the Habit"", I acutually started to cry at the beginning. I am so glad that I have my LP tattoo. I am going to post some pics from the concert. The first one is of me just having fun and it came out really good so I didn't want you guys to miss out on it. The second one was of me and  Julie  being silly. Then it's me again in the bathroom being all blee. Finally is a pic of  Chester  from LP I took when he was on the huge screen above us. Enjoy!"
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"I don't know.  It sounded like a good title.  I am so retardedly confused about so many things.  Well, not confused because I know what I want, but frustrated might be a better word.  Life is always so difficult for me.  I suppose it's because I make it that way, but still.  I have to be at work at four.  Yea.  I am still in bed and it's three.  LOL.  And Mondays suck.  There is the schedule to do and then the new release wall.  I just have to make room for Butterfly Effect, but I need a whole bay to do so.  Sorry.  Video store talk.  I will take a pic of my handiwork tonight and put it here.  It is so amazing how I can get eight empty rows out of a full wall of movies.  I finally beat  Tiara  at Literati, but then later on in the night she kicked my ass again.  What's going on?!?!?!?!  Well, lemme go because I don't want to be late for work.  And come on people.  Comment on my entries!"
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"I recently updated my site. I decided to go with this format. I hope all of you like it. It's a lot brighter. So, what's new with all of you guys? I am doing ok. I have been working a lot lately. Me and  Danielle  really haven't seen each other a lot because of her car situation and my work situation. I feel bad for that. I will have to admit that  Tiara  has been mentally distracting me. I need to stop that. I have a girlfriend who loves me very much and I need to remember that. I don't know. I am all bajang. I took next weekend off to get away from things. I don't know what I am going to do yet, but I will figure it out. I am at work right now typing this, so sorry for the choppiness and shortness of this entry.  Well, that is it for now. Visit the forums and post something. TTFN......"
8ZVKKWF,female,23,I plan to be writing a lot these next few weeks.  I have decided to get it all out at the expense of you guys.  Sit back and enjoy!!
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"My laptop isn't feeling too well.  I spilled hot wax all over the keyboard and the LCD the other day.  I did a pretty good job of getting it off the screen, but the keyboard is a mess.  So I went on eBay and ordered myself a replacement keyboard for 30 bucks.  I was going to go through Dell, but I figured why pay like well over 100 bucks for something I can do in minutes.  When I get the keyboard in, I will take pics of me replacing it.  This is the first time I am actually opening up my laptop to work on it.  Yipes!  I have always been more comfortable with desktop pc's, but I think it's about time I get more involved with my pride and joy.  That's it for now.  I need to go shower and pack.  I am staying over  Julie's  house tonight because the Linkin Park concert is tomorrow.  Yay!"
8ZVKKWF,female,23,Work sucks.  I feel as though I am just going through the motions.  Everything is so overwhelming.  I have literally hundreds of previously viewed movies staring me in the face with no place to put them.       See what I mean!   Joe  and his boss are coming on the 12th.  I better get this store in shape.  I am sitting here right now playing Literati with  Julie .  I could be organizing the library.  Nahhhhhhh.  Some other time.
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"September 11th happens. The country is in turmoil. George W. is reading ""My Pet Goat"" with a bunch of school children as 3000 people lose their lives. This is the same man who, in his first year in office, was on vacation 42% of the time. He as well as all of us were blindsided by 09.11.01. Two days later on the 13th, Osama's family is allowed to leave the country when all other flights were grounded. Days, weeks, months pass. Osama goes without detection. You think we would have had the prescence of mind to interview his family members before we let them knowingly leave the country? We decide to look for ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" in Iraq. We order Iraq to disarm or we will go to war. They don't comply because they have no WMD. We declare war on Iraq to help them ""rebuild their government"". As much as Saddam was doing bad things to his people, what gives us the authority to deem what is a ""proper government""? I don't know if any of you have been paying attention, but our government is n't running very well right now. Exorbinant health care costs, taxes through the roof, and we are fighting a war we shouldn't have even started in the first place.   We've lost more soldiers after the war ended then while the war was going on. Saddam has been captured. No ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" have been found. We basically made a fool of ourselves, of our country for a pissing contest. Nobody cares if we are the richest, most powerful country on the world. In my opinion, we are rich with ignorance and power hungry. Why can't we be like Iceland? They don't even have an army. They don't need one. We recently turned over Saddam to his country so they can prosecute him. I feel bad for the man kinda. We pinned the 09.11.01 attacks on him indirectly. The american people were happy to have something, some shread of ""revenge"" on the Middle East. Our real war should have been with Afghanistan for harboring a terrorist. Osama bin Laden. Who we have yet to find."
8ZVKKWF,female,23,"That explains my first customer of my shift today. I usually don't get annoyed by mentally retarded or challenged people, but this one took the cake.  Oh my holy hell.  This is an actual sentence she said over and over again:  ""Canyoulookupamovieforme? Iaminarushandtimeistickingticktockticktock.""  She like didn't breathe when she talked and mushed everything together and had a lisp.  It was baddddd.  And  Andre  and  Jim  totally abandoned me at the front, so I had no choice but to help her.  She bought Brady Bunch in the White House.  Go figure.  Anyway, I had a cruddy day.  I slept til 2:45 and then showered and went right to work.  My back has been hurting so bad lately.  I routinely take 3 Advil at a time.  That can't be good.  When I get paid, I am going to go to the doctor.  Yay!   Madonna's  song ""Frozen"" is on.  I love love love that song.  I always wanted to make love to it.  Heh.  Speaking of making love, I need to do that soon."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Have achieved my goal of previous post of not starting entry with ""well"".  Well well, you might say.  Discovered today that the room where I type this stuff out has a heater in the wall.  Only discovered this because lovely boyfriend turned it on and I happened to stand near it while opening a door.  That, and the room was suspiciously warmer.  Invention for the day: Machine that beats all warmth related information out of residents of abodes (a manual solution is just not workable)."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Sufficient stuff has happened to me that I feel it worth while expending some effort on expounding it to the universe at large.  I am currently typing one handed... long story.   Key thing:   I have a new man... Benji.  He is marvellous.  I am REALLY happy.  People see us and go on about how happy we are.  Some people just want to generally vomit at us.  We take this as a compliment.   Where I am:   Benji's parent's farm in South Gippsland.  The lead up to Christmas involved a lot of trying to stay cool during the day (by undertaking such tasks as going to Chadstone and buying presents or sitting in air conditioning and wrapping presents) and seeing Benji in the evenings.  We had two singing performances and have visited people.  Christmas was pretty good.  Went to my parents place the Sunday before Christmas and had lunch and presents with them.  It was all good, they only tormented me a little.  Christmas Day was spent at the farm, opening presents and being dinked around the farm on a 200cc dirt bike.  I got to jump off to open gates a lot.  Once I was closing the gate and I felt this massive thump in my chest and I jumped and screamed.  I now know what 5000 volts of electric fence feels like.  I was okay, more surprised than hurt.  I also got the tour of some of the closer local thingies to look at, such as Mt Best and Agnes Falls.  Mt Best had Benji's old primary school, I got to see the roof he fell off...  Boxing Day was eventful.  Ha.  Benji and I went down to Turtons Creek and saw a water fall there.  It was excellent and lots of fun to drive around some steep, curvy, gravelly roads.  The creek was very pretty and the surrounding ferns were really cool.  I particularly liked the way that the water reflected to create dappled light underneath the ferns.  Then we went on the bike again to Scanels Road and saw the new bridge, which had replaced the previous evil bike eating bridge of doom.  The we went up to the end of the road and saw the ruins of this old house.  Then back to the farm.  I had expressed an interest in learning to ride the motorcycle, so we went up to one of the back paddocks and I managed to ride around for a bit.  The first time I took off I was completely out of control with Benji running behind yelling ""Clutch!  Clutch!""  But I didn't come off and I went round a few more times.  Benji said that it was important to jump clear if the bike fell.  It was much easier once I got it into second gear, because the accelerator is much less sensitive, and I was beginning to feel pretty good about the whole thing.  I drove around a few times with Benji standing in the middle.  I was stopped and straddling the bike and Benji wanted me to turn it around so I could ride around the circle the other way.  But I turned it too hard and the bike became too heavy for me.  Suddenly the weight of the bike is too much and it's falling.  I remember wrenching at the handle trying to stop it from falling and I remember Benji running towards me yelling ""Jump!"".  I jumped.  I managed to fallmostly clear of the bike.  It had fallen left, and my left foot was still under the bike when Benji got to me.  He was worried I'd crushed my foot or ankle, however, it had been under the seat and it was fine.  I pulled it out from under the bike.  Benji turned it off and stood it up.  The bike was fine.  I was concerned about my right knee, which had fallen across the bike.  But it is okay, though a bit tender with some bruising.  My left wrist hurt a bit too.  We sat in the paddock for a bit, while we both recovered from a bit of shock and I said my knee and wrist hurt.  We decided I couldn't dink back on the bike, so I walked back while Benji took the bike back.  After a while my wrist really started to hurt and we went inside and I wrapped it in frozen peas while we played Simpson Trivia.  A few hours later and my wrist still hurt a lot.  Benji and I went to the hospital at Foster (which I was last at for Liam's knee when he got a massive hunk of wood in it at the prom) and waited for a while to see a doctor.  I was feeling drowsy and kind of nauseous by this point, so I was lying on a bed talking a bunch of crap.  The doctor saw me and didn't think it was fractured.  He wanted to strap it and see it on Monday.  But I had planned on going camping the next day with Jeans, so he said he'd better x-ray it.  Had to wait for the x-ray machine to warm up (another 20 minutes) then he nuked me twice.  I had to put my arm out at two angles that really hurt and hold still.  Had a look at the x-rays and everything looked okay, except that the end of the outer bone of my arm was fractured.  So, 6 weeks of plaster over summer, here I am.  Joy and rapture.  Had to call Jeanie and tell her I wasn't going camping.  Haven't told my parents yet.  Then yesterday we had to go into Foster to have the cast checked, but it was too loose.  So he sawed off the first one and put the second one on (the cast's understudy - it was recast).   Hung around Foster for a bit before and after being recast.  Got a fridge magnet.  Saw the other back part of the farm and in the evening we went and watched the sun set while seeing Toora and the prom.  Most excellent, though rather cold.  I can only wear one of the tops I bought as all the others have sleeves that are too tight for my arm.  So I was wrapped in two jackets.  That evening we watched some videos (  Black Books , way funny) but my hand was really aching and tingling.  The cast was too tight.  So Benji's dad got some pruning scissors and cut at the back of my hand (which hurt a bit) to free up some space.  I can now wriggle my fingers a bit.  This morning it was back to the hospital to watch the fish in the waiting room and to have the plaster checked.  Different doctor this morning and he was pretty happy with things.  I have to see a doctor on Friday, just so they can confirm everything's okay.  Today Benji took me driving up to Mt Fatigue which also was a lovely view.  My hair has gone skanky and washing is a chore.  I can't do up my shoe laces or open things.  Gripping is still painful, so I am almost completely only using one hand.  Though this morning I managed to hold my tooth brush with my left hand while applying tooth paste.  Invention for the day: Instant bone mending machine - based on ray technology.  (Or water proof casts, which ever's easier.)"
6DJZE6K,female,26,"David's internet isn''t working today, so once again this blog is being written from Mel, Ben and Sascha's.  And a big thanks and Hi to them all.   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 3.   Today I got up about 8:45.  Hannah and I went into uni together and I parked at the Blackburn Rd car park.  Took the shuttle bus into uni.  I have never taken the shuttle bus before so this was a new experience for me.  It is still raining and the bus was crowded.  The driver was a popular guy today.  Spent most of today in the library.  Read this article on Lucretius by Kenney, (called  Lucretius ) which was about Lucretius and his context, poetry and stuff.  It was quite interesting, but not terribly philosophical.  I am trying to focus more on the philosophy of Lucretius than Epicurean doctrine or Lucretian use of hexameter.  (Woo hoo)  Also found Bailey's famous commentary on Lucretius text.  He goes through the tricky bits in Latin and commets on Lucretian intent.  However, as (I think) Nussbaum points out, he doesn't give the section on love and sex much attention.  But that's okay, more for the rest of us.  Borrowed a book on Latin.  It is by the same person who wrote the Ancient Greek one I used in first year.  Re-read one of the chapters from Annas today, after photocopying it.  I got a lot more out of reading it a second time round, I could underline the text and write bits.  I have even drawn up a matrix with beliefs/desires categorised with Natural vs Empty and Necessary vs Non-Necessary desires.  Then I have asked in big letters, ""Where does Lobster go?"".  It makes sense for me, anyway.  It was good - I feel much better about what's going on now.  Went back to corner and discussed the use of the definate article with our resident lingust, Olav.  (For aliens, (or non-grammarists) the definite article in English is ""the"" (as opposed to the indefinate article ""a"") and in other languages is things like ""el"" ""los"" ""das"" etc.  Latin doesn't have one.)  Then went home, had toasted sandwhiches, found out which episode of the Simpsons was on (Lisa needs braces, dental plan) and went to Dave's to find out the net wasn't working.  So, that was my day.  Classes tomorrow and meeting with supervisor.  David so kindly printed out my bibliography, so I will have something to show Dirk when I meet with him.  Invention for the day: Pocket size devise that allows the zapping of students to the other side of campus if they are on the computer you want to use and only bumming on the net and not doing any real work.... or even if they are."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Sunday.   Failed to go to church.  I still have a cold and feel snuffly and achy.  Benji and I went to Borders at Chadstone the Fashion Capital.  I used the gift vouchers I got for my birthday to buy a book.  Thanks to David, Kellie, Greg and Felicity.  Sat around and watched a DVD in the afternoon and then had a snooze.  Went to Polly's place and watched Eurovision.  We all wanted the Ukraines to win, so it was pretty neat when they did.  All the yucky ballads were punished really badly.  Norway came last with 3 votes, compared to the Ukraine who had 280 votes.  Some of the countries just voted for their neighbours, like Latvia, but the commentator made a joke out of it.   Semester 1, Week 11, Day 1.   Now usually I spend my blog post on Day 1 of any given week panicing about how many weeks there are to go.  I think I'm just too sick to be bothered.  My thesis is good enough.  I will send it out to be proof read after I see Dirk this afternoon.  I am happy enough with it.  Any more work on it will just break it.  Animal Minds essay has a plan.  I just need to fill in the blanks and have a neat idea or two.  Value Theory essay is unstarted.  But I know I am going to write on Korsgaard and Normativity, so that's all good.  I really just need to chill out, kick this cold and do some work.  There's nothing particularly hard about it.  So, that all being said:  2 weeks until Thesis is due. 4 weeks until my essays are due.  Easy.  Invention for the day: Instant Kill-a-Cold."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Once again at Mel, Sascha and Ben's place.   Semester 2, Week 3, Day 5.   Last day of week three.  Have I done any work?  It doesn't seem like it.  If I'd done work, I'd be closer to the end of my work, but it seems like I'm still just as far away.  I have to write to summary of the key papers in my area.  That means I have to read (more than once) the key papers in my area, plus write something about them....  At least it doesn't have to be critical!  Last night I re-read Fiona's paper and made more notes.  Today I read:  2.5 articles of Soble's  Philosophy of Sex and Love . About 15 pages of Nussbaum (again) Some Lucretius of various bits, including an entire re-read of what he wrote on love.  But, is this enough?  I take comfort in what I learnt yesterday.  My fellow students (who are finishing this semester) have their first draught of their thesis due in three weeks.  At least two of them haven't started writing it yet.  But I would freak out if I was in that scenario.  One of the guys wrote his two essays in the last four days of semester.  That just seems wrong.  I couldn't right 9000 decent words in four days, no matter how much pre-reading I have done.  Went to uni and photocopied the Nussbaum paper, so I can scribble on it.  I feel more accomplished in an article when it has bits underlined and I've scibbled comments in the margin.  I don't think it's right to mark up library books.    Invention for the day:  Library books you can mark up, but as they pop through the Return Shute, all the markings disappear.  Yeah!"
6DJZE6K,female,26,Thesis Update.   My thesis is due today.  But I handed it in ages ago!!!!  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  Ha.
6DJZE6K,female,26,"If you type Ainsley into google, this web page is number 6.  I don't know if anyone else I know could say that about their name and blog.  Smugness.  (As you can see, I'm writing my thesis.)"
6DJZE6K,female,26,"I bought a new bike!  Just a quick blog before I go ride my old bike....   Exam Period, Second Thursday.   Woke up at 12:30am and couldn't get back to sleep.  Slept from about 2am-5am.  I think I may have a problem....  Got up early.  Went to parents place.  Dad and I spent two hours at Invanhoe Cycles looking at bikes.  I bought one.  (I recommend Ivanhoe Cycles to anyone.  The lady there is REALLY great, she knows her stuff (she has four bikes) and knows girly things about bikes.  The fellas are also great.  Other people who have bought from Ivanhoe include my mum and David Golding and they'd probably say great things about them too.)  It's a Giant XtC3 with Hayes brakes, Shimano gears (lots and lots, possibly 27 (at least 24)) with a Deora (?) changy thing.  I.e. much better than current bike, bigger, lighter and better gears and brakes.  Got a touring saddle for the Great Vic Bike Ride.   Also got a pump (I know, I didn't have one before, I'm so ashamed), some drink bottles and holders and a new head thingy (bit what connects the frame to the handle bars, it needed to be shorted and higher for me.)  Because of the disk brakes, Dad has to teach me how to get it in and out of the car (have to take wheel off), so we put it in Dad's X-Trail and I will pick it up tomorrow.  Invention for the day: Giant XtC3s in purple.  Mine's red."
6DJZE6K,female,26,"Number of hands used to type this: 1. Number of brain cells used to type this: ?   Yesterday   Went to uni, got a Value Theory (one of my two corse work subjects) reading by Velleman.  Managed to get there (despite the persistant crush of over enthusiastic first years) before lunch and the department office closing.  Met up with Hannah and she gave me a lift to the physio.  The physio seemed pretty happy with my hand.  She said it will take some time.  Being able to lean on my hand could takes moths.  Goody.  Singing was okay.  We sang  For the Longest Time .  My part (alto) has several words.  Not only to we get to sing Woh, but also Oo, Ah and Boom.  Sounds a bit like sex really.  We also began work on  Who Wants to Live Forever  which we haven't done since 1996.  Scary.   Semester 1, Week 1, Day 3.   Read:  Velleman, J. David, 'Well-Being and Time',  The Possibilty of Practical Reason , Oxford University Press, 2000.  Brief summary:  Velleman thinks that the amount of well being experienced in moments (moment well-being) cannot bear any relationship to the amount of well-being experienced as a life.  No classes until tomorrow.  Hah!  Those 4 contact hours on a Thursday are a real strain.  Invention for the day: Some kind of slapping device that finds and slaps people who think that randomly initialising part of their name is a good thing.  Prime candidates should be C. S. Lewis, C. I. Lewis (philosopher, wrote  An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation ), J. K. Rowling, J. R. R. Tolkien, Micheal J. Fox and George Bush Senior (for having a son and then naming his son after him)."

04D7121,female,23,"gosh, i am blogging at two places. i feel bad for neglecting one or the other because both xanga and blogger seem to have a great, hardworking and responsive staff. therefore, i am doing both. this is exactly what happens when i watch a ballgame. i start out rooting for one team, and as soon as there is a disparity in the scores, i start feeling sorry for the underdog and start cheering for that one instead. this ambivalence is also reflected in my lack of partisanship of any particular political party. (how's that for alliteration?) i think i will end up voting republican for governor and democrat for president. (go dean!) both of which, of course, will most likely lose anyway.  i would like to make it a tentative goal to run in the LA marathon in may. i don't care about my finish time, my goal is just to finish the race, and live to tell about it.  when my self-imposed bank account freeze is over (lord give me strength), the first thing i'm gonna do is go to b&n to buy the following books: -she's not there by jenny boylan -benjamin franklin -kavalier and clay -  there were some other books i wanted. can't remember right now. will revise later."

04D7121,female,23,"hey guys, i need some input about xbox and ps2. which one do you prefer and why (ie, size, controllers, attachments, dvd, games, price, etc)?  i've fallen prey to flu season. it started with an innocuous headache, but by the end of turkey day, it felt like a golfball had been stuffed halfway down my throat.   my mom left for china yesterday. it was so sweet. the first thing my dad said when he got back from dropping her off at the airport was, ""i feel so sad. the house is not the same."" i'm sad too. my mom's absence means only one thing...cleaning up the dog poop! auggggh, why can't dogs just bury their own poop?? they bury everything else! anyway, looking forward to three weeks of hangtime with the pops a la lakers games, chicken in a can, and disposable utensils. :)  being bedridden for the past couple of days caused me to miss a friend's housewarming party, going to the airport with my mom, and the last chance to take advantage of my friend's 50% employee discount at arden b. here's what i was able to do instead:   1. finish watching the first season of 24. resulting stress and trauma did nothing to alleviate flu symptoms. can't wait to start the west wing.  2.watch Together with the 'rents before my mom left. mom cried, dad laughed, i just kept thinking how great it is that i can understand chinese.  3. finish Barman by alex wellen. a must-read for lawyer wannabe's and imminent bar victims. started reading ""girlfriends talk about men."" so it's not hemmingway or anything, but it sure as heck clarified a lotta things. some excerpts:  ""During the course of our interviews, we saw women falling into two general categories: women who felt a strong need for attachment and those who wanted more freedom. The more we listened, the more we realized that, generally speaking, the women who were more likely to want closeness were those who felt, to a smaller or larger degree, that they did not get the attention they needed from their fathers....While our observations were not scientific, we have noticed that many of the women we interviewed who had never married were those who described one or both of their parents are 'intrusive' or 'controlling.'"" (try smothered...but in a good way.)  ""Most women admit that they've dated 'bad boys' and 'good guys,' and both have their appeal and their own set of problems. Some women we talked to help us identify the types and the sets problems you might expect from either type. Ursula said that bad boys are different from grown-up men, that they are 'more attentive but prefer form over substance.' The bad boys were attentive to being romantic and doing sweet things, so there was never any complaint about the 'trimmings.' Whether they were good people or whether I trusted them was the question. A bad boy is the one you want to pick up at the bar. High on charism, low on commitment."" (oh so true...but oh so irresistible...)   ""Yes, it's true. Women are perverse. We like trouble...someone who doesn't need us is a lot less scary than someone who needs us too much."" (amen.)  ""Some couples fall apart when the Switch occurs. The Switch is a phase described by Dr. Sills. she writes, ""The most common victim of The Switch is the woman. She was being actively pursued when, suddenly, he turns off just when she turns on...Today, however, sex roles in courtship are much more flexible. It is therefore increasingly likely that she may pursue him until she captures his interest and then --- whammo --- she pulls a Switch and he is the victim."" (hahaha...""whammo!"" well, at least now i have a name for it...)  ""Perhaps we all dream of catchng the eye of a gorgeous man across the room and, as violins play in the background, watching him move toward us as our heart says 'this is the one.' (um no...what decade are we in??) In talking to women, we found that some of the most successful marriages began, not with love at first sight, but with a resounding ""yuck!""....As the previous stories show, we frequently have a negative reaction to men who end up making a good match for us. The important factor is that we had a reaction, and someone caught our attention."" (okay, personally, i'm not a believer of this whole fungus theory either, but it's been known to happen i guess...)  okay, i'm going back to bed. my head is out to explode, probably because of this junk that i've been filling it with. just thought i'd spread it around. please answer my question about the game consoles. thanks y'all."

(the one on the right)  i also ate really bad sushi on sunday. after that, i was pretty sure i'd be abstaining from fish for a good couple of years.  for dinner tonight, my mom baked salmon with sweet onions drowning in XO sauce. that marked the end of my fish fast. i now have food coma on top of heat stroke. goodbye."

There were no paranoid security guards, no North Korean refugees protesting outside nothing. I just walked right in and they didn't even want to see my ID or anything. Nobody spoke any English so I just wrote down different impressions and took pictures at the event. Took a good picture of the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs giving his speach in front of portraits of the ""Divine Leaders"" of his country. Yesterday was a good day. It was the printing day, so we were busy. It was also my birthday.  Our paper was done on time and then out of nowhere a cake and a bottle of vodka appeared. Very nice. Everytime a bottle was empty someone was sent out to get a new one, so we stayed at the office for quite a while."

Derfor skulle jeg allerede ud af doeren klokken syv, hvilket er meget tidligt efter mongolske forhold. Da jeg skulle ud af min lejlighed, som ligger paa tredje sal, kunne jeg maerke at der var en forhindring foran min doer. Da de er ved at renovere nabolejligheden, og derfor hele tiden bringer saekke med affald op og ned, troede jeg foerst at det var en af disse saekke, som de snedigt havde placeret foran min doer. Derfor lagde jeg lidt vaegt i for at aabne doeren. Da doeren var lidt paa klem, stak jeg hovedet ud for at se hvad det var. Jeg maa erkende at jeg fik et chock da jeg saa at det var en dreng paa fem til seks aar, som laa og sov op af min doer. Normalt er hoveddoeren ud til gaarden laast om natten, men det er aabenbart ikke sket i gaar. Jeg var noedt til at skubbe doeren helt op for at kunne komme ud. Han gled bare med doerens bevaegelse uden at vaagne. Paa et tidspunkt kunne jeg se hans oejne aabne sig en lille smule, for derefter bare at lukke i igen. Paa reposet under mit, laa to lidt aeldre drenge og sov. Gad vide om man nogensinde vaenner sig til et saadant syn?"

Three kiloes too heavy to be precise. Oh well, after another hour of re-arranging, I'm all set. 20 kiloes. Not an ounce more and not an ounce less. The internet was down most of the day, so I've had no excuse not to pack and organize things. Oh yeah, I still owe the nice Mr. Bolor from the Mongolian embassy in Berlin 70 euros.

Feel really bad about it because I had to persuade him for around half an hour to pay the courier for me in advance. He probably thinks I've cheated him! Anyway - it was a bit stupid of me to send cash, but that's the way he wanted it. And for you conspiracy-theorists out there among you, who have already decided that Mr. Bolor has actually received the money, but want me to send more, I can only say: Even though the German Post is incompetent, they have been able to see that the letter has not been delivered to the embassy, so there you have it........ unless they are in on it!!!

764TLFV,male,26,"The answer to the question in my former post is obviously no. I did not get any work done. I did however have a very surreal day, but also a very interesting and fun one. Before going out to the farm I et up with a couple of people for lunch. Chinese food and beer... Lovely. So we were mildly buzzed by the time we were supposed to go to the farm. Our driver was Christian, a young German man who has his own business here. He picked us up in his landcruiser and off we went. There were eight of us in the car. Eight people, that is. There was also one wolf! Not dog... Wolf! Honestly. Christian owns a wolf. It's still a cub and he's had it for three months. 45 minutes after departing eight people and a wolf reached the farm. We had brought a keg of beer, so the spirits were high. At the farm we got the grand tour and the we had a barbeque. Plenty of meat and beer. Then unfortunately someone got the bright idea to bring out the vodka (was it me? I can't remember) In Mongolia you drink vodka from a small bowl which is then passed around. That bowl got passed around a lot! So by then we were all - apert from the driver - quite drunk. So what did the drunk people think of next? Shooting, obviously. Werner (the German farmer) had an old Czhek military rifle, so now it was time to hit a few rounds. We had a small competition. We had to hit a metal plate. And the results were as follows. Soeren (A total of four years in the Danish Armt) zero points. Horst (Five years in the French foreign legion) zero points. Stefan (Construction worker who had never fired a rifle before and were more drunk than the rest of us) one point. Not my finest hour! Arrived back home quite late. By then I smelled like farm, smoke, gunpowder, beer, vodka and wolf (as the cub had been sitting on my lap all the way home). The next morning it took me about 15 minutes to wash the smell off me... And I only had cold water!!! Served me right!"

DNCWQGX,male,27,"I'm back home in good ol' St. Louis, the Gateway City, home of the Cardinals, Blues, Rams, Imo's Pizza, toasted ravioli, Chuck Berry, Nelly, and the bowling hall of fame.  I made it in my usual ~13 hour trip from Chapel Hill.  It was one of the smoother roadtrips because I didn't run into too much traffic, even though I almost got rear-ended by two cars during a sudden stop in St. Louis due to a car accident by the Galleria.  Notes from the road:  North Carolina:  What a beautiful state.  I dare to call it the most beautiful state not on the west coast.  West of Winston-Salem, I saw a really tall flagpole by I-40 with an American flag and a Confederate flag right below it.  Sometimes I forget that I live in the South since Chapel Hill and most of the Triangle doesn't really feel like the South.  I made to Asheville in a little over 3 hours, which is a new record (it usually takes about 4 hours).  I love Asheville.  It's probably the only other place in North Carolina I'd consider living in.  Tennessee:  Also a pretty state to drive through, mostly.  But it's rednecks and Christian-right galore.  Lots of large cities (and medium-size cities) are ugly to drive through, but Knoxville takes the cake.  What a fucking dump.  It's like the world's largest truckstop.  I have lots of mix cds to listen to, and they really helped me tolerate this drive.  And mix cds are the best on roadtrips, although I have to say that the Fucking Champs' IV is an awesome roadtrip album.  I rocked out to it while driving through Nashville.  Kentucky:  Not much going on in this state.  Their car license plates are the pussiest license plates I've ever seen.  It's a picture of a sunrise, and the sun has a fucking smiley face drawn on it.  Jesus, even the queer eye for the straight guy dudes would call that gay.  I listened to a lot of Black Dice and Wolf Eyes through Kentucky, which surprisingly makes for good and soothing roadtrip music when you're by yourself.  As I was about to leave Kentucky for Illinois, I noticed that the miles tracker below the speedometer read 666.  I wonder what if that means anything...  Illinois:  What a shitty state.  The southern tip of Illinois isn't too bad, but when people think of the stereotypical midwest with just flat land and nothing worthwhile to see, I don't understand why Illinois isn't typically included with the likes of Indiana, Kansas, Iowa, etc.  (Leave Missouri out of it...it ain't the best, but it's a hell of a lot better than those states.)  The drive from St. Louis to Chicago doesn't take too long, but it sucks due to how shitty Illinois is.  Fuck that state.  The only two redeeming things I can think of Illinois are Chicago and East St. Louis, the strip club capital of the midwest.  It was a little creepy at times driving through Illinois, due to the rain, and because of the lack of traffic, very little light anywhere.  Plus I was listening to the Swans' Children of God album.  Missouri:  I love rolling into St. Louis from the Illinois side.  First, it's because I'm leaving that dreaded state.  But it's also because I love seeing the St. Louis skyline coming in from the east.  St. Louis doesn't have the most impressive skyline, but the Arch definitely makes it look nice.  I never tire of seeing the city coming in from the east.  As I crossed the Mississippi, I knew I had to come back home gangsta style.  So I switched from the Swans album to Dr. Dre's Chronic 2001.  Word.  Now I'm back home and am relaxed.  I wish I could spend more time here and hang out, but tomorrow I'm heading out to the Windy City to look at apartments."

U6TEGNU,male,34,"Racism as a problem is nothing new; it can likely be traced to the times immemorial. We mostly notice it when we find ourselves being the target of racists; that is also not particularly surprising as we the humans always possess a certain measure of self-centeredness. But what goes around comes around, and whatever behaviour you consider morally wrong is wrong universally, regardless of whether it is your group that is practicing that behaviour, or some other group. The same goes for racism.  Racists tend to seek legitimacy by claiming that they are spiritually best endowed members of their ethnic or religious group. They tend to view those who do not hold their radical views as apostates. Quite in agreement with that pattern of behaviour, Jewish racists claim to be the truest Jews ever to tread the Earth. On a number of occasions, people of that mold informed me that they consider me not to be a real Jew. I disagree with that assessment, and I also consider racism incompatible with true morality. Sometimes extreme expressions of bigotry and prejudice make me feel that I must no longer remain silent, and thus I feel that I have to make my views known. Later in this piece I am going to address the radical publication whose existence ended up being a catalyst in motivating me to write this piece. It is just that I believe that silence in the face of extremism can sometimes be viewed as acquiescence,- and on the part of myself and hopefully many others, there is no acquiescence here.  I have recently come across the name of Rabbi Saadya Grama who had authored a Hebrew book titled ""Romemut Yisrael Ufarashat Hagalut"" (one possible translation: ""The Grandeur of Israel and the Issue of Exile""). Among other things the book establishes the idea of Jewish superiority. The book was written in Hebrew and proved controversial enough for the only bookstore in Brooklyn, New York that was for a brief period of time selling it to pull it off the shelf. One would be correct to say that I did not put in as much effort as I could have in obtaining the book and checking it out for myself. I certainly did not; I have reason to believe, however, that that book is not something which I would want to spend much effort locating, or much money subsidizing by way of purchase. So I am relying on third-party translations and quotes in forming my opinion of this book.  In its December 19, 2003 issue ""Forward"" published an  urlLink article  about the book titled ""Charedi Rabbis Rush To Disavow Anti-Gentile Book"". This, along with other ""Forward"" articles, is the source I am using for my analysis of Rabbi Grama's book. It is worth noting that some of the Rabbis denouncing the book had earlier endorsed it. Thus it appears incorrect to claim that this book can be dismissed as an opinion of one individual, not supported by anybody of import.  However, Rabbi Grama and his book is just a side-show to the topic that I would like to address: the Jewish racism. Just like any other form of racism, it takes many forms and varies in its intensity as well as in its choice of a target. Based on what I get to see the prevalent strain is the idea of superiority of Jews and inferiority of others, derisively referred to as ""goyim"". Rabbi Grama, whose racism is radical and uncommon in its intensity, formulates it thusly:   The difference between the people of Israel and the nations of the world is an essential one. The Jew by his source and in his very essence is entirely good. The goy, by his source and in his very essence is completely evil. This is not simply a matter of religious distinction, but rather of two completely different species. This is clearly a justification for a racist view of the world. While few Jews would openly make this kind of a racist statement, a certain percentage of them appear to follow this sort of notion in some way or other. Some believe that Jews in Diaspora should avoid certain jobs that are not sufficiently prestigious. Some think that Jews should only abide by Jewish morals and customs, disregarding moral norms and customs of other societies even if they happen to reside in those societies. Some radicals believe that Jewish interests simply override any moral obligations towards the non-Jews. Racism is a complex phenomena; so is Jewish racism, and the list of its manifestations could be continued.  It would certainly be wrong to say that racism is a universal affliction amongst the Jews; I would think that it is only a minority that shares this sort of worldview. Jews as a people know as well as anybody what the toll of racism can be. That may be why Jews have been so active in many liberation movements, such as the civil rights struggle of the Black Americans in the US. And Jews have every right to fight the new wave of anti-Semitism today.  However, to bolster the morality of our demand that racism directed against us be stopped, we must first stop racism emanating from us. To that end, I would like to unequivocally state that Rabbi Grama does not speak in my name. I hope the majority of other Jews share this perception.  Unfortunately, the racist minority receives a tacit support of a silent majority that is too complacent to denounce them. Or, in some cases, that majority may be too selfish to denounce them, thinking that bigots promoting Jews are ""good bigots"". This perception is myopic and wrong, both from a moral perspective and from a pragmatic one. Jewish racism must be denounced,- and neither the tragic Jewish historical experience, nor the rabid racism of Israel's enemies can be used as an excuse.  As extremist minorities often are, the one proclaiming Jewish superiority as the cornerstone of its political agenda is very active politically and has enough influence to affect millions of people, both Jews and non-Jews. Those who view Arabs as subhumans certainly help perpetuate oppression of the Palestinians in the occupied territories and lack of equal rights for the Israeli Arab citizens. To the cohorts of those racists belong such prominent Israelis as the late  urlLink Rabbi Meir Kahane , late  urlLink Rehavam Zeevi  and  urlLink Rabbi Ovadia Yosef . It only appears logical, following their racist assumptions, to conclude that the suffering of the lower race (Arabs) should not be viewed as a priority problem and can be allowed to continue indefinitely so long as the master race (Jews) is not affected. That sort of sentiment is also heard at times from ordinary Jews, Israeli and otherwise, who, when pondering the various aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only concern themselves with the well-being of Jews without giving any thought as to what the other side's circumstances are.  Even if a racist ideology can win a momentary success at any given point, it corrupts the society that succumbs to bigotry and is likely to cause more suffering and misery in the future. Those who seek to humiliate others always humiliate themselves in the process. It also helps to keep in mind that victims tend to have a long memory and they are likely to try to get their payback when an opportunity presents itself. That is yet more reason for the Jews to fight racism, not espouse it.  We as Jews must send a clear message to the world that we are ready and willing to build ties with other ethnic and religious groups based upon equality and respect. That we are ready to shoulder the same responsibilities as those shouldered by others. That whether in Israel or in Diaspora we demand no special rights or privilleges not afforded to others, nor accept special responsibilities not shared by others; nor do we view ourselves superior to non-Jews. Not only is defeating the racism emanating from the Jews our collective moral duty,- it is also an integral part of the struggle against anti-Semitism."

U6TEGNU,male,34,"In a few months we as a nation are facing an important decision: who will lead us for the next four years. There are many issues associated with that choice, and clearly it is but impossible to address them all.  However, there are many things an election accomplishes. One of them, an important one, is the evaluation of the job the incumbent administration has done.  The current administration has come to the office with a set of promises, of which many seemed to have remained just that: promises. One could argue, and correctly so, that the world has changed dramatically since the year 2000. However, the world has not seen anything unheard of before.  The massive terror attacks of 9/11 were a really terrifying event, but the world has seen many a battle where more lives were lost. And the world, especially the so-called Third World, experiences such privation on the regular basis that 9/11 simply pales in comparison. And that, I believe, is part of context in which 9/11 ought to be viewed.  However, the Bush administration presented these events as the ""end of the world as we know"" and did a very thorough job of trying to convince Americans that this should also be the end of America as we know it. The almost immediate reaction of the government was to claim that it did not have sufficient powers to properly address the issue of terrorism, and thus needed a massive extension of its powers. It also claimed that the separation of powers,- which happens to be one of the key elements of our social order as envisioned by the Founding Fathers,- was a major obstacle in the fight against terrorism.  The Defense Department and the White House claimed the right to indefinitely detain those they consider to be a threat. The Patriot Act allowed the executive branch to take numerous types of action unsupervised by the courts. The idea behind that was that the government has our best interest in mind, and we should just let it proceed unimpeded.  However, that is not what this country is about. It was not founded to be about comfort or security,- it was founded to be about liberty and responsibility. And there is a price to pay for that,- and many have paid this price, and many more will. Those who think that is just a piece of empty sloganeering should read urlLink  this list  and see for themselves.  I am not a hard-core Libertarian, nor do I have a formal affiliation with any other party or movement. I simply believe that a piece-meal transformation of our society into something entirely alien to what it was meant to be is not a way to go. And I believe that this is a reason to vote against Bush in November. It may not accomplish much, but it is at least a way to send a message out that attempts to facilitate such a transformation are going to lead to defeat at the polls. And to those who think that's all I can muster,- no, I can think of many other reasons to vote against Bush, but I am not going to address them here.  I believe that in the final run, adhering to the principles set forth in the Constitution will prove the best course of action in all regards, including security. And we must not sacrifice our long-term vision for some short-term gains, real or perceived."

U6TEGNU,male,34,"Voter disenfranchisement is nothing new. If it weren't for it we would likely have a different man for President now. However, according to Katrina vanden Heuvel, we as a society are far from having the issue addressed, or even making an honest attempt to do so.  In her  urlLink article on the subject , vanden Heuvel describes many attempts by various parties to make it so that those from whom they have little reason to expect any favors do not get to cast their vote.  ...in St. Louis, Missouri, election officials told voter registration workers that of 30,000 applications submitted, two-thirds had been rejected. No reasons were given... While we are on the subject, I would like to say that personally I think in this day and age the very idea of voter registration sounds archaic. Given the technology available, any citizen must be allowed to vote anywhere. Once the data is entered for the citizen, a verification process should be run to ensure the validity of the data. Once that process completes, he or she must be presented with the proper voting form conforming with the local election requirements. All of that can be done electronically, with the proper electronic replication as well as a paper printout. Sounds incredible? Not so, if you compare it with the systems we use everyday, for instance, the ones that allow us to receive instant credit at a bank or to make purchases with a credit card. However, for now we do have the voter registration procedure in place, so lets get back to the issues as they are.  I believe the first major step towards insuring the fairness in the vote count would be creation of a public election oversight commission empowered to oversee everything related to elections,- from the registration procedures to the software code for the systems involved in the election process. The local and federal election oversight bodies are part of their respective governments, and that makes them suspect. Personally, I think all the technology involved must be open source, wherever possible, to avoid tampering by commercial interests.  Those are just a few thoughts that come to mind. Clearly, someone with more election management experience than yours truly can come up with many more good ideas. They need to be discussed and implemented as when found applicable. For, as vanden Heuvel correctly states,  At  stake, isn't simply our choice for America's next president, but also our faith in  our nation's democracy."
U6TEGNU,male,34,"In his  urlLink article  Anthony Gregory makes a number of important points. I certainly agree with him that if suicide bombings of buses or the events of 9/11 are to be considered acts of political terrorism, so must the intentional mass killings of civilians in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Drezden, Leningrad, Rotterdam and many other places whose civilian populations were likewise intentionally eviscerated by various warring parties during the World War II.  It certainly reflects favorably on the US as a society that eventually Americans showed themselves capable of taking a critical view on those events of which they were part such as nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is also true that in today's wars the US attempts to minimize civilian casualties. However, it is worth noting that that is mostly possible due to advances in technologies which have taken military precision to a whole new level.  But I think we need to acknowledge that terrorism is not something that just came out of the blue and plunged us into the ""age of terror"" on 9/11/2001. Terrorism is a military tactic, it has been used in many wars,- including by us in some of the wars we have fought."

GO7CF9V,male,26,"Another George Bush blunder.  And this comes from someone who has seen firsthand the jobs in question.  GB wants to give  urlLink illegal alien workers legitimacy .  But one of his arguments in support of his plan is actually much stronger an argument that this is indeed wrong.   “Illegal entry across our borders makes more difficult the urgent task of securing the homeland,” he said.   But wouldn't the act of ENCOURAGING more of them to come be multiplying the problem?  The only encouraging part: the intent to  provide incentives to entice those workers to go back to their homelands.

P6LH97X,male,24,I succumbed to this worldwide craze and started a blog. Ya mama.
P6LH97X,male,24,"Nothing reminds me of my teenage blues as well as  urlLink gusGus ' ""Polydistortion"".    Oh . When i think of Polydistortion, i think of being seventeen. Being deep in love with a girl that hated me (and very depressed about that), starting to understand that life is harder than i ever expected ... and having very few CD's. With the little money i had i didn't buy East 17, Metallica and Tupac like everyone i knew, but Bjork, Tricky, dEUS, Sonic Youth and gusGus. The soundtrack of losing innocence really. Nothing better to say about that than  ""Oh...""    Gun . Back in 1997 i used to be very miserable and disaffected and for me Polydistortion was a wonderful soundtrack for almost killing myself. I really thank God (and Beck) that i didn't. I thank God that i blew my mind with gusGus' music and not my head. How can music be so depressing and so uplifting at the same time is a mystery which can probably be understood only by Icelanders, but luckily it can be enjoyed by anyone. Oh + Gun = one of the best openings for an album, ever.   Believe .  On the water we talk se-ri-ous-ly . Yep, it seems that for an Icelander, nothing is easier and more natural than having a serious conversation with Jesus while walking on water. Whatever is the message of that song, it is encapsulated so well, that ""Laconic"" is not the word. Even ""Effective/Passive/Aggressive"" is far from describing it right.   Polyesterday .  They tried to rape her, she couldn't reach higher . With gusGus, it all comes back to the sheer simplicity -- the simpler the song is, the better. Sparse and minimal is the formula for genius. These songs aim straight at the heart and they hit perfectly.   Barry . It is a song about love. Homosexual, probably. Or maybe i didn't get it right at all. What i am sure of is that it is a song about someone who is very unlike me, at least on the outside. Or vice versa.   Cold Breath '79 . This song, along with Barry, is the one that i find hardest to identify with on Polydistortion, which doesn't mean that i don't love immensely. I'm a guy and Cold Breath has something inherently female in it; some things we just don't understand.   Why?  Everyone likes this one. I don't know why, no pun intended. It's one of the tracks i like least; the context makes it loveable, though. The best thing about ""Why?"" is the  ""Longing for you baby, mm-mm-mm""  line, which can't leave anyone indifferent.   Remembrance . It's a little too long, but one just needs to find a good time to listen to the album. Probably the saddest song i know. And it's nasty. So nasty. It is in the feeling -- i have very little idea what the lyrics are about.   Is Jesus Your Pal?  Oh, the heavy cultural burden: i was born Jewish, and this deprives me of the possibility of being pals with Jesus. The good thing about it is that i don't need to  call out his name when my conscious is shivering . Something taught me that coping with it by myself is the right way; maybe it was my culture and maybe it was this beatiful song.   Purple . One of the best and the most outstanding tracks on the album. The artists are not ashamed for a second to put a happy major-scale trance tune at the end of one of the saddest albums ever. Whatever were the reasons to putting it there, the result is so wonderful, that this song changed me -- suddenly i moved from hating trance into respecting it, along with absolutely any other kind of music. Up to that time i was solely a rocker; ""Purple"" triumphantly broke that.   Polybackwards . The little hidden track that could. Nothing but weird synths with no melody or beat, but who needs them? It made me feel good about buying an electronic album - ""ha-ha-ha, i'm listening to super-cool arty music, it's not just trance."" How innocent was i."
P6LH97X,male,24,"Could it be?  I listened to the whole of  urlLink R.E.M.'s ""Reveal"" . It wasn't easy. I tried a few times before, but didn't succeed. I haven't decided yet if it simply sucks, or good but hard to get used to. I should keep in mind that ""Automatic FTP"" wasn't so easy for me to get used to either.  I'll take the raaaaaaaaaaaaain. The really good song here. But Beachball starts off with a pretty disgusting electrobeat. Then it becomes a faux-latin thing, that  urlLink Yo La Tengo  would do so much better. I should try some 80's R.E.M.  The reason i'm listening to it is that i'm home alone. Alone, that is at home with my parents and not with my sweetheart Hadar, with whom i spend almost all my weekends and holidays. On the rare occasions that it happens i am somewhat glad at first for the opportunity to spend some time alone listening to all those CD's i buy, and ""scratching my balls"", but soon realize how much i miss her. I swear to God (see  urlLink Gen 2:24 ) that i'm not getting this touchy-feely because she might read this."

I ordered  urlLink Beginner's Lithuanian , which is supposed to be a revised version of the book  urlLink my professor  uses.  Yesterday evening on my way to Jerusalem i read the Latin textbook.

P6LH97X,male,24,"We're going to Coachella today! Wow. But first, a little more San Diego. So hard to leave this wonderful place. So we drove a little around La Jolla, took some pictures at the beautiful LDS temple (which is, as i mentioned earlier, even more impressive during the twilight) and then the truly greatest American experience -- dinner at the world-famous  urlLink Hooters ! Our server (which is an American word for ""waiter"") was Starley, who is apparently Jewish! Horrors! She even went to Kotel on her Bat-Mitzvah! Oh my. After a little stroll on the beach, we headed to the desert.  But no, not yet -- California is a very diverse place, so we had some mountains and forests on the way. So it was similar to Beyt-Oren again, but much longer and with a genius improvement called ""Turnouts"" -- short side lanes for slow traffic. Slow traffic is me, of course, and i let all those American guys to pass me. I still don't why were they in such a hurry.  And finally the desert. Huge, endless, with quite a lot of RV's going to and fro. Some half-abandoned ""restaurants"" on the way. A very long drive there, and though monotonous, not boring, and even quite beautiful.  Now Coachella is the name of the valley and also of a small town there. Nothing special about the town, except the Polo field. It's special, because first of all, all the other ""fields"" we've seen there were golf places, and there are a lot of them. Secondly, the Coachella Music and Arts Festival took place there. We've spotted the place from afar -- there were huge lights pointing at the sky (like in a Soviet war movie, i thought.) We arrived at the campsite right on time, just a few minutes before a very long line formed there. The tent was a good surprise -- it was my first time building it, and it was a breeze. The box said that it is for four people, but it had place only for two, or as El'ad said: ""It is fine for two people, but four? -  urlLink Sprats !""

Carly, Jackie, Landon, and Ky were on Ky's boat or sumthin'...so Brittany, Kyle, and myself were invited in by Carly's parents*who are really nice.....for canadians* 2.)  We were sitting in there doorway talking to Carly on the phone, and her parents invited us in, and since it's just a force of habit for me, I had already taken off my shoes, and was standing in the doorway with my socks on....it was funny. 3.)  We went downstairs and her mom was trying to tell us that we could make ourselves at home, but I had already hooked up Carly's Gamecube and was playing The Hobbit....which is a pretty kool game by the way.  A few minutes later, Conny just walked in the back door, and came in and sat down, and they all played a game called Labrynth...it looked pretty kool. 4.)

KENNY!!!!  I almost forgot Kenny, he was there too. 6.)  The people who left came back and I eventually stopped playing The Hobbit....and started playin' FFCC with other people.  *For those of you who are video gamely challenged, FFCC stands for Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles...it's an awesome game for the Nintendo Gamecube, where you use a Gameboy Advance as a controller.*  We all made new characters, and of course mine was named SpEnSe.

Me and Kyle made plans to leave and go eat, which we did...but, on the way back to Carly's...I was runnin' and I stepped on a stick...which went through my shoe and stabbed my foot.....man that hurt, but Tom got it out with a knife.... 9.)  We went and got DQ and went to my house and got all black clothes for CTF, and then went back...and no one was there, they were already playin' CTF in this big field with a bunch of trees by her house. 10.)  This is getting really long. XD 11.)  We *Kyle and I* headed toward the game and we heard voices, so we headed toward them, and I told Kyle to be as sneaky as possible...I was sneaky..sumone walked right past me and didn't even notice...and just as I was gettin' close to the group..I heard ""Get Off My Property!""  Then these people with flashlights started comin' down this nearby hill...so everyone started runnin' towards me...and no one really saw....and eventually we all were runnin' back for Carly's. 12.)

DBTRABH,male,26,"At work we were just notified that once the contract ends we would be put immediatly into OEM (hardware) and customer service skills...  Basically the severence that we were offered because we were being laid off is horseshit.  The whole point of that fucking package was so that we could have a comfort zone while we looked for new work.  How exactly im going to look for work while working a full fucking shift all day.  I really hate how theyve jerked us all around for the last three years.  just totally lying, and fucking us around.   -- Jax, signing off."
DBTRABH,male,26,"well, ive finally talked my father into going Atkins.  He had been doing the dieticion ""eat a leaf of lettuce"" diet for the last little bit.  We started to diet at the exact same time...  he on his dietician enabled horror diet, and me on atkins.   Well, he was immensly skeptical about it from the begining.  he read the book, and he wasnt sure. he watched the tv shows, and wasnt sure.  he saw me lose about 50pds in a month and a half. he started to consider it  I baught a bunch of wal mart clothes (they dont make clothes to fit us usually) he started to consider it more.  Finally I talked him into it.  Hes already starting to feel the effects.  Hes in induction, and had his first energy burst the other day.   He cleaned the yard out for the spring, loaded the junk onto his truck, and hauled it away.  somethinghe would not have done a week ago.  Which is excellent.  Hes also had a positive result by way of his gas production (which had always been a problem)  Once he sees how positive this is for him it will totally win him over.  -- This is jax, signing off."
DBTRABH,male,26,"Ok, have any of you heard of this Matrix thing?  No, im not talking Neo, the one.  Im talking about that new anti terrorist sorting device...  How close to thoughcrime is some of this stuff?  they had a component that would analyze the data and affix a terrorist quotiant to each person.  Now this would of course scan for non criminal activity, and criminal activity alike.  So theoretically if you read mein kampf (for isntance) and had a parking ticket on the same block as a KKK meeting place it would raise your TQ (terrorist quotiant)  All of this info would be put togeather and you would be judged.    Now, in theory this ability has been removed, but seriously, when ever has a genie been put back into a bottle?  Now this type of technology while beinign in and of itself. randomly coalating data, all of it thats already had, and putting it togeather.   The thing that makes me want to go out and buy a tinfoil hat is simple.  It fosters a paranoid reaction  ""should i read this book?  how would it look on my report?""   It doesnt actively prevent freedom, it just makes you less likely to act in a free manner.  If i had to come up with an anaology, id call it pre emptive mcarhtyism.  The all seeing eye affixing a value and measurement on the individuals daily activies...  ""Sir!  you are a communist!""  ""I have not now, nor have I ever been a communist!""  ""Ahh, but we have records that state otherwise, here on october fourth, your car was given a parking ticket two blocks from communist headquarters, and here, you obtained a russian english dictionary at the library, and here you were viewing the webblog of a notorious communist! and that sir, that marks you in our books!""  So knowing that everything we said, everything we did, no matter how random would be watched, sifted through and compared to ""patterns"" and your eventual behavior was judged, regardless of your activities or even actual affiliates.  Well what typeof atmosphere does that promote?  You may be free to read books shunned by the governmen, or visit websites unpopular with the particular regime.  But when you do each and every time its marked down against you, and so many hits, and bam, your out of the ballgame.  -- Jax, signing off."
DBTRABH,male,26,"Well, there are some new, almost confirmed rumours floating around work today.   First, a friend of a friend is coming back from pregnancy leave,  she is due to start training (OEM) this monday at 11am...  this is from her lips.  Secondly a supervisor told an agent that around thursday or wednesday of this week an email would go to the floor telling of the status of future contract...  Thirdly A source that shall remain nameless.. the workers in the building have been begging for two weeks alone in the building to replace the decrepit elevators...  Fourthly... a local political figure said in ""confidence"" that stream employees had a 99% chance of having a small amount of time off as opposed to the paid lovefest we were expecting.  its also an election year...  what does this lead to?  Well, the OEM option, coupled with the Sirius radio option comes to mind.  not one, but two full contracts... sigh.  Im not sure how i would deal with that.  I hope that i get a contract where i can make some bonus again,  i need the dollarz.  but there is definatly something coming down the pipeline.   I hope we get some time off.  -- Jax, signing off."

DBTRABH,male,26,"Ok, so apparently the Indian people have elected Sonia Ghandi and her party into power.  Revitalizing the Ghandi ""dynasty""  This is accomplished by her alliance with the Indian Communist party...  Of course this crashed the Indian economy, Foreign investors who have recently been flocking to India because of its financial reforms and general cheap labour force are leaving India in droves, taking their money with them.  India had the largest stock market crash in its history.  so, we have a communist backed Congress party is close to ruling India, how communist do you think they can get India?  whats this going to do with all the recent hullabaloo about outsourcing?  How much does this effect the probability of an Indo Pakistani nuclear war in the near future?"
DBTRABH,male,26,"Well, ok.  I guess my stats are good to have on this.  Im Male, 26 years old (born nov 15 1977) I am 5'11' and i weight somewhere around 433pds. This is a bit excessive, i know, thats why the atkins.   I'm going to take this diet and get down to a svelt 200pds of lean mean fucking machine!  ;-)  so far I have actually lost around abouts 30 pds on Atkins, I started out at 456 or 460... and in the month or so since ive been on atkins I've lost quite a bit.    Some of the effects of Atkins on me:  I've lost 30 pds, about 10 pds a week.  I'm not hungry.  I have much more energy  My heart doesnt pound in my ears when i climb stairs  My penis has grown an inch longer (I thought this was a myth, but apparently for every 30 pds you lose you gain an inch in length)  I dont get depressed like i was getting   daily highs and lows in energy dont happen, i dont get the midday sleepies anymore  I dont get the headaches I used to get  my mind isnt as cloudy in the morning as it used to be.  Now, there are some ""negative"" effects...  Im always thirsty  (dont mind it)  My bowels arent as regular as they were, but im not constipated.  there are eating limits (i want to drink ice cold pepsi.)  te cravings were bad at first, the sugar, and the caffeine were bad for the first week or so.  Luckily I had been trying to cut caffeine out of my diet for the last few months anyway (it makes me jittery) so when i cut cold turkey at the begining of the diet it wasnt too big a shock to the system.  the sweets however were another thing.  i was a big baker, i loved making and eating sweets. the cravings for sweet went away (not all the way) the first week.  so there we have it, my experience thus far.  thus endeth the lesson."
DBTRABH,male,26,"Well, I saw the trailer for farnheit 911...  and all i can say is astounding.  I cannot wait to see the full film.  it looks like it makes a lot of connections. which the average man on the street isnt aware of.  its going to be good when this stuff hits the pop culture fan.  -- Jax, signing off."
DBTRABH,male,26,"Ok, so, i weighed in, and I'm now 423pds!  thats a further ten pounds!  exellent!  also I was trying on walmart pants (previously far too small for me to wear) and they were fitting!  woo hoo, im like a former porn star, dropping X's from my title every day!"

DAMMIT! how can you love some one too much???? *sigh* i dunno but it's one of the reasons he split with me that and the fact ""he can't handle me"" and ""he wishes he'd never split up with sophie"" dammit y do i have to still like him.  jimmy today did the sweetest thing for his girlfriend he baught her this amazing necklace and it looks like it cost him like a few hundred and it's as a thank you for helping him out through loads of things, it's like major awwwwwwwwwww factor.  oh and Fitz has made me part of his hareem, so i'm now his bitch hehehe! and i had a great conversation with him about underwear and how stockings and suspenders rule. which they so do."

DS9R9BI,female,16,"was at nathan's over friday and hannah and amba and rachel are all round tonight everything would be all cool but i can't seem to think happy like.  i found out from a random prerson that i met today who knew kel and doz that nathan had just been taken to hospital, because he had been beaten up by townies, who had broken his nose and some other shit. i didn't know what to think or say or feel, i just had to pretty much power walk with amba to sunrise to see hannah, on whom i burst into tears on, she's never seen me cry ever, coz i dont cry easily. i just want him to be ok. i saw the reflection of the flashing lights of the ambulance in the shops windows, i could have been there for him, and i wasn't, when he needed me most i didnt know and i wanst there for him. right now i just wish i was with him in the hospital, if he's still there, i think he is kirsty his brother's fiance rang me from nathan's mobile to tell me what had happened, they said they'd keep me posted, but i just wish i could be by his side holding his hand, i just wish i was with him. *sighs* i can't explain it it's too hard i can't put how i feel into words and i feel speechless because i just can't talk or know what to say or do. it's like i'm powerless and mute and numb. numb with fear for him and if he'll be ok and all that and i can't express this it's too hard and i don't know how to, i could be here for forever if i tried i feel so many different emotions yet i cant say what.  i saw jonny for like the first time in ages today, man i've missed him, he's great. :) ok so i've changed the subject but i can't talk about it, it's too much. oo ooo oo i got a ticket to see HIM when they come to norwich!!!!!!!

DS9R9BI,female,16,"ok so i watched that dvd on friday, my empire records dvd, and am now listening to the sound track wich aint as groovy as the movie coz they ran outta money and couldnt put all the cool tunes on the sound track from the movie.  Nathan and me seem to be all cool now and i think the friends thing is settling in, which, even though i want him back, is probably for the best, because i know i am not what he wants. we just both need to let go, which i know he has done so i just need to catch up and let go too. then we can both be happy :)  today was so god damned boring, and i feel super fat coz i did fuck all, except sit and watch tv, god i'm sad, but it was mainly good tv it was the world rally chamionships, so like rally car races and shit it's so bloody kewl :D  i got a surprise text of jordan today which was nice but took bloody ages to send a reply back coz in my step dad's house i have fuck all signal, but he just wanted to know if i had a girls mobile number but i didnt know who he was talking about so i felt a bit crap not being able to help him.

DS9R9BI,female,16,"yeah i'm tired of being alone now. i know it's the whole re-bound effect taking hold of me but i just want him back, i miss him so god damned much, everything reminds me about him, and us and how it all used to be. :( life now officially sucks, i'm alone and i ript my kewl long goth skirt today and i love that skirt, and all around me there seem to be happy couples.   and on top of that today it was the first time i had seen ryan today since the last time which would have been a month today, and he was ok with me last time i saw him but today he was being a complete and utter cunt and so mean come on like cant me and him ever be friends? from the looks of things i'd take it as a no. damn him! why do i care? ok so i know why i care but i wish i didnt care. pretty much ever one of the old crew at work dont like me i think, coz they are all so similar and all one of the popular crew people from the old skewl days i reckon and i just dont fit in with them, it's like i'm out of my league. lol, ironic really, that i say i'm out of my league with work, ryan is all i look forward to at work coz we usually get on and have a laugh but looks like him and hannah O. are all buddies at work now, i hate being excluded, dammit, no one told me they were all going out on the town when i got back.   ok so i am having a major bitch session at work but i'm allowed to ok, coz i hate life and it just keeps getting worse because on top of all that ross is like majorly like hugging and touching my ars all the time, yeah ok i get it he fancies me but i dont want him like that, i just want him as a friend, i dont want any kind of a relationship right now. like the title of today's entry says in the lyrics of white snake ""here i go again on my own, like a twister i was born to walk alone"" i guess i'm just ment to live my life alone, because how could anyone deal with some one like me, i'm just too much hassle.  ok i really should stop comming back to this after i have written it, this is the second update of tonight.  i spoke to nathan again tonight, he didnt mean that i love him too much, he ment i was too possessive or how ever you spell that word. but then he tells me he was a retard for splitting with me but b4 telling me i'm possesive he tells me he thought i looked really pretty when i saw him on thursday. Kat just went, ""oh my god what a total mind fuck"" yeah it has fucked up my head again, but i just told him if he didnt like me hugging him so much he should have just said get off, and i would have. but i know he doesnt want me back no matter how many times he says he should have never split with me, i wish he never had split with me, we should have just talked this through. god i miss him so much. he said he'd forgotten it was saturday coz the only way he knew it was saturday was by walking me to his bus stop in the morning but now he doesnt do that.  i feel so alone in the world now, all my friends are trying so hard to lift me back up onto my feet but i just can't feel happy.they are saying everything that i say to them when they are in my position, but now i know it just doesnt make a difference, i still feel shitty and alone, and i'm not over him. because i still want him back, and i still want him, so much. i tell myself i need to let go, because that's what he has done, and i try to do that, during the day when i dont think about him, when i push all this to the back of my mind, i'm fine, but then it's now when it all comes out and i just feel like if i wasn't here it'd be so much better for him and for me. i'd be over all of this, and he wouldnt keep getting confused when i talk to him. coz i know he'd get over it if i died, not get over the break up but get over my death.  listening to the sound track from the film The Piano makes me think abouth what it'd b like to drown, is it like suffocating but with water? i have a weird imagination, i see my death. do you want to know what i see?  no i didnt think you'd want so.  look what i just did again its supposed to be the HIM song that i am, seems to be true after what i found out tonight,this is what it said:  urlLink     Which HIM song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla"
DS9R9BI,female,16,"ok note to self never tell boyfriend you are wearing your ex's trousers, he'll think you've been up to no good but will then tell u he trusts you more than that. so if u do have a guilty conscience u feel like shite but if you have a clean one you feel all special inside, like you are truely loved.  today was, well , an experience. watched the crow and beetlegeuse round daniel's house and yes i am wearing his trousers but for a very good reason *pokes the stomach* if you are a girl you'll understand, if you are a boy we hope you understand and just move on, which is what i'm gonna do. anyways watched the dvd's coz french tape and blank tape got mangled up in tape deck when tried to copy french tape to a blank *yawns* it was a messy day but as usual i'll pull through it all, talked to daniel about the day and we r all cool, not that there was a problem.  brandon lee is tres sexual! hehe it had to be said! am currently re finding my love of Aqualung and the cute lil music he makes. so if there are anymore references to his lyrics in my blog that's why. :)  i may add more to this later as have now run out of things to say and the night is still young and i could get enourmously (dont care that that is spelt wrong i can't spell it any ways) bored and write some more random stuffs."

HVCLCGB,male,17,"Boxing Day.   Today is usually an Excruciatingly, Horrendously, Supercalifriagilically painful day for some. Usually because they now reside within this fragile thing, a ""lifestyle"" if i were bold enough to term it one; called normalcy.   Today is the day in which millions over the globe pack their Christmas Trees into their old, crumpled, torn, soft and mildewed, brown cardboard boxes. The time when they pack the fun and festivities away and return to life as they know it. (Mind you, I'm not one to use the word ""life"" likely, just as various other aquaintences of mine do with thier attempt to start a conversation disguised as the common and i mean COMMON enqiry of, ""So Tim, how's Life"".) Screw that. I'll probablly write about that tomorrow. So anyway, It's symbolism.  Ironic too due to the very fact that the warmth of Christmas is intended to last one through the year, hauling along with it, jargon like good will towards men and the like. Instead, for some, the glow's gone the very next day. Tragic.  Odd. If I had a choice, I'd live Christmas daily. I'd bet I'd live longer too. There's this guy in England who does (as in literally). I saw him on Guiness.   God bless his jolly soul."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Hello. Hope you're doing well. I just sent an Email to my princess. Hope I wasn't too straightforward. Naah... She's a strong girl. Sometimes/most of the time/ all of the time, too strong.  I went for dinner last night with mummy, daddy and mama. We went to this Turkish restaurant where the service was rubbish. I couldn't enjoy my food either coz I was to yolked.  ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************  I don't want to think any more.  I'm glad that I've got pati. She prayed with me over the phone about the little problem I'm facing now. I love her soooo sooo much. I remember I used to cry when I thought about her ""leaving"". I'm very frightened. I don't wanna loose pati.  I'd be really sad if anything happened to Zel's grandma too. Zel loves her a lot and yah, I wouldn't wanna imagine.  Ne'way, I'm going to meet Jireh at 4.20 and then go for Choir at 7. Will send Sarah home after that coz I dun' like the thought of her walking alone at night. Yah... well... will re entry later. Ciao"
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I am happy today. I woke up thinking about what happened yesterday and I figured, that it had to be one of those things. The kind of thing where you JUST DO IT and not look back from there.  Today I scored full marks for my boat license theory test. Then, I spent the rest of the day at IMM with the bands. Oracion was so so but Jireh's was excellent. At least Crimson tide was good. Tight like nobody's business! Today really made me feel a lot better. After all the shit that's been happening.  ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** I walked out of the school almost in tears. Called Madam Ang and told her that I needed to go back to PJ. She arranged it for me and I was asked to make my way down. I explained my predicament to the principal and vice principal of PJ and they were willing to help me. Now what I have to do is get transferred from ACJC to PJC and it'll be set. I'll start again.  Leaving a lot of a great dream behind. You will never know what it feels like till you have an encounter of the first kind. Its hard to describe. I'm reluctant to leave it behind, but I know it's something I have to do now. My chances for leadership there are all but gone. Black marked in a prestigious institution. Man, that sucks man. Should I stay and fight? Is leadership everything? Is it true that the standards of education in ACJC are higher? Or is it up to the individual to determine his own destiny? Leading the AC choir would have been nice, but leading the PJ choir would definitely pose a much greater challenge. And that's what I wanted in the first place, so yeah. Do I really want to be on the same stage as the Pioneer choir? Would it be embarrassing? Will I finish my A levels with a great opportunity cost? These friend are a mere fraction of all the shit in my head now. Haha... Yet I can still find humor in that.  The Best Is Yet To Be."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Hello. I am happy today. I don't know why, it's just one of those things. I think less of her, but still drift into the occasional dream world again. Old habits die hard. She wants me to let go. I'm not going to do that, but I have to accept that she's not mine anymore. She just told me that there's this gay drama teacher who's getting TOO CLOSE to the students, and I feel like beating the shit out of the homo pervert if he touches her. SEE!There I go again.  I think I've got a crush on this girl in my class, but I keep getting held back by the memories. But I think it's like a small crush lah mike. I think I may have too many requirements. That she should be younger than I, that she shouldn't be Indian, that she should be intellectual, that she should be Christian, that she should have a history of commitment or maybe no history at all but believes in commitment. I'm not sure, if that's too much to ask? And after all these requirements have been fulfilled, am I left with no fish in the sea?  Just spoke to my friend. Realized that many makes treat girls as a commodity. ""She's taken"", ""She's mine""... shit...  We won today's debate- THBT pop culture exploits the weak. And we were the opp, which made our case even harder to fight. Muahahaha!!!  Later"
HVCLCGB,male,17,"I will relight my star. There was a wet girl standing in the bus staring at me occasionally as I stared back. Our eyes spoke yet they said nothing. Only last night through my memory did they begin to be heard. What was she saying? Her hair was damp and bunched up with a pin. Fringe fell alongside her face as she glowed.  You were there too, telling me things unspoken. That which I had wished I had not heard. Silence in a distempered head.  Went to Steph's house last night for my first and their second class party. H.U.G.E. Wow.. It takes quite a while to get from one end of the house to the other. Also, she's got a pool and art and her TV room's a freaking cinema! Literally! As in PROJECTOR!!!! AARRGGHHHHH!!! So what? I'm content with what I have. Am I? Are you?  Was walking home and saw a police blockade ahead. They were checking every car. Funny Shat. Then, a walked down the hill and saw many HEAVILY MODIFIED CARS sneaking off in all directions very very quietly. Haha... funny assed shat! No points for guessing what was going on.  I was thinking about a beautiful girl. She likes poetry slams and literature."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Today has to be one of the worst days of my life. I cant talk now. I'm ill and have a sore throat. I cried a lot today. I wanted Zel, but wanting is all I can do now. The situation in ACJC has become irreparable. I will elaborate further in my next entry. Just know this dear reader, that my life is almost at rock bottom."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"A day's got many interesting parts about it. Mine do.  Yesterday, Zhu's classmates and I played with melting chocolate cake and the wall about 7 meters away. My econs teacher mocked honkies to their faces in the lecture and the episode gave me a good laugh. And in the evening, a girl fainted and drama practice was cancelled because of that. But the highlight of my day was definitely after school.  I went back to Fairfield to get tickets to ""The silly little girl and the wise old tree"". Walked towards Miss Luah's class and found her not there. That's not the point. I turned about to go back towards Joe in the canteen and I saw Zel on the corridor. I wasn't as scared as the last time, but I was still very worried. You know the way many thought's zip through your mind when you're shocked. I was calmer, but still worried that she'd give me the ""what the hell are you doing here?"" look.  She saw me too. She smiled. Everything was alright just then. If I had to trade this whole week for those four seconds, I would. She smiled at me! Things are looking up. She actually talks to me civilly now. I'm so so so happy. We sat at the same table with Joe. She laughed and smiled and was happy. I was happy. I miss the way she tries to tell her story whilst she laughs. I miss the way she laughs, the way she smiles. I am thankful that things are picking up slowly. She hasn't fully warmed up to me yet, but I was a dumbass in my decision and I suppose I deserve it.  Did exercise in school. Realised that I can't do pull-ups any more. I don't understand why. So I ran about 9 rounds and did a few push ups instead. I watched the play today. It was pointless, but it was good to see how my juniors there are doing. Gave practical criticism to the teachers and helped them close shop at the end if it all. It's technically and setting-wise impressive, but I think it's more of a literature type play. Will watch it again on Friday.  I say again; if I could trade my week just to see her smile again, I would. It's that important to me."
HVCLCGB,male,17,"Hats off to the girls who did this with me. Willing to do the gig or unwilling to do it. Inhibited or uninhibited. Teachable and held. I love the four of you.   Rhythms of Nature   Gun still smoking when the hoof beats stop 5000 species of birds and no sound Cacophony of insects in the evening and birds at 6am And at 6pm The tenor song of frogs on rainy nights  Rainy nights. Rain The sound of rain on a windowpane The smell of yesterday's showers To know that every puddle is meant to be stepped in The shimmering sound of fairies drying their wings  Their wings. Rustle of leaves, small stirrings, in trees The way flowers bloom and fall to the ground. Blossoms on the grass Stupid weeds that refuse to be pulled out Stupid flowers that die too easily Grass under your shoes  Under your shoes. Footsteps on gravel Steps on leaves Step Step Step Step Step on the Ant! Fading footsteps in a gloomy morning  Morning. Breathing Heartbeat Tribal music, jungle beat Rhythms, drums, music, beat, STOMP!

HVCLCGB,male,17,"Today, there was a freaking Indian Zoo in my living room. I was damn shit pissed sick about my sister bringing those things home when mummy expressedly said not to. THE BLOODY WHOLE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY. Baby, mother, 2 brothers and a sister and there was this short pudgy animal-like thing that kept running about, I think he's got an under devoloped mind or something.. the queer way he acts, man... Looking at me like I'm a pissin' caged attraction. Then, there were these other 2 clowns, a cousin and her boyfriend I think. DYSFUNCT SHIT MAN! I'm damn pissed about her socialising with all of them DAILY.  THIS IS GOING TOO FAR! I think my parents should stick my sister in a home of delinquent girls or something. Today's feat was a new trick that we havn't see our cunning little fox pull. Just adding laurels to the cirriculum vitae I suppose. And mind you reader, that this is the latest incident of shit that's been going on for about 2 weeks now. HELL! SHE'S REVERSING MY FAMILY'S RECOVERY COURSE LAH.  And get this! The eight circus animals which my sister brought over hadn't eaten their dinner and come over for food. WHAT THE DIPSHIT IS THIS PLACE? A FREAKING FAST FOOD JOINT AH? Bloody hell! NOW MY HALL SMELLS OF INDIAN!!! shit lah!  I just stayed in the room and played my guitar, man. I'm beginning to think that it was a mistake to have bought the bass, but what the hell...  Bloody backward people. TRUST ME READER! YOU KNOW SHIT. MY ANGER IS JUSTIFIED.   How would you like your living room to smell of Indian?"
HVCLCGB,male,17,Was going to totally thrash the DASH programme in church today but I decided against it. There are other things and people which happened today too. Not worth mentioning. Will not go for another youth organised event ever again.  Became a bit sad again. Inferiority complex again. Didn't connect as well as I'd hoped with the NJC touch rugger girls. It was like a proving ground for myself. Will try again at CAP. Leon Toh connected damn well though. They literally told him to pack 'emselves up in his suitcase and take them away to Italy with him. I envied him for that. Inferiority complex speaking.  Spoke with Jolyn and Desiree. They're sweethearts. I like 'em.  Good night. (Yes... a short entry...)

And each conversation would end the same way.  He always said, with the utmost sincerity,  that  honesty  is always the best policy.    Always  .         And everytime he said that, I always thought to myself that he's come a long way...         Honesty is the Truth.  And the Truth can't be all that bad, right?       Unless you're a fuckin loser, redneck-wannabe, Chinese-Vietnamese-whateverthehellyouwannabees, how-the-hell-you-became-an-optometrist, Louisiana hoe who sucks uncircumcised dick.....dumbass!

It takes the Earth about 23.25 hours to rotate about its axis, half of those hours are spent in the sunlight and the other half at night.

NC8XISX,female,14,"We were all walking to Subang Parade when we saw Fawwaz pushing Shahrul who was in a trolley.. OMG!! They looked so silly.. and we were all just laughing.. hahha…               Soon.. all the other guys joined them.. I mean seriously.. My brothers don’t do that.. and they’re 11 years old and 1 year old.. I guess it’s a guy thing kot.. then all the girls and Fandi went to MPH first.. whilst the rest playing trolley outside..               Me and Gg were wlaking together to MPH! When we reached there.. I went back to call the guys.. They should really stop it and go jalan-jalan with us all.. or sumthing..               When I met them.. Fawwaz pushed Shahrul next to me and we just walked together..               Since none of the others wanted to go to the computer games store (they rather spend time with books than Harry Potter and The Sims and the rest of the FUN computer games..) so I ajaked Shahrul.. hehhe.. at least ada kawan..               We just hanged out together.. We went to computer games shop.. Then Toys ‘R’ Us.. Then Yamaha..               We went to the studio room where I jam.. I brought in a guitar and borrowed my drums teacher a pair of drums-sticks.. Shahrul asked me to play my song but I chickened out and stopped at the middle of a song I played.. malular.. then I let Shahrul played on the drums for a while.. then I played the drums.. The Reason is the only drums song I can play (and I Will Survive but dah lupa dah!).. so I played that.. played only parts of the song lar.. just playing and singing the chorus (coz that’s the only part I hafal).. and he was just watching me.. Felt kinda weird really.. Main drums with no guitar and stuff.. But then we went out..               We went to MPH! Mom called! Yikes! But nasib baik can stay till 6.30pm.. phew.. Shahrul was suppose to go back at 6 but he just stayed jer.. When we got there.. we just saw people and stuff.. It got bored again.. then Shahrul ajaked me to find headsets.. we found some.. ahahha…               Masa nak pergiu balik to MPH we saw Iman, Isko and Nasriff playing trolleys.. HAHAHAH!!! They were gonna make a movie! OMG! I mean seriously?               When we got to MPH we saw miza-fandi and gg-fawwaz sumwhere.. we just joined them.. but it was almost 6.30pm so we all had to go already.. all 3 pairs of us just parted.. ahhaha.. then I went to say bye to miza.. shahrul to fandi.. then before I left.. Shahrul asked me to be his girlfriend.. hahaha.. I turned jelly.. but said yes after that..               Then we just said bye to each other.. Shameen joined me and we went to meet my dad..               Masa balik.. I was really happy.. I was jumpy and OVERLY-OVERLY perky! Hahahah! But thank god I covered in front of mom.. phew..               When I got back home.. amsa tgh tgk the O.C. I got worried.. I mean.. I was still smiling.. But I got scared.. about what?               I was scared that I would not remember this day.. Its such a FUN FUN FUN day.. but luckily sampai sekarang ingat lagi.. but sekarang is only 2 days after that but still.. haih..

I just wanna waste my batteries.. or that I really do enjoy playing Snakes 2..    serious! I've been playing it like 2/7     24/7 means you do sumthing 24 hours in 7 days!  2/7 means you do sumthing 2 hours in 7 days!    hahahah! thats byk right! hahahha!    ok.. so my score now is like 2987! sikit lagi nak 3000! I guess thats why I've been more addicted to it.. I WANNA BREAK MY RECORD!!    but you know what I have discovered? I've discovered how much the game.. is like life itself! really!    ok! lets play 'kaitkan these things'.. think about it..    the snake - us!  the makanan - our goals in life!  the extra food - what we want!    at the beginning of the game, you start out.. free.. independant! you can go whatever course you want! you can go up and down.. go though the wall! I guess thats how you are when you're a kid! free! you can run around! caring about nothing! coz you know.. that there will always be someone to catch you when you fall.. and all you have to do it! enjoy your life as a kid! collecting your goals in life.. and by that age.. its only to be loved always! and its really easy to get what you want! because there are not many rintangan!    when the snake get longer.. we get older.. as a teenager! our life is harder.. our path is more narrow.. and there are uncertainty about the path that we will choose.. our choices are less.. and we have to jaga where we step into! jaga everything! and by now.. what we want! is not as easy to get as it was when we were little! as a teenager.. not getting what we want just.. sucks! since we're so use to it.. but we have to know.. that getting what we want.. cannot matter to you as much! as what we really have to go for! is our goals!    now you're all grown up.. you have chosen your path.. and all you can do is.. go trhough the same path.. on every round.. because you have to jaga to stay alive.. you're too long by then.. and what you want! you only get it if your lucky! if it comes in near you! but all you have to go for.. is you goals.. its what you have go for! what you live for by then! you'd be doing the same thing.. going through the same path you ahve chosen when you were a teenager.. and stick with it.. coz if you don't.. you'd bid your last goodbye!    when u think you're old enough and can't stay longer.. that your path is getting harder.. and you're getting older (longer), you feel like, you can't fight for more.. and then you'll fall! its     GAME OVER!!    poeple might not agree with me! but this is what I think about life its a challenge! you are who you are.. what you go for is your goals! and you'll only get what you want! when you have the chance! you can't get what you want everytime you wish for it! life is not like that!     Life is just A GAME!    shahrul! this was what I was thinking of when you asked me what I was thinking..    - you go for what you need! and you get what you want when you can!"

I was kinda shocked lar.. like.. you never ever ever EVER called me before.. so I just answered lar kan..    I heard fawwaz's voice.. he sounded so freaked out.. and so.. worried.. he made ME freaked out.. he asked me what I was doing.. I'm like.. apa benda nih? tibe-tiba jer nak tahu what I was doing.. kinda weird.. I thought he nak ajak keluar ngan the others or sumthing.. then.. the unexpected happened.. he told me that iesqo's dad has passed away.. I was menggelabah gila.. I don't know why!

NO MORE GAYUTING MLM-MLM KAY! when I got to the gate.. I saw omar getting into shahrul's car and driving to iesqo's house.. I got out of the car and go talk to fawwaz.. I felt weird to talk to him since mom was there to 'see'.. haih.. then i was just waiting in the car for diana.. thats when mom drove me and diana to the house..    we got there.. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE! I saw shahrul and stuff (but whateverlarkan).. we just waited depan the pintu.. calling practically a lot of poeple! we jsut waited for the body and stuff.. just sitting there with diana.. talking.. iesqo looked sad... but I couldn't tell really coz he was busy running around doing stuff.. when Atikah knew.. I asked her to come and stuff.. and me and diana waited for her at the corner street.. we met sahhrul, shzalee and fawwaz there.. fawwaz left and asked the 2 boys to teman us.. (to protect from the bad guys and the night bugs I suppose..)    we were just waiting there.. talking.. me and diana I mean.. me and shahrul didn't talk.. much.. what do you expect.. shazlee was there.. it seems weird (but after that, shazlee asked me why I was not talking to his brother that night.. hahah.. I felt weird for nothing..) just waiting there for 30 minutes for atikah.. gila kan!    then we went back and the jenazah was there.. we just baca yasin and stuff.. after that.. me and practically all my girl friends just hung out outside.. everyone was there at least.. so thats the best part of the whole thing.. we just stayed untuil 12.00 when dah kena balik... school teh next day and stuff..    I got back.. and was basically sweating.. so I mandi.. and still trying to recover from the shock.. haih.. then it was pretty hard to sleep.. really.. but eventually I did..    the next day...    I have to go now.. my mom dah suruh offline.. I'll update more on the rest of the days later.. and tuesday was the best day.. so tunggu je lar.. ahahah..    - to think.. this long is only Monday.. hahahha! and I've got a lot to tell on tuesday.. sorta!"

NC8XISX,female,14,I watched this show called Table For Two yesterday.. you know the iklan Ponds yang he masukkan his tgn in the popcorn so that he could touch the girl’s hands? Yeah.. theres a whole serie of that.. and this show was really interesting..               The guy was having family problem.. but he wouldn’t wanna tell his girlfriend coz he thinks its personal.. and his girlfriend was all.. worried coz he’s been acting strange and she doesn’t know what..               When she found out.. she was kinda upset but the guy just said sorry and stuff.. and she end up solving the problem for him.. well not exactly solving.. but she told him what he could do and it leads up to something good..               And the guy told the girl to tell her friend the truth about her opinion on the her friend’s art work.. and it lead to something good too..               And then I realized something..               First rule of having a girlfriend/boyfriend :                Telling them stuff you don’t think you can tell other people.. share your problems.. telling them everything.. that’s what having a girlfriend/boyfriend for.. that special someone..               Seeing them being really close gave me a good feeling towards this whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing.. they looked happy.. and just.. it felt special to me.. so that’s it!!               Its just a good feeling..               - Table For Two anyone?
NC8XISX,female,14,"listening to : sway, bic runge mood (I'll make a point to write this in every post) : BORED!!     the only decent thing thats been going on with me is my hair.. it looks nice right now..  since I am obsessed with hair styles.. once again I come up with ways to make my hair looks more.. shaped..     I have side-parted my hair.. and have braided it into little pieces.. you know.. like one of those black people's hair.. the one where you just braid ur whole hair kinda way.. yeah.. my hair is like that rite now.. just messier.. but it looks good.. one of those moments when I kinda agree to the fact that I look.. nice..      Mom said having my hair parted at the side makes me look.. grown up! heylo! whats wrong with that!? I think I look really nice having my hair side-parted.. despite anyone's comment.. ok.. or maybe until after about 20 ""U LOOK UGLY IN THAT HAIR"" comment..     Is it me.. or up till I'm ADDICTED to side parted hairs, a lot of stars have been having that style.. and EMMA! OMG! have you seen her hair! If I was a guy.. I'll definitely fall for her.. (though its not like none other 10 million guys in the whole world doesn't).. AARRGGHH!! but it still looks SOOO DAMN PRETTY!! I just love her hair!!     So right now.. I'm just waiting for another 5 days before I can un-tie these little braidies thats in my head.. and It'll come out like how I want to.. (and by this, I don't mean Alicia Key's).. sorry to her.. but her hair in her single.. You Don't Know My Name.. is just.. revolting! horrible! I think cats look better.. and I don't like cats!     Having my hair braided like this, I've been getting ""WHOA LOOK AT THAT GIRL!"" reactions.. Isn't this normal!? heylo! Its called stylin'! Just today.. My mom invited all my uncles and their lovey-dovey families) to come have dinner at our place.. and all my uncles and aunts gave this.. ""ARE YOU SURE WE DON'T NEED TO RUSH YOU TO THE HOSPITAL"" look! PUH-LEASE!! sweet smile is always a good mask!  - Is it wrong to have FUNKY hair?"
NC8XISX,female,14,"listening to : Diffuser - I Wonder mood : getting less bored.. hey this thing does help!     ok.. this is a story of me and one faithful day I went to ashraf's house.. and his uncle came over..     as usual.. me and my two guyfriends always hang out at ashraf's place at nights for guitar playing.. (as if we don't have enough time with each other masa petang).. I had some work to do that night.. so I had to eat dinner pretty late.. just when I thought I could peacefully eat my tinned can szechuan soup.. shahir had to call me and invite me to go out.. reluctantly.. I agreed.. (even though I have Harry Potter on MTV screen that night..     so i cooked up my soup and brought it over to ashraf's..     the 3 of us just hang there.. me enjoying my soup.. and the guys playing guitar and at the same time feeling disgusted over my icky looking soup.. (which does not look icky by-the-way) .. its only the lighting and the fact that its brownish in colour.. doesn't make it look icky.. well it sure doesn't taste icky though.. thats for sure.. so./ ignore the yappy-doodle and just ate my soup..     10 minutes later.. ashraf's mom pull out of the driveway.. and along came his uncle and form 4 cousin! AAARRRGGGHHH!! I'm in my jammies for god's sake.. the uncle came up to us and was like.. ""class guitar ker?"".. we were all just putting on our sweet smile masks.. and seeing me being the only girl.. and the only one with a spoonfull of soup in my hand.. asked me ""what is that!?"".. I was just smiling and politely saying 'some sort of soup!"" -being nicey and all next-door-girl type.. is hard.. (even though literally, I am the next door girl)- ARRGGHHH!! BITE ME!     so basically we just hung out that nite.. the uncle made a few visits outside.. asking us about guitars and insisting me on playing a P. Ramlee song! heylo! as much as I love to do that.. I just don't know how to.. I barely made it through ""My Immortal"".. and as I return what was left of my szechuan soup dinner.. I came back to ashraf's and hung out with the addition of his cousin.. (cute but nah..........)     and when I thought that was that.. I recently met up with his uncle again.. when he picked us up from tuisyen class.. he had to remind me of the soup! I was just smiling again.. his uncle made attempts to talk to me and made funny jokes.. and being the nice person I am (with grown ups) I laughed.. some of them were pretty funny though..     and 2 days ago.. me, ashraf and shahir went on our daily basis walk around the padang.. and ashraf's mom came to the padang to talk to ashraf.. and who else is better to be there than his 'joke man uncle'.. the minute I saw the uncle.. my feet just went jello.. (do I have to go to them? yeah DUH!) so ashraf's mom made him go have lunch at 6 o'clock.. the mom was insisting on taking us to the mamak store ""asam pedas' near there.. and the uncle.. suggested I take him for a round of SOUP!! ARGH!!!!!!!!!! whats with the uncle and soups.. or in this case.. MY soup.. pirsh!!! weird... I'm starting to get creeped out by this person..     and tonite.. we hung out outside again.. and his uncle and mom came back from buying dinner.. both of them came up to me and commented on my 'WHOA LOOK AT THAT GIRL' hair.. I'm telling you.. Its starting to get to me.. just leave my hair ALONE!! and then.. guess what the uncle did! He invited me to dinner.. WHOA!!! I mean.. what the heck.. its nice and all.. but dinner.. I'm starting to think he's planning on my engagement with ashraf already!! puh-lease.. I sweetly declined and my body just went up to chills when he went in the house.. both of the guys teased that the uncle 'likes' me.. EEWWW!!! the uncle is not bad.. and I don't hate him.. he's not the type yg.. ""HEY LOOK.. TEENGAE GIRL!"" kinda type.. just the fact that.. he's been obsessed with all this.. and my soup! argh!!...  -LEAVE MY SOUP ALONE!!!!!!!!!"
NC8XISX,female,14,"listening to : Maroon 5 - She Will Be Loved mood : I'm not sure current status : shouldn't have had that asam pedas at 10  Finally! I get to write my little pink blog! I have been here for almost 2 hours now. And baru sekarang boleh tulis. Been busy.  Alright. 3 guesses why today's online time wasn't very FUN!  Hahahhaah! I guess Hamiza, Izzati, Shaen, Saufi and Ereeq knows why.  Yeah. Shahrul wasn't in. Hahahahaha! (Call me obsessed)  And again. Not literally OMar.  He makes me happy, its only natural that I want him around me always.  He is my boyfriend anyways.  So who the f***ing cares if anyone calls me Desperate!~  Yeah. Well at least my day turned out FUN FUN FUN!!  NOT ME!!  I hate the word 'desperate' by the way. Just a heads up!  Serious. By the end of the day, I was feeling very happy that when Nasriff said something that kinda hurt my feelings, I was still smiling. Thinking about today! Hahahah.  Have you ever-  When you go to sleep that night just thinking that, when you woke up that day, you never thought your day would turn out to be FUN! with capital F-U-N!  hahaha! Well. Me like that today!  Waking up that day thinking 'another ordinary Friday'  When I was sleeping, at about 6.40, mama waked me up and I'm still drowsy and stuff, and mama nudged me aside on my bed and joined me. She asked me to peluk her. Hahahah.  Whenever Ma and I have these only me and her time, I'd always be scared. Afraid she will get into the whole 'responsibilty' and 'be careful with guys' and 'belajar dulu' speech. And I still remember when I was form 1, before I go inside the Operation Room, she had thi motehr talk with me, asking me who's my crush and all, and I actually opened up to her. It scared me. I mean, what if that happens again? Especially now that she knows about Shahrul and stuff.  Creepy.  So thats why I made up an excuse to bangun coz I DO NOT want mother-daughter talk with her. Especially when my eyes are half closed and my stinky-baru bangun breathe. I'll shoot the info's right out of my mouth like a bullet train.  I know Ad is having a birthday party after school. So I'm like.  OK!  It wasn't actually 'highlighted' in my day but I was happy to join.  I didn't fit in at first. I mean, some of them, 1/2 of them, aren't exactly, my kind of people. BUt I was ok as long as I stick with Diana.  Me and Shahrul went to call his dad to tell 'em about the party and stuff. Got caught by Ustazah again. Hahahah.  Is she like a sign or something? Saying 'tak elok dua orang'. Coz she's everywhere.  When we got back, the whole 'singing' tradition is over. And when I got to class, I know the first thing I've got to get my hands on is the drinks! I'm dead thirsty.  When its cake time for me and Shahrul, apparently, dah habis. Cruel!  So we just had to take bits of our friend's.  The whole 'clan' now have gotten into 'CAKE FIGHT' mode.  They were throwing ices, cakes and water balloons at each other. I know its fun but its just not my group. So I can't just join in and baling cake at Raja.  When the hectic-ness were taken outside, pieces of cake scattered at most parts of the floor, I decided to do something naughty when I saw that very nice piece of chocolate cake {with its icing} on the floor of the class. And its not even smushed yet.  I ajaked Shahrul masuk the class, get a load of the piece of chocolate cake, and threw it at him. HAHAHAH! too bad he ran. I picked what was left of the cake I threw and ran for him again. Finally I got him and asked to put it on his face. And then, it happened.  SHAHRUL GOT CAKED!!  It was hilarious. He tried to get me back but I ran. Then when we got outside, Diana, Shameen and Sonia were going somewhere. Hamiza and Gg wasn't anywhere in sight, and I dind't wanna be there alone, so I joined them. I didn't feel like going up so I just sent Shameen to the gate and washed my cake smushed hand. hahahha!  When I got back, there was only Shahrul that I could possibly hang out with, so we just went jalan-jalan. Around the school. Then we settled in at the seat ket bengkel yang bawah pokok tuh. (ask me where when we're at school nanti)  We were just looking at pictures and just talking. We saw Gg and Fawwaz and they came to us for a while. Then they left. Then Miza and Fandi came, and left us. Hahhaha.  We planned to pergi Syed. So we just snap a few shots of us together and joined Miza and Fandi.  We had fun there. At Syed I mean.  - again the whole Part 2 thing.."

KAFTLPZ,female,25,"During the modern era, ""story"" as a form of communication was minimized as compared to ""report,"" ""essay,"" ""argument,"" and ""documentation."" Intelligent people seemed to assume that if you wanted to entertain, then tell a story, but if you wanted to get at the facts, you should present an argument. Therefore a scientific report that was well-researched was a better medium for communicating truth than a story.   The modern assumption has been challenged in the last two or three decades. We realize now that a good story (that is, one that obeys the rules established by the story world and genre--fairytale, sci-fi, murder mystery, etc.) can contain and communicate truth as well as any other form of communication. In fact, many scholars (including cognitive scientists) believe that ""story"" is necessary for human thinking, for ordering our worlds, and for forming a rational and coherent mental map. We need stories to make sense out of the events and circumstances of our lives. Stories help us figure out how everything ""fits.""   I've been reading N. T. Wright's,  The New Testament and the People of God  (and loving it!). Here's a quote: ""Stories are a basic constituent of human life; they are, in fact, one key element within the total construction of a worldview.""    I don't know how to fully articulate this yet or explain why it is so, but I can feel its truth. My worldview is my total story, my explanation of reality.   obg"

KAFTLPZ,female,25,"Below is a teaser to the article you may want to check out (click the ""Link"" above).  I've never been really interested in trying to wrap my brain around how science proves or disproves the existence of God.  I am completely mystified still by the whole concept of radio in my car.... so this article mostly just furthered my belief in the mystery of God.  Yet somehow it helped my logical thinking understand the co-existence of our Free Will and God's Predestination.  I am interested in hearing if anyone else knows this stuff or cares or already gets it..... whatever.  I feel more enlightened but I also feel like it's worth checking out....  The teaser to the article on the link.......  We're talking about the ancient smackdown between God's resolute, unchallenged predetermination of all things and, on the other hand, humankind's unfettered right to choose our own destiny. In one corner stands God's ultimate prerogative to rule; in the other, man's primal birthright as a free-agent.  But here, in little more than the time it'd take you to delete the spam in your inbox, you will encounter a mesmerizing synthesis of science and philosophy that will forever change the way you look at the universe."

KAFTLPZ,female,25,"We talk about the ""emergent"" church: it might be worth thinking about that  emerge  itself derives from ""to come forth from  immersion ""---which resonates delightfully, and as I see it, even in a kind of providential artistry, with this group's name. Was that thought of when the name was chosen? We go in, I hope to see people emerge as something newer than when we came.  Before about 1425,  emergent  also referred to the year of the Israelite exodus---and I hope that many people here are also finding their own exodus into clearer perspectives of God, themselves, and one another. (Hopefully without plagues of flies and such. The incense might help keep them away.) On the other hand, an  emergence  can refer to a plant outgrowth such as a thorn. The question there is: Whose side are we in (not ""on"")? (And are we maybe  supposed  to be there!)  And even the alarming word  emergency  began simply as referring to an  unforeseen circumstance--- but like so much else in life, maybe really not so unforeseen, if only we had recognized how a genuinely normal part of life is that much often comes from little. A seed somehow ends up as Jack's giant beanstalk (or a giant redwood); water, air, heat, and a spin from the Earth are all that make up our endlessly complex weather.  John Holland's fascinating book,  Emergence: From chaos to order,  is a marvelous adventure in that kind of complexity---the notion of much coming from little, of systems ""where the behavior of the whole is much more complex than the behavior of the parts,"" and where ""the deeper explanation, once understood, inevitably gives the imagination an exhilarating boost."" Which would be good to have in understanding our own lives! Things we might puzzle over as confusing---the sprawl of a rain forest or a city, the churn of traffic or just of our own lives---can take on a whole new perspective, with even an exhilarating jolt of recognition, once we step back to see order emerging from confusion.  Which, it might seem, is easier to see in a rain forest than in our own (or others') lives---until we also step back to see the potential in each person's life. There is a fresh view of that by Roger Lewin and Birute Regine, in their book with the really long title,  The Soul at Work: Listen ... Respond ... Let Go: Embracing complexity science for business success.  Once you get past that, and the maybe drab sound of ""business,"" they have a refreshing view of creative potential in  any  groups, drawing on observations of animal groups, such as a flock of birds. ""The complex behavior of the system as a whole---the coordinated motion of the flock---emerges from a few simple rules of interaction among individuals, not from a single leader.""  So what about all this? So they conclude by thinking about  emergent teams;  see for yourself how this sounds, considering what we've hoped to do in Immersion: ""In emergent teams, everyone jumps into action; everyone intuitively knows what needs to be done; different people guide the collective action at different times ... and it's all done in the spirit of goodwill and care. And the results are often beyond the imagined .... This capacity in people, and in teams, to [break] through the normal day-to-day structures is the soul at work."" Actively including diversity, especially diversity in ideas; openness for people to contribute and have a say; the central need for caring relationships; the importance of story in building understanding and trust---these are some of their pictures of how this idea looks in action, how complexity emerges from individuals' gifts.  And this sounds a lot like what I hear people hoping for (and often practicing) in Immersion. If any of this sounds like what you've wanted to do, or see, or be a part of, I hope you dive in and add your part, because no one can tell how important your part is until it's in the mix; and it takes  all  these unique lives for us to see how the whole design will emerge. The whole is very much greater, richer, deeper, more complex, than the sum of the parts. Lewin and Regine were told, with regard to teams, ""If someone asks who the leader is, then that person has never been on a good team."" What's important in this ""team""? Look around: you're immersed in it."
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Experimenter   That was the result of the personality test yesterday.  It said something about me being dominant and blah blah blah.  Oh and that I love to cause trouble but also like to fix things.  I think that could be true.  But the experimenter part is so true...it said something like you will try anything once...anything.  That could be a really bad thing to have as a personality.    I have tried many things but I don't know if I have a line to draw.  I mean of course sex with animals, family members and other gross shit like that is duh out of the question.  But other than that I can't say that I wouldn't be up for anything.  I can't see myself eating raw tomatoes but like four months ago I ate them at Ruby Tuesdays and didn't have a problem with it.  Now I can't even think about a raw tomato without being sick.  And I'm sure we all know that I'll do any type of drug except for heroin...unless I was given it without knowing.  That is so scary...isn't it?  I don't think that I could do crack, crank, cocaine.  But here I am saying ""I don't think.""  That usually means you would do it.  Doesn't it?  No...I'm over the drug scene.  Really...the only thing I take now is a random pain killer for my leg and back...allergy pills, paxil, and sleeping pills.  Other than that...that's it.  See I also think that April would do anything at least once except for what I've excluded for myself.  The only other thing I know she wouldn't do is anal sex...but you never know?  Wink Wink...I'm just fucking around with you April.  She has swore off anal sex for those of you who do not know her that well....and she will never do it!  I'm really proud of her for biting!  I told you it was wonderful.  Now all you have to do is be bitten...I think you will find it very exhilariting.     I need some h2o   I really wanted to go to h2o last night but seeing that April and I didn't get to bed around 3 or 330am Friday night it was out of the question.  I feel asleep at 6 pm and got back up at 9pm.  Then went back to sleep at 1030pm and got up Sunday morning at 11am.  That's pretty bad.  I am in the mood to get messed up and shake some ass.  While Frank shook so much ass that even I was wore out...the temptation to go to the club is growing stronger and stronger everyday.  I really want a long island iced tea from h2o.  They are really good.  And they are huge and only 5 bucks.  Maybe next weekend.  Is it bad that I'm like really tired and I've only been up for like 2 or 3 hours?  I think not.  Tonight...the mission if I choose to accept it is to get drunk...like my mom did last night!  Ha!  In the words of the famous Bubble Malone:  Remember that one time that I..................................fucked your mom.....  Paul"
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Back in the habit   And no I don't mean I'm trying to become a nun again.  Today at work I had the most uplifting and positive thought.  I am going to reclaim my Queen/Queer Bitch tiara back.  You see my supervisor Jerry a.k.a. Peppy LaPew (due to the skunky hair) has it out for me.  I think it may be because he asked me what kind of person I was and I told him honest.  He then said ""Well since you are an honest person do you think there is something I could change about myself to become more positive in our team.""  I told him:  ""I'm glad you asked that Jerry.  I think you could change your attitude.  You may be a supervisor but you walk no higher than us (referring to my coworkers).  You talk no better than us.  And yes Jerry I know for a fact that my vocabulary is more advanced than yours.  Yet you still walk around this building thinking you are better than us.  Just because we are under you doesn't mean that you can tread on us.  If you think that we are afraid to yell back you are wrong.  So come down off your high horse and let us know that you walk with us not against us.""  So now I know he is plotting my demise.  Bastard.  What he should be plotting is a fucking opportunity to get his hair colored.  Anyway, that is beside the point.  My point is:  I'm going to be a bigger bitch than his wife.  I don't kill people with kindness because I'm not kind.  I am a manipulative, heartless bastard who owns up to the middle name Vengence.  Actually I'm fuckin with ya.  I'm a sweetheart.  Really.  But anyway, the first thing I did this morning was not answer his question.  He repeated himself about 4 times and then I turned around and said ""Oh I didn't have anything to say.  Why did you keep asking me the same question?""  And then when he asked why I didn't have any member contact yesterday I said ""Because I didn't.  The paper answers all of your questions.  It's there in black and white Jerry or do you need me to highlight it?""  He thought it was a joke and started laughing.  I looked at him and made a phonecall.  So yeah it is so much fun at work now.  I can't wait to go in tomorrow."
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Kah...nitting   Yeah I'm a superstar now.  I figured out why I couldn't do the damn knit stitch...I wasn't casting right.  I was using the left handed people page instead of the right handed people page so it fucked everything up.  Now I can knit.  I'm knitting my rat ""Baby Girl"" a scarf.  I will have a matching one too...but of course.  Other than that I'm doing well...work is flying by....Christmas is close...but I still have insomnia.    P.S.  Tricia Calvin Klein's Eternity used to be my signature cologne but it made me feel a little attracted to myself.  I myself drool when I smell it on someone...on me it is just exceptionally fragrant and made many at the alphabet soup group drool.  Sharon used to say that it was sexier on me than anyone she had ever smelled it on before.  Go figure?"
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Horseshit   Cookie day at work went splendidly well after I fixed things.  I go to the table and only a dozen of the sugar cookies are gone.  I'm thinking to myself ""Paul you made Faustus' cookies and they are wonderful yet no one has really eaten them.  Damn them all.""  Aside from there being too many cookies I figured that maybe people just didn't notice them.  In return I took the cookie container and marched around to everyone telling my sob story about the original ""dud"" cookies.  Then I informed them ""This receipe is from Faustus who lives in New York.  This receipe came all the way from New York and you haven't tried the cookies?  Here are two.""  Needless to say my co-workers loved the cookies and a few asked for the receipe.  See you evil bastards you didn't take the cookies therefore, you get no receipe.

It almost favors a ring-ding/devil dog/Dairy Queen brownie earthquake.  Too much.    I've delcared that having the inner diva that I have that the new me is ""Glamour Princess.""  The kit contains a tiara, silver bag, and a Petal mirror as a microphone, and The Go-Go's.  When you throw all the ingredients together you pretty much get me lipsyncing to The Go-Go's wearing a tiara and holding a pretend microphone and handbag.  At work I might add.  Well Cheryl is on her way over and I have to start dinner.  I'm thinking baked chicken with a lemon zest and parsilled("

You can put whipped cream and cherries all over it. Cheri:  Why can't you put whipped cream on a vagina? Missy:  And the boobs? Paul:  Well if you put whipped cream on a vagina it just reminds me of a really bad yeast infection.  And I have a rack of my own so why would I want to mess with someone else's? Cheri:  You know you like to decorate.  Think of it as an art project.  Why is it that I am always talking about vagina's at work.  Well I mean I was text messaging at work so it sort of is at work.

GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Giggle fest 2003   So it has been forever since I have had an extreme case of the giggles.  Well today Giggle fest 2003 began after lunch.  I could not stop thinking of the word ""retarded.""  Don't ask me why it was just stuck in my head.  I kept on placing it in unappropriate sentences, songs, phrases.  Like:  Correct sentence:  Oh I see that you have a dental policy through Aetna. Misuse:  Oh I see that you have a retard policy through Aetna.  Why I found it funny I have no clue.  All I know is that I kept making Heidi crack up and she told me that I needed to turn around so that she could teach because everytime she looked at me I would laugh and she would laugh.  It was just one of those days.  And speaking of days...have you ever been so tired that you thought you could fall asleep with your eyes open?  Well that was me today after my three stacker 2 caffeine pills wore off.  Starbucks Mocha Frappacino couldn't even help me recover.  Now I am even more tired than I was an hour ago.  I think I may be able to stay up until 8pm.  If not...goodnight ch'all.   Hoping that everything is okay...   So Dwayne and Frank got in a massive argument Sunday night and boy was it a big one.  They faught from their house to Walmart and shopping and coming home.  I hope that everything is okay.  April you need to do a follow-up just to make sure.  I really need to give them the bottle opener and the friendly sperm magnents.  Hopefully, that will give them a smile on their faces!

GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Quote of the Day   ""Missy Elliott is in everything these days April.  I mean she in my pants right now you just can't see her.""    Feeling inspired by the new music that MTV has provided I decided that I needed it.  And so I got it.  Hmm...being a part-time pirate is quite rewarding.  Afterall I did bring a smile to many people's faces today when I played them ""Gay Boyfriend"" by the Ukes of Hazzard.  It's sad that I know the words to the song already and I just discovered it on Faustus' website.  If you haven't viewed the video yet look at the link from a couple days ago.  I have to say that the song really is wonderful and should be an anthem for all faghags across the world.  Anyway, I decided at 8am this morning an oldie but goodie would be quite nice...hence the repetition of ""It's time for the Perculator"" blaring from Cheryl and I's cubies.  And little did I know but Cheryl felt the rhythm just as much as I did.  Fuck all the other bullshit...(this is in reference to work)...we wanna party and dance.  Yeah...and that happened all day long.  I even surprised myself my doing some Hindi dancing to ""Milkshake"" by Kelis and ""Indian Flute"" by Timbaland and Magoo.  Esther wanted me to show her the perculator and I busted out a little.  But Cheryl got the full effect.  Cheryl's quote of the day is ""Between the fat and cigarettes I think I'm done trying to keep up with you.""  I even broke a sweat at work today...not that it was from working but it happened there so it counts as working extra hard.  But between two insurance companies I managed to save them $11,000.  Last week was around $5000.  So yeah I do manage to do some work.    I get the MRI on my brain this Saturday.  Maybe they can prove to the world that I do have a brain.  If not then consider me ""Stem Boy"" because that's probably what I've been living off of for 23 years.  Having said that I told April I think the people I work with take random hits of acid daily however, I'm still tripping off that one hit from a  couple of years ago.  Between the acid and ecstacy I'm permanently tripping and rolling for life.  It's good to know that I haven't fell yet or broke anything rolling about daily.  Today life was good.  Poetry time my children:   Big Booty Hoe   Big Booty Hoes are neat, They keep their hair did, And polish on their feet.  Big Booty Hoes can be a slut, Open for business, Just to sell some butt.  Big Booty Hoes are all the rave, Living the high life, Never in a stark cold cave.  Big Booty Hoes are just like you and me, Bitchy, slutty, gold-diggin tramps, We're all the same you see.  Big Booty Hoes remind me of your dad, He wanted, couldn't get  Using his hand the only tool he had.  Big Booty Hoes remind me of yo' momma, Shh don't tell yo' poppa, I fucked her I don't need the drama.  Big Booty Hoes should rule the earth, Busting, stiffening, hardening, All men's girth.

""In fact, for the last 2-1/2 years, I've become increasingly concerned about the growing number of Emerging Church Voyeurs --  men and women who are fascinated with this emphasis, this paradigm, this movement -- but who persist in ""watching"" others instead of rolling up their sleeves and getting personally involved.  In some instances, they are people who lurk anonymously around EC-related message boards. In others, they're the host of people who join book discussion groups and attend workshops and conferences, but never launch out themselves.  The Emerging Church experience, for these folks, is tantalizing, titillating, and even addictive. They love this stuff!""      ""Religious and ecclesiological voyeurism is certainly nothing new.

""The emerging church needs more voyageurs, not more voyeurs!  On the surface, the difference may seem incidental -- but don't be fooled!

As I Googled, I came across this quote in a book review somewhere...   ""Many Christians today have what some sociologists of religion have called a 'suburban spirituality': we like our religion neatly trimmed, safe, gated, and above all respectable. As a consequence, fewer and fewer of us are willing to take chances - much less, God forbid, risks - for the sake of the Gospel. Little wonder that some of the folks most ardently working for peace and justice have a healthy distrust of Christianity.""   Anyway, here's the  urlLink whole article ..."

It's  urlLink about the cleaner from Ohio  who loves to sing and is encouraged to give it a shot on the professional stage. He's the best singer in Dayton, but it's an entirely different story when he goes to New York for his big debut. In one succinct review, Mr. Tanner's dreams are shattered, and his life is sucked out of him.   He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends. Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again, Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed. He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes. Music was his life, it was not his livelihood, And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good. And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul. He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.   Ever feel like that?"

X4JTJ1O,female,33,"For some reason, I thought Roman would take to food much quicker and with more enthusiasm than Reilly Kate did.  I don't know why I thought this. I guess because he is a boy.  I figured that he would grow big and strong and eat whole tomatoes like his father before him.    I was wrong.  Very, very wrong.    Quite to the contrary, Roman's reaction to his first bit of food was actually much worse than Reilly's first bite.  She wasn't that interested, focused more on the picture of a rocking horse on her high chair than the spoon I was shoving in her mouth.  She pushed the rice cereal gruel out of her mouth with her tongue, but opened her mouth up for the next bite to push out.  Eventually, after weeks of this, she clammed her mouth shut to food and didn't open it again until she was almost a year old.  But at least for a small period of time, she willingly allowed food to enter her system.  Last week Roman turned 5 months and I bought a box of rice cereal.  I excitedly milked myself into a bowl (no, that is not a typo -- I did MILK myself -- think cow and pail but the cow has hands and no need of the farmer), mixed my milk with some of the cereal to form a soupy gruel, lined up the cameras, and spooned him his first bite of food.  Immediately, his face skewed up into a grimace as if I had just put a rotten, sour lemon into his mouth.  He pushed it all out of his mouth and let out a whine.  Undeterred, I tried again.  Again, he pushed it out and let out a bigger whine.  His facial expression had turned from a grimace into a look of pain.  I got concerned that perhaps there was something wrong with it so I took a bite.  No, nothing wrong with it provided you are a fan of raw human breastmilk -- which most assuredly Roman is.  I tried for a third time.  This time he shrieked, grabbed the spoon with his right hand, my hair in left and yanked hard on both.  I pried open the hand with my hair, worried that he might pull it out leaving me with a nice bald patch.  While I was occupied with that, Roman took the opportunity to steal the full spoon away from me.  Once I had my hair back, he looked right at me and flung the spoon across the room.  The soupy mess went flying all over the kitchen, dining area and even into the livingroom.  Again, Truman McFatty (the ever dieting dachshund) was there to lend a hand with the clean up.  I'm thinking that Roman is not so crazy about rice cereal.  Next I'm gonna try bananas.  Truman likes bananas, I think."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"It's a safe bet that we will not be making any friends at dance class.    This was our second class with this particular group.  They've been together for several months, practicing a couple of routines that they'll be performing in the coming weeks.  All the little girls have their matching tutus and fairy wands and they all know the choreography.  All that is but the new girl and her mom -- that's us.  So we're already starting out on the outs.    There are other little things that also set us apart.  For example, all the other little girls are dressed head to toe in pink frills.  In our last class, Reilly was one of  the few in pink.  The other girls were in trendy streetwear black and glitz.  When she outgrew her old pink and frills, I bought her funky dance attire.  Then we switched classes.  She is now the only girl in black.  In contrast to the others, she looks like a two year old stripper.  Another difference:  the other moms are all thin and cute and seemingly have it all together.  One mom handed out birthday invitations to the class (sans us) which were hand made.  Another mom made Easter treats in little plastic eggs.  And another has her hair all neatly blown out and perfectly coifed.  These ladies are all smiles and Martha Stewart, pre-prison.  In we came, literally running in five minutes late, dropping baby toys and sippy cups as we went.  The quiet of their previously calm studio was shattered by my son doing his high pitched baby whine and the squeak of my stroller wheel saying, ""WD 40.  WD 40.  WD 40,"" with every rotation.  My hair, untethered by a scrunchy, was free and wild and whipping around due to the industrial fan they have blowing to keep the studio cool.  And my daughter, in her glitter and glitz, black and silver, sexy toddler garb strutted in, stood in front of the whole class and announced, ""I eat birdy poo poo!!""  ""No, you do not, Reilly Kate,"" I lied in a desperate attempt to fool the others into thinking we're just a normal, have-it-all-together family simply having the odd, off day.  ""Yes, I do. At the pool.  Mama say, 'Eeew, yucky.  It's gross.'  But I say, 'Isss goooood.  Mmmmmm.....'""  ""Just get your shoes on, Reilly.  They're all waiting for you,""  I shut her up and temporarily shut her down.  They began the class with stretches.  Reilly was stretching with the other girls, trying to imitate the teacher with hands over the head lunges and pointy toed side bends.  Then they each sat down, knees bent, soles of the feet pressed together.  They bounced their knees up and down, making what the teacher calls a ""butterfly.""  Reilly was digging it.  She loves butterflies.  I'm thinking, at this point at least, she is really going to like this class.    The teacher then instructed them all to bend over and smell their toes.  She tells them this as a way of getting them all to stretch out.  All the little frilly pink girls bent over and sniffed and when they came back up said in the sweetest, daintiest, little voices, ""Stinky feet!""   Reilly Kate bent over, didn't sniff, but instead lickrf her feet and said, ""Mmmm... Smells good.  Smell it.  I smell it.  Smells good.""  The entire class, frillies, Marthas, and teacher all looked at her like she was from the planet Gross.  And quite possibly, she is.  While they practiced plies, Reilly got bored and threw herself onto her belly in the middle of the room.  As she hit the wood floor with a thud, she bellowed, ""Sucks!""  The normal reaction of any mother who hears a bad word escape from their child's mouth is to correct the child with a gentle, but firm, ""We don't say words like that, honey.""  I have learned that ""normal"" does not pertain to any mothering situation that comes my way.  Particularly when it comes to bad words.  Last week, we were in the religious section of the video department at Walmart.  I was looking at the old Jesus movies (as I've said before, Reilly loves Jesus).  Suddenly, unexpectedly, and seemingly out of nowhere, my beloved daughter, the one who is a big Jesus fan, yelled out, ""These god damn stickers are always in my way!!!""  Then she threw out some stickers that I thought I had hidden in the cart so as to surprise her with them on Easter morning.  I caught the stickers and sweetly, gently, and kindly said to her, ""Dear heart, we do not say such things.  Taking the name of our lord in vain is a sin.  Only say ""God"" when speaking to him while in prayer.""    ""Mama say that.  Mama say, 'god damn!'"" All within earshot, a whole crowded aisle filled with pious Polynesians perusing the Easter movies, were staring straight at me, listening to the entire conversation.  So I did whatever any level headed mother in complete moral panic would do.  I lied.  ""Well, then, I'm going to have to speak with your mother about that.  I don't want her saying stuff like that around you if you are going to repeat it.  I dislike that kind of nasty talk and will not allow it around me.  If it continues, I will refuse to babysit you and then where will your mother be?  I suggest you both clean up your mouths.""  And with that, I hightailed it on outta there.  From this experience I gleaned I must lie in situations like this so as to cover my own potty mouth.  Better to lie than to reveal myself a toilet talking mama with no hopes of reforming.    ""Socks?  No, no.  No, Socks, Reilly.  We don't wear socks to dance class, silly.  We wear tights.  You have on tights.""  I was bailing as fast as I could.  ""No socks.  SUCKS!!  Sucks.  Sucks.  Sucks, "" insisted my clear speaking two year old as she began pounding on the floor with the toes of her tap shoes.  ""We don't wear socks in Hawaii.  I don't have on socks.  No one here has on socks.  I didn't even bring you any socks.  But if you really, really want some socks, we'll buy you some after class.""  I yanked her up and whispered in her ear, ""Don't say 'sucks,' Reilly.  Please don't say it.  These other girls won't be your friend if you say 'sucks.'""  Replying in her loudest, most defiant voice, Reilly said, ""Mama says ""sucks.""  Not socks.  No socks.  SUCKS!!!""  There could be no denying my maternity in this crowd.  I took the best path available to me at the time.  I just said nothing, hung my head in shame, and prayed that she would just let it drop.  Eventually, she did.  She moved on to picking her nose... and eating it.  What exactly is the proper way of correcting a child whose favorite snack is stored right up her nose?  All the experts suggest diversion.  I was leary of diverting her attention since the nose picking/booger eating had gotten her away from the ""sucks"" repetitions.  But I knew if I didn't do something, we'd be in for an all you can eat booger extravaganza.    Sadly, motherhood has left me little in the way of intellectually acuity.  My clunky thought processes are similar to the whirling emitted from George W's when he's in front of a Coke machine.  So many, many choices... hard to choose... what to do next... can't decide... forget Coke... invade another country.  I don't have an army, though, so I usually just sit blankly.  Basically, I'm about as sharp as a stick of butter these days.  So as I sat there, feeblely attempting to devise a diversionary tactic, my booger eating, potty mouthing, hoochy mama toddler comes up to me and says, ""I love you soooo much!  I make you happy.  Are you happy, Mama?  I make you happy when I build you a sand castle. I build you a sand castle on the bed.""  She was referring to an incident yesterday involving a load of clean clothes that were neatly folded and awaiting a chance for me to put them away.  She climbed on my bed, unfolded them, and stacked them up one on the other.  She insisted the mound was a sand castle and if you closed your right eye, and looked squinty with the left while cocking your head to one side, you could see the resemblance.  ""Yes, Reilly Kate.  That sand castle made me very happy.  I love you, too.""  ""And I peed on Mama-Daddy's bed, too!"" she added enthusiastically.  ""I peed all over the bed.  Made Mama mad.  Made Mama angry.  Her yelled.  I peed on the bed,"" she sing-songed as she tapped on over to the teacher who was now asking me if she was wearing a diaper because they had just installed new Pergo flooring and it can't withstand wet messes.  But I cannot blame our lack of friendship possibilities solely on Reilly Kate.  No, I had my share in it as well.  While the girls were on stage performing their dress rehearsal, us moms all sat together to watch.  I noticed one little girl talking almost as much as Reilly, who, as you should know by now, does not shut up (I've actually taken the liberty of carving down most of her ramblings into nice, short, sound bites which actually fit into the story.  If I were to quote her word for word, you wouldn't leave my blog for days.)  I turned to her mother and with the hope of creating an ally said, ""Wow.  It's really nice to meet another child who talks nonstop.""  With a scowl on her face akin to receiving an oil change as an anniversary gift, she said, ""I think that's normal for this age.""  Thinking I could still save the situation with some of my infamous self deprecating humor, I continued.  ""Yeah, right.  The rest of the class is quietly following the teacher's direction as our two just yammer away. And not even to each other.  Just bathering on and on to no one in particular...""  I dropped the rest in light of the daggers she shot my direction.  I had just dug myself a ten foot hole with both my feet in my mouth.  Yum.  I spent the rest of the practice rehearsal just trying to melt into the background, despite my still whining baby disrupting the mood and making it hard for the frillies to hear the music.  As soon as the practice rehearsal was over, while the frillies were on stage taking their bows, Reilly Kate climbed down and began running to me.  I bent down, thinking she was coming to give me a great big hug overcome with excitement in performing on stage.  As she got closer, I realized that she wasn't slowing down.  She was, in fact, increasing in speed.  It didn't look like she was planning on stopping.  In fact, it didn't look like she was coming to give me a hug at all.  Just as I was straightening up to brace myself for the hit, she tackled me.  Hard.  Down we went.  Both of us.  Almost taking Roman and the stroller with us.  There I was flat on my back, my child on top of me giggling with sheer delight.  It was, on all counts, an excellent tackle.  Maybe we should try football lessons.  I bet they'd love her black, glitzy get up.  I wonder if they make black helmets with glitter butterflies and rhinestone hearts..."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I started a new house cleaning program.  One that is guaranteed to  easily  move me from clutter and chaos to organization of my time, home, and life.  Easily, huh?  The program is outlined in a book entitled, ""Sidetracked Home Executives"" written by the self proclaimed ""slob sisters.""     I've read the book.  Cover to cover.

She dumps half the contents of her toy box on my bedroom floor and joins me and her brother in bed.  Fortunately, Roman is already awake and squeals with delight at the sight of his beloved sister.  I get out of bed and find the floor cluttered with the toys she's strewn all around.  I clear a path for myself to the bathroom, where I put my to do list the night before.  As if I'm a gypsy fortune teller, I see my entire day laid out before me.  In plain black and white, inkjet ink.  First on the list: situps (it's either do 'em or look forever 5 months pregnant).  I'm mid crunch when it hits me... or rather  she  hits me.  Full force.  All her weight.  Onto my crunched, flabby baby belly.  Ugh, that hurt.  ""I love you, Mom,"" says Reilly obviously craving attention at an early hour.  ""I love you, too, Mom,"" she replies to herself (or was that to me she was replying?).  ""And I love brother and I love Daddy and I love GG and Papa...""  She doesn't quit talking again until 7:04 pm when she falls sound asleep in my arms.  For those of you keeping track, that's over 12 straight hours of nonstop, ceaseless talking.  I have so much two year old running around in my brain that I'm starting to develop a crush on Bob the Builder.  Can he fix me?  Yes, he can!  By 7:45 am I had made Reilly's breakfast, changed the baby's diaper twice, run a mile and a half, planned our dinner menu, and was in the midst of doing two loads of laundry.  And I hadn't even made a dent in that damn to do list.    According the reformed slob sisters, to succeed in this cleaner, more organized and time efficient lifestyle, one must finish the to do list before leaving the house.  If I were to keep to this rule, I might never leave the house again. I would be a prisoner of my warden -- the to do list.  So if days go by and you haven't seen me, you know I'm trapped inside with two small offspring and a sheet of paper ordering me around.  On the list was instructions to clean the bathroom and sweep and mop the whole downstairs.  This would take a normal person about 20 minutes at the most.  But I am not normal.  Neither are my children.  I set about my tasks, however, neglecting this fact.    I was about five minutes into my sweeping when Reilly takes a tennis ball from Truman (our miniature dachshund) and shoves it into a slot in Roman's exersaucer.  I look over and poor Tru is up on his hind legs with his long snout pushed into a plastic toy barn attached to the exersaucer.  He is trying to pull the ball out but he's only managed to get it wedged into the barn loft.  Roman thinks this is high comedy and giggles to show his approval.    Reilly Kate has moved on to better things at this point. She is now running the length of our couch and leaping from the arm rest of the couch onto our rocking recliner.  Run run run... leap... Land!!!  And each time she lands she says, ""Be careful, Mom.  Be careful!  Just be careful.""  What the heck to I have to be careful about?  I keep my distance from her just to be safe.  She seems to know what she's doing.  I don't interfere.  To finish the floor with interruptions like this every five minutes or so, it takes me three hours.  It's 11 am before I'm done with the floor and on to the bathroom.  This is a little powder room off of our living room.  It shouldn't take more than ten minutes.  And it wouldn't have, if I hadn't let the dogs outside.  We live in a fairly new house and the grass in our yard hasn't fully grown in yet.  It can get pretty muddy out there.  But I didn't pay attention and I let the dogs back in without washing their feet first.  All over my newly washed floor were bright red, Hawaiian mud prints.  I get out my trusty mop (the one I had become so attached to earlier in the morning) and damp mopped the spots up.  I also stain treat the carpet.  Not, of course, before I get out a bowl and stoop down to wash each dog's foot.  If you would have told me five years ago that I would be crouched down with a bowl of warm soapy water washing the feet of two mangy mongrels, I would have told you that George W was gonna be president, too.  I  must  be a gypsy psychic.  By the time I get back to the bathroom, Reilly has already used her little potty and was swishing the pee around in the bowl before pouring it into the big potty.  The pee went spinning out of the bowl and all over the bathroom.  Fortunately, I wasn't completely done with the bathroom so I didn't feel like it was a total loss.  Just a setback.  Minor setback at that.  The day progressed like that.  Two steps forward, one and a half steps back.  I finally finished my to do list at 9:30 this evening.  All but one thing:  Pick up trash by the computer.  I wonder, does that ""trash"" include tomorrow's to do list?"
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"It's been a busy week around here.  Hard to imagine, huh?  Reilly Kate starts school in a couple weeks at a cooperative preschool.  Since no one wanted to be group leader for her class, guess who volunteered.  Yep.  Me.  Plus, I'm trying to get all our paperwork together for her admission.  You wouldn't believe the amount of paperwork to simply get my daughter in a preschool.  And, it seems, I will be getting her the varicella (chicken pox) vaccine tomorrow morning, much to my sorrow.     You see, this silly little island state has decided to  require  the varicella vaccine.  In most states it is optional.  I'd really rather her not get the varicella vaccine.  I would much prefer she just get the chicken pox the old fashioned way.  I fully intended to have her vaccinated for it by the age of ten had she not contracted the pox.  Sadly, though, it looks like ""pox parties"" are a thing of the past.      I actually called the state's immunizations department and talked to a very nice, cheerful woman.  She informed me that had I not had Reilly Kate vaccinated against  anything , then I could get an exemption.  But since I only wanted an exemption for a shot that was, until recently, optional, I was out of luck.     ""Excuse me,"" I sputtered.  ""Do you mean that since I had my daughter immunized for the deadly diseases, the diseases that have caused widespread death, disability, and disfigurment, but do not wish to have her immunized for a fairly benign childhood disease with a vaccine whose efficacy is questionable, then I am up the proverbial creek?""     ""I'm sorry?  A creek?""  she questioned.     ""I'll rephrase.  She cannot go to school unless she is completely immunized.  Or completely NOT immunized.  Is that correct?""     ""That's correct.""     I was stunned.  What the hell kind of Catch 22 bullshit is that?  This immunizations topic is really starting to burn me up.     For those of you that don't know, there is a growing movement amongst middle class Americans to  NOT  vaccinate children.  I'm sure to some of you who lived in fear of polio each summer during your childhood, that seems outrageous and unbelievable.  But I assure you it is out there and growing.     Growing thanks to a lot of baseless information poisoning the internet. I swear, I am gonna start a website about the cancer causing agents of red clothing and see what kind of following I get (especially from the Mothering.com crowd -- and before you flame me for that I subscribe and visit those boards so I'm amongst them). I can hear it now, ""Oh, I don't allow my kids to wear red. Too risky. We stick with only neutral colors dyed with sweet potatoes and red dirt on hand-picked organic cotton woven by underprivileged mothers in Botswana. In the winter, I do allow my children the occasional wool sweater made from sheep who live in the Waldorf-Astoria and dine on organic grasses flown in daily from Scotland.""     ""Really?  Well, we've been red-free now for five years.  Since then our headaches have cleared up and my son no longer experiences those eye twitches that plagued him for so long.   I don't allow any red in my house whatsoever.  Not even blood.  We do all our bleeding outside, in our mulch pile.  It's so much cleaner.  But let me just suggest you do some reading on organic grasses grown in Scotland.  They're full of lead.  The soil in Scotland is so contaminated with lead that the sheep eating the grass are currently being tested for developmental delays.""     ""[Gasp]  I had no idea.  I have to go and google that.  Ciao.""     Barf.  There's a culture of perfect parenting out there that is so obsessed they are no longer thinking clearly.  Any ninny can go and post an internet site and blather on and on about whatever they choose, using real information or stuff they yanked out the pure, blue sky.  It's dangerous.  And even more dangerous are those that are too lazy to do the real research for themselves.  Parents are just hopping on the internet and basing their parental decisions on cyber junk floating around.     Now, I'm not saying that there is not risk involved with vaccinations.  There are.  Of course.  Real dangers.  But if you put your kids in a car driving 50 miles per hour, there's danger.  If you let your kids ride a bike, there's danger.  Hell, I remember reading about an American child living in Japan who fell while walking down the street, hit his head on the curb and died.  I'm sure somewhere there are parents pressuring government officials to demolish curbs.      I agonized over giving my precious children these shots.  I agonized, prayed, sweated, and cried for days.  And yet, I did it.  Why?  Because it is a social contract we all must abide by.  Just like when the traffic signals go out and everyone treats the intersection like a stop sign.  It's a social contract.  You stop.  Then I stop.  This way we don't have a collision.  See?      What I don't understand is why these parents who are not getting their kids immunized are being allowed to put these kids in schools.  Why should I subject my children to the hazards of vaccinations just to have the Smith family refuse and potentially expose my kids to outbreaks?   It is arrogant and classist.  """"Oh, not my child. Let them, those poor people living in unsanitary conditions vaccinate their children.  But I won't do mine.""  Blech.      Ya know, if you don't want to vaccinate your kids, fine.  Go buy yourself a nice plot in the 100 Acre Wood and live there amongst other potential lepers and don't come out.  Stay there and grow your own food and drink rainwater and make breastmilk cottage cheese.   Just don't contaminate my kids, thankyouverymuch.     Unless you happen to have an outbreak of the chicken pox.  Then could you give me call?"
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"Last night I attempted to sleep smashed in between two very small children who seem to take up three quarters of a queen sized bed.  ""Attempted"" would be the key word in that sentence.  And my king-sized husband slept on about three inches of space on the very edge of the bed.  Poor guy.  Yet he did in fact sleep.  His snoring added to my insomnia.  The worst part of the night was being hit in the face with my own boobs.  Yep.  That's right.  You read it.  I said it.  I get hit in the face with my very own mammary glands.  They are just that big and out of control.  Imagine it for yourself:  Sleeping with hardly any wiggle room.  You don't want to move a slumbering child for fear of awakening their inner beast.  So you just inch a little to your right and ::WHAM:: the left boob hits you square in the face.  It's not pleasant.   After this happened several times, I started thinking of a nice comfortable sleeping bra that wouldn't clog my ducts but would be gently supportive.  And breathable.  A brushed cotton, perhaps.  Heaven, thinks I.  But at a price.  A high price.  Bras in my size (a 40-I cup) don't come cheap.  They range between $35 and $80 and must be ordered online.  It's a serious, royal pain in the ass.  Then the thought hit me.  No, I am not thinking of making my own bras.  I'm thinking that bras and the like should be tax deductible for me.  My occupation is lactator, right?  Okay.  I'm a mother.  But a big part of my role as mother is lactator.  So just like an astronomer can deduct his telescope from his taxes, so should I be able to deduct my bras from my taxes.  And the cost difference between a queen sized bed and a king sized bed.  That should be tax deductible.  And nursing shirts (which, if you don't know, cost twice as much as normal shirts -- why?  It's a conspiracy between the textile workers and the formula makers, I'm quite sure).  And chocolate.   Yep. All this should be tax deductible.    I just hope that I get a better night's sleep tonight.  Brainstorms like that can really take a lot out of a person.  Especially a lactator.  With the breastmilk goes one's brain cells.  This is fact.  Ya see, DHA is a fatty acid that helps build and maintain one's brain.  Breastmilk is high in DHA.  So if a lot of DHA is leaving my body, but I'm not taking more in, I must be losing brain cells.  My kids are making me dense.  That too should be a tax deduction.  Moooo..."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I've been working on a little ditty on our Easter adventure.  But I haven't finished it and I'm pooped.  I just wanted to post something to let you all know that I am alive and well and just haven't the energy tonight to finish.  Stay tuned.  Oh, and tomorrow should be another good adventure.  We'll be sitting out in line for 7 hours.  What for?, you ask.  Concert tickets, perhaps?  Dora's autograph?  A picture with Sponge Bob?  No, no, no.  Nothing quite so fun.  We'll be in line for 7 hours to get Reilly Kate signed up for preschool.  It's the only one in the area that is decent and reasonably priced.    I'll have the cell phone on.  Take pity on me and give me a call."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I've come to the realization that in order for me to get a proper vacation (that is one that includes actual rest and relaxation) I will need a full body cast.    How I plan on acquiring said cast is still in the works, but I'm thinking that a Christmas ski trip might be my answer.  I'll have to jump off the ski lift, of course.  And it'll have to be on the first trip up the mountain.  If I wait at all, I run the risk of Mike somehow legitimately injuring himself while skiing, blowing all chances of any relaxation for myself.  With my luck, however, the doctor will crook my arms for baby holding, leave my hands free so I can wipe snotty noses and poopy behinds, and cast around my nipples so the baby can still nurse.  Mike would have to cook meaning we'd be eating grilled meat and over nuked tv dinners.  Reilly Kate would use me as a jungle gym and Roman would get slobber deep into my cast.  The laundry would pile up so high that I wouldn't be able to see the television and I'd probably gain 20 pounds.  On second thought, I think I'll just shave my head and join the Hare Krishnas."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"Mike is off to Korea for 10 days.  He leaves tomorrow.  So I'm spending time with him before he goes.  I'll be back to regular blogging soon.  Till then, enjoy this one. I actually realized I should be doing a blog when I typed this one up.   I wrote it March 3, 2004 (I think)  Yesterday was another one of Heather's Days.  I'm thinking maybe this is my life plan.  To have shitty days and write them out for the entertainment of others.  So yesterday.  Got up.  Breakfasted without incident (RK fell back in love with french toast which thrilled me to no end) except I still have a fussy baby.  But that is nothing really.  Oh, and the ants.  The gnats are gone from all the rain.  But the ants have taken their place.  I got up and the counter was covered with them.  Thousands and thousands of little black ants.   They whole counter.  They had a highway built across the kitchen floor from the sliding glass door to the dogs’ food to the counter.  I’d call Terminex, but last time they came, they told me that I didn’t have a pest problem.  I was my own problem.  According to the guy they sent, I need to get rid of my dogs and my kids and all the stuff in my garage and then I wouldn’t have any bugs at all.  In his exact words, “I can spray all day long, but it is your lifestyle that causes your bug problems.”  Instead I put out those ant traps that they love so much.  I think they thrive on the stuff they put in them.  I had some phone errands to do.  So at about 8am I started on the phone.  I called the Cook County Clerk's Office about getting my absentee ballot sent to me via email.  I had checked the website and it had a whole page dedicated to military and how they will send you a ballot via email.  Look for yourself.    http://www.voterinfonet.com/sub/absentee_overseas_military.asp  The woman on the phone flat out said, ""No.""  What? What do you mean, ""No?""  I don't get it.  The website says that you can.  ""No.""  I read directly off the site to this woman whose answer is... ""No.""  I read again.  ""No.""   I then talk to the supervisor who tells me that they have never done it that way.  They cannot do it that way.  And she cannot figure out how I would ever think that.  When I again read her the website she just says, ""Well, it's wrong.""  The bottom line is that military gets no easier way to vote than any other absentee.  Fine. I now have to fill out an APPLICATION  for a ballot and return that and then they'll send me the ballot.  This all needs to be completed by the 15th of March which means we'll be overnighting two applications and two ballots for a total of 60 bucks.  60 freakin' buck to fucking vote!!!  And then I still don't know if it'll get counted since it is cutting it so close.  That is of course easier than last year, though.  Last year I had to fill out an application for an application for a ballot.  Go figure that one.  I get off the phone and hear RK yelling, ""Poo poo on the foot!!!  Poo poo on the foot!!!""  I go running to see whose foot and whose poo poo and find it to be Truman's poop on RK's foot.  It's all over the downstairs.  And Truman's long haired ass.  I decided to cut the poop and hair out.  He's got to go the groomer this week and get a chop chop.  More on this later.  But I get the poop cleaned up from all offending areas.  Then I called my house's builder.  You see, my driveway isn't flush to the asphalt so every time it rains, about an inch and a half of mud collects where the driveway meets the street.  Additionally, the driveway concrete is crumbling into little stones.  But my main point of calling was because the kick plate to my fridge has never been delivered.  They keep trying to tell me that the fridge doesn't come with a kick plate; that the motor is supposed to be exposed on the bottom of the fridge.  Dumbasses.  Anyway, I call and my customer care guy (Scott) is supposedly out of the office.  The woman I am talking, however, seems to have a bad case of the giggles.    Me:  My driveway needs to be run done. Her:  [giggles] Yes? Me:  The cement is crumbling. Her:  [giggles] Oh, that's bad.  [giggles]   Then I tell her about the fridge and this is high comedy to her.  It has gone from giggles to all out laughter. I finally ask again if Scott is there and she says, ""Scott? No, he's not here.""  Huh.  Okay.  Fine.  I move down my list of to dos.  The library.  I received two notices from them while I was on the mainland.  One for the book I ordered from another library.  It seems that it came in while I was out of town and since I wasn't there to pick it up, I must pay some kind of a fine.  The other notice is for that damn DVD The Land Before Time.  They claim I never turned it back in.   So I call.  They are not open until 1pm.  I ask you, what kind of a library doesn't open until 1pm on both Monday and Tuesday?  Especially since it is not only the local public library, but also the High School library.  And it doesn't open till 1pm?  I'll tell you what kind of library it is.  It's the kind that charges you to take anything out of there except books.  Books are free.  All else you pay for.  Can you believe it?    Next phone call is the post office.  This is an interesting one which requires me to give you some extensive background.  I sent out an invitation to Roman's christening to the mother of a very good friend of the family.  She wished to attend but would only do so if a formal invitation was extended to her (she wouldn't just come as a guest of her son).  So I sent one to her along with the 60 other invitees in the middle of January.  A week or so later, it was returned to me with a stamp saying, ""Return to sender.  Attempted - Not Known.""  This woman has lived at this address since ancient times.  I called the family and verified that the address was indeed correct and then I took it back to the post office.  I talked to the clerk and he wrote on it, ""Retry"" and then stuck it back in the mail (mind you, this was in the days of dragging two kids and my father in law everywhere I went so this was no easy trip to the post office).  By 4pm that very same afternoon, the damn letter was back in my freaking box!!!!  Back to the post office I went.  This time the clerk told me that since it was returned for a second time that is obviously is the incorrect address.  I try to explain to him that it never left Ewa Beach the second time and that they need to try it once more.  He calls in his supervisor he then tells me that I simply don’t understand the complex post system and that this letter just cannot be delivered.  “WHAT?  WHY?”  I ask in my most diplomatic stressed out fat housewife demeanor.  His answer: “Because you didn’t scratch out the postal bar codes stamped on the bottom from the first time it was returned.”  Huh?  Like this is MY damn job?  No, sir. My job is to clean up poop and pee and breastmilk spit up.  That’s my job.  My job doesn’t involve postal codes or bars or any of that nonsense.  Jackass.  Anyway, I scratched out the damn bar codes with a marker and sent it off for a third time.  At the suggestion of the supervisor, I followed this up with a phone call the post office for her zip code.  I talked to a guy there and he promised me that he would be on the look out for this letter and would personally make sure that it was delivered in time for the christening. On Monday, two weeks after the christening, it arrived back in my box.  This time stamped “Insufficient address.”  This was the reason for my post office phone call.  I called the Chicago post office and explained to a woman there the situation.  This, mind you, was the same number I called when the man assured me that he would make sure it got delivered.  This woman tells me that I have the wrong post office and gave me another number to call.  I call that number and explain to a man there what happened and he tells me that the woman I am sending to must have moved.  No, she didn’t.  Well, she must have forgotten to change her address when she moved.  No, she never moved.  Oh, well, then she didn’t come to our office and fill out a forwarding address form before she moved.  SHE NEVER EVER MOVED.  He then asked me for the name and address and went to look it up.  After fifteen minutes, he comes back and says, “Ummm…. She never moved.  I don’t know why it’s getting returned to you.  Just put it back in the mail and I’ll make sure it gets to her.” Sound familiar?  I’ll keep you posted on that one.  Minutes after that call my mom calls to tell me a few things about my grandma.  In the first few minutes of talking, RK comes up to me and says, ""Mama, I'm all wet.""  I asked her if she peed her panties and she proudly says, ""Yep.""  (the potting retraining is going like gangbusters, you can see)  I tell her to go change her panties and clean her yoni and off she goes to the bathroom and resume talking to my mom.  A few minutes go by and I realize that I hear her splashing in the toilet.  I investigate and find her dunking her panties in the potty, poop all over the floor (big hunks), smeared all over the toilet, the baby potty, even the tub.    I get off the phone with my mom, grab the disinfectant towels and start to clean.  I put RK in the tub to just stand.  Of course, she can't just stand so she is touching her poop smeared bum with her hands and then touching her hair, her face, even rubbing her eyes (to which she got my shrieking in her ear!!!)  When I finished cleaning up the mess (took about ten minutes -- it was that bad), I turn the shower on and we both go in the shower.  RK hates showers and screams so much and so loudly that she wakes Roman and he starts screaming.  By the end of the shower, all three of us are screaming.   Oh, and Truman peed on the carpet right outside the bathroom door.  I got to step in that when I exited the steamy scream chamber.  I am getting the kids dressed and the only clean clothes I have for them are new ones.  I picked out sort of matching outfits from a good friend of the family.  I’m not sure what possesses me to do this, but I decide to take some pictures of them in these outfits to email to the woman who got the clothes for them.  As I’m getting Roman diapered, he spouts a fountain and pees all over himself, the clothes, and the bedding.  I give him a bath (the pee got all over his little remaining hair) and strip and make the bed.  I get another outfit that’ll go with RK’s and set about taking pictures.  While I am snapping away, Reilly, who is bare bottomed (for potty retraining) pees all over my freshly made bed as well as her dress.  I strip the bed and the child and redress both.  I smartly decide to quit taking pictures.  I’m gathering our stuff up to get us out of the house.  I go to grab my cell phone which had been charging for several hours.  It is not charged.  In fact, the display says, “Unable to charge.”  I retry it a couple of times and then the thing just plain old dies.  Completely and totally dies.  Fine.  Not exactly a good day to leave the house without a cell phone, but I’ll throw the bones.  Everything in life is a gamble, right?  As I am pulling out of the garage, a bird flew in.  Yep.  A bird.  Flew right into my garage.  I get out of the car and try to shoo it out of there, but it’s scared and panics and flies about frantically.  The last I see of it is by a pile of Rubbermaid boxes filled with holiday decorations.  I couldn’t find it after that.  I decide to proceed with my leaving since it’ll probably fly out when I open the garage door upon our return.  Again, a gamble.  It is now 11:30am and we are off to Wal-Mart.  Ya see, on Thursday (the day of the storm) RK had to leave the house without shoes on because we have somehow lost all the shoes that fit her.  Well, that isn’t exactly true.  We have closed toe shoes, but she only owns several pairs of socks (since she is mostly in sandals) and she wore them on our trip so they were dirty.  Anyway, we had to go get her shoes.  And sunglasses (she broke her last pair and she screams if we’re in the car and the sun hits her eyes without sunglasses on).  Long story short with Wal-Mart is that they didn’t have sandals in her size so I bought her a size too big.  And the sunglasses fit fine, but she broke them before we even had left the store.  As I am putting our stuff into the van, RK says, “I gotta go poo poo, Mama.”  Luckily, my mom bought us a little tiny car potty.  It basically is a seat that you attach these bags to.  On the bottom of these bags is a pad thing to absorb pee.  So I set this up, but by the time I got it set up, she had already started to go in her panties.  Poor thing had diarrhea.  She went so much that she filled the bag and it started to pile up to her bum.  I had her get up and I changed the bag.  She filled two bags with poop.  So imagine it.  There I am in the parking lot with a baby on my boob (oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that by this point Roman was hungry and I had to nurse him) and a toddler on a bag car potty for about 20 minutes.  People would go in and come back out and we’d still be there.  I’m sure we were a sight to behold.  When we got home, I tried calling the library again.  I explained to them that we don’t have the movie and that I was out of town and unable to pick up the book I had ordered.  While they were busy calculating my fees, I just happened to think that maybe, just MAYBE, the movie had fallen behind our TV.  I look and can make out the shadow of something.  While still on hold, I try moving the TV and the wine cabinet that it rests on.  As I am heaving and hoeing, the top drawer in the wine cabinet falls out and hits my foot causing me to scream out in pain which for some reason startled Truman who starts barking his head off waking up Roman (Reilly Kate thankfully was still asleep having fallen asleep on the ride home from Wal-Mart).  But low and behold, I find the stinkin’ DVD.  When the lady comes back on the phone, I excitedly tell her that I found the movie.  She then tells me that the late fees for it are 20 bucks.  TWENTY BUCKS for a movie that my daughter couldn’t even watch to start with.  So all said and done, with rental fees and late fees, I will have spent 40 bucks at the library in just TWO stinkin’ visits!!!  It would be cheaper for me to just go to Borders and buy the damn books and DVDs!!!  Shortly thereafter, Mike comes home and I ask RK to show him her new shoes.  She puts them on and then tries to walk in them.  She fell flat on her face.  They are too big.  She cannot walk in them.  Great.  Guess who’s going to Kmart today for shoes and another pair of sunglasses.  For dinner, I cooked a pork roast according to the directions.  When I cut it open, it was still bleeding.  We nuked it and it tasted like shit.  We had chocolate ice cream instead.  Oh, and that bird in the garage?  Haven’t seen hide nor feather of it.  I imagine we’ll know for sure it’s fate in a few days when it starts to stink."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I love to talk.  Talking is my game.  And there is no one I like better to talk with than a fellow talker.  The more you talk, the more I talk, the more we talk together.  It's a love fest.  But, my daughter takes talking to a whole new level.  The child does not shut up.  Not even for a minute.  Let alone five.  When I beg her to shut her trap for just a few minutes, just to relieve the pressure, just for a few, blissfully silent minutes, I am treated to a mouth noise similar to high pitched trills of Arab women in celebration.  She can keep this up for about three minutes before she then has to go back to the spoken word.    This ceaseless talking begins before the break of dawn.  Take this morning for example.  At precisely 5:49 am I hear her tramping through my room saying, ""It's morning.  I'm aWAKE!!! [with the stress on the 'WAKE' part, of course] Still dark outside.  Mama, wake UP.  Mama, wake UP.  Where's my book?  I wanna read my book.  Wake UP!!!""  With only one eye opened halfway, I groan out to her, ""Still dark means still sleep.  Come in here and go to sleep.""  ""I'm not sleeping. I'm aWAKE!!!  I want my book.  I want to see brother. Where is brother.  Touch him.  Touch him.""  Now, this is serious.  There should be no touching of the baby prior to seven o'clock in the morning.  He needs to sleep.  And if I am going to be forced awake while it is still dark outside, I'll be damned if I'm going to be awake and juggling a cranky, woke-up-too-soon, four month old.  I intervene quickly just before she is about to lay on top of him.  ""Here!!!  Your book is here!!!""  I reach for the book left on the night stand and hand it to her.  ""Please read it  quietly . Do not talk.  Do not wake your brother.  It is still sleeping time.""  And then my eyes slammed shut.    If only ears had lids.  And why the hell don't they?  Perhaps not all people need lids on their ears, but by God MOTHERS do.  They should magically appear after your first child is born.  Kind of like that flap that used to be your abdomen just suddenly appears after you give birth.  A belly flap is useless.  But ear lids... that would be heaven.  Anyway, no sooner did my eyes slam shut then the baby starts screaming out in pain.  Reilly has dropped the book on his head while he was sleeping.  Not only is he awake, but now he is hurt and pretty pissed off about it.  I reach out to move the book and soothe his aching head.  ""I'm sorry Brother.  Brother, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I dropped the book.  I'm sorry. It's an accident.  Accident.""  Sure, she's apologetic now.  It gives her something else to talk about.  But now I'm mad and tired and cranky and a bit hungry (postpartum dieting, ya know) and in my sternest not-even-6am-tone tell her to go back to her room.    As she sadly drags her feet back to her room, I feel a twinge of guilt.  She is still talking, apologizing profusely.  And talking about her book, it's whereabouts her main concern.  Her cute pink jammies and her ringlets of red were too much for my soft, mushy heart.  I tell her not to go. It  was   afterall an accident and I shouldn't have been upset with her.  Just as she is about to exit the doorway, she turns back, reaches out to the light switch and out from the ceiling pours the most blinding light I've ever seen.  ""Read my book to me?"" she asks.  ""I wanna read my book.  I turned the lights on to read my book.  I hit brother with the book.  It is an accident.  I'm sorry brother.  Read my book now, Mama?""  I beg her to turn the light off.  ""Brother is trying to sleep.""  ""No, Mama, Brother's awake.  He's aWAKE.""  And with that she crawls into bed and lies on top of him, her entire two year old body on his slight four month old frame.  Over her shoulder, through her locks of bed head, I see his big toothless grin beaming ear to flapless ear with love and adoration.    ""Yep.  He's awake now.  Brother certainly is awake.""  With that, I climbed out of bed and we began our day... even though it was still dark outside."
X4JTJ1O,female,33,"I had to go to Walmart this morning.  I had to go early because I wanted to get my Martha Stewart supplies to craft myself another glorious Mother's Day.  Read my post below for more on that.  We arrived around 8am.  I hadn't brushed my teeth or Reilly's hair, but we were there early and I planned on whizzing through the store like a bee in a flower bed and being back at the ranch before 10am.  That was the plan.  And ya know what they say about plans... the best laid plans of mice and housewives often go straight to hell.  I started off by going over to the t-shirt section. I needed to get some plain old white t-shirts.  As I am looking at the shirts, the bathing suits which were sinisterly displayed right behind me, caught my eye.  I really need a new suit since we have a beach date planned with some bikini clad skinny moms on Wednesday.  I look like a milk cow next to them, but at least if I had a new suit I could pretend like I fit in.    I was magnetically pulled over to the bathing suits with my daughter following behind me.  She was pushing a hand basket across the wood flooring, scraping and scratching it with each step she took.  ""Reilly, please pick up the basket.""  ""No.""  She no longer even pretends to obey me.    I was looking through bathing suits in sizes that a few years ago I didn't even know existed.  It was so depressing.  I wasn't in the mood to play around with my toddler and her shopping basket.  I leaned down to pick up the basket.  In an attempt to get away from my reach, she rammed my calf with it.    ""Ouch!!""  I cried out in genuine pain.  ""What's wrong, Mama?""  Her favorite question.  ""You hit me with that basket.  Now give me that."" I said and took the basket away.  ""What's wrong, Mama?""  She asked again.  This question is only fun if asked a minimum of ten times preferably in a 30 second time span.  ""I just told you what was wrong, Reilly.  Please, let me look at these bathing suits in quiet.""  ""What's wrong, Mama?""    ""Please, Reilly.""  ""What's wrong, Mama?""  She continued on for about two minutes like this.  At about the one minute mark I quit playing.   Finally I found a couple of suits to try on and marched us all over to the fitting room.  As I was starting to undress, Reilly switched gears.  ""Whatchya doing?"" she asked.  ""Trying on bathing suits."" I informed her little inquisitive mind.  ""Trying on bathing suits?"" She was requesting confirmation.  Maybe I hadn't been as clear as I thought.  ""Uh huh.""  ""Whatchya doing, Mama?""  This is her second favorite repetitive grilling.  This one also continues and is more fun when asked a minimum of 10 times in a 30 second time span.  ""I just told you.""  I wasn't going to fall into her toddler lair.  ""Trying on bathing suits?""  I didn't respond.  I just fell silent and continued disrobing.  ""Whatchya doing?  Whatchya doing, Mama?""  She continued, undaunted by my silence until she looked and saw Roman holding my bra up to his mouth.  ""Roman!  Don't do that rrrrrriiiiight nooooow!!!!!  That's disgusting!!!"" She ripped it out of his grasp so quickly that she didn't even have a good grip on it herself.  It tumbled onto the ground and slid across the freshly waxed, shiny tile floor of the changing room and landed, I assume, somewhere near the feet of the attendant who so kindly giggled and then handed it over the door to me.  With a new bathing suit in the basket that Reilly was now carrying despite the fact that it was almost half her height, we headed over to the craft aisle.  I needed felt for the inside of the never-to-be-made cigar box purses.  As I am looking around, Roman begins fussing.  I tried to sooth him by rocking the stroller a bit, but no dice.  I figured he was ready for a little morning nap so I flipped the back to the stroller to get him in a lying down position.  Unfortunately, the lever slid too quickly and fell backwards with a loud thunk and a shrieking cry.    All the other women in the craft department looked at me like I was Mommy Dearest or something.  I don't know what all those women were doing in the craft section at that hour in the morning anyway.  I don't know where  their  kids were.  But they were there, six of them, all shooting eye daggers in my direction.  One even gasped and then said to him, ""Oh, my poor baby!""  Who's baby?  Who the hell are you, Miss Nosy Busy Body.  I picked up crying baby boy with the bonked head and that's when the smell hit me.  And every other nose in the joint.  He had a buttload of stink bomb poop in his diaper.    The same Miss Nosy Busy Body peeks over and says, ""No wonder he was crying. I'd cry too if I had to sit in that.""  Huh.  Then my daughter chimed in with her little rap that while painfully cute in the privacy of our own home is just plain painful in the craft section of Walmart at 8:30 in the morning with Miss Nosy Busy Body looking on.   ""Who got the poops?  Say it!  Roman got the poops.  Roman got the poops.  Roman got the poops.""    ""How cute,"" drips Nosy Bee.  ""Even your daughter is telling you to change his diaper.""  I managed to squeak out a weak smile while positioning Roman so as to not leak the slimy, mustard yellow baby poop on my shirt.  I looked over at Reilly and she was now bouncing with her rhyme.    ""Who's got the poops?  Say it!""  then she pointed to Nosy Bee who responded with,  ""Roman's got the poops.""    ""Roman's got the poops.  Roman's got the poops.""  The two, my traitor daughter and the childless Nosy Busy Body, rapped a poop duet to stinky, screaming, bonked head, dirty diaper boy with the unusually populated craft section looking on.      I clutched Reilly's hand mid rap and marched us all to the bathroom.  After I had Roman all cleaned up, I decided that it might be a good idea for Reilly Kate and I to use the toilet as well.  I put her on first amidst cries of ""No!  Don't have to.  I can't do that right now!"" and ""I can't want to use the potty!!  I can't go pee pee!  I can't!""  There she sat as time ticked on and my bladder got fuller and fuller.  It is horrible to have to stand there waiting for your toddler to go while listening to other people going and toilets flushing and water running.  I swear one day I will wet my pants in that situation.    About five minutes into Reilly's toilet protest, a woman came in who had, from the sounds and smell of it, a bad case of diarrhea.  The poor woman must have been really suffering.  Public bathrooms echo horribly as it is, but this particular bathroom, located near the layaway counter in the dead middle of the store, has almost no privacy.  You can hear all that goes on inside from the outside.  Diarrhea woman let out volley number one followed by a courtesy flush.  The second volley hit the toilet as the smell of volley number one hit the air.  And then it hit Reilly.  ""Mama!  Someone is pooping in here!!!"" her voice smacked the walls and reverberated throughout the bathroom, echoing loud enough that the workers at the lay away counter heard it all, I'm sure.    ""Yes, Roman did poop in here."" I was hoping to redirect her attentions.  ""No!  Not Roman.  Some lady.  She's in here.  She's pooping.  It's stinking.  Some lady got stinky poops.""  I heard someone in the bathroom laugh.  I was crimson with embarrassment, my own and Diarrhea woman's.  ""Roman did have stinky poops.""  I'm not sure why I think I can pull this off.  Even if I succeeded in redirecting her attention, she speaks so clearly that no one would ever misunderstand her.  ""Not Ro-MAN!  No!  Some lady.  Right there!"" she pointed at the stall wall.  ""Some lady right there has stinky poops.  I can hear 'em.""  She loudly sniffed the air.  ""I can smell 'em!!  Them's stinky!!""  There was more laughing from the bathroom.  I whispered in her ear in as harsh a tone a whisper will allow, ""Stop that.  That isn't nice.  Just stop talking about it.  Please.""  She whispered back, as loudly as a whisper will allow, ""No.  Those are stinky poops.  I can smell 'em.  It's stinky in here.""  Then back to her normal thunderous volume,  ""Spray, Mama.  Spray in here!""   She pointed to some air freshener that was sitting on the toilet paper dispenser.  Unfortunately, it was empty.  There was nothing I could do at this point.  I quickly got her off the toilet and we left the bathroom with her talking about the stinky poops the whole time.  I, by the way, still had a full bladder having not yet used the toilet myself.  As we exit, there were some workers sitting on a bench next to the bathroom door laughing their heads off.  Reilly looked at them and pointed from where we just came.  ""It's stinky in there.  Some lady's got some stinky poops in there.  Them's stinky!""   I pulled her arm and dragged her off as she was saying, ""Spray's empty.  Mama's gonna buy some spray for that lady's stinky poops.  In there!!""  I didn't turn around, but I heard howling laughter behind me.  I just hoped that Diarrhea woman didn't work in Lay Away.  When we had almost completed our shopping trip, I told Reilly Kate that we could go through the toy department.  Reilly is very serious about toy shopping.  She went up to each toy that interested her and discussed it's merits.  ""This one's blue.""  ""It's got dinosaurs on it."" ""The dog is pretty.""  Then she saw it.  An African American baby doll with little pig tails and a purple back pack.  I immediately told her to put it back.  We have about 25 dolls at home and she plays with just one.  I was not about to buy and bring home another orphaned baby doll.  No way.  We were just about to get knee deep into toy negociations when I spotted Disney dress up dresses for $20.  My girlfriends have repeatedly told me to get Reilly Kate some dress up, pretend clothes and accessories.  ""She'll play by herself for hours,"" they tell me.  ""They may be expensive, but worth every penny,"" they reassure me.    I gravitated toward the Cinderella blue one with thoughts of a mini break this afternoon.  My vision is filled with Reilly in her room, dancing with an imaginary prince at a make believe ball while I miraculously craft the Mother's Day gifts together making the 4pm postal deadline.    With a far off, dream like look in my eyes, I ran my hand over the Snow White red and blue signature garment.  I only had one free hand, as I held a now clean diapered but still fussy Roman.  I balanced the Sleeping Beauty pink lacey sparkle gown on a pinky and the Cinderella shiny, pale blue one on my forefinger.  I turned toward Reilly and with a voice filled with hope and anticipation, I asked,  ""Which princess gown would you like?  Cinderella or --""  I didn't get the chance to finish.  ""No. I can't want that. I want my baby.""  She cuddled the little baby doll with the purple backpack while glaring an evil glare at my hopeful handful of play garments.  I was losing my afternoon dream.  My chest started to tighten and my eyes filled with tears.  ""No. No. No.  You want one of these.  You want one.  You like being the princess. These are princess dresses.  Here. We'll try one on you.""  I quickly undid the velcro fasteners with trembling fingers and brimming eyes.  ""I can't want that.  No!  No!  Aaaaahhhhh aaaaahhhhh...."" She took off running at a break neck speed, racing against me through the toy aisles, dodging the books and stuffies strewn about.    I shifted Roman under my arm like a football, and chased after her with cheap taffeta and fake sequins flying along beside me.   ""You love Cinderella!"" I called out to her.  ""Just try it on!!""  ""My baby!!! My baby!! I want my baby"" she answered, clinging desperately to the African American pigtailed doll as she sprinted through the video department.  I caught up with her over by electronics, right in front of the big screen TV's.  I held her tight between my knees since I had no free hands.  She was fighting like a crazed pig before the slaughter.  I had the Cinderella dress undone and ready to put over her bobbing head as she screeched.  ""Please, no!!  I want my baby. No dress.  No Cinderella. NO!!!!""  A man's low, baritone voice stopped me as I was about to pop the pretend gown over her head.  ""She don't want that.""  I looked up and saw an old man standing in front of the biggest television in the store.  He was leaning against a rack of movies, wearing 100 year old flip flops and a t-shirt that read, ""Eddie Would Go.""    ""She should watch this movie.""  As he talked, I noticed that a couple of his front teeth were missing.  It made him lisp a little.  ""It's like Hawaiian.""  I stopped what I was doing and watched the screen.  It was a movie with ships and Russell Crowe.  I flipped through my memory banks and replied, ""It's Master and Commander, isn't it?""  which is nothing like Hawaii, I wanted to add, but didn't.  ""Yeah.  Just like Hawaii.  She don't want that thing.  You put it back.  She want to watch this movie.  It like Hawaii.""  And that was that.  Reilly released the baby doll and I in turn released Reilly from the clutches of my knees.  I shoved the doll along with the dress up gowns in with the work out videos while Reilly sat in front of the huge television next to toothless, old Hawaiian dude.    ""I told you.  She don't want that.  She like this movie.""  He said again before drifting off to look at digital cameras.  I lured Reilly Kate away from the movie with the promise of a lollipop and we were back home a few minutes before noon.  So much for a quick, early morning Walmart trip, eh?"
WVESAHK,male,27,"This Blog is about El Salvador, a country regarding which Western public opinion knew next to nothing before the early 1980's when it came perilously  close to being taken over by the leftist rebels. What little the public learned after that point came largely from newsreels of the conflict, orfrom simplistic, cartoon-grade depictions of certain events, such as those offered by the films ""Salvador"" and ""Romero.""  The public at large was told only the worst about El Salvador, and incompletely at that, creating a woefully skewed, distorted and inaccurate picture of events there. for example, it learned that Monsignor Romero was brutally assasinated while saying mass--but no that he was known to be harboring terrorists in his church; that four nuns were raped and murdered on the airport road, but not that they were supporters of the rebels; and that six Jesuit priests and their housekeepers were shot to death in their beds, but not that those priests were openly collaborating with the insurgents' ""final offensive.""  International public opinion was outraged to learn that the Salvadorean government was doing little to bring the perpetrators to justice, even though there seemed to exist ample evidence of rightist ""death squad"" involvement in those crimes. Human rights groups did not tire of reminding anyone who would listen of that fact; many in the U.S. Congress did listen, with the result that the U.S. military assistance program became hostage to those accusations.  Given the abuse heaped on the government (and on the military and on the political right), and since little was heard about attrocities committed by the extreme left, it is not surprising that many informed people the world overtended to feel at least some simpathy for the rebels' cause.  That is not to suggest that the charges made by human rights monitors were entirely devoid of merit; those charges were indeed supported by credible evidence which pointed in the direction of reactionary fanatics. But having said that, it is of more than passing interest that so little attention was paid to kidnappings and murders ascribable to leftist extremists, whose crimes were carried out with even greater impunity than the ones mentioned because no international pressure was being exerted to prosecute them.  This Blog does care about those forgotten victims; it tells thir untold story. It begins with a recounting of the author's own experience as a kidnap victim of the ""F.P.L"" (Popular Liberation Forces - Farabundo Marti), a harrowing tale of brutality and endurance. It goes on to identify dome of the other well known victims and present, in graphic detail, their tragic abductions and murders. It discusses the family and professional backgrounds and achievements of the victims, placing them all in context. It describes the agony suffered by a victim's family while waiting for some word from the kidnappers; the frustration and difficulty encountered in seeking to raise huge sums of money to pay ransoms; the kidnappers' sadistic periods of silence; the discovery of a bullet-ridden corpse in an abandoned car, or, what's perhaps worse, the permament disappearance of a loved one.  This Blog also examines the political context in which the crimes were committed, underscoring the disturbing lack of interest which the government showed in tracking down the perpetrators, or even launching a preliminary investigation. That official indifference is aptly illustrated by the shocking fact that although leftist  kidnappers collected scores of millions of dollars in ransoms, not a single penny was ever recovered nor a single perpetrator ever convicted. The author offers several theories for such egregious nonfeasance, ranging from governmental complicity in the crimes to the government's fear of being accused of violating the human rights of the leftist kidnappers, a charge which easily could have resulted in a suspension of the U.S. aid.  There is a revealing chapter on the role played by the Carter Administration in the bogus coup which brought the first leftist junta to power in 1979. That inglorious piece of American diplomatic history would only be compunded by the ensuing U.S. sponsored agrarian reform program, which the author exposes as having been an ""unmitigated disaster.""   No!  those are not the kinds of things people have been told about El Salvador. Nor have they been told, as this Blog tells them, that El Salvador is a panoramic place, especially during the winter months, when ""agricultural activity is at its peak..., and the land takes on the greenish hues of its plantations;"" or that the Salvadorean patriot, Jose Simeon Canas, called for the abolition of slavery in Central America 40 years before Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation; or that the Salvadorean people are known to be the among the most hard-working and hospitable in the hemisphere.  This Blog is, in a word, by and about a man who deeply loves his country; a man who worked hard to achieve success, only to see the fruit of his labor confiscated by military squadrons; a man who did not abandon his country during its darkest days, but stayed on, hoping to save it from the abyss; a man who nearly paid with his life , simply for being the true and brave patriot that he is.  Americans and others are wise to read this blog and learn from it. At a time when the United States and Western European countries are becoming increasingly involved in establishing, restoring or preserving ""democracy"" in diverse foreign lands, it is vital to avoid repeating past mistakes. To enlarge upon George Santayana's often quoted phrase, ""those who do not fully understand their past follies, may be condemned to repeat them.""  New York, New York 1993"

WVESAHK,male,27,"Ahora se cierra la negociacion para que el ¨Cañon Zurdo¨ Roberto Carlos siga en el club hasta la temporada 2008.  Esto le viene bien a un Real Madrid lleno de galaticos, pero que en la temporada pasada muchos contratos llegaban a su final generando incertidumbre entre los integrantes del club. Un factor que psicologicamente no deja de afectar a la quimica del plantel con la llegada de figuras como David Beckham.  Al finalizar la temporada 2003-2004 El Real Madrid perdio los titulos que esperaba pero ha recuperado a las piezas importantes y a los lideres del club. Ya vimos como Zizou fue la primer renovacion del club hasta el 2007, ahora ante toda las ofertas de Roman Abramovich se logra llegar a un acuerdo con Roberto Carlos para que siga en el club hasta finalizar su carrera.   No dejemos de mencionar lo bien que va ha estar la zaga del Real Madrid la proxima temporada con figuras como Michel Salgado que ha sido un verdadero pilar en la defensa junto a la mejora de Raul Bravo que ahora es ya un internacional Español y que regresa de la Eurocopa en un estado optimo de rendimiento. Ahora hagamos enfasis en la cantera y en el hecho de que ya Alvaro Mejia ha firmado su primer contrato profesional con el Madrid al finalizar la temporada debido a la excelente jornada que tuvo en primera division y la Champions haciendo un partido estelar ante el conjunto Bavaro Bayern Munich.   Bueno.......he comentado un poco sobre los jugadores que ya tiene el Real Madrid, ahora  agreguemole los nuevos fichajes incluyendo al ex-madridista Camacho quien dirigira al club en la temporada 2004-2005 y por supuesto el regreso de el ´MORO´ quien a traves de MARCA ya confirmo su regreso al club y su deseo de seguir en el mismo. El internacional central Walter Samuel, una persona que muchos califican como el mejor en su posicion o el equivalente a un galactico en la defensa. Y mientras sigo escribiendo sobre mi pasion por el Real Madrid en estos momentos se negocia con la Real Sociedad para poder hacer posible el traspaso del jugador Xabi Alonso.  Sin mas, me despido..........(solo imaginense la proxima temporada)"

WVESAHK,male,27,"En 1983 me acuerdo que durante recreo en 3er o 4to grado unos niños habian llevado en aquel entonces un walkman a la escuela y me dieron a probar mi primera dosis de un sonido exquisito el cual llegaria a conocer como Heavy Metal.  Nunca supe cual fue la banda pero me dejo muy inquieto aquel sonido de guitarras agudas en sintonia de una linea de bajo agresiva con la voz gritona de el cantante. Solo recuerdo que uno de los momentos que mas han marcado mi niñez fue cuando mi mama me llevo al Super Sonido de la Plaza Caribe en aquel entonces, por supuesto a peticion mia. Y al entrar a aquel lugar me atendio una señora odiosa que trataba que yo escuchara musica de Plaza Sesamo u otro conjunto para niños tipo Cri-Cri.  Cuando me acerque a uno de los mostradores en la pared recuerdo haber visto una seccion con señores de pelo largo y guitarras en forma de estrellas; esto me provoco curiosidad. Sin embargo de todos los cassettes que tenian en display habia uno en particular con una portada que mostraba a un caballero en jeans, chumpa de cuero rojiza, y una mascara de metal. Simplemente hice click con la portada y decidi realizar la compra por tan autentica portada del cassette.  Cuando me subi al carro con mi mami, le pedi que no lo queria escuchar hasta que llegaramos a casa y el viaje de la plaza caribe hasta la colonia San Francisco se sintio eterno. Pero cuando llegamos me acuerdo perfectamente de la ilusion de un niño abriendo su primer cassette frente a la grabadora, pocos minutos despues empezo una voz muy distinguida a sonar con una cancion que revolucionaria los años 80. Se trataba de la cancion #2 CUM ON FEEL THE NOIZE"
WVESAHK,male,27,"El domingo empieza nuestro mundialito....  Nuestra seleccion se caracteriza por la baja produccion y malos resultados, y nuestra aficion siempre responde de manera incondicional cuando empieza una eliminatoria a un mundial.  Ya saboreamos el triunfo y creo que la poca madurez de los jovenes en la seleccion nacional es que no supieron asimilar el exito logrado en los juegos centroamericanos y del caribe. Fuimos campeones regionales a nivel olimpico pero mas aun inflo el ego de los muchachos a tal grado que ahora sienten menos el orgullo de vestir la camisola nacional y se enfocan mas en el aspecto economico de integrar la misma. Por que nadie de ellos se pregunta: Y si voy a un mundial se fijara en mi algun club reconocido tal y como sucedio con Jorge Gonzalez?  Quiero dejar claro que el problema no es el mal futbol. Nuestros jovenes han demostrado que poseen una gran batalla y que saben responderle a la aficion pero para ello tienen que afrontar los partidos con entrega y siempre ver al contrario con respeto y humildad.  Ya lo pasado quedo en libros, y el Mexico de los juegos centroamericanos y el caribe es diferente al Mexico de una eliminatoria mundialista. Y si ganamos el Domingo recordemos que Bermudas es un rival supuestamente facil, y que aun no hemos concretizado nada hasta clasificar a Alemania.  Ahora ya no es una pregunta de dinero sino de profesionalismo y caracter. Es hora de recuperar el orgullo que sintio la aficion hace 24 años cuando la humildad y la magia del once nacional lo dejo todo en la cancha!.....  Hasta mas tarde."
WVESAHK,male,27,"Tras la coronacion del Oporto en la Liga de Campeones de Europa, Portugal esta de fiesta.  A mi juicio los anfitriones de la Eurocopa son los que se consagraran como la mejor seleccion de Europa en dicho evento. No cabe mencionar que es una seleccion que aporta experiencia mundialista y madurez profesional. Los veteranos del equipo Rui Costa, Vitor Baia, Pauleta, Luis Figo, Fernando Couto, y Rui Jorge han tenido un excelente año en sus respectivos clubes y ahora podran remontar la mala experiencia del mundial Corea/Japon 2002. En especial quisiera hacer mencion de un jugador que en la pasada temporada ha dejado mucho de que hablar a pesar de su edad. Ese hombre se llama Luis Figo y llega a la Eurocopa en la mejor condicion fisica de su carrera futbolistica. Este año pasado aparecio en la mayoria de los partidos de Liga, Copa, y Liga de Campeones demostrando que es una figura vital para su seleccion y su club y con mucho futbol por delante.

OX45YLS,male,13,"""It is ony after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.""    -Like that person who made life seem worth living, who brightened every day for years until a blow-by-blow confession of horrendus sexual depictions and disloyal procedure sends shooting pain throughout your body and sinks the life- pumping-organ into shock and depraved convulsions.   Like the people who battled with you everyday and accompanied you through your most elating and disgusting experiences killing themselves, overdosing, being murdered or simply becoming so vulturous that mere contact is intolerable.   Or quite possibly the comfort found in a mothers touch through years of suffering, vomiting and torterous hospitalizations becoming suddenly distant until it is nonexistant and you only have the nervous twich and the screaming vocal punishments of a substitute to ease the pain.  Perhaps it is the dependance upon chemical numbness which has so lengthily created a tolerable existence becoming obsolete and over-destructive.  Maybe after the delusional dreams of youth which permeate every realistic endeavor are finally realized to be absurd.  Or every home-away -from-home, custom made to escape the realm of negative perception, fades into a wasteland of hatred and stupidity.   When institiutions no longer, protect or incarcerate or manufacture a sense or normality.   It is only after the loss of those, among many other things, that I am free to do anything.  Free to encompass myself with talented, well-directed people.  Free to run.  Free to quit school and join the circus.  Free to dance and sing and so many of the things that others are limited from by fear, embarrassment or material constraint.  Free to appreciate the last years of the family I have left.   Free to, one day, really connect with a woman in a spiritual manner and discover the euphoria of unity.  It is only with a feeling of complete hopelessness that divine possibility unfolds for me every second.  When comfort is not an option the only way is up and  I live every day like it's my mutherfuckin last one.   So many analyze and bitch about the most trivial of problems so frequently that nausea deepens in me.  It's time to go back to our roots.  Technology and distraction have robbed us of our right to experience more primal interactions.  If Tyler durden had not blown up his condo he would've never attained enlightment.  The purpose was to become life, not the perpetual search for materialism.  While at present, material posessions are abound, they are and have always been an unnessary stimulus for the soul.  Given the depletion of necessary nourishment which grants a human to flourish,  physical luxuries are frequently disposed of and or ignored.  ""It is only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything"" is just one of the ""Durdenisms"" that become very inspiring after everything goes wrong or circumstances are unbearable.  ""You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else, all part of the same compost heap.""  That is another universal truth that puts into perspective the utter predictability and irrelevance of the universe.  Quite often when nirvana isn't acheived, it is useful to discover peace in fatality.  ""Stop being perfect and let the chips just fall where they may.""  ""You are not your job.  You are not how much money you have in the bank.  You are not the car you drive.  You are not the contents of your wallet... You're not your fuckin khakis.""  How incredibly those obvious facts facilitate the true essence of life.    But that's just Tylers view.  Thats what you use as an after effect.  When you are about to engage a situation, no matter what the circumstance, Tony Montana is the source of inspiration with which best to enter.   ""Me, I want whats coming to me... the world, chico... and everything in it.""  Especially considering the context of the character: broke, bottom rung criminal refugee with no education, freshly shipped to the United States, with nothing to look foreward to but death or incarcaration, one can gain an incredible sense of empowerment from Scarface.   ""First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the woman.""  -a formal plan for success.  ""I bury those cock-a-roaches!""  -as far as mantras go, it's about as good as you can get for aggressive and optimistic positive affirmation.  ""I eat that fucka for breakfast.. shut that fucka down.""  -also attains the desired effect.  ""Wanna go to war!?""  quite frequently amps the adrenaline to an appropriate level so that maximum performance is achieved for a job, school, courtship, feud, fight, or any endeavor.  Although not verballed by Tony, this statement was made to him as he was losing touch with his own philosphy:  ""Every day above ground is a good day.""  -cannot be reiterated enough, we only get ONE shot at this so lighten the fuck up and cherish every minute."

OX45YLS,male,13,"Whomever is responsible for the blog, I’m assuming not Ms. Eaton, is quite possibly the most disturbed journalist we have amongst us, or at least that’s the way it appears.  If there is a more troubled individual on the list, their angst-ridden soul is only visible through their comments about others and their environment.  This person, posting themselves as “Ryan,” quite eloquently expresses the darkest and most pessimistic of thoughts, by using simplicity as a most effective force.  Posts such as “jesus h fucking christ life is hell” quite significantly purvey a deep understating of harsh reality.  If one is able to relate to such a statement, admiration for their straightforward nature immediately resides.  That is the only comment for the entire entry at 10:28 PM.  The next jewel of wisdom bestowed upon us occurs at 6:41 PM and is impossible for the same Wednesday according to the Gregorian calender system, which would lead one to believe that we cannot trust our author, at least not for accurate data entry.  Emotional content, perhaps, is another story.  It appears this person was forced to write a blog even if they had nothing to say.  Even in such a vacuous environment, the inner person seems to reveal itself.  Self exposure was probably assisted by the forced entry, much like a Rorschach test.  For instance, “ihateyaihateyaihateyaihateyaihateyaihateya”  does a magnificent job of communicating frustration.  Other entries, such as “I have nothing to say.  I have so little to say.  So I won’t say what I have left to say.  Which is really close to nothing.  So you see nothing.  Which is all I have to say.”  reveal the hopeless nature of the individual while simultaneously divulging a clever mentality.   More impressive mental acuities become present as reading continues.  Philosophical questioning, pertaining to human existence and religion follow.  Talk of mass destruction and world termination would lead us to believe that, while pensive and intellectual, this person is quite depressed and pessimistic.  A most impressive analysis of American socio-political values concludes; “Life and liberty for everyone.  Of course the developed world doesn’t extend to the ghettos and black people.”   Overall I am impressed with this persons passion, as dark as it may be and ability to communicate bluntly.  I feel that if more time were spent, they would be able to expose a plethora of philosophical debate, however therapy may be needed."

OX45YLS,male,13,"Dirt.  Dust.  Sweat..  ""Mbwa-dach-teret-dach""  and my personal digital assistant, hi-8 camcorder, cellular phone, clean white air force ones, dry-cleaned shirt and caucasian entourage.  They played the song they play when a king arrives.  We were just a news crew, but they thought what we were doing was deserving of royal treatment.  We were giving credibility to their medical technique.  Though stationed in an uncomfortably small hut and surrounded by grime, these people had successfully figured out how to treat the AIDS virus.  This was worthy of flying across the world, being subjected to discomfort, harrassed and assaulted by the natives and traveling long and bumpily through the worst heat known to man and finally arriving in the village of fatik.  I, carrying a tripod through the sandy walk across the village, could feel the astonishing eyes of men, women and children gazing at me with more intensity than I'd ever felt, even on stage.   The first white people they had ever seen unloaded advanced recording equipment from a van and began to document their lives.  They studied us as we studied them, probably with more curiosity, since we had all seen people like this on television, but they had never seen anything like us.  What a remarkable circumstance that such drastically different forms of evolution were taking place on the same planet.  Us, with our digital revolution and them, with their spitritual practices.  Who was I to be so deserving of fresh, clean comfort in the United States while these people transported nourishment from the only water source, miles away from home, upon thier heads?  Immediate guilt ensued.  Never stepping out of the spotlight and in a constant state of awe, I began to shrink front of these most basic, simplistic humans.  Walking around, as we do in this country, even in the most poverty striken of areas, cannot compare to the feeling one encounters in the midst of those in Fatik.  But perhaps my entire dishonor about being a ""priveleged"" American was false.  Perhaps these people were completely satisfied with their way of life and felt sorry for us, being so entrenched in a materialistic world, and it was arrogant to assume that everyone else on the other side of the globe wants to be like us.  Either way, I discovered the most enchanting reletionship I'd ever experienced with the young Abladoof, a little boy who took a serious liking to my personal video camera.  Against better judgment I let him touch buttons, aim and point the camera at everything he wanted.  He behaved remerkably well and treated my equipment with utmost care.  His friends exitedly gathered as the little boy and I bonded, in spite of our language barrier, for several minutes, completely flabberghasted that I chose him over the others.  He was just too cute.  I never saw such a glowing energy of life as in the eyes of young Abladoof.  He calmly followed me around everywhere for the entire day.  So in the place most different than any I would ever enounter, and where the people couldn't be more opposite, I discovered the most memorable relationship to date.   Unfortunately it came time to bid farewell to the boy with whom I had grown so fond.  I gave him all the francs I had and some candy that I made him eat in front of me so I wouldn't be attacked by the other children.  He waved frantically as we exited the premisis with our footage and I thought of how I was taking away something far more profound than the story we were there to document.  When I graduate to a digital camera, I want to send my 8 millimeter to Fatik addressed to Abladoof.  I've been instructed that it would only create a destructive situation for the boy considering the jealous nature of human beings.  Either way I will always remember my little man in that dusty village where they cure AIDS."

OX45YLS,male,13,"evan struck me as an immature teenager, probably sixteen or seventeen years old with quite a bit of nervous habits, including chewing his lip, tapping any part of his body, twitching various parts and some strange rolling maneuver with his thumb and forefinger.  He seems to think quite a bit of himself and I wonder if his head will explode from ego.  I was immediately dissuaded by his uncontrollable mouth.  He's almost cute but blurts the most inappropriate phrases and comebacks ever known to man at the worst possible times and doesn't seem to have any regard for anyones feelings.  even his own.  He will casually remark about his own self destructive nature as if there were no choice in the matter.  If he's not doing that he's making some overt sexual remark, intended either to humor or attract, I don't have the slightest inkling, but neither works for me.   Forced to spend more time than I would've liked with him, proved to be a revelation.  He is in fact, 24, quite a bit older than I would've ever guessed, especially considering his vulgar, immature sense of humor and juvenile style.  He has quite a bit of rationale for his choice of attire and youthful appearance.  He explained that Hip Hop culture has been such an emmense part of his life that he will always be inclined to represent the aspects of the movement in some form.  His choice for early ingestion of intoxicants and genetic disposition serve as a possible explanation for his appearance.  Or, he says, just ""luck.""  ""It helps me justify playing like a kid"", an activity without, he reveals, may find life intolerable.  As he explains his circumstance, his eyes become intense and sad and I can see the pain beneath his cavalier demeanor.  He was encompassed by negative people from an early age and exposed to quite a bit of unpredictable and dangerous predicaments.  Most of the people with whom he learned to associate were very blunt, abrasive individuals.  It is that for which he attributes his innappropriate vocal nature and social challenges.   Although self sought, he accepts responsibility for many of his skewed beliefs and actions.   He expresses a desire to be more ""normal.""  He starves for female attention and is very lonely since his mothers departure during his teenage years.  Near death experiences, years of abandonment, abuse, social disfunctionality, depression and self-hatred, have left him open to new experience and a serious lust for a gratifying life.  He is also a manic depressive with extreme paranoia.  After listening to the details of many misfortunes, I'm amazed that he's able to cope as well as he is with such an enthusiastic attitude, the only noticable after-effects being some nervous twitches and occassional slip of the tongue.  I feel sorry for him and have an urge to hold him and take care of him unless he slips back into his normal motus operandi.  His ability to articulate and analyze is profound and I can hardly believe he is the same man whom I thought so lowly of at first meeting.             - what Brooke told me"

OX45YLS,male,13,"""having the ability or power to create.""  That over-simplified dictionary definition of the word 'creativity' doesn't quite encompass the essence of originality and deep expressiveness of the word when applied to authentic artists.  People merely ""create"" all the time.  I know a girl who writes what she calls ""poems"" about  rugs and swimwear that are ten words long and I would hardly call her ""creative.""  My step-dad used to make wooden birdhouses and household utility objects and I would also not label him a ""creative.""  Yes, indeed, they did ""create"" something, However creative merit, I believe, should be judged by depth of human understanding and the ability to communicate beauty and emotion in a particular artistic endeavor.  Yes, poems do consist of simple things like rugs and swimwear but there is something about the project that makes us marvel at that persons perception of those things or the spiritual revelation of, or perhaps disgust at those things along with their ability to interest us in why they are what they are and how they arrived at such an understanding.  The manner in which the art is presented.  Poems can also be quite simple in structure but the choice of words have such an impact that makes one recognize the true creative genius of what they have compiled.  It may be a simple brush stroke on a canvas and it may be the effortless placement of an object, but the interpreter needs some sort of personal fulfillment from that arrangement.  Some aspect of the product ""moves"" them.  It is a gift.  It cannot be taught.  (except at the circus)  It cannot be bought, although many artists experience capital gain from the distribution of their own creativity.   But that creativity will never be a tangible existence which can be transferred from one person to another, except through genetics.  Oh how I wish it were easier, I would have all the Cee-lo Greens copulate with the Eryka Badus havin little Tarantino and Scorcese babies rubbing on their Alan Balls.  But in a world where everyone was truly blessed with the gift, much like everything of any value, would we really be able to appreciate it or even distinguish it?  As far as my own creativity, I'm obviously unable to properly interpret, although I'm told my collage of the pillsbury dough boy is really ""neat.""  Limitations include the inability to transcend overtly sexual, violent, disgusting or in some way inappropriate references and imagery.  The hope is that through experience with greater minds, I will be able to one day see the world in a more universal format and have the opportunity to reach people via song, film or print.  The impact of others creativity on me is incomprehensable.  I literally owe my life to a number of musical talents, having had their songs pull me through unbearable moments and for providing the inspiration and confidence to save some of the minor successes I've been fortunate enough to keep.  Doubt anyone feels that way about my stepdads birdhouse."
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"I want to cry.  In fact, I think I will.  I discovered Saturday night that I have no serious piano pieces in my current repertoire.  How pathetic is that for a full-time musician with a degree in classical piano performance?  I can't play anything except musical theatre.  Here's the story... Jacob was here and we were just playing in my studio Saturday night.  We were playing Christmas duets, he on the student melody line and I on the teacher part. (Yes, I know it's May.)  He commented how he'd never heard me play any classical pieces.  So after much hemming and hawing (what a stupid phrase--where'd that come from?) I decided to play Debussy's Poissons d'or from Images book 2.  This whole book I performed from memory several times a few years ago.  Yet I sucked.  After about two pages I gave up in embarrasment.  He said it was great, but I know it wasn't.  And don't tell me I'm being too hard on myself.  Then I played a Chopin nocturne that I learned for my students' recital several months ago.  That wasn't quite as pathetic.  Pathetic.  And I'm actually considering graduate school right now.  Right.  love Meagan"

I was explaining it to the cast at my rehearsal tonight (yes, I know I'm supposed to be teaching them music, but, well, true to the heirarchy, I had to talk about my hurting teeth.).

It started out just talking about Connect the Dots and the struggles the company has in the community with discrimination and then ended up being not just a friendly discussion about the homophobic Grants Pass but morphed into being about them not paying me fully.  I guess that bugs him more than I thought.  I hadn't realized.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  I love my husband lots.  More than music and Madeline and Poco and strawberries and chocolate and martinis and Debussy and lipstick and Sondheim and Diet Coke and anything else that is a favorite thing of mine.  love Meagan"
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"...""never know your luck when there's a free-for-all""  The above is my current favorite lyric from Les Miserables.  It reminds me of Sweet & Hot.  Yes, I've got to complain about Sweet & Hot once more.  Just once more.  Well, we still have three shows to go, so it might be more than once.  So David E. Weck, read with discretion.  I think you're the only one in this production that might read this.  But you probably agree with all I'm saying anyways. And you'll know that anything insulting I might type probably doesn't apply to you!  Right?  All happy.  Good.  (HI JACOB!  WE'RE ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW AND WHEN YOU READ THIS TONIGHT YOU CAN SAY ""HEY KOOL SHE WAS TALKING TO ME WHILE WRITING THAT AND I WAS IN THE LOUNGE TALKING TO RUBY."")  So Sweet & Hot.  Still subtitled ""Sucks & Sucks"".  But it is getting better every single show.  In fact, that's quite nice.  The cast sems to be loosening up, starting to interact with the audience some.  The weirdest thing I think is during the dance breaks, whether solo or everybody, they just silently go through the steps.  It's not that it's un-energetic, it's just...un-emotional.  Yeah, that's it.  There's no emotional involvement.  But why should there be?  I don't think the director did any sort of character development with the cast at all.  Yes, it's just a bunch of random songs loosely pasted together with a wimpy plot of sorts.  I did something really notnice at a rehearsal for this show recently.  I was so frustrated with the whole process at that moment that I wrote down all the things I could think of that were being done wrong (in my so very unhumble opinion).  Even though I would only share some of the things on my list with someone if they asked, it was still notnice of me to even put it down on paper and out of my head before I exploded.  Many of the things had to do with director/musicaldirector relationship or just the musical director's process.  I waffle (waffle--such a great verb!!) between being so glad I wasn't musical directing this and being so frustrated and working hard to keep my mouth shut since I'm not musical directing this.  Anyway.  Enough about that.  Katie, you mentioned wanting to come see ""Into the Woods.""  I'm not actually musical directing or performing in it...I'm just doing some emergency help.  (How do you know about this show, by the way?)  Crater is doing it and it's so sad how all the other high schools in this area do pretty decent musicals and my hometown is so pathetic.  My piano student Aaron is accompanying for them (which he does perfectly wonderfully okay) and at his first rehearsal he realized he was basically musical directing too as they have no other musicians/conductors involved.  And he's never done any theater before.  So as good as each individual seems to be, this show is definitely struggling.  Not to call myself any kind of expert, but I do think I'm a pretty decent musical director and it's nice to be able to come in as an outside person, be efficient, skilled, and immediately make things happen.  So that's been fun.  I went to one rehearsal last night (they only have two-hour rehearsals...that's something I'm going to suggest changing soon!) and will go a few times more next week after Sweet & Hot closes and before Fantasticks rehearsals start.  That one week I had a couple free evenings.  Oh well.  In Production and about to close: The Matchmaker (SOU/MD/recorded pianist) Little Shop of Horrors (CTD/MD) Sweet & Hot (CTD/accompanist)  In Rehearsal: Into the Woods (CPTA/guest MD) Carousel (RMT/I'm not really doing anything with this but I've been consulting with their MD a lot and I helped with auditioning/casting so it feels like I'm involved still)  Casting: Les Miserables (CTD/MD)  Auditioning: Fantasticks (CTD/MD)  Am I crazy?  Most people do one show at a time.  How is it that I am suddenly involved in, like a million and three shows?  Well that's what it seems like at times.  The times when I can't keep straight what song's from what musical.  It just requires me to pay more attention I guess.  And give up on trying to keep my house clean.  Ooooh.  That's hard for me.  New subject again.  So yay yay yay for Katie posting a comment!!!  I hope she read about herself in my first entry!  And yeah, I think it's weird too when people get really really personal in these things.  I bet it'd be a really interesting social psychology experiment to study the dynamics of why and what people type in a publicly online journal.   I guess it's cool that you can say whatever you want, but nobody should expect anything really juicy from me.  Just so you know.  :-)  Every now and then I might feel...voyeuristic.  But in general I'm sure my journal will be like ""this is what I did today.  I had ice cream.  Yum.""  Yeah.  Exciting stuff liike that.  And on and on and on about musicals.  Next time I think I'm going to talk about my mom.   love Meagan"
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"I know it's time to post a new entry to my blog.  I will soon.  And I  do  have things to say.  Really, I do.  Just not the time to write about it.  Well, I do have time today.  But I'm too busy relaxing right now.  And I have hiccups.  love Meagan"

0C3YRSQ,female,25,"Heellllloooooooo!  Well, it seems like I spend quite a bit of time lately reading other people's blogs online.  I suddenly seem to be quite interested in the mundane details of lives of those I don't really know very well or at all.  So...perhaps someone would be interested in mine!  I honestly can't imagine why.  I promise I'll try to be entertaining :-) but no guarantees.  I might have something exciting to say sometime.  So watch out!  At least I can promise to spell things correctly.  Complete sentences?  Now that's asking too much.  Especially if it's late at night.  I think my blog is starting out ugly.  I will find a way to make it prettier.  My new friend Erin (well, I've known her a few years and now we've hung out once and it was fun, so I guess I can call her ""my new friend Erin"") has one here that looks way cooler than mine.  Her blog's name is pezpoodle.  Or poodlepez.  I never can remember which.  Maybe she'll read this and set it straight.  And then there's livejournal.com.  Oh my.  An endless variety of fun things to read there.  I keep finding random journals related to all the various musicals I'm working on.  I find the best research really is just talking to people who've already done a particular show, so that's been way helpful.  I think I may become addicted.  I do tend to have an addictive personality.  Speaking of...I just finished my beer.  Grrrrrr.  :-)  Anyway, back to the allure of online fun. (Oh, that sounded bad)  Recently Jacob introduced me to friendster.com.  I'm still not sure what to do with it.  He's the only friend I've added and somehow it suddenly is telling me I have like 300 friends online.  I don't get it.  Connect the Dots (one of the theatre companies I work with often) has a message board on their website, but I think I'm the only one who looks at it regularly.  I really need to get out more.  The first person I need to tell about this blog is my dear friend Katie.  I bet she'd love reading it.  Maybe she already has one of her own.  Katie!!!!???? Are you out there???!!!!   So.  I'll find a theme of some sort for this blog soon.  Or at least some kind of through-line that makes it...um....suspenseful.  Yeah.  That's it!  Suspenseful.  Hmmm, yeah I don't know if that's the word for my life.    love Meagan"
0C3YRSQ,female,25,"The power of Blogger!  This evening at approximately 6:45 I read in ""My New Friend Erin's"" blog that tonight is Sonya's senior recital.  And by 7:15 I was out the door.  Were it not for Erin's blog, I wouldn't have even thought to go to the recital hall tonight to listen to an AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL vocal concert.  And I'm so glad I did!    It's rare for me to have a free evening.  ""Sweet & Hot"" opened Sunday and ""Matchmaker"" opened tonight (the two shows I was rehearsing for) so this Wednesday evening I really truly was planning to stay home.  So much for that.  I really don't like staying home.  I really need to work on the scores for ""Into the Woods,"" ""Les Miserables,"" and ""The Fantasticks"" for upcoming rehearsals, but it's not everyday I get to be out with friends so I've gotta take those opportunities when they come!  Right? And besides, I was at a classical voice recital.  That could be considered research.  It's not like I just went to the movies to see, say, ""13 going on 30"" (which, by the way, is a movie I really want to see.  Yeah, I know, that really shows you the depth of my cinematic choices.)  After the concert I went out with Jacob and Erin and I was so glad I went to the concert just for the opportunity to hang out with them.  Jacob and I got to be really close friends really fast and those kind of friendships sometimes scare me because they have a tendency to end as fast as they start.  And I don't want that to happen with him.  I hope it doesn't.  But I don't know how to stop it from fading away.  I still haven't figured out if it's just me, or just the way some friendships are.  Either way, I don't like it.  I hope we stay friends for a long time and keep getting to know each other more and more, even as new people come and go.  We have a lot in common as far as music goes and just having fun together and he's interested in God-stuff, so with those two topics we always have lots to talk about.  Note the title of this entry.  That's because everyone at our table at the bar tonight (besides myself, Jacob, and Erin) were smoking and I had to smell myself in the car the whole way home.  My first priority was to take a shower as soon as I got home (well, after saying hello to Poco and Madeline).  Does that make me obsessive-compulsive?  I mean, really, I live with a smoker (my husband Mike).  You'd think the smell wouldn't bug me.  But Mike only smells like smoke immediately after actually smoking.  When a bunch of people are smoking in a room like tonight it really sticks to clothes, hair, everything.  Grrrrrr.  Another way going out tonight was really just as productive as staying home and practicing----I met a guy at Alex's Bar that plays bass and is really interested in playing for me in ""Les Miserables.""  Yay!!!!  I've been hiring musicians for that this week so it is perfect that I met this guy.  I just hope he's good.  After all, hiring someone you just met over martinis (me) and beer (him) isn't really the most responsible job interview.  But hey, we're ""artistes!"", that's the way it's done!  I love my job.  Hey, Friends!!!!  I hope you'll give me a little comment when you read this, so I know you found it.  Just once.  Then if you're bored and never read again, well that's okay too.  Does it sound like I'm begging?  Oh well.  love Meagan"

364ERKD,female,24,"well it was a lovely day...  another A in the bag for me.  yay!  the gf and i got into a little argument.  it's amazing how two people whom are so alike in so many ways can have so many disagreements. ay.  then again, it makes sense doesn't it?  we both want the same thing; we have the same expectations, wait for certain responses, and crave the same attention.  when we BOTH want it, no one's willing to give in (or are aware that she should), leading to both of us being on the emotional receiving end with no one to give, and this results in SHIT.  then again, what's life without a little spice right?  take in a little of the crap with the really, really good?  yeah, that works for me.  man, i love this girl.  we just have to find a comfortable middleground that has yet to reveal itself.  anyway, enough of that.  i want a kitten, and my own place to live. lol.  and when i get older i'm going to retreat to the mountains and live like a hermit.  anyone wanna join me?"

364ERKD,female,24,"i've just woken up from what is quite possibly one of the most embarrassing and traumatizing nights of my life.  you know that whole saying: beer before liquor, never sicker...   well, even with ed repeating it over and over again (didn't know that til he told me this morning) my stubborn ass eventually took 3-4 shots of spiced rum (again, don't remember doing it) after already drinking somewhere between 5-8 beers (taking into account the beer bong, yes they had a beer bong).  consequently, this led to my clothes being changed by my aunt, throwing up on myself and on clothes that weren't mine, bro having to carry me to the van AND i throwing up on him too!  ...ahhhh blah!  man, someone please hide hard liquor when i'm drinking beer because i just don't know when to stop.  how sad!  anyway, i'm sure i had a good time, to what expense though.  haha.  terrible, just terrible.  i'll be posting the pics from this memorable night soon enough.  til then, here i'll be... recovering...    [laters]"
364ERKD,female,24,"alas, school is upon me once again, or should i say has been upon me for over a week now.  well, it's definitely keeping me busy.  english is intriguing as always--when presented with a good teacher, one who challenges all and everything at that.  nice, i love knowing that i'm learning, and when my assumptions are proven false, i know i'm learning.  right?  graphic design is fun.  i admit, it's a little frustrating as i know absolutely nothing about photoshop or any other software we will be exposed to, but nothing is better than jumping head first into a field you don't really know.  ok maybe not that bad, i AM an art major, but the technical computer stuff really throws me for a loop.  luckily i have girlfriend to come to my rescue (her being a graphic design major and all) and save me from all my troubles and worries.  which brings up another point.  it's funny because i see her more than anyone else, friends and what not, but i miss her the most.  maybe because ever since i've started school, we don't have as much of that lounging-around girlfriend down-time that always feels so nice.  however, things will change as this is her last week in school and she will be spending more of it here with me.  she even rescheduled her work availability so that she could take me to class on wednesdays (an anticipated horrendous two hr drive to LA during rush hour); isn't that the sweetest?  not the drive, but JESSICA.  anyway, i digress...  i apologize for the spaced out updates, but we all know how that is don't we.  gotta go, bram stoker's dracula awaits me.  by the way, i recommend the book to anyone; it seems that i'm hooked..."
364ERKD,female,24,"Hm.  See I told you it wouldn't last long.  Btw, belated Happy Holidays everyone.  So plans have changed, I am no longer going to Vegas with Mica, technically the ex, but she's closer to being a best friend.  We've had our ups and downs lately, but I'm glad that her and I can maintain a really good relationship despite how hurt she is.  Cece's another story.  That chick won't give me the time of day.  It's understandable I guess, but.. it still sucks.. oh well life goes on.  Anyway, I digress, I've come to the conclusion that going to Vegas with Mica and her friends might not be such a good idea since she's not completely healed, and I don't want to risk getting into an argument with her when I'm all the way over there with her and her friends.  That'd REALLY suck.  On top of that, we'd be drinking like mad women and everybody knows that drama and alcohol equals trouble, so needless to say, I'm looking for something else to do to bring on the new year.  Got any suggestions???    Christmas was nice.  It was for the most part quiet and intimate, or from what I heard from Mary, Kata used the word ""boring"".  I admit, it was pretty uneventful and it seemed to go just as quickly as it came, but being around family is always a comforting feeling, you just have to learn to appreciate it, I guess?  So, I had a good time.  I even got really cool presents this year.  Among them, a cool ass book called ""This Book Will Change Your Life"" from Urban Outfitters, a shot glass chess set (oo yeah baby), a stereo for my room (jealous huh?), and the goapele and dido cds (they freakin rock btw!).    K, well I should go.  I'm going to head down to San Diego and hit up ""Bad Kitty's""--an average girl club, but unfortunately the only one in daygo (unless you're wanting to put up with the lame music and way older crowd of ""the Flame"").  We  were  supposed to go with Kata and thems (and see Cece for the first time since the major drama hit san diego), but it I just found out they're not going anymore.  Cece doesn't feel like seeing me there (  her  or  she  is what she calls me.  I'm no longer worthy of a name, only pronouns. ay.)  Oh well.  We had enough respect to remain homebodies for the past three weeks when they went, so I'm not stressin.  I have no problem seeing anyone there, but hey, that just saves me the trouble of looking over my shoulder to see if I'm getting any death looks from anyone (more specifically my nemesis.)    One last thing, I'm planning a trip to Frisko the weekend after New Year's, so we'll see how that works out.  I made reservations already, but I have to work my ass off to actually pay when we check in. =X  I miss no. cali..  I hope everything turns out OK.  Anyway, I'm off.."
364ERKD,female,24,"First day of school.. not bad, not bad at all.  Of course, today and Thursdays consist of two art classes, so of course I'd enjoy it.  I've come to the conclusion that I absolutely love art and I kick myself in the ass for not getting into it sooner.  There's this painting class that I'm really excited about, so we'll have to see how that goes.  I've never really had any experience with paint with the exception of a class I took in Junior High, but even then I remember it sparking an interest.  I was debating on whether I should experiment with acrylics or oils, but the instructor said that if we were looking to compose abstract art (which seems more interesting to me, but I don't know) that acrylics would be easier because they dry faster and are more suitable for beginners anyway.  Anyway, it'll be fun..  K so one of my best friends and I had the funniest of funny conversations this evening.  He and I have come along way since we met three years ago.  I wish I had more friends like him in my life, but then that would take away from what we have, so scratch that thought.  I was venting to him earlier about the little things in life that have been irritating me.  Guys have this gift of seeing things in a whole different, less complicated, light.  I dunno, girls (and those who think they are..lol) are just drama sometimes--alot of times.  It's always a relief to talk to him, I can't think of one time where he wasn't  there  for me.  Especially now when it seems like everyone's doing their own thing, it's nice to have at least one familiar face keeping me grounded.  So, that's my thought for tonight."
364ERKD,female,24,"quick blog.  figure, it's been a while and since i'm not reaLLY doing anything except enjoying the company of my gf next to me while she works on her magazine layout (and oh how cute she is when she has her random bursts of creative ideas!).  she leaves today and though she's coming back tomorrow night after work, i'm still going to miss her.  it's so odd, being this attached to her when it's already been four months.  maybe it's because we don't live together because we all know everything changes when you move in with someone.  at least everyone that knows my past knows that that's how it is, or--is it just me? maybe.  hm, but we want to move in together eventually... i guess we'll see when that time comes, whenever it comes.  this semester is almost over.  i'm still undecided on what classes to take over the summer.  lanie and i might take a graphic design class with jason (my design teacher) only because it's computer lab time and we'd get to familiarize ourselves with adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator.  i figure, well, of course i'd benefit from it because it wouldn't hurt since i'm an art major anyway, and well, lanie being the future educator who is already familiar with similar programs (kinda sorta.  thanks to yearbook) could update her skills and help me out on the side too. haha.  well we'll see.  i am definitely taking a critical thinking class, so looks like leila will be writing some papers this summer.  holding off on deciding whether or not i want to join a figure drawing workshop in corona, but who would turn down the opportunity to draw nekked people?!?  haha, trust me, it's hard.  on a serious note though, i recommend figure drawing to every serious artist because rendering the human figure--well--is probably the most complex, fascinating, and rewarding technique to master.  ...my two cents.  as i was saying, corona might be too much of a drive for me, and since i'm already taking that portfolio prep class in LA, i think i'm going to have to pass. :(  oh well, there will be plenty of other times.  i think leslie (my figure drawing teacher) is going to have a class in the fall for once, so i'll definitely try and do that if this summer falls through.  the heat has approached us.  you know what that means.  that's right folks, swimming pool AND jessica in a bikini!... woohoo!  it just doesn't get better than this...   hahaha...  peace out!"
364ERKD,female,24,"Ah, entry #2, woohooo I'm on a roll!  Actually, it's  FINALS WEEK  and I can't sleep for the life of me--not that I need to be sleeping when my ass is trying to catch up on half a semester for two classes IN ONE NIGHT, but hey, let's not talk about that.  So what's new with me?    I found myself in not a love triangle, but a love SQUARE, that's right folks, you heard me right. =X  OK, well so there's CECE who's an ex...MICA who's my ex...and JESSICA who's Cece's ex.  Can anyone guess who I've fallen for??  Aye...d r a m a.  It never fails, I always seem to get myself in situations like these.  I need a chastity belt for my heart, because I can never control the damn thing.  Anyway, time heals, so that's what I'm waiting on.  I love Cece and especially Mica, and I anxiously wait for the day that they've completely forgiven me.  In the meantime, the more I kick it with Jes, the more I realize how beautiful she is.  But shhhhh... I'm not trying to jump into relationships after coming out of a two-yrs-and-then-some one.  Anyway, dating's fun... no strings attached! ::winks::  On another note, Kathleen (younger sister) and I made up.  We're friends again--yay!  I hate fighting with sisters.  That's got to be the worst thing ever. =\  But we're friends again so YAY! =D  Christmastime is upon us once again and once again, LEILA HAS NO FUNDS.  Man, I need a job...

O77EEHN,female,25,"It's July 4, and we've worked through several bottles of alcoholic substances. (The ""Three Philosophers"" Belgian beer was excellent - I think we found it at the grocery store on 8th near 23rd.) I am drunk enough that iambic tetrameter seems like a fine transport mechanism for tonight's entry.    I stood on the apartment roof And watched the world  urlLink implode  in light Some drunken Irish serenade As I absorb the sounds of night  Some helicopters fly above I wonder if they see us there Or, if we are just ants to them Up in the sky without a care  The sound rips through the ashen sky It fills me with a sense of pride As fireworks of red white and blue Illuminate the riverside  It reminds me that I'm lucky To celebrate with friends and beer So even if we're still at war At least the bombs aren't falling here."
O77EEHN,female,25,"Golden Chicken, Ribs, and Steak has cheap and tasty chicken and ribs (and, I assume, steak - but I haven't tried that yet).  It's at 604 9th ave (near W43rd).  $5 buys you a huge sandwich plus a side, or a quarter-rack of ribs plus a side.  You can watch a hundred chickens cooking on their grill while you wait; the chicken sandwich was full of moist, flavorful chicken (I'm too used to dried-out overdone fast food, I think.) This could be addicting - the menu is long and varied.  While I've been trying not to eat at the same place more than once (to ensure that I sample as many different restaurants as possible), this is one place I'll be going back to.  Speaking of places to go back to, I pass the Breadstix Cafe (254 8th ave, at W23rd) most days on my way to work.  I have discovered that I'm a complete sucker for freshly-baked cookies - every time I walk past, I smell something new and have to go in and try it.  Yesterday I discovered the magic of the  urlLink black and white cookie  - they're big soft poofy cookies with two kinds of icing. Unfortunately for my diet, there appear to be  dozens  of different kinds of cookies in this bakery. At least there's a gym across the street."
O77EEHN,female,25,"The weather looked a little foreboding early today, but it quickly cleared into a very beautiful day.  There's a great bike and rollerblade lane along the Hudson river.  The parks were well kept all the way along the west side of Manhattan.  The ride along that stretch was perhaps the most peaceful moment that I've had in New York.  It was a little less peaceful for the second half of the trip as I lost the bike path for a while and had to bike in New York traffic.  I cut east across 165th St.  and went down 1st Ave. for a while until I found the bike path again.  Halfway back down the island, I came across a bridge to Ward Island.  It seems to be an island dedicated solely to providing teenagers with a place to go and drink or smoke.  There were two guys drinking cheap beer near the dump on Ward Island.  And I swear I passed their friends on my way back over the bridge on the phone asking where they were and if they had the stuff.  Pictures from my ride are up at:   urlLink http://www.seq.org/~acasteel/newyorkbikenorthmanhattan/index.htm"
O77EEHN,female,25,"We went to see the Yankees play the Devil Rays today.  I learned from my  urlLink previous experience  to take an express train this time.  The express train didn't make up for the hour late we slept in, so we got to the game late, and the only seats left were the $10 bleacher seats.  Now, I don't have a problem with cheapie bleacher seats, but Yankee Stadium is huge - the view from the bleachers is pretty bad to begin with, plus with people standing in the aisles to get a better view it's almost impossible to see anything.  The bleachers are also out in the open, so we were both sunburned pretty quickly.  This must be the advantage of buying the $20 nosebleed seats - the view is just as bad, but at least there's shade.  Squinting at the seating chart suggests that you have to spend upwards of $50 to get a good view of the game.  Yankee Stadium (err... Con Edison Stadium) is also one of those parks where everything is really expensive and there's lots of stupid rules, like you can't bring in backpacks.  Hint to stadium owners: If I wanted to blow up your stupid ballpark, I would hollow out my six-inch clogs, fill them with plastic explosives, put the trigger in my pocket, and walk right in (because no guy security guard is ever going to search a girl, much less question what's in the shoes), leave the bomb in the restroom, and detonate it from a few blocks away. Really, it's not rocket science. The only real impact of the no-backpack rule is that I can't bring in sunscreen and a newspaper, so now I'm sunburned. Other ballparks settle for searching your pack on the way in, which works out fine for me - I'm not trying to smuggle food in or anything.  At least the Yankees won. It was an exciting game, although I probably would have gotten a better view from a wireless unit and ESPN."
O77EEHN,female,25,"When Andrew got tickets for us to see  urlLink Sarah Jones  do a one-woman play, I was a little reluctant. See, I thought it was going to be, like, one of those new age poetry readings (like the bit in Rent where they start mooing), something his film school buddies recommended.  But, I figured, everything is worth trying once. (Except for broccoli.)  So we went to  urlLink 45 Bleecker Theater  for the Friday night show of ""Bridge and Tunnel"".  It was nothing like what I expected - I was completely blown away by the performance.  She does dozens of different characters, switching back and forth between guises at the drop of a hat.  She has a really instinctive understanding of the backgrounds of each one - each seemed like it was effortless, not like a performance.  The poetry read by each individual character was pretty neat - some was funny, some was serious, all of it was well written.  But the one by the young Vietnamese character just reached out and grabbed me - the style and the rhythm felt  right , as if all other forms of verbal expression were just shadows of what is possible.  It was the first poetry slam I had ever heard, and as I listened to it, it made me really want to write poetry like that too. I mean, I'm not going to quit my day job and move to the village and turn all bohemain, but it's been a while since something new called to me like that.  Anyway, this post is called ""limericks of mass destruction"" because that's my favorite line from the performance - the main character is warned that the government might investigate his gathering of immigrants reading poetry, and he responds, ""what are they expecting to find - limericks of mass destruction?""  So, in that spirit, I have one:  The UN once got an injunction Barring Iraqi weapons production   But what did Bush see   In each bombed city? Just limericks of massive destruction."
O77EEHN,female,25,"Damn my bog-dwelling ancestors.  I was filming all of Friday, and 5 hours on Saturday and then tried to watch the Sunday Yankees game from the bleacher seats today and it only took 2 hours of sun to run me down.  I spent the rest of the day feeling like crap.  I wanted to get out and rollerblade or go to the gym, but I guess this is my body's way of telling me to slow down.  I have been missing too much sleep this week and I should store it up if I can.  This week besides going to class, I got to watch Rent and Bridges and Tunnels.  Rent was OK.  I prefer my musicals to be more comical and less tragic.  There were all these tragic bohemians.  For example, Jai from Queer Eye played a free spirited cross dresser who spends the first act joking around and perking up everyones spirits.  Then in the second act we have to watch him die of AIDS.  It had too much of that defeatist, Gen-X, ""The Whole World is Corrupt but I'd rather hide from it than make the compromises required to fix it"".  Throughout the movie, the characters hid from themselves, their families and the world.  One of the final triumphant moments is when the filmmaker in the play turns down the offer to work in Hollywood so he doesn't ""sell out"".  His character believes in a lot of truly positive ideals, many of which I share.  I wanted him to accept the offer.  Make some films more people will see and slowly but surely work his ideals into his films.  I hate that the play celebrated the lack of patience and the cowardice of his decision.  It diminishes the contributioons made by those who are willing to make the compromises required to create real change from within the system.  Sarah Jones' Bridges and Tunnels was great.  I wonder what Samm would think about the play.  He hates Dave Chapelles style of self-depricating racial humor, but I wonder what he would make of Sarah Jones' racial humor.  As the racial differences she chose to joke about are less negative, he may be more approving even though he claims that all racial humor is wrong.  Saturday started with a 5 hour shoot.  For 3 hours, I helped my friend Alina shoot interviews for her documentary on happiness.  I thought that it was unlikely that people would be willing to stop for 5 minutes a piece in the hot sun to answer questions and then stand still for 10 seconds, however Alina and her friend have a much greater ability than I to draw people into such things.  After we concluded her shoot at Union Square, we took the subway down to Battery Park to interview 3 Polish Girls who were paying for their trip around the world by working as street musicians.  I had been worrying all week about what to do for my documentary when I saw these 3 girls playing at Union Square with a sign that said ""Help us pay for our trip around the world"".  I made arrangements to meet up with them on Saturday and have them tell their story.  It turned out to be a little different from what I expected, but it was still a great story of brash youthful adventure.  I got a great 30 minute interview from 2 camera angles and 20 minutes of b-roll of them playing while people watched.  More importantly, it gave me the inspiration to create the Academy documentary part 1 for my final project.  I hope to get a well lit interview with Jack when he is out here and splice it together with some interviews of my own and the footage we recorded at Sequoia.  I'd been worrying about my final film for quite some time as I didn't really have a great inspiration for a narrative film.  Once I was able to let go of the narrative format and give myself the chance to pursue a project I've been thinking about for a long time, it was like a huge weight being lifted.  Creativity is hard.  It's much harder than organizing and arranging, which are my strengths.  That's all the brain spew for tonight,  Good Night All"
O77EEHN,female,25,"Lexi's sister Amy came to visit from the 21st to the 26th.  So we all kicked our vacation into high gear.  In the past few days we've seen Fiddler on the Roof, The Producers and Paul Mooney Live.  We've visited the World Trade Center site, Grand Central, Central Park (on foot, bike and horse drawn carriage), Battery Park, The Empire State Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  We've eaten at more than a dozen restaurants that even Lexi and I haven't visited yet.  All in all I think we had a great time, considering that we had to put up with some thunderstorms.    It's a little hard to process everything and I even skipped editing today to relax after all that activity.  These last few days have shown me that there are some huge discrepancies in how hard it is to do some of the touristy things in NY.  Visiting the WTC site: free, quick and easy.  Visiting the Empire State Building's observation deck: a 2 hour wait on a Monday afternoon with exorbitant ticket fees.  Horse Drawn Carriage ride: $50 and there's always one around the south end of the park.   Broadway shows: varies.  We bought Fiddler tickets 4 hours before showtime with no trouble.  However the Lion King had a 3 week wait for any reasonably priced seats.    One experience I definitely suggest is to see a movie at the AMC 25 in Time Square.  It's a huge glass building and you can chill on the top floor of the theater, soaking in time square for the cost of a movie ticket.  They even have the new ticket dispensers that let you buy a ticket by credit card without waiting in line.  Given Manhattan prices and the lack of soda refills, it's pretty cost effective to chill with a huge diet coke on the top floor and just watch the pageant of tourists, street vendors and natives all flow by.    Gotta go to dinner.  I'll write more about the shows and such later."
O77EEHN,female,25,"My husband Andrew has joined me in New York, now that he's done teaching for the year.  He'll be posting too.  Everybody say hi to Andrew. :)  We went to Greenwich Village to try a sushi restaurant recommended by some friends.   urlLink Sushi Samba  (87 7th Ave South, near Barrow) is sort of what you'd expect, for a sushi restaurant that has a website that plays music.  The cuisine is Japanese/Brasilian fusion, which means that you can get mango on your sushi or tuna in your ceviche. (Mango-eel-avacado sushi turns out to be pretty good.)  So there's a lot of variety on the menu, the atmosphere is good, and the food is tasty - but it's definitely more expensive than regular sushi.     This restaurant did give me my first-ever experience of looking at a wine list and recognizing something I had previously tried at the brewery where it is made.   urlLink Hakusan Plum Sake  is a sweet, mellow sort of fruity sake.  The Hakusan Sake Garden, where it is made, is in Napa and happens to open for sake tasting at 9 a.m. - an hour before any other wineries in the area open for tasting, which is why I have tried it.  It comes in the big bottles (750ml), not the little bottles, so our valiant attempts to finish the bottle tonight were thwarted by a lack of coordination needed to pour the last of the bottle into the sake glasses.    Across the street from Sushi Samba is the Actor's Playhouse, whose current feature is  urlLink The Marijuana-logues .  We'd seen them do a segment on Real Time with Bill Maher, and figured it would be pretty funny.  It's a great live show - they improvise some, and there are some really good bits. My favorite went something like this: ""People say the body is a temple.  Well, I'm not religious - so  if my body is a temple, it's empty, and I rent it out to demons to have wild parties."""
O77EEHN,female,25,"Tonight we went to the  urlLink Upright Citizens Brigade Theater  (24th st at 8th ave) to see some improv comedy. They do different shows every night - some nights the improv students do shows, some nights are open mic, and other night are more.. professional? The show was random and pretty funny. For $5, it's one of the best entertainment bargains out there. (I'd recommend this over the Ha Comedy Club, which we visited on Sunday - some of the sets of standup were okay, but the evening was marred slightly by the host mistaking me for a man, and saying that with my fashion sense I was likely to be kidnapped by five gay guys in a van.)    On the way there, we stopped at Tono Sushi (174 7th ave). This was reasonably good, cheap, and fast, and I'd definitely go back. We've been on a random walk of sushi restaurants in the neighborhood, and I still haven't found any place like my favorite 'good' sushi bar back in California (where you're allowed to sit at the sushi bar as long as you want, and the sushi guy hooks us up with free stuff when he's bored) or my favorite 'cheap' sushi bar in California (where all the rolls are $1 during happy hour, 5-7 on Tuesdays). Most of the sushi around here seems fine - it's not cheap (but nothing in Manhattan is, so that's expected), but the quality is generally good, there's usually reasonable variety, and they're always open late. Monster Sushi (158 W 23rd) has some interesting (and huge) rolls and a variety of sakes. I'm sure I went to Hana Sushi (211 7th ave, near 22nd), but I don't remember anything about it. The one on the corner of 7th and 20th (Meritake?) had good food but not so good service. We went to Sushi Sen-nin (49 E34th, near Madison Ave) once - it's a more high-end experience, both much more expensive and much better food than anywhere else. (The Crazy Dragon roll is astonishing - we'll upload pictures.) The advantage the Manhattan sushi restaurants have is that you can get sushi at nearly any hour of the night, even delivered.    For comparison, on my way to New York last month, I stopped for a night in Salt Lake City, Utah. There are, in fact, at least four sushi restaurants in the greater Salt Lake area. (In a turn of events I would not have predicted, there are now more bars than sushi restaurants there.) I walked all the way across town to find one (don't even ask about the public transit...) to discover that they're only sort of open sometimes, but never for lunch and not at all on the day I happened to be there."

RO9SBUW,female,47,"The new job started this week! I'm totally brain dead, and I have 2 days to go! I can't believe how easy the other job was, compared to this one. I've knocked the dust off all my medical reference books, and learned some new things too! But, for some reason, it's now after midnight and I'm still wide awake. I'll be regretting this in the morning.   I fired off a letter to the public pulse today about the stupid covenants in new neighborhoods. I'm so disgusted. Steve and I found a perfect house on Monday. I mean it was  perfect , it had a huge pantry, laundry room, huge basement, oak woodwork, you name it. I loved it. Steve liked it (which is about as good as it gets with Steve!) But the covenants wouldn't allow him to have his antenna for his radio. How stupid is that?  Oh yeah, we have to have the neighborhood  look  good. Heaven forbid that an antenna disrupt the lovely scenery! (Can you hear the sarcasm?) I don't think people really realize how much ham operators really do - especially in times of crisis or natural disaster.  Oh well, it wasn't meant to be I suppose, but it was a beautiful house. *sigh*   I just realized tonight that I have to teach a class at Enrichment Night at relief society next Tuesday.  Maybe I better start preparing pretty soon.    Great news! It looks like our Dad and Pam will be moving back from Arizona some time this summer! I'm so glad.  It's too bad that dad and I didn't really get close until he moved, and I really hope to get to know Pam better.  Things sure started out on the wrong foot there!  Too bad mom didn't move to Mississippi sooner, then maybe dad and Pam would have been back here sooner.  I don't know if the two things are related or not, but I know I'd like to leave my ex in the dust somewhere! I sure can't blame dad (or Pam) for feeling the same way!   Okay, I've got to get some sleep, or else I'll be dozing at the keyboard tomorrow! TTFN."
RO9SBUW,female,47,"My home computer isn't working.  Hasn't worked for nearly 2 months.  I have to do everything on my work computer, which I shouldn't be doing, but hey, ya gotta stay in the loop, know what I mean?  I know about enough to install new programs and that's about it.  Maybe a little photo editing, but not enough to fix whatever the heck it is that ailing the computer.  We did have a trojan horse virus (thank you to whoever did THAT!).  We got the virus deleted, but the internet won't run right.  The stupid thing won't even recognize the CD burner or DVD burner, so I can't back anything up.  I'm a little annoyed.  I love my computer.  Steve works with some guy who I guess can fix it, but finding time in his schedule is (apparently) not going to happen any time soon.  Personally, I'd be just as happy to get a new notebook computer so I can take it out with me when I do my geneaology research, but I can't see that happening either.  As a matter of fact, it's pretty funny that I would even THINK such a thing.  Hahahaha!   We have all our internet, cable, and telephone through the same company and the bill got lost during the moving suffle last month, so the double bill today was, are you ready, $414!  I have to have internet cable for my job, but I'm thinking we may be able to dump some of the services with the phone, but then I don't think we'd be eligible for free HBO and Showtime.  I might have to check into that, I think $207 a month is a little bit excessive.  And hey, the long distance bill has gone way down since dad moved back from Arizona.   I just want my computer.  Come on, please?"
RO9SBUW,female,47,"Why do I love summer?  It's only 79 degrees outside right now, but when you factor in the humidity it feels like 89.  At 9 o'clock at night.  What the heck.   I like summer, I really do, I just hate the humidity.  I guess I have to go live somewhere like Arizona where ""it's a dry heat"".  Whatever.  I've been there.  They can have their silly scorpions and those dashboard carpets so your dash doesn't crack.  How lovely.  No thanks.  But why can't it be just a  little  less humid and a little more breezy.  When the cable guy (haha!) was here this afternoon the heat index was 102.  Ick.  That's just  too hot  for humans.   Remind me of this when I'm whining when I'm freezing my hoochie off in January and the wind chill is about 30 below.  Then I'll wish it was 102 in the shade.  I'm never happy."

RO9SBUW,female,47,"I noticed last night we had THE virus.  I don't know where it came from and I tried to fix it! BWAHAHA! Yeah, right.  Thank goodness for Adam C. - don't know if it would have ever gotten fixed otherwise! I'm not the most computer literate person I know. I was thinking of taking some computer classes at Metro, but I can't decide if it's possible to teach an old dog new tricks.  Maybe, but at what cost!? (Sound of frying egg in pan...)   Anyway, I logged onto work today and saw we didn't have any jobs! That is very uncommon! Usually we get an e-mail from out team leader saying there's about anywhere from 200 to 500 jobs in the system - today there were none! So I stayed connected for awhile and waited while the solitary job came through once in awhile.  Finally got a call from the main office - the account I work on is in North Carolina so there wasn't any work because most of the doctors couldn't get to the hospital today! So the hospital asked the home people to get offline! Okay.  I didn't want to make any money anyway! Actually, they would have assigned me another account, but I really wasn't in the mood to learn another set of account specifics, so I deferred!  I'm supposed to be off on Thursday anyway, maybe I'll just work then.     This is our second day without mail - whatever happened to that old adage, 'Neither snow, nor sleet...""? I guess it doesn't apply in this day and age. Didn't get a newspaper yesterday either.  As I type this there's a car stuck on the street in front of our house.  From the sound of it, he won't have an engine much longer - or any tires, for that matter!"
RO9SBUW,female,47,"Okay, I think life is back on a more even keel now.  Why is it that sometimes life throws a curve that you just can't dodge?  There wasn't any one particular thing that happened in the past couple weeks, but every little thing just conspired against me until I felt totally overwhelmed.  I don't get like that often, that goodness, but when I do - look out.     I didn't go to church today.  Yeah, I'm seriously slacking.  I hated the 8 o'clock start time because it was so early, I hate the 3 o'clock start time because it's too late... I need to just do it.  I hate getting out of church at 6.  By the time you come home and eat it's 8 o'clock or later, and the whole day feels shot - never mind that you had until 3 to do whatever you needed to.  There's just something wrong about going to church in the afternoon.  I don't know why this bothers me so much. When I first joined the church we had Sunday School in the morning and then went back at night for sacrament meeting.  That didn't bother me... But then, it wasn't a three-hour block at one time either.     I did go last week, I also got a calling last week.  Relief Society Temple Coordinator.  Doesn't that sound impressive?   I'm such an idiot too, I thought my recommend expired in December so I haven't gone  - even though I have about 150 names from my family ready to go.   Brother Jansen or Jenson, or whatever, reminded me last week that recommends are good for 2 years now.  D'oh!  The stake assigned our RS a temple time every month, ours is 2 pm on the fourth Friday.  No wonder no one ever goes.  How can women with kids be at the Temple at the time kids are getting out of school?  I think it would be so neat to live in a city where the Temple was open all day Tuesday through Saturday, but since the saints in Omaha aren't quite so Temple-minded we only have day sessions on Friday and Saturday.   I did set up another time for our RS to go - next Thursday at 7:30.  Maybe I can even make it that night.  Why is going to the Temple so much easier than going to church?  I wish someone could explain that to me.     Meg came home from church tonight a little discouraged.  She's the only person working in the nursery.  The bishopric has called other people, but no one has accepted the calling.  I don't understand why nursery works are so looked down on in the church - don't even try to tell me they aren't, becuase they are.  Meg does such a good job with the lessons, and she really loves the kids.  Kind of ironic that she's the only unmarried young single woman in our ward and she's better with the kids than some parents I see.  Hmmm.  Anyway, maybe I'll start going to help in the nursery, just so she can have a little less hectic time.  She can't even take one child to the bathroom because there's no one there with the other kids.  That's just nuts.  She had to go to RS and ask for someone to come help today, and the bishop's wife had to do it.   I think far to many people in church think that the nursery is a free baby sitting service, thay have no idea that lessons are actually planned and carried out!  Okay, off that soapbox.   Another thing that's got me going this week is outsourcing of work to other countries - especially India.  The AAMT is going to a legislative hearing in California this week to   support   it!  That pretty much ticks me off.  Here I go paying dues to the AAMT, because it's the American Association of Medical Transcriptionists, and they're supporting our work being sent overseas.  Not only that, I don't relish the idea of my medical records and personal information being in the hands of someone not governed by the sme privacy laws as the United States.  Don't even get me going on THAT subject."
RO9SBUW,female,47,"1. In the morning, do you brush your teeth before or after eating? Since I don't usually eat until after I get to work, I brush them before.  But, on weekends, when I eat breakfast as soon as I get up, I brush before.  And then after.    2. Do you believe in the emotional power of colors? Absolutely.   3. What do you do to preserve your memories? Scrapbook, take tons of pictures, journal.  I've even tape recorded some conversations with my mother-in-law about her childhood and transferred them to CD so in years to come we'll still be able to hear her voice, long after she's gone.  I wish I had done something similar when my grandparents were alive."
RFSPOJR,male,39,"We are trying to enjoy our last days in Colorado.  We went water skiing today at Highline lake a very small lake but one large enough to have fun on.  Angie was able to get up on the first try on only one ski (cool chick!) Especially when the boat was not as fast as it should be for water skiing.     Our friend Vicki, bless her heart, was so excited to take us out to water ski for the last time here in Colorado.  With the sun shinning and the water rippling with enjoyment, we had a blast!   We hope we will be able to come back to Colorado for my clinical rounds and it may just happen.  There are many whom are willing to take me under their wing and train me to be the best physician I can possibly be.  They are the ones who have encouraged me to become the physician I would like to be--compassionate, caring and above all understanding.  Understanding to the needs that every individual desires.     All of our friends are here and it will be hard to leave, but there is a great adventure awaiting. . . one that will instill everlasting memories upon our future generation-- my children.

RFSPOJR,male,39,"It's 11:15pm and I am up late setting up Yahoo Messenger so I can communicate quicker with people down in the Caribbean that are helping us in the transition of a middle income family to very poor medical student family.   The families and students that I have been in contact with have been better than anyone could have ever hoped for with such a large move.   The big shocker today was we found a great apartment that when you roll out of bed you are on the AUC campus.  This is good because we will not have to have two cars and the kids and I can walk to school--it's only 100ft.  That will lower the stress on Angie, the kids, and I and we will be able to spend that ever so valuable time being together rather than commuting even just ten minutes.  Do that a few times a day and were talking a whole hour of wasted time.  I will post some pictures of the Apartment.   The only catch is that today we talked to the landlord Gil and he would like $4500 up front.  OUCH!!!!!  The rent is $1500/mo and he would like two months in security deposit.  He didn't mention anything about a contract either.  Shady?  What do you think? He seems like a nice guy and our family advisor Amy said that he is a good guy.  Well find out tomorrow when he inspects the apartment for the leaving students and see if he gives all of the securtiy deposit back. Interesting. Hmmmm."
RFSPOJR,male,39,"It is getting late for me but I am trying to figure out this Blog thing.  I was trying to figure out how to post a picture and I posted a picture of my beautiful wife Angie at Philipsburg Marina in St. Maarten, Dutch Antilles and it reminded me so much of how much I want to be back in the warm sun and listen to the turquois wavelets brush upon the beach and soothe me into equanimity.       St. Maarten a beautiful and wonderful place with so many nice and kind people who move as rhythmically as the turquois wavelets do lapping upon silicon crystals--a place where the insane rush of American life drifts silently away fading into a distant memory--a memory which becomes more difficult day by day to comprehend or recall.  You are swept up into a life of peace and slow pace, enjoying all that everything has to offer.     That is until you drive a car there and everything instantly changes.  You must be on alert a factor of 10 times greater than driving any busy freeway in the US.  It is a contrast that cannot be reckoned with by any means.  It is metaphorically a world of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde.   Ganga is smoked on a religious basis and of course as a means of slowing down, but they must all be extremely high on caffiene when they drive.  Who else would slow down for a speed bump and then peel-out to accelerate at break-neck speed to once again slam on the breaks for the next speed bump.  The only speed limit is there is no speed limit.  Safe and Sane is an understatement.  It's more like Unsafe and Insane; it is the rule not the exception.  Must get some sleep.

The bad thing - I was bored at certain points of the movie. The story/plot is expected. Well, it can get kinda drama but then again, it should be expected out of such movie. I was looking for more climax but since it was expectable that the good won't die, I wasn't too excited when the good guys were in danger.   The good thing about it thou, is the graphics. Really cool and fun to watch. And of course, Hugh is nice to look at, Kate too of course. It's worth, 3/5 stars.  Friend went to Eng Wah Suntec and reported bad sound system. The sound can go mute at the exciting part. I went to GV Plaza and the sound system also sux. One side of the speakers go mute and back on minutes later. I guess Orchard Cineleisure is still the best, although it can be deafening. You can do what I did, plug in ear phones. Hahah."
24S02MP,female,25,"Romance comedy by Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore who last paired up in ""The Wedding Singer"". I enjoyed the wedding singer better thou. This one had lotsa slapsticks and corny jokes which fails to deliver the punch. Nevertheless, there's still lotsa laughter. (I was wondering why the two gals next to me were laughing so hard when I was frowning at the corny jokes. It wasn't even that funny!) Crazy gals aside, it's still a funny romantic girlie show. I was with a guy so didn't really feel much of a romance out of the movie. Haha.   Adam sang in the movie again, and it sorta sound the same as in the wedding singer. You'd pity Lucy (the gal who lost her short term memory) for having to begin each day with so many emotions. But you'd also envy her for having such a sweet guy willing to do so many things for her.

24S02MP,female,25,"I went to watch ""Passion of the Christ"" and it left me with a lot of emotions, questions, and thoughts. If you have watched it, could you please tell me what are your thots? If you don't intend to watch, could you please tell me why?   My opinion: Fantastic movie. Thru the movie, I empathised with Christ and understood the meanings. I could also understand why this movie is made. There are serveral so-so or bad reviews, but I feel that they did not see the reason for making this film. Or maybe I'm biased? After a discussion with my sis, we think people can either don't like the show, find it either meaningless and ridiculous, meaningful and worth-while, or interesting and provoking. The show made me want to find out more about Christ. It's not just for Christians or Catholics. It's also for non-believers if you keep your mind open. :)  After the show, me and friend were quite 'disturbed'. We end up discussing about Christ and religion for 1 hr over a cup of hot tea (for me)/coffee(for him). I believe we will be reflecting on ourselves for the next few days.

With his Director brother's as backing, he got in to my company again. Anyone mention his name, they smirk and say, ""Oh, good luck!""  Just another part of life to deal with. :)"

24S02MP,female,25,"after a strings of public holidays, we are left with a dry month - march with no holidays. can't wait for apr to arrive. haha.  so bali was alright. lotsa aussies. you can just tell that they are aussies, no matter how they dress.   took a sq flight in the early sat morning, it was a new air craft. very roomy and nice. its the same one they launch for the non-stop to LA flight but smaller.   had a nap at the hotel room until 4 when we start our shopping spree in bali. the shops close at 10.. how nice.. ^u^   we went diving the next day.. strong current.. and i crashed into a coral without looking. we were sort of flying in the sea so fast that we dont see much of the marine life. the corals are indeed very nice.. looks unspoilt.. but with more divers going down, crashing into them, graping them for fear of being washed away, it will be quite polluted/damaged in no time.  we went back to wash up, had a nap and move out on our second shopping spree. knowing that its our last nite in bali, and probably last trip, i spent over SG$300 in beach/surf wear. Its cheaper and there's more designs of billabong, rip curl, quiksilver, rusty, roxy, stussy, mooks, etc.  some locals are very persistent to do biz w u. some are really nice and friendly. however  most of the salegals i encounter w are unfriendly, lazy and they show u faces. but the guys are friendly and didn't mind making the many trips to the store room. overall, i find the locals in bali are nicer then in most places. (although they keep thinking we are japanese, indonesian.. only one got it right by speaking Mandarin to us.)  it's a short trip. not fantastic but a good break. i'm so broke that i'm sticking to my $2-lunch for as long as i can."
24S02MP,female,25,"Went away over the weekend to North Malaysia, an island called Pulau Penang. It was almost a 12 hours coach ride to reach there. Would be shorter if not for the traffic jams along the way. The journey was alright, slept most of the time.  Sis' friend, Raph picked us up at the bus station and went straight to savour the local delights. When we were done with our breakfast, Raph was already planning where to for the next meal. Well, before coming, Sis told him that our objective was to eat.   After checking into the hotel and freshening up ourselves, Raph brought us to another round of eating. We were so stuffed after that and requested for some 'tourist visits' to the famous temples in Penang.   We decided to skip dinner and meet Raph for clubbing at night. In the meantime, we did a quickie at the nearby shopping center and bought a bottle of orange juice. We were quite disappointed that we couldn't get any bargains. But it is also due to the fact that we were all tired from the journey.  We napped for 4 hours and almost wanted to give up clubbing and carry on with the sleep. Glad we didn't. We went to two clubs and one of them was having ladies nights (on a weekend!?). I thought a little village like Penang won't have too great a nightlife but I think it was better then in Singapore.   Next morning, Raph met us at 1030 and we continued with our eating expedition. After breakfast, we were planning to take a scenic drive up to the mountains and the beach but decided to give up when the traffic was really slow. We shopped at another shopping center and got a better 'returns' this time round. After more slow traffic, we made it back to the hotel with 4 really full bladders. We relaxed and chatted in the room before making our way for dinner again. We had the apportunity to explore other parts of Penang apart from the beach and the town while driving to the seafood restaurant. Pity, the restaurant was full and we settled for a simple chinese restaurant further down the road.  That night, we sang our lungs out until 1am at a karaoke lounge next to our hotel. With coarse throats, we went back to our room and pack for our departure the next day.   Raph insisted on bring us out for a last breakfast before our coach leaves at 1030. It was really sweet of him to help us scout for coach back to S'pore since Monday. Our Penang trip couldn't be this great without him.    I use to think that Penang is a country-side-village. But it looks like Singapore 10yrs ago. They are developing, slowly. There are places that are run down, dilapitated and flirty. But there are also developments to improve on them. Of all the Malaysia states, I prefers Penang.   At the end of the trip, on the 10 hours ride home, we pondered about friendships. My sis asked me to join some social club to get to know more friends. Cos we realise that I don't have many, and can count on maybe just one. But isn't one better then none? Anyhow..I don't want to think about this. I have my own mind and plans. I will do what I please, when I'm ready."
24S02MP,female,25,"I went to see ""Something Gotta Give"" last night with my sisters. It stars Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. A very enjoyable movie with witty dialogues, a mature/adult comedy show that I believe you'll enjoy it. ;) [And Keanu was gorgeous!!]  There's a scene when Diane was telling her daughter the pain of falling in love. And her daugther said, ""That's what I've been telling you, to protect yourself."" (not in actual words)   The mum said, sobbing ""You mean you have been living that way?""   ...Fast Forward>>   The daughter said, ""I never know how love feels."" ""You have to let someone in. Even though it hurts, I had the time of my life.""  It was touching the way the scene was played. Not to mention the words were what I have said and been told.   I have said to many friends who have got heart broken that one should always protect one's heart. My sister told me that I have to open up, let someone in, experience love even thou it might hurt. The sweetness will linger, anger will eventually subside, the wound on the heart will heal, the pain you'll remember. This is life. If you haven't experience falling in love, you haven't lived.   So Charbel was right in my previous entry. Knowing that chocolate will make me fat, will I still eat it?"

The story is about 2 couples, ending up having affairs with each other's partner. Basically it's about relationships, trust and sex.   It's a rather fun and entertaining movie. Great acting, singing and dancing. Almost like a musical on screen. Wonder if they had refer to one of the Bollywood movies. Hhaa. Great scripts and editing too! Truely enjoyable. Oh, and great bodies. ;)  I was more preoccupied with the language. Half the time I'm recalling and remembering the spanish vocab then digesting the plot. Haha. So, I failed to gather any conclusion at the end of the show. Haha.  Anyhow, it's spidey 2 today!!"

7HCUXM0,male,38,"THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO COME OUT OF THE CLOSET...  Yesterday in a  urlLink statement  issued throught the family's lawyer, the Thurmond family acknowledged that the late South Carolinian Senator J. Strom Thurmond  had sired an illegitimate child with the 16 year-old daughter of an African-American maid in the Thurmond household when he was 22 years old.  After withholding her story (despite rampant rumors) from the press until after Senator Thurmond's death at the age of 100,  Essie Mae Washington-Williams said at the urging of her children, she wanted to be acknowledged by the Thurmond family.  She said that she had kept her secret for so long out of respect for the Thurmond's family and career.  After an interview over the weekend with  The Washington Post , Ms. Washington-Williams had planned to hold a press conference later this week to ask the family to acknowledge her birthright.  Cutting her off at the pass, the Thurmond family released the following statement to the press:  "" As J. Strom Thurmond has passed away and cannot speak for himself, the Thurmond family acknowledges Ms. Essie Mae Washington-Williams' claim to her heritage.  We hope this acknowledgment will bring closure for Ms. Williams. ""  To say this is a revolting act by the family is an understatement.  Isn't that nice?  After 78 years, they hope to bring Ms Williams closure?  The fact that Thurmond was one of the strongest segregationists in the United States Congress and had sired a black child is the utter height of hypocrisy.  That Ms. Washington-Williams kept the Thurmond dirty little secret until after his passing out of a respect she clearly did not owe the man, speaks volumes about her character and integrity.  On the other hand, the family's callous statement is egregious in so many ways.   ...BUT, DON'T DO IT IN THE NFL  Former NFL player, commentator and current president of the Detroit Lions Matt Millen is making more fans.  Millen issued an  urlLink apology  on Monday for using a derogatory term for gays in a heated exchange with Kansas City receiver Johnnie Morton. According to the  Kansas City Star , Millen and Morton had a hostile post-game exchange outside Kansas City's locker room Sunday.  Millen was overheard by at least two witnesses yelling:   "" You faggot! Yeah, you heard me. You faggot! ""  Nice.  People actually wonder why gay professional athletes aren't lining up to come out of the closet?  Millen said in his apology, "" He made an inappropriate remark, and I reacted inappropriately.  I said something I shouldn't have, which was wrong, and I apologize for that. And I apologize to anybody that I offended with that remark. ""   Gee thanks, Mr. Millen.  For his part, Morton is quoted in press reports as saying, "" What he said is demeaning and bigoted.  Jeremy Shockey got in trouble for saying it about a coach [Bill Parcells], and now we have a president of a team making statements like that. It's totally unacceptable.

7HCUXM0,male,38,"COLIN FARRELL: FULL FRONTAL INTERVIEW   In issue #775 of  Entertainment Weekly  (07.23.04), Colin Farrell gives Dave Karger an interview entitled 'The Naked Truth'.  The following are excerpts from that interview:     Karger: I wonder why you wanted to do this movie in the first place.  Your character, the ultra-naive Bobby, is so different for you.  Farrell:  My agent passed me the script, and I read it in Dublin on me couch.  I think I called him at four or five in the morning and left him a message on his voice-mail.  I hadn't read anything like it.  It was just very gentle.  It was about people whose lives are changing and molding and about loss.  I had never read anything so fuckin' intense on the idea of love, yet didn't hit it with a hammer.        Karger: Besides the wig, what was the biggest challenge in playing the part?  Farrell:  When so much importance is placed on a particular energy that you've become known for, whether it's brooding or swagger or being butch, it's very easy for the human mind to find comfort in being recognized as one thing, which can become a form of self-imprisonment as an actor.  So I suppose [the challenge was] for me to break out of that and be as open and weak and simple as Bobby was.      Karger: I can't open a paper these days without reading something about your nude scene.  Are you surprised by all the attention it's gotten?  Farrell : Yeah, man, I mean, fuck me!  Who gives a fuck! Apart from the readers  of The Advocate   maybe, who wants to see Colin Farrell's cock that much?  And let me tell you, it ain't nothing to fuckin' write home about.  Someone told me that someone said it was fine but it was no Ewan McGregor!      Karger: I saw the early version with the scene, and it wasn't that big a deal, pardon the pun.  Farrell : [Laughs] No, it's nothing, man! I walk to a door and you see my cock, and I walk out of the shot.  It's dark, and it's three inches, uh, seconds long.        Karger: So it wasn't the studio that made the decision to cut the shot?  It was you? Or Michael Mayer?  Farrell : Both of us together. And [producer] Tom [Hulce].  Everyone seemed to be on the same page.        Karger: But now what's been added back in the film is...  Farrell : My asshole.  That's in the next picture.        Karger: No, the rooftop kiss between you and Dallas.  Farrell : The kiss is back in?  Good, yeah.  It's a very important part of the story.  It's very quick and very gentle.  It's not exactly '9 1/2 Weeks'.        Karger: So would you be okay if they put the nude shot back on the DVD?  Farrell : That'd be totally gratuitous.  It's not like a director's cut.  That would now creep me out.  I would prefer it to be in the original than have it put on the DVD.  'Cause to have it put on the DVD, that's to sell [nudity].  And that's when I'd come in with me fuckin' hands up, to be honest with you.  Would they have it on ""Special Features: Deleted Cock""?"
7HCUXM0,male,38,"THE SCOOP  According to knowledgeable sources, the first actor to show interest in Ang Lee's next film ""Brokeback Mountain"" (based on the award-winning E. Annie Proulx short story of the same name) is very close to signing on to the project.  The highly anticipated film tells the story of a love affair between a ranch hand and rodeo star.  The same-sex love story was thought to face a huge stumbling block when it came to casting A-List talent. Obliquity has learned that none other than Joaquin Phoenix is in talks with the Lee as he scouts locations.  The exact role he would play has not been determined.   ROSA PARKS  On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court  urlLink refused  to hear the case of LaFace Records v. Parks, 03-504.  The silent refusal sends the case back to a Federal Court judge and allows Ms. Parks, the 90 year-old civil rights activist to persue legal action against the R&B/Hip-Hop group Outkast.  Ms. Parks has claimed that a 1988 track entitled ""Rosa Parks"" violates her rights of publicity and trademark--and further defames her.  The track which appears on Outkast's album "" urlLink Aquemini "" does not mention Ms. Parks by name in the lyrics but does contain the line ""Ah-ha, hush that fuss. Everybody move to the back of the bus.""--an obvious reference to Ms. Parks famed act of civil disobedience by refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955.  Ms. Parks wishes to have all references to her removed from future pressings of the album.  Outkast and LaFace Records claim that song does not violate Ms. Parks rights and is protected by freedom of speech.  The fact that it has long been known that ""Rosa Parks"" was a song written about the entertainment industry and it's alleged treatment of black artists does seem to lend credence to Ms. Parks claims.  The fact that entertainment artists, who regardless of skin color, make millions of dollars hardly seems a comprable experience that endured by Ms. Parks.  This will be an interesting case to follow.   A WAR OF NUMBERS  Two U.S. bases were  urlLink targeted  by suicide bombers in Northern Iraq Tuesday morning.  At least 43 soldiers suffered injuries from glass and shrapnel.  The continued escalation of rebel forces throughout Iraq should be extremely troubling to the Bush Administration.  Once claiming that major resistance was contained to the Sunni Triangle area, recent days and events have proved otherwise.  The rise of the dead and wounded counts seems to be spiraling upwards.  The discontent of a confused Iraqi citizenry should hardly come as a surprise to the coalition forces.  For each day that occupation continues, that discontent will breed and mutate like a virus.  Unfortunately, the infection rate will be exponential.     While the Administration has signaled a new found desire to leave Iraq as soon as possible, it belies the facts that it faces on the ground.  While they have detested the press use of the word quagmire, it has become just that.  It would be inhumane to pull out quickly.  It becomes intolerable to stay put.  Millions of families will be without loved ones this holiday season.  The future remains murky and by all accounts less than hopeful.

7HCUXM0,male,38,"I HEART MICHELLE KWAN  Saturday night in Philips Arena in downtown Atlanta, the exquisite Michelle Kwan  urlLink won  her eighth U.S. Figure Skating Championship--her seventh in a row.  After a slight bobble on a double axel in the short program, Kwan was in second place going into the free skate.  Both Dick Button and Peggy Fleming picked Sasha Cohen to win at the outset of the evening much to my chagrin.  With a look of passionate determination and swathed in a spectacular coral braided Vera Wang costume, Michelle Kwan struck her opening pose as the gorgeously sorrowful strains of Giacomo Puccini's ""Tosca"" began.  In what may have been the most moving, exquisite program I have ever seen her skate--and one that should go down in history as one of the defining moments of the storied U.S. Championships--Ms. Kwan was radiant and mesmerizing.       After her last triple toe jump was securely landed, she sped down the middle of the ice in an inspired straight line footwork sequence that sent shivers down the spine and set the crowd into a frenzy.  As she sat in the kiss and cry area with her new coach Rafael Arutunian, you knew something special was about to happen.  As her technical merit scores lit up the boards with a row of 5.9s and 5.8s, there was little doubt she would retain her crown.  When the presentation marks flashed seven perfect scores of 6.0, even Dick Button could not contain himself.  Michelle Kwan had just received her 35th perfect score of 6.0 in the U.S. Championships.  To realize the breadth of her excellence, the person in second place with the most perfect marks is Brian Boitano with 9.  I've since watched the performance about twelve times and it does not fail to excite and enchant me each time.  The beauty, grace, athleticism and inner fire that Ms. Kwan possesses is simply breathtaking.  I love you Michelle Kwan--and I'm not afraid to admit it."

After days of U.S. media outlets showing footage of the infamous spiderhole that was alleged to be Saddam Hussein's hiding place and portraying him as a cowering rat, a new  urlLink take  on Hussein's capture is slowly finding its way into media reports.  Contradicting the claims that U.S. and British Intelligence led to the capture, a report Sunday in a British newspaper claims that Saddam Hussein was captured by an element of the Kurdish Patriotic Front, drugged and later abandoned for U.S. soldiers to find.  Hussein is said to have been betrayed by a member of the al-Jabour tribe in retaliation for a rape committed against his daughter by Hussein son Uday.  The newspaper quotes an unnamed British Intelligence officer as saying the report ""exposes the version peddled by American spin doctors as incomplete"".  The paper further claims that Hussein had been held a hostage for some time by the Kurdish group who was negotiating for power in the region.  It will be interesting to see what the U.S. official response will be to these reports.  Did they not learn anything after the Jessica Lynch fiasco?   ANGELS IN AMERICA  This weekend I watched all six hours of HBO's adaption of Tony Kushner's "" urlLink Angels in America "" for a second time.  It was as stunning and moving the second time through--if not more so.  Mike Nichols's lyrical portrait of Kushner's searing words is as relevant today as it was when it debuted on Broadway.  The names and years may have changed, but much of the history and story is sadly the same.  While every cast member was extraordinary in their roles, I was completely mesmerized with Jeffrey Wright's turn as Belize.  Wright is a blazing tour-de-force worthy of award recogniton.  Scathing, bitchy, brilliant, compassionate, he takes a role he played on Broadway to an entirely new and nuanced level.  Mary-Louise Parker's Harper Pitt is a brilliant portrait of disintegration and rise as a phoenix of unfettered proportion.  Justin Kirk and Patrick Wilson are superb in their difficult roles.  I am so looking forward to the DVD presentation of the film.  Truly a movie--and experience--for the ages.    BEST REMASTERED RECORDING OF 2003      Make no doubt about it.  This is one album that  MUST  be in your collection.  This exquisitely remastered, repackaged set is one of the most exciting recordings of the past twenty-odd years.  Disc One provides a remastered version of the album as it first appeared.  Then all eight tracks are repeated in the original productions as helmed by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards (of Chic fame).  Forget, that you get a second disc of extended, remixed material.  The original session recordings are worth every penny of the $29.98 this set that lists for.  Turn it up really loud and bask in the glow that is some of Diana Ross' finest work."

7HCUXM0,male,38,"LAY ON MY COUCH  "" The critical ontology of ourselves has to be considered not, certainly, as a theory, a doctrine, nor even as a permanent body of knowledge that is accumulating; it has to be conceived as an attitude, an ethos, a philosophical life in which the critique of what we are is at one and the same time the historical analysis of the limits that are imposed on us and an experiment with the possibility of going beyond them. ""---Michel Foucalt  A series of completely unrelated events over the past couple of days has left me in one of 'those' moods.  You know the kind where you wonder if you'll ever really know what  IT  is all about?  As for what my specific  IT  is--or yours for that matter--that's beside the point.  It's all about a journey.  A fantastical trip to places unknown and without a road guide.  Whether it be a trajectory of self-love, purpose, self-hate, being, or ultimately an end, we are all on a similar journey.  The one constant is always trying to find our boundaries on that path--and then learn how to carve new arteries and find new detours to explore.  I've said this before.  At age 38, I sometimes stop and look around me.  Whether that gaze is my loved ones, friends around me, or even strangers circling in outside orbits around me, the realization remains the same.  When do I become an adult?  When do I feel grown-up?  It's such a stupid question to ask out loud.  I am a mature, fairly intelligent individual who's had a fairly decent life to this point.  I interact with the world around me in a grown-up fashion.  I am an adult to onlookers.  Yet, I'm partly a fraud.  Inside, I always feel a streak of childlike fascination and wonder.  It is rather like being perched at the edge of a precarious cliff and trying not fall.  For every life lesson I learn, sixteen more questions present themselves.  For every person who I befriend and grow to love, there are those I never will.  Swirling throughout this process of being and wondering is an uncertainty.  It is an uncertainty that fuels me to move forward and scares the hell out me when I linger.   In the end, no matter how methodical and planned out you lead your life--the unexpected will always come calling.  Good people die.  Bad people succeed. Some days are filled with accomplishments--others frustrations.  It is precisely a game of chance.  A game to find your limits and move on--grow.  So, my preliminary conclusion is that I may never find that place where I feel grown-up.  But, more importantly, I'm learning to be okay with that.  I am not a theory or doctrine.   I am not an accumulation of knowledge and experiences.   I am influenced and affected by people and ideas around me--both positively and negatively.  I am finding my limits.  I am pushing beyond them.  I am growing forward--not up."
7HCUXM0,male,38,"QUEER ON COLLEGES  The October 2003 issue of  Instinct  takes a look at  urlLink colleges and universities  that rank as the most gay-friendly in several categories.  To wit, a few of their choices:  * BEST QUEER STUDIES PROGRAM:  Duke University * CRUSIEST CAMPUS:  Kenyon College * MOST FABULOUS SCHOOL: University of California at Los Angeles * MOST BI BOYS:  University of Washington * BEST FAG HAGS: Parsons School Of Design, NYC * GAYEST SCHOOL IN THE MIDWEST:  Grinnell College * BEST SHOPPING & NIGHTLIFE: New York University * BEST TANS/HOTTEST JOCK PARTY BOYS: Arizona State University   DICK & DAVID  On Monday, U.S. Representative and Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt  urlLink announced  that David Mixner would be appointed co-chair of his campaign.  Mixner is a well-known public policy scholar and political activist who was also a senior campaign adviser for Bill Clinton in 1992.  Mixner famously protested outside the White House when President Clinton backpedaled on a promise to allows gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces.  Mixner also penned an passionate and candid memoir,  urlLink ""Stranger Among Friends""  that is quite a terrific read.    For Gephardt, whose daughter came out as a lesbian publically earlier in the year, the appointment is seen as a shrewd move to try and court the disenfranchised GLBT voting block that is one of the targeted sectors for a Democratic return to the White House.   U.K. POP IDOLS & BOOBIES  As the second competition of the U.K. phenomenon ""Pop Idol"" (which spawned ""American Idol"" and a version in nearly every other country in the World) nears it conclusion, it seems to be stirring up another gay controversy.  Idol's premiere season champion, Will Young, became tabloid fodder when he publically declared his homosexuality after the competition's conclusion.  This year's competition takes on a lesbian spin, as one of the axed competitors, Kirsty Crawford  urlLink claims  that she fancied a fellow female competator and the two shared a bed.  She created a furor by being quoted in press reports as saying that the two ""have a kiss boobies kind of thing....We don’t actually do anything, we just bounce boobs.""  A kiss boobies kind of thing??  I'm gobsmacked!  Those crazy British folk.   SPEAKING OF WILL YOUNG...  On Sunday evening, Will Young was presented the Best Album Award at the National Music Awards.  His debut release  urlLink ""From Now On""  was never saw the light of day in the U.S., despite his appearances on ""American Idol"".  I purchased the import and was very impressed with Mr. Young's song selection and his silky voice.  He's preparing to release the first single from his follow-up album, ""Friday's Child"".  The single ""Leave Right Now"" will be released in the U.K. on November 24th, with the full album expected at year's end.  I highly recommend ""From Now On"" if you haven't given it a go.

7HCUXM0,male,38,"PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE  A few years ago, I crossed paths with a gentleman in his early thirties.  He had been married for ten years and had a seven-year old daughter.  He had recently separated from his wife after telling her that he was gay.  He was in the process of discovering what gay was.  I really knew little about him.  He was a friend of a friend.  Yet, for some unknown reason, he reached out to me in his search for guidance and answers to questions that had perplexed him for years.  It's so odd that at times we can find more comfort talking to a relative stranger, than in a loved one or close friend.  I certainly did not have the answers to his questions.  All I could do was share my experience and offer support.  One day after talking on the phone for several hours, I rummaged through an old journal and found some entries from the time in my life where I faced many of the same questions he was tackling now.  I made a copy of a page and faxed it to him.  It had the following written on it:  "" I am coming in.  At turns, I leap.  I crawl.  I get shoved.  I am pushed out.  I am dragged from my closet. I am stepping into the person I was meant to be. I am finding the new skin that my body, my heart, and my mind demands that I occupy. I am becoming comfortable with who I am and integrating that person and persona into my everyday world. I am realizing that as I get acclimated to my new skin, the process of going from a mental closet to the orbits that create my world is fully underway. From the circles that comprise my private life, my family life, my career life--the entire world around me is falling into place. I am a planet on an elliptical orbit waiting to crash into other objects. I am leaving my center--my closet--and traveling forth into a real world. With this new skin--a brilliant armor--I am venturing forth to slay dragons and claim my domain.   I am comfortable being who I am. I am validating my own existence. The many parts of my life are now being filtered through the cognizance and embrace of my sexual orientation.  Whether I look from a perspective of coming out or coming in--or perhaps a hybrid of both--I am achieving inner peace. Balance. Acceptance. Courage.  The overwhelming desire to be who I am. '  Happy Birthday D.  May your universe always be as beautiful as you are."

Meticulously and seductively directed and written by Anthony Minghella (and based on the Charles Frazier book), the film is a visually arresting Civil War period piece.  The story of journeys made by the film's characters is beautifully photographed by John Seale.  Stellar perfomances from the troika of Law (Inman), Kidman (Ada), and Zellweger (Ruby) highlight a film filled with wonderful supporting perfomances from the likes of Natalie Portman, Brendan Gleeson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and Kathy Baker.  From the beautiful scenery of Romania (subbing for western North Carolina) to the beautiful score by Gabriel Yared, ""Cold Mountain"" is an epic story of war and relationships.  It's brutal.  It's beautiful.  It's just the kind of film Oscar loves.   THE CHRISTMAS STORY  I had a wonderful Christmas with my family.  One of the gifts my niece received was a karaoke machine.  We must have sang ourselves silly for hours and laughed up a storm.  It deteriorated into a public access radio show that was too funny for words. (Our traffic reporter, Nerd Roberts, was killed in a tragic helicopter accident--so very Dr. Romano).  We ate turkey, ham and all the trimmings.  Of course, we had no snow--but it was a wonderful Christmas nonetheless.  I received some great additions to my DVD collection: ""Strangers With Candy"", ""Coupling"", ""24 (Season 2)"".  I was also gifted a gorgeous globe, a fax machine, Armania Mania and a couple of GameCube titles among other things.  But I think if I had to pick my favorite gift this year, it would have to be this:  urlLink 6-in-1 Kameleon Touch-Screen Remote .  This has to be one of the neatest pieces of technology to come along in a while.  I was overrun with a literal pile of remote controls.  Now, one sleek beautiful remote controls my television, satellite receiver, VCR, DVD, home theater system and stereo.  It looks fabulous too!   TOM SNEDDON: D.A. OR MEDIA WHORE?  Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon's gleeful abandon in pursuing Michael Jackson has sunk to new  urlLink lows  in its zealousness.  Whatever your opinion of Michael Jackson or the charges leveled against him, you cannot help but notice the unusual way his case is being handled.  Sneddon's original press conference was a textbook example of gloating.  Having media crews following the clerk filing charges against Jackson was pandering in its lowest form.  Rumors that Sneddon has hired a public relations group (The Firm) to orchestrate press appearances are troubling.  Now comes word that Sneddon has set up a website dedicated solely to the Michael Jackson affair.  Along with showcasing all relevant documents, the site has a FAQ section that has to be seen to believed.  Now many legal scholars are wondering if Sneddon has finally gone too far and compromised Jackson's right to a fair trial.  One can only speculate that Sneddon is looking forward to a time when he will be making the press circuit promoting his new book about the case.   ALBUM OF THE WEEK  Meeting great resistance at radio with its first single, Nelly Furtado's "" urlLink Folklore "" is a gem of an album that has been overlooked by many.  ""Powerless (Say What You Want)"" is one of those songs that takes repeated listenings to appreciate.  But once you surrender to its magic, you've got an inkling of the wonders that await on the album.  Furtado infuses her music with new sounds and her Brazilian cultural influences.  More musical and experimental than her hit debut""Whoa, Nelly!"", ""Folklore"" is a soundscape of beautifully cohesive and superbly written songs.  Among the stand-out tracks: ""Build You Up"", ""Explode"", ""Picture Perfect"", ""Childhood Dreams"" and ""Island Of Wonder"".  ""Folklore"" also sports an impressive supporting cast with guest appearances by world music greats Kronos Quartet, Bela Fleck, Jarvis Church, Michael Einziger and Caetano Veloso.  This is not so much an album as it is a beautiful journey.  Simply gorgeous.  Don't miss it.   WORLD IDOL  As an avowed ""American Idol"" fan, I was curious to watch Fox's Christmas special "" urlLink World Idol "" (which concludes on New Year's Day).  It was interesting to see how the competition was viewed elsewhere in the world.  The singers ranged from bad to interesting.  The judges were far more amusing.  I don't think the Polish judge will ever be invited to any competition again.  Aside from the strong U.S. entry of Kelly Clarkson, I'd have to say that the only two who have a comparative chance at winning the title are the contestants from Norway and South Africa.  I also have to be upfront and admit that I have a new schoolgirl crush on 25 year-old  urlLink Heinz Winckler  of South Africa.  Those eyes."
