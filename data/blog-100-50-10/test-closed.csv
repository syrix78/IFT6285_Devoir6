RY5U4JB,female,36,"Bonus! Yay! Last night as I was walking home from BART, I happened upon  Best Buddy Q  waiting at the bus stop near my house and as such got to have a good  twenty minutes  of unexpected ""hang out"" time with her PLUS a bonus glimpse of the  ever-fabulous   Little Lu ! Sometimes the timing in my life is  just so right !   K. So, I  just  fired off an e-mail to all my assorted managers explaining my  ""adoption plans""   again  lest they forget ( again ) that it's something I'm  planning to do  and neglect ( again ) to factor in time in which they must learn to live without me for a bit so that I can get my  New-Boo  settled in... I currently inhabit a very strange state of expectation wherein I never know if announcements like these will cause  every single person  in the entire world to  lose their minds  but heck, at least this time I'm ready for it.    In other news, I would like to offer a  clarification/rebuttal  re: yesterday's post submitted by a regular reader of our forum.   Apparently, it is the studied opinion of this individual that I ""totally misrepresented"" gestures and/or remarks made yesterday by this well-meaning  guest in my home  -- apparently aforementioned gestures/remarks were ""a joke"" and I have been advised that I should ""stop thinking everything is about me."" That being said, this individual would also like it known that he or she has ""no interest"" in pursuing relations with ""a dried up tw**"" like myself and as such I should ""consider myself lucky"" that he or she continues to occassionally become so ""desparate"" that they  appear  to be making themselves available to the likes of me.  Our lovely reader goes on to opine that I quite often come across as ""a total c***"" and that I need to stop ""bad-mouthing other people's jobs"" just because I ""get paid to suck d*** all day"" rather than doing actual work.   Right. For the record, I'd like to  formally respond  that I was  not  in fact making fun of anyone's  new employment . I feel that  phone solicitation  is a  valid and fabulous  way to make money and if I ever run out of d***s to suck, I may just look into it as my  next career choice . Above and beyond that, I think this reader's otherwise astute analysis of the situation as it occured in my livingroom yesterday is quite probably a correct one and I will therefore let it stand. [  DB=Whiney...Little...Prick.  ] Alrighty then, moving along...       Me  and the  Boo  (and the eldest of the  Missus B's  children) will be out and about this  glorious city by the Bay   either taking in a  urlLink flick  ( Boo's  actually in this so I would recommend everyone who is dying to say they knew her when queing up for some tix...) or watching some  quality acrobatics . This all depends on  permission  from the  Little B's  parents,  ticket sales  and  Boo-mood  so nothing is set in stone, just wanted to give a head's up to those stalkers out there trying to plan their next "" crouch and wait ""."
RY5U4JB,female,36,"Had a chat with the  Ex  earlier today. She really is good people. Breaking up is weird. That's it. I have nothing profound to say about it beyond that simple fact. I've been thinking about our conversation for the better part of the day. Not to find any hidden meaning or figure out if I could have possibly phrased something differently but more, I think, because i just miss having conversations with her so I keep replaying this one.  Anyway. I was actually planning to write something about a conversation I was having with  Mistah Lovah Lovah  about aging and solitude vis a vis loneliness but now that I'm here I'm just not up to it."
RY5U4JB,female,36,"They're baaaccckkkk!  For those of you keeping track, you may have noticed a marked  LACK  as it were in the mentioning of a certain under-thirty crew and while most of you (like myself) may have cared not even a little bit about the sudden disappearance of one  Dirty Boy ,  Other Girl ,  Angel  and  Texas Guy  I'm sure their respective mothers  did  actually give half a damn and will now be relieved to hear that they have returned from the rain-soaked halls of our sister state,  Portland, Oregon ! Give it up folks! That's right, the   prodigal crew   has returned -- slightly older, not particularly wiser, but in some respects cuter ( Texas Guy's  new haircut =   tres chic !!) Welcome back, kids! I can't say I missed you but I sure as hell could use a little diversion! Ha! Just kidding. We wuv our wandering rainbow children {big squeeze!!} I would like to take a moment to point out that apparently, for no reason other than my  urlLink new job position  i am now, in their beyond all reason jaded llittle eyes ""cool"" ... this is only  slightly  disconcerting because it makes me really wonder what  exactly  it was that I was before. Ah, well. no worries. If I left it up to the   puppies   to define me I'd be nothing more than a leathery old Mrs. Robinson stand-in who rents out rooms on the side... Glad you're back, Children! Stick around awhile, the weather's great!  In other news, birthday bash was fabulous! So very many wonderful children types running around. it just warms the cockles to know that the Alternative set seems bent on catching up with their more ""conservative"" brethern in terms of sheer output! Go, us!  Let's see... what else...? Missing the  boyz  right now:   Tony  - There are some truly fab people here but as of yet none has undertaken make it thier mission to brighten my mornings with the daily drop-in (NEVER let it be said that a stop-off by an attractive and well dressed young man isn't JUST the thing to get your morning going in the right direction!)   Family Guy  - I, am Dying to know what the world's  Cutest Family  is up to!!   Sir James  - What can I say, your ""serious"" look kills me! I need some earnest-ness in my life. Everything here is just too damn flippant...!   Mistah Lovah-Lovah  - I actually  DON'T  miss you at all but hell, I'm making a list, right??? Kidding! Are we still going out on the 30ieth??   Kyle  - I also don't miss because I've found another cute, approximately my age, serious gay man to bond with; sorry! (Again with the kidding -- sheesh! you people cannot take a joke!)  and  Drew  - You are the standard by which I shall forever measure all men (and some women!) I want to steal you away and keep you here under my desk (not like  THAT  you perverts!!) but you'd probably get bored.... {sigh}  Anyways... I miss you all. Write and let me know how the  New Me's  doing... You had better not be hanging around her desk, you fickle bastards!!"

Miss Bee  forced me to partake of some "" holistic "" drug thing and now I am  DYING !! At any rate. Ran into my beautiful  Professor K.  last night at school (I do this thing where I take the  long way  to class so I can walk by her office but she's never there so last night I was kinda running late so i took the  short way  and there she  was  coming down the hallway eating a cookie. sigh.

Anyways, she brought me another  refrigerator magnet . NEVER let it be said that a heart cannot be solaced by a simple  refrigerator magnet ...! It's actually kind of funny. When I'm in a relationship with someone they can call me every day, remind me to pay my bills, buy me bikes and leather jackets for Christmas, love my kid and when all is said and done, I'll still probably be grouchy at them for forgetting that I like  Shilling  brown gravy not  Lawry's  dammit!

And finally,  Little Brother  just called to let me know that the rumours of him co-habitating in sin as it were with probably the only female either of those boys has ever dated that I thought was worthy, are, in fact, true. Yay!    I had a very nice  police officer  sign off my fix-it ticket today. (This has degenerated into  random musings  at this point so bear with me...) He got all annoyed that I even got the stupid thing in the first place. he was all ""San Francisco cops! Why'd he even write the ticket. Damn waste of everybody's time!

R3Y34BF,female,26,"Getting to know...      CHRISTINA ELLEN G. BAUTISTA aka CHRISSY    Vitals:  Been cousins since I was born, but got more acquainted the Summer of 1998 at our family reunion in Ohio (at their house) = 26 years and counting  Role In My Life:  The Cousin You Love to Hang Out With – Chrissy is so fun to be around because, first of all, she seriously laughs at everything she sees and hears. She loves listening to me, my sister and my other cousins from California talk because she’s so amused by our expressions and slang. She’s so chill, often found with a smirk on her face. I feel so easygoing when I'm with this girl.  Good Times:  I spent the week in Ohio at my aunt and uncle’s house (Chrissy’s parents) back in 1998 after a family reunion. Before I had met Chrissy and her sister Melissa, all I knew were that they were kinda quiet and reserved, so I was a little apprehensive about meeting them because I’m so NOT quiet. They live in Maumee, OH, which is a pretty quiet city a few minutes away from the next big city, Toledo. We didn’t do a whole lot of sight-seeing, but we did what we could to amuse ourselves. One day, Chrissy and I were bored, so we found some cake mix and some chocolate mouse mix and decided we were gonna bake a cake. Suffice it to say it wasn’t Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker. #1, we forgot to grease the pan so the cake fell apart when we tried to take it out and put it on a plate. #2, chocolate mouse does not equal chocolate icing, so the consistency was…well, it wasn’t icing. So for dinner that night we served fragmented cake with hardened chocolate mouse on top. I don’t even think we cooked the chocolate mouse correctly. And then to top THAT off, we found some cherries that we scattered in a pattern on the cake thinking it would make it better. It didn’t.  In her own words:  “Hey, let's go somewhere I can see some lowriders.” – Chrissy on her last visit to LA"

KELSOE MAURIUS MADARANG GONDA      aka KELSITO, BEAN or just plain KELSOE     Vitals:  Been my nephew since he was a twinkle in his mommy and daddy's eyes, but met when he was only 12 hours old = 1 year, 2 months and cnounting   Role In My Life:  My Favorite Baby - I have bunches of nieces and nephews because I have a load of cousins. But they all live so far away from me that I don't get to spend much time with them or watch them grow up. But then, my cousin, Christian and his wife Tristin (who both live close by) had Kelsoe (who's my inaanak/godson) and let's just say the spoiling began. I love this baby so much! We all do! Just thinking about him makes me smile and seeing him brings the greatest joy to my world.   Good Times:  Kelsoe's a funny baby, with gags up the whazoo! When he hears music, any kind of music, he starts to dance, either bobbing up and down with hands at his side or rocking back and forth to ""Toxic."" He loves playing with anything that has buttons: the computer keyboard, the piano, remote controls, the doorbell (his personal favorite I think), cellphones. In fact, he was playing with my sister's cell phone today and managed to punch in a random code that locked her keypad for 8 hours. ha ha ha...   In his own words:  Picture us saying, ""Kelsoe no!

R3Y34BF,female,26,"Have Faith   If you've spoken to me at all this week, you probably got to witness the dormant outrage that lives within me. I think I'm a relatively patient person, and as much as I can, I will stand back and let my fellow humans be the erroneous beings that they are (not that I'm excluding MYSELF from falibility) and say nothing. But hurt me or something close to me and it's SO over!  Everyone knows that my camera and I are like a couple. I LOVE MY CAMERA!! But I had to bring it in to Best Buy to get fixed because the shutter wasn't opening all the way. Glad that I had bought a warranty for free repairs and maintenance, I set out to the electronic superstore the week before thanksgiving, November 20 to make use of my $60. The invoice they gave me read: ""SCHEDULED COMPLETION DATE: November 26. Too busy during thanksgiving weekend to pick it up, I decided to wait until Monday, December 1 to call in and let them know I was coming to pick up my camera. 1:15 pm, I call Best Buy and the customer service guy says that he can't find in the computer that the camera had arrived. Knowing that there might be delays, I say OK, and decided to call again the next day. ""I'm sorry ma'am,"" the girl says, ""But I don't see that your camera has been returned to us yet."" A little upset, I tell her how long ago I dropped it off and that it was scheduled to be ready on November 26. She apologized, yada yada yada, and knowing that she has no control over this, I let it slide until Wednesday. I speak with another young lady who says that my camera may have been dropped off on november 20th, but it wasn't physically sent to the vendor until NOVEMBER 24TH!!! So here I am, ticked off as hell that they would send the camera to be fixed 2 days before the completion date they typed onto the invoice AND THEN she had the nerve to say, ""well ma'am, the date is really just an estimate. It won't always be ready by then."" THEN PUT ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE DUMBASSES NOT SCHEDULED! And then she goes on to say that there is a UPS tracking # in the computer but she doesn't know if that's for an incoming or outgoing package. I reprimand her for a few minutes and midway into her, ""Thank you for calling Best--"" I banged the receiver onto the phone rest. I was too busy on thursday to deal with it so on Friday afternoon, I decided to go to Best Buy MYSELF and complain in person. The tech guy looks my invoice up in the computer, heads to the cabinets to look for my camera, talks to ANOTHER tech guy to help him understand what the computer is saying (TECH GUYS? really?) and then says, again, that the UPS tracking # doesn't indicate incoming or outgoing so he suggested I use their phone to call the customer service line. The guy puts me on hold for 10 minutes, then asked to talk to the tech guy, then advised that he would call the vendor the camera was sent to and by this time i am 5 minutes past my lunch and I still have to drive back to the office.  So I give the guy on the phone my number at work and storm out of Best Buy ready to slap the first person I see wearing a royal blue shirt and khakis. I get to work and I have a voicemail message from the customer service guy I spoke with 10 minutes earlier and he says that the vendor is already closed so maybe I should call them on Monday to check the status of my camera. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!! For the rest of my workday that afternoon I was speechless and spent.  So I head to the 5:30 mass at Holy Family Church and Father Maurice's homily was all about having faith; having faith that bad things will happen, having faith that they happen for a reason, and having faith that they will be resolved in due time if we just let it go and let what's supposed to happen, happen without getting so upset at everything that comes to us thereafter. After I got home that evening from a rockin' JC Chasez concert at the House of Blues (more details to come), I went to bed and laid everything that happened this week to rest. My camera was somewhere and worst case scenario, they lost it and will replace it. I personally couldn't do anything about the situation but complain and be upset and I was so sick of being that way that I decided to let it be and have faith that it would be okay in the end. All I was sad about was the fact that I wouldn't have it for a christmas party saturday night. Oh well, I said. It's cool.  I was eating breakfast the next morning, Saturday and my grandfather comes in and hands me this thing wrapped in foam paper and bubble packaging. ""Here, this was put into our mailbox by mistake yesterday."" It was my camera. My first reaction was, ""HELLO! Does Best Buy really not know the procedures involved with situations like this?"" Then I realized I had my dear digicam in my hand and I shut my mouth. It didn't matter anymore.   Moral of the story: Overreacting will get you nothing but unnecessary anxiety and agitation, which never helps in any situation. Sometimes you just have to have faith that things will be okay in the end. Life is so much calmer when I'm not angry and annoyed. Faith; I'd forgotten all about it."

I’m so flattered (and rather terrified at the same time) that they trust me that much to ask, considering wedding planning is still only an aspiration and not my expertise.   Good Times:  I went with Joellee to a bridal expo at the LA Convention Center and we were so overwhelmed with the 50 photographers, 40 florists, 30 bakeries, 20 invitation-makers, etc that when we got out, we both just kinda looked at each, glazed eyes and then she said, “ok, no more wedding talk for the rest of this day.”    In her own words:  “It’s like, when Trista was trying to choose between Charlie and Ryan. Even though she was having fun with Charlie, she was thinking of Ryan the whole time. That’s how I feel about these two dresses.

R3Y34BF,female,26,"LET THE SUN SHINE   Is that what the sky really looks like? I had almost forgotten! After weeks of rainy, lethargic weather, here we are under the bright blue backdrop that is the sky. The first sunny day after a rainstorm is one of my favorite things! I love how windy it is after a storm so that there isn’t any smog looming over us. As Molly Shannon’s SNL character the joyolist would say, “I love it I love it I love it!”   I’m in such a weird mood right now. I think it’s because I’m keeping myself from being a stressed about nothing and just being cool. On Sunday, after our drive down from Running Springs, my friend Thuy and I were getting out of the car at St. Elizabeth’s and I was all short of breath cuz I was scared we were gonna be late. So she put her hand on my shoulder and she’s like, “Anna, relax. We’re here, everything’s gonna be fine.” And I was like, yeah Anna, chillax…  Ok that’s all.

R3Y34BF,female,26,"DEAREST GOOD-BYE   I love going to the airport...I love it when I'm standing by the gate looking out for the familiar face I'm supposed to be taking home with me. I love it when I'm packed and ready to add another entry into my travel journal of life. I love the anticipation I feel right before I get to sit and fasten my seatbelt. The only thing I hate about the airport is often having to say good-bye when I'm there.  We had to bid Jhoette farewell tonight. If you don't know who Jhoette is, he's one of my best friends and he's in the Philippines attending medical school. I swear it seems just like yesterday when we were all singing karaoke back in March upon Jhoette's arrival, looking forward to our plans during his stay. And today I had to hug him, say I LOVE YOU, and then say good-bye.   None of us got choked up when he stood up from the table, grabbed his backpack and motioned for us to walk with him. Not one of us shed any tears as he showed his ticket and passport to the guard by the terminal entrance. No one uttered a disparaging remark as we walked away, knowing it would be 2 years before we'd see Jhoette's face again.   We didn't show much disdain this evening; instead choosing to joke around like we usually do to keep the mood light. Maybe it's because we were trying to deal with it all as best we could, hoping to stay, or even just become optimistic. But if you observed closely enough, you could see the heaviness that fill our hearts. It's not the greatest feeling you could feel. In fact it can be a little painful. It's a real mystery how a heart can tell when you're feeling sad, alone or angry.  I pray for the safety and success of my friend. I pray that with these great sacrifices will come greater rewards. I just wish this sacrifice didn't take Jhoette so far away. 1 year and 10 months...the countdown to his return begins now..."

R3Y34BF,female,26,"Proud   Last friday I spent the evening catching up with some great friends. Some I talk to, if not everyday, every other day, and others I haven't seen in months or years. It's times such as these when you witness the embodiment of true friendship. Except for Cile, who is our honorary, I spent practically everyday with these girls; talking about boys, ""suffering"" through espanol, world civ, US history or experiencing god! And of course we discussed, in length, about our futures. I look at them now and I am so proud to see who they've become.  There is Daphne, who, I think is the most naturally intelligent person I know. Lawyer to be at the UCLA School of Law, she will kick ass in the courtroom one day and I can't wait to watch her. Rochelle, who's graduating from Pharmacy school THIS YEAR, is the most fervent student I know. You don't know true dedication and sacrifice for career and school until you've met her. Iya, who just got a new job working for LA county, and who you will constantly hear me raving about is finally getting a chance to show off her skills. YOU GO GET 'EM GIRL! Cheryl, nurse and wife-to-be, I don't know who's happier, me or her. Vanessa works for an investment firm and she said she loves where she works. Loving where you work and who you work for is success to me. Jessica, a graduate of FIDM, is a design consultant for Bebe. She's as stylish, but not over the top, as they come and I know one day she'll have a fashion show of her designs on E!'s Style Network. Riza, whose fatigue from working the night before still showed during dinner, is one of my MANY nurse buddies who I can't say enough admirable things about. She just bought a new Toyota Solara Sport! Her sister Kristine, who's always been artistic, has a fetish for sneakers and, I just know, will be discovered for her talent someday soon. And then there's Cile, who's lack of doubt in life has helped her name earn recognition in PAYCHECK's end credits. We tease her about leaving her children at the grocery store one day, or losing her wallet everyday, but the truth is, I never fear for this girl because she always lands on her feet regardless of what's thrown her way.  I can't find the words to decribe the admiration and awe I feel for these friends of mine, who have not only grown up to be successful and ambitious career women, but have managed to stay true to themselves in the process. None of them have been disillusioned by adversity or even success and I am proud to know them."
27CKBT7,female,25,"...just thinking...  My mind today keeps wandering to the painting that presides over my Daddad's living room.  I'm scanning over the seaweed covered rocks that shine in the moonlight.  The ships look so weathered, like the small town behind them in the distance, but not unhappy.  I'm trying to imagine myself on that beach.  You would need a thick, wool sweater I think.  Everything is moist with salt water...can't escape the smell.   A foghorn sounds...there are still some lights on in the town, though it must be past midnight.  I can see the moonlight playing on the surface of the water, trying to illuminate further than the first few inches.  I'll have to be content with not getting in the water, though I want it to cover me.  Too chilly. I think about how in her last years, Mama must have spent a lot of time looking at this painting.  I wonder if she pictured herself wherever it is supposed to be.  She saw beauty in that scene...she was the one who picked it out.  That painting is like a long, deep sigh.    This whole weekend has been trapped in the painting.  It's been days of garlic soup, hearty sweaters, perfectly cured cast-iron pans, fat ceramic mugs of coffee, thick ecru-colored cream, grey, chilly skies, fine mists, sewing by hand, warm cat cuddles, crunchy leaves, seeing your breath, drafty houses..."
27CKBT7,female,25,"...it's getting hot in here...  Last night we met up with  urlLink Adam  to go have a little dinner, then head to the Cutting Room where his friend  urlLink Adam Dugas  was singing a few songs, including his version of Nelly's It's Getting Hot in Here!  Also performing were  urlLink The World Famous Pontani Sisters.   Glittery costumes, huge smiles, fake eyelashes, old fashioned dance moves...bringing back the burlesque atmosphere!  It was the best show I have seen in a long time.  Plus, there was Dana Pontani (singing), the Fisherman Xylophonic Burlesque Orchestra (awesome!  the xylophone guy wears a fez!), Jo Boobs ( does not show it all, but can twirl her tassels well), and Oh De Twirlette.  Yay!"
27CKBT7,female,25,"...it is not acceptable for a mermaid to turn into a panda...  My hands are itching to work out some ideas.  Why have I kept myself from drawing for so long?!  I guess I doodle some.  Anyway...Piper and Nick gave me a great blank book for Christmas, so I believe that tomorrow, or possibly this evening, I shall start filling it with things I like to look at whether it be other people's visuals, my own, or writing.  Very exciting.  I'll have to pull myself away from my new books though.  With my gift card bonus from work I purchased Fast Food Nation and Gangs of New York in person, and am reading them simultaneously.  Excellent.  I finished out the card last night on-line with The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher,  The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss, and the latest Dead Prez CD. I've seen two new movies within the last week: Gangs of New York and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Gangs was great.  I am absolutely fascinated with that period in time.  Very violent movie, but great.  I am a total nerd who now wants to go find where the five-points neighborhood used to be.  Harry Potter was good as well.  Maybe a little scary for kids, but probably not.  I was into crazy, mythic beasties at a young age, as well as low-grade horror films, and look...I'm normal...hmmm.                                                                                                               You know what I miss?  Crows.  I don't think the city has much visible besides pigeons and sparrows.  Sadly in K.C. they have so many crows that they place poison on top of buildings for them to ingest.  That's bad news bears.  I love large birds.  We had a badge in Campfire called the Thunderbird.  I think you had to stand out in the rain for 20 minutes or something to earn it (that's a very bizarre thing to have to do to earn a badge)  Anyway, I hoped more than anything that I would see an actual thunderbird someday.  Why am I never the person who sees the things I always read about starting in fourth grade from those books on the supernatural/myths/strange natural things shelf in the library at school?  I guess I should not complain...I have experienced some very ""strange"" (though they didn't feel wrong) things with energy and such.  Uh-oh...I'm getting all space-y on ya.  Yeah, so no crows here.  Maybe if I set out some shiny things they will come..."
27CKBT7,female,25,...watching...  Orion was shooting his arrow to the heavens last night as we headed back East.
27CKBT7,female,25,"...emerging...  Work is good!  Busy bee, busy bee.  I am enjoying my job immensely - the familiar faces who come in, the variety of materials, questions, and having things to do!  Yay this job!  I hope my feelings for it continue in this vein.  It has been a good past week...both Jeremy and I have reconnected with seemingly lost friends, I've started a new book - ""The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings"" and have a couple waiting behind the curtain - ""The Red Tent"" and ""Gravity's Rainbow.""  The food I've been eating has felt very healthy, and I have been exercising regularly.  We once again have fixings for White Russians in the house.  We had multiple days in a row of 60 or so degree weather...the snow is all gone, and the birds are out in record numbers.  Yesterday at the bank, a gaggle of Canadian geese were taking their sweet time walking along the drive that leads to the teller windows.  I watched a woman just wait helplessly in her car until they meandered past.  They were actually headed for a specific sidewalk, and walked along it, not going into the grass!  Here is a shout out to Morgan...my future neice...Happy Birthday!  You look great for your age!"
27CKBT7,female,25,"...pulling the strings together...  Lately I have been feeling a little like the miniature hot air balloons my Dad used to make in college out of paper bags and candles...the ability to go far - soar high, but delicate...I might catch fire at any moment.  It has been constant going, going, going...but when is it never?  I've been a bit of a complainicus I must say - Jeremy hears most of it, a little on edge, a little more manic songstressing, yet...I am happy for so many reasons.    Here are my reasons to celebrate today: the sudden tan-ness of my arms, Frank leaning his pink nose into the waves of the song coming from my mouth, a sweaty jar of Coke leaving rings on the beat-up desk, picking out paint colors for the house...brazilian blue, artichoke heart, laguna yellow, burnt cumin..., little kisses that cover your face, the hot sauce burn of Tapatio on my lips, wearing flip flops, seeing the cycle of life displayed in the gutter even though it was extremely sad, music that you can't sit still through, and...last but not least...it's Rick's birthday!  A real reason to celebrate!  Happy Birthday Rick! I just realized today that next Monday will be the first time I will have seen him in awhile, and the last time I will for x amount of time considering he leaves for South Carolina in a little over a week.  Everyone is on the go...I hope none of you catch on fire before you land."
27CKBT7,female,25,"...thanks...  Our Thanksgiving trek was great.  It was nice to get away even if for a couple of days.  Joan had her veggie lasagna just coming out of the oven when we arrived on Wednesday night.  So, we had a nice dinner, and just hung out.  Rachel and I had a fun time painting nails and chatting.  Thursday, we drove to Meade, Alan, Lucas, and Liam's farm in South Haven.  Ahhhh.  An invigorating walk and talk, good food, board games, no responsibilities.  Jeremy and I spent the night at their place, while Joan and Rachel stayed in town.  In the morning, I helped Alan take one of the cars in to town for a tune up.  Then we made our way back, and Alan whipped up his wonderful blueberry waffles.  Unfortunately, we had to leave after that to go back to Detroit, but it was the first night of Hanukkah, so Joan made latkes and applesauce (with ginger in it!) and we ate some leftovers too.  We exchanged prensents and played dreidel, which is a fun game (especially if the dreidel isn't rigged.)  So...there's a lot to be thankful for.  Thanks to all my new family...I love you all very much...and thanks to all my own family...you know I love you tons as well."
27CKBT7,female,25,"...one toe over the edge...  I screamed at a man on the phone this morning...he's with the Mayflower moving company.  We got a letter in the mail today that just made a rage brew in me.  I wish my screaming could have penetrated the heart of the corporate beast like a sword...be felt throughout the whole body...make it quake and question.  Instead I was yelling at an outer scale.  I don't feel fully sorry for doing it, though I always feel pretty bad for yelling at anyone.  It brought up lots of issues.  I'm partly feeling the sting of realizing my own naivete and stupidity regarding the move, and it sucks having to admit it's not all on somebody else.  It also just transported me back to those days of summer, when everything was so right for awhile, and then just got dashed into the ground.  I guess I've been suppressing a lot of sadness towards what happened with my dad.  I just released it all on Jeremy...poor guy.  Then I felt the sudden need to blindly write something down here.  I don't really need to talk to anyone specifically, I guess I just need to have something concrete come out of me...something I can look at.  Things aren't that bad.  I love my husband, myself, our life, our cats, friends, family, our house.  Sometimes I need to realize it's okay to embrace sadness, and that it doesn't have to be put in a spot where no one can see it.  So...now I'm realizing other people besides me look at this.  Uh...hi...please don't think I'm crazy or depressed.  I'm normal...yeah...normal... :)"
27CKBT7,female,25,"...till next year...  The party is over.  At least, the birthday party, not the party that is everyday of my life! (ha.)  A quarter of a century does not feel that different than last year, at least so far.  We'll see what is in store for this one...  The sun is still shining, and the leaves are still breaking delicately beneath my feet.  Halloween is not far away, and thankfully we have not eaten all of the candy...well...I had to buy another bag or two that we haven't opened, but we never finished off the original one!  My head is overflowing with things I want to work on in studio, strangers are calling Jer to have their pianos tuned, and the cats are still rearranging the rugs every night."
27CKBT7,female,25,"...i'm falling...  It's almost my birthday month!  Yes, I declare the entire month of October as my own.  This is absolutely my favorite time of year.  I love that I can still wear summery clothes most of the time, but that at night I need to put on a sweater.  Soups, chilis, stews and such are much tastier in the fall.  Halloween is by far the best holiday, and this year we get to super decorate for it, and we should actually have kids that want to trick-or-treat at our place!    Today the first leaves started to fall from the trees, and I noticed at the tip tops of some that the leaves had turned.  Fall makes me a little melancholy (spelling?  one l right?)  I know death and hibernation are coming for nearly everything.  It's a chance to reflect and release things and hope to survive to be reborn in spring.  I really like this aspect of fall.  This is kind of a central theme to my life...my name actually means ""of the resurrection.""  I love the image of the phoenix, periodically going up in flames only to come back again to repeat the whole process.  I suppose lots of people can relate to that, so I'm not saying it's a unique thing to me by any means.  Hmmm.  Enough reflection...let's go drink some warm apple cider...and eat donuts...mmm...donuts."
1K8H65N,male,26,"Yesterday was the most eventful day in my entire life. First was the episode at St Nick.. early in the day. How it turn out to be... Beyond description. There is definitely a better way to communicate. Else there can be a mature way in handling of the matter. Either way, that was the way she chose to present the affection towards him, the irritation that I am presenting. A bit dramatic. The whole drama was like watching her talking to me in the past... so familiar and loving. I would need to learn to control my emotions and temper. No emotions now... love, yet not that intense. Hate, yet cant bear to. Sad, yet too tiring. Just been too long...  Really thought I am dead when the car flipped. It seems like there are so many things in my mind. Not exactly the entire life flash by, a lot of the flash back of what she said to me over the 2 years, what we have done, those happy moments, sad one... everything. It just flash by... I guess what people always mention about when you are going to die, the so called ""life"" that appears before you is what you have been thinking about for a long time. We both have changed. Would need to find time to do a full check up, still hurts. What is more painful is the car payment. Sigh... in debt one more time. Wonder how much the insurance is going to pay.   Bugis shopping in the evening was like going back to the past. Althought would really like to do it in another method... nevertheless, surprise to meet all the old friends. So many pple are settling down. I guess I am still me, able to meet someone, somewhere as long as I am inside the shopping center.   The gathering with the ASLC group was less than the initial excitement. Not as many people as I thought it to be, still, it was fun to see them. When was the last time we met? Since the posting at Pasir Laba? Everyone grew fat... many with the characteristics that will never change. A bit on the surprise side when the group always remember me as the best trainee... and expected me to do well in life. I guess when someone excels at one point of his life, others will expect him to be smooth sailing all the way... So many people broke up with the gf they had back in SISPEC. Part and parcel of life... if someone like Poh can survive without Jessie, I would be doing as well as him.  Experiencing a bit of the single life that I so wanted when I was attached. Always hoping for that little breather space so that I can still do what I want... alone... with some peace and not to worry about gf. Now that I have it... feels weird that there is no one to share that kind of excitment when I see something nice. Shopping has always been of buying something for her... thinking how it would be nice... yet I can hold on and not buy anything during then. Nowadays can just spend without thinking. I have been thinking and planning to much for the future that I miss out the present. Need to curb spending again... sigh... hate it when I have to watch my spending.  Mindset determines EVERYTHING. I think... therefore I am. Today, is the changing point in my life."
1K8H65N,male,26,"Messy!!!! Never thought that the cupboard will be empty. Gotta iron and pack all those clothes back in. Sigh... where is Shell when I need her? haha...  Okay... later will pack. Actually, its quite good that I took 8 weeks to empty the cupboard. Was it 8 or just 2 weeks? Still I have to pack them back.  I think I am fine if I can think of putting things back in place.... okie... start work... tml have nothing to wear. tonight no place to sleep. I WANT TO SLEEP ON MY BED... again... sigh. Miss her on it..."
1K8H65N,male,26,"I figured what happened. Thats coz I was staying in the past all the while. Thinking of that sweet smile, that loving look.  Just remember that night, the distance felt and the disgusted look from her... Sigh... never the same again. Still she make my head turn when I see her.  Remembering that time when I was going to call her to look at some pretty gal and realised that she is the one... ha!  Have to start thinking or self talk tat she hates me, she hates me..... Yet, I dun mind being hated, just being here is enough. What contradiction!   The dilematic me now... is there even this word?"

TODAY.  ~Money dun mean much, except as a means of what you want to do. No money? dun do it... ~Only working in HP. ~Read.. nothing for a long time. Pick up a lifestyle book over the week end.. suppose I will still read it. ~Lost touch with the world for a long time, forget about the newspapers. ~Loads of time... nothing to do. ~Past time now, pubs and clubs. ~Listen to the Shell special that represented us for a long time. Today is the only day without any earphones in my ears... Cannon in D just drifted in. Wonder why that rythme ever pop in when I have not been listening to it even when Shell was around... brings memories. ~Army? whatever lah... ~Planning? Whats there to plan anyway... things just foul up. When you fail to plan, you plan to fail? Nay.. Either way, Murphy Committee will be there for me. ~Michelle, no longer around. Yet ya... still love her but slightly different from that moment of passionately wild. Not really contented with where I am, think lots of regrets...  I thought that Shell leaves me at the time when I love her the most. Then again, when you lost someone, is there any extension on how much you love a person? It is that I have been loving her enough throughout the relationship. The willingness to give everything from me came too late for her... Life simply came apart without her... became a bit dependent on her, never did realise.  For a long time, I was thinking about if she comes back... then how nice it would be... what we can do... I would want to show her this, show her that.. give her this, give her that... can be here, there, everywhere. Tell others how happy we can be... EVERY SINGLE TIME, reality hits hard. Well... if she did come back. 2 more days to her birthday...  ""*-*)/"

Sigh, some people can overcome all sort of adversity and move towards the path of living together. Some just break up for the smallest tiff long build ups, I guess.   The best thing out of part-timing is having something to do, get money & T shirts, watch free movies and maybe Ill get to know some pretty gals who share the same interest. Then again which idiot pays $12 to watch movie in park alone? Open mind. God says seek and you shall find lets see who can find me. The bad thing is that it is another of those little memories... nay, control your thoughts and your actions will being you through. Will definitely enjoy the company of the gang again, hopefully it will be so pack that no chance to think... must have lots of pretty gals.   These 2 days just stuck into so many things. I think I am still far away from being a manager... was never sensitive to the numbers. Look at those blue, black and red. Wonder how I ever ace my accounts... I need more subordinates to deligate the workload.  Be, Do, Have... why do I always forget about the simple stuff. Sigh..."

How many of them did you share With opportunity and date Again where you so often missed?  We do not find you on the list of Makers Good Explain the Fact! Ah, no 'twas no the chance you lacked As usual - YOU FAIL TO ACT!  Wonder how the most amazing note appear before you when you are thinking of one?

1K8H65N,male,26,"I wonder how much of a memory lane I am going to walk down before I decide to track a different path. Sometimes it is just difficult and pictures just float into my mind. No one says it was easy to forget someone that you love. The question is do I really want to forget about her and pretend nothing has happened?  Why people always do not know how to treasure what they have. It always have to be at the moment when they lost it that they are whinning about it. So I am just common after all, taking things for granted. Does she knows that I even love her even when I am not around, working, wondering how she is doing?  Communication is everything in any relationship. You know that you are gone when two are not able to communicate and talk over things like adults. Was I even given the chance to talk or was I just so insensitive about everything?  Work, by itself,  often has no meaning if you do not have any targets to look forward to, no one to share the joy of accomplishment and agony of some stupid colleagues that backstab you to look good for herself. She has to listen thru some of these stuff, but at times with all her troubles you wonder if you should boke her down with all the unhappy moments in the office. Next time, ask then share...  Feelings. There is nothing in this world call I know you so well that I can predict what you are going to do. Utimately, I dun know that she remains upset and she din know that I still love her despite all the arguments.  Base line for everything... GET A GOOD HANDPHONE THAT WILL NOT DIE ON YOU WHEN IT IS CRITICAL FOR YOU TO TALK. A good relationship that you treasure might just be lost like that... coz you are not able to get her at the time that matters most.  Well... if she comes back... take her back anyday. For how long....?"
1K8H65N,male,26,"An interesting lunch discussion. It started off with me not having a gf and they were ""guiding"" me on the places to go. So if it comes, it comes... I dun seek. Just seeking that gal for the moment.  I wonder how that ever veered off to Singapore men. ""hopeless"", ""not global"", ""bounded by rules"", ""MCP"" Wow... so most gals are not even considering Singapore guys. Sadly, I am in the number. So they say, I am still fine as a friend... no idea how I would be like when I am a bf... no one is interested to try anyway. Talk about dichotomy.  Need some self reflection should I seek someone as partner now. For the moment, Shell still lingers here and there. Cant sleep this morning. Today's dream seems more real than any others. I should live life, sit back, relax and enjoy. Treasure the past and enjoy those moments that we had... there are so many things that I have not done yet. Next time shall not picture life with gf... you think about too many things that you have flash backs everywhere. DArn....  Like Willy... if you get sex, you do... if you dun get sex, try soccer. Typical Singapore men. Thank Willy for making their point. Stupid Discussion~!"

I've been getting tired of running the  , chasing down my news and other sites of any interest.   As those of you who have been   with me on this blog from day one would notice (yes you...you know who you are), I'm slowly adding stuff as I go along. I'm sure this is the case with any   in the early days but I thought that I should let those people who do read this blog (yes, thank you the two of you again, hands down now...thanks) to bare with me as I slowly add all these upgrades. Still deciding what kind of stuff I should add. That sidebar really looks empty at the moment. Hope to get it all settled down soon but I know thats unlikely. I just love to tweak things. Never really trully happy with some things and yet there are stuff that once I get it the way I like it, I never change it. I think it depends for situation to situation. For example, I never touch my handphone settings again after the first day when I get it the way I like it. And yet i never leave the software on my Rig or PDA alone.I'm always trying out new ones when the old one works fine.

9FTB0A8,male,25,"Man...the surprises from blogger just keep coming. After re-vamping the whole interface and adding much sort after features like comments. They then throw in a photoblogging service that allows photos to be posted with just a few clicks and no html. Just like the one in the post below.  There are other additional features to the service as well that is pretty cool. Such as direct connection to your friends to share photos and chat with them about it MSN/ICQ style. So no more trying to find ways for  DaMan  to show off to me his photos from his latest holiday (all 9megs worth), we just both connect using the  urlLink hello client   and he can show me each photo at time, discuss them while both of us are viewing the same picture (so no more misunderstandings) and I can then op to save to my disk which photos I want.  Totally cool. If there is anything that can get me back into using my digital camera more often, this would be it. I highly recommend this to anyone with a digital camera, don't forget to add me to your list."

Most of the Internet problems over the weekend was caused by a worm exploiting the latest in  Microsoft  security holes. Good news that the attack doesn't seem to be malicious, but nevertheless it been giving huge denial of service worldwide. While it seems to be easily fixed, I'm wondering why this 6 month old hole was not fixed earlier? I'm not sure if this is an oversight of the server administers  or of  Microsoft , but at the risk of sounding bias, I'm sure you can tell where I am pointing my finger to.  Work Update: I managed to finish off one assignment, just have to reorder the reference list thats all. I am however waiting on the other assignment, still not all the details are in yet. I did get updated about the oncoming tests the weekend after the CNY, so looks like I'll be busy for next week and the week after as well. Starting to look like there is a pattern to how my school works. They like to dump on us last minute stuff especially the two weeks before the one before the test. Guess I'll have to be more aware for the next module. Good think I only have one to do after this two, but I have to study all three for the exams in April.  Aside from school, I did manage to learn something new in the form of installing and running basic desktop functions in Linux, that a good thing. I should learn a new skill every month for this whole year. Wonder what I can do for next month? Maybe finish off by learning the server side stuff of Linux, or hopefully Windows XP Pro. Of course lets not forget about Driving.  Hmm That should be kinda cool.  Gotta get back to work now. Will update again later.    >"

I figured that this one would be suitable to showcase.  You can find it here:  urlLink Lord of the Rings Personality Test   Here is my result:    You are most like  Frodo Baggins, Son of Drogo  With many acquaitenances, Frodo is deeply attached to a few people, like Bilbo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam. His high ethics come out in his treatment of Gollum and Saruman. Frodo has pity on Gollum and believes that change can occur. You have a strong personal morality. You are committed to relationships and their growth. You tend to be an idealist, believing the best of the world around you. Time alone is important and solitary activities refresh you. You have a tendency to introspection. While providing compassion and being considerate, you may have the tendency of being soft-hearted or even ""too emotional"" You like keeping your options open. Closure is probably not one of your strong suits.   The Orcs display the evil side of this personality with their lengthy torture methods.  Traits: Empathic, benevolent, looking to the future. On the dark side you could be sadistic.    Happy Holidays once again, may you find cheer and joy in everything and everyone around you. God Bless.  >"
9FTB0A8,male,25,"Statu5 Updat3   I live! :)  I know it sure didn't seem like it over the last week or so but yes (fortunately or unfortunately) I am still alive and determined to continue this online commentry.  It is back to work for me after quite a long break. Only now I work half days for I have taken half day leave for the next two weeks. This is to allow me to study in the afternoons, and looking at how much time I have left I really need to make full use of that time. However I find myself easily distracted, more so than when I was in Poly. Hoping that it just takes awhile for me to get my studying engine back up to speed.  Another important update is that the Home cell group that is meeting at my physical lair (i.e. Home) has begun. It is good to have people around, to sit around and chat in a comfortable setting, to share and study the Bible. Most of the members are younger than me, but nevertheless it is entertaining to listen to them and be there for them if need be. Of course   Edwin   is always the life of the party, with him sharing with us his jokes and stories. He always has this way of getting everyone to unwind and open up. So anyway we meet up on Friday nights at my house. Anyone interested for more details, feel free to drop me aline.  Lastly, here are some plans that I have for the blog coming up this month. I'm planning to get a Links section up on the sidebar, keep a look out for that. And I am still working on that article about the programs and how I use my Palm PDA, for those new palm users who would like some tips, now that they actually own one.  Here I go, back to the grindstone again. Take care and stay sharp."
9FTB0A8,male,25,"Well for more than a week, an error would have prevented most people from visiting this blog. Not that there are alot of visitors in the first place.  I had figured it to be a problem with the re-directing service from Pacific Internet and that they would fix it after a few days. However as it turns out the problem lay with how they handled the URL to be directed to, which required a change in the settings, of which I only discovered today after much testing. However it seems like this only solves the problem for a short while, then it pops up again. Really looks like a problem server side. Hopefully they will fix it soon but in the meantime Im looking into finding a new web host for the site. Having trouble coming up with a good domain name though. Any Ideas anyone?"

9FTB0A8,male,25,"5nowflakes in the 5ystem    Its Christmas time in the City.  Many season greetings to one and all. Over the last two days, Ive witness with some amusement the last minute shopping rush that always takes hold this time of the year. However it seems like this year the rush is even greater and not just in the shopping centers and malls. Online shopping rates jumped again since Thanksgiving. Would look like more and more people are turning to online shopping as a way to beat the rush. I think that the delivery service that these online stores provide is the key selling point. They would even wrap and decorate the gift for you. Very useful if you cant wrap for nuts.  Kinda makes one wonder why there isnt any good and established online retailer here? Most likely because the market is small and filled with already established big name brick & mortar retailers. So I guess the best way to go is for these retailers to set up their own website to conduct e-shopping services and to provide delivery.  You will have to forgive me. My new course modules have just begun and one of which is on Electronic Commerce technology, therefore I have been thinking in this areas as of late. It also doesnt help that I dont seem to be in the Christmas spirit this year. One would think that I would be jumping around in a red suit since this is the first Christmas where I Dont have to wear green. But with the things in my life of late, it seems that Im back to wearing blue.  However the tide is changing. I think Ive been putting myself low for far too long. If there is any occasion to rise myself up, now is the time. Hmm perhaps its not too late to regain that Christmas Spirit and do some Window shopping.  *Grins*     Merry Christmas Eve everyone and all.       >"
9FTB0A8,male,25,"I have been scouring the Net for this book,  urlLink Plowing the Dark  by  urlLink Richard Powers . I heard that it is similar to  urlLink Snow Crash  by  urlLink Neal Stephenson  in that it talks about a virtual Cyberworld where people worldwide log-on to and interact with others and their environment in real-time.   Im a big fan of Stephenson and of his peers,  urlLink William Gibson  and  urlLink Bruce Sterling . If you havent realized this yet, then you havent been looking around this website enough  *grins* . I remember reading most of their old stuff but never actually owned them until recently, (I think I dug them out of some corner in my primary school library or something like that) and would like to read Powers take on this genre. Well it looks like I will have to access a library for a hardcopy of the book after all as I have not been able to find an e-book version.  Talking about the Metaverse or the on-line virtual world that is the basis of both of the books mentioned above, one should look into  urlLink Second Life . It is the closest form of a real virtual cyberworld I have seen yet. In fact, I have been participating in the beta test ever since I heard about it in April. In short, all I can say is that it is a very intriguing concept that uses state of the art technology. Being able to chat and interact with people all over the world in real-time and a realistic looking environment really brings to life all the ideas that one can imagine in being a virtual world where almost anything is possible. Events are constantly being held in-world, users buy land and build houses and shops, sometimes in a group as building in-world is done in real-time with everyone seeing the results at the same time. Users take a lot of effort to make their in-game avatars looking surreally like how they are in the real-world and even upload images to be made into clothing. Any fans of ICQ/IRC chat programs and enjoy messing with 3D design programs will totally feel at home there. If you do decide to take a look, remember to let them know that  urlLink I sent you .             urlLink"
09SDT6G,female,24,"Keegan has this ridiculous habit of thinking that every time we see someone, she knows them....seldom, if ever is she correct.  Hell, we could be watching an AT&T Wireless commercial and she'll swear that she knows the person in it.   Last night at Carmine's was no different.  We both noticed a girl sitting at a corner table that we couldn't place.  We racked our brains for over an hour, calling mulitple side bars from the boys to discuss it, but we came up empty handed every time.  Finally I knew that she had to work at Amadeus.  Keegan (as terrible as this sounds) could place her bringing her something to drink before she got her hair cut.  Yes I know, we're sick.   This girl finally comes over to our table to bum a cigarette.  Keegan immediately tells her that she recognizes her and asks her if she works at Amadeus.  Her response (are you ready?!?) ""No I work at Jonathan's, are you both stylists?!?""  We of course kind of giggle to ourselves and all I can say is ""I love him!""  Over and over....and over and over.  I looked like a lune!  It was Kimberly, Jonathan's assistant/new hair stylist who took 4 hours to cut some guy's hair in the last episode.    Oh. My.God.  Most of you have no idea how much I love Jonathan.  This is a dream come true for me.  I want nothing more then for him to cut my hair.  And she was in Pasadena!!  We might be neighbors and I don't even know it! Imagine it!  We could become friends, she could tell Jonathan that she met the perfect girl for him...Shut up, Kevin.  He likes girls, this one's in my family!!  AHHHHHHHHHH!!    You would think that after all of that excitement, my night couldn't have gotten any better...I've got  4 words for you: ""Amish in the City.""  Learn it.  Love it.  You'll be a better person for it."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Lately I haven't really felt like myself....it's not like I'm unhappy or anything torutred-soul like.  For once there's not that much drama involved.  It's something different.  I look at the elderly that walk in front of my car in the crosswalks and wonder what their lives may have been like, are they lonely, are they saddened that the greater part of there lives are over.  I then find myself, as I'm sitting at the Coffee Bean with Eugenia genuinely wishing that all those around me are happy, I mean really happy in the purest sense of the word.  I don't know these people from a hole in the wall, but I wish them happiness or at the very least a general feeling of good will.  Strange.  Now I'm not trying to make myself out to be a saint, because believe me, I'm the farthest thing from it.  But I really and truly believe that everyone is valuable and worthy of common decencies and respect.  So many times I think most of us get caught up in our own lives and personal dramas that we forget that there's a whole world out there that we'll never know because we couldn't see past our own noses.    I strive to be an expectional human being.  I surround myself with who I feel to be exceptional human beings.  Someone once told me that I wasn't worthy to meet a friend of theirs....I immediately thought to myself, how very sad for you that you don't want me to meet him.  I am so proud of each and every one of my friends and I love them all so dearly that I would be honored for the whole world to meet them.  I never want to have to tell my children about the people that I loved the most, I want them to see their greatness first hand.....be witness to individuals of exceptional character.  Granted they are not without their flaws, but who isn't.  I like to see my friends as an All-Star line-up of sorts.  Each person bringing something different to the table and adding value to my life.  Therefore why wouldn't I want to share them with the world??    My best friend for the greater part of my life, Arianne, leaves me the most lovely messages to wake up to in the morning.  I don't know how she does it, but she has this uncanny ability to say the right thing at the exact moment I needed to hear it.  As I said in a previous post, she's my biggest fan, my champion.  When she tells you to believe in who you are and that you're destined for greatness, you can't help but believe it because it's said with such whole-hearted conviction, how could you ever doubt it.  I think people like Arianne are sent into our lives as guardian angels, they uphold us at our weakest, loves us the most when we screw up, and forgive us our worst faults.  They're more than friends, it goes deeper than that.  She is a beautiful human being and without a doubt, I can say without faltering that she gives more to the world than she takes from it and will leave the world a better place for just having been in it."
09SDT6G,female,24,"I keep hearing the line ""being an adult is about getting over your childhood,"" that growing up and dealing with all of the issues that bogged us down growing up is like a right of passage.  Not so in my case.  I, unlike most people, had the fortunate experience of growing up in a loving, nurturing home where my parents set a pristine example.  I've always felt that my parents are a reflection of how people should be...yes they're kind, good, and just...but it's more than that.  It was never lip-service.  They truly embodied the qualities they wished to instill in my brother and me.  Of course we have our arguments and petty disagreements, but it would never get to the level where it would sever my ties with my family.  In the end they're all we've got.    Of course you could throw friends into this mix, but even then they too tend to disappoint at times...I'm not saying all, but some.  I know, I'm a cynic.  But I've been there, experienced it.  It's not fun.  I have yet to grasp how it's a learning experience as much as it may have been a lapse in judgment.  I believe that once you love someone you will always love them....it never dies, it just changes shape.  Yes, the feelings may not be as fervent or at the forefront of your mind, but at one point you found some value in this person.  They contributed to your life, whether it be good or bad, they have shaped, however small, the person you are today.  That's what I do when I become angry over a past friendship, I remember a handful of the good times and suddenly I remember why I involved myself with that person in the first place.  My mom used to always tell me that I would fixate on the bad because it's easier to remember the horrible things people have done to us rather than the good.  That statement stuck with me.  I didn't want to be bitter.  I wanted to see the best in people...still do.  But it's easier as a child, feelings aren't as complex, ignorance really is bliss.  Hence the importance of keeping your thoughts positive.  Every thought you have plants a seed in your subconscious and if they're negative, you're just contributing to your negative karma.  So you think, so shall you be.  I think as you get older it becomes more difficult to forgive and forget.  Of course it's a virture, but yeah so what.  So is patience, that too is lost on me.  Seriously though, when your best friend in 3rd grade hurts your feelings, it's not felt as accutely as a failed friendship at the age of 30 or even 25.  See, emotions become more complex and the various emotions are achieved at different levels for different people."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Last night a group of us went out to this wonderful little restaurant in Silverlake called Cafe Stella to celebrate Bastille Day.  Keegan finally got to meed Tiffany.  All in all I'd say things went well.  It felt like a tiny piece of Paris in the middle of L.A.  Actually it was a bit refreshing to feel like I'd stepped out of the city for a moment.      After our three hour dinner and an ever so slight disagreement over the tip, Keegan and I went to Beverly Hills where we met Lauren and some girl.  (don't be fooled, Lauren's a boy)  We all met up at Backstage and it was a total bust!  However I did finally manage to talk to the owner who is Sting's manager....Yay!!  I'll keep going back to that place just for that mere fact.     So I still have yet to write back to Nigel.  I've calmed down a great deal about the whole thing, but I can't help but feel like I should address it in some way because it is going to be virtually impossible for me to avoid him for the rest of my life....however nice that thought may be.     If truth be told I don't really know how to go about addressing it.  I don't want to attack him, I don't want to point fingers, and I'm certainly not out to make him feel like shit.  I just don't want an argument.  I suppose my silence is making some sort of a statment to him, but like I've said previously....Nigel's immune to the feelings of others.  They just don't register on his radar.  Plus I'm not quite sure what I'm hoping to gain from all of this because he does  not  in any way, shape, or form ever make me feel better about myself or make my life better in any way.  Bottom line: he doesn't contribute in a positive respect.      On second thought, maybe it's best not to say anything."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Just as I suspected, he apologized.  Via email.  Title of heresaid email ""hey yo.""  Gee, that email was just begging to be opened and read.  Granted I should have immediately hit the delete key, but my curiosity got the better of me and I read it.  Now, I have to say that I was right.  I knew that he would apologize this time.  I knew that he realized that he had gone too far.  He felt badly about it, or as badly as Nigel could ever feel about anything considering that his self-righteousness is practically suffocating.  The email states that he apologizes for upsetting me and that although he knows that we argued, he doesn't remember what was said.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?!??!  Am I supposed to buy into that garbage?!?!  THEN....THEN he has the gaul to ask if we want to go to the movies later this week.  This is some sort of joke, right?!?  I mean the kid really can't be this dense can he?!?    So I call Keegan, tell her what happened...ask her if I should just let bygones be bygones.  She advises me to ""enlighten"" him as to what was said so that he learns that he can't go that far.  However, note to self, she is in fight mode due to recent events.  Drama was the name of the game yesterday.  However I am in no mood or no condition for that matter to start a war of words with Nigel.  It wouldn't be pretty.  (no pun intended)  Although I don't feel that I can ignore it either because my silence in a sense is condoning his actions.  I can't let him win.  Not this time.    I think I should create a powerpoint bulleted presentation on the highlights of our argument.  Ideas?  Thoughts??    Haven't written back yet...I think I'll make him sweat it out a bit longer.  Not that he will sweat it out.  Once again the arrogance factor kicks in and he can safetly rest in his office knowing that at the end of the day his intellect is far superior to my own and that his life will be far superior...or so his delusional mind thinks...  Oh Nigel, sometimes I think you'll never learn."
09SDT6G,female,24,"After a brief hiatus I am back.  Nigel has this uncanny ability to make my blood boil.  I have no clue why I allow him to get under my skin the way he does...maybe it's because he points out my flaws like nobody's business...maybe he's just an asshole.  Yeah, that's it...  We'd been doing well over the past week or so.  Basically he stayed out of my way and I stayed out of his.  We hadn't seen each other in awhile so I thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea if we were social...together.  Once again, I was wrong.  It all started on Saturday when I had a lapse in judgment and invited him to the Galaxy Soccer game.  He was already going with his family.  I was going with Eugenia and John.    Just as I was saying to Eugenia how weird it would be if we ran into Nigel, he comes walking down the staircase next to our seats with his family...TOO WEIRD.  He doesn't notice us.  It was the first time that I had ever seen his family.  To his family's credit, his parents appear very much in love.  He seems to adore her.  Too bad that didn't rub off on their children.  I blame his mother for not hugging him enough as a child.  It's minute 83 of the game and Nigel finally realizes that we're 2 rows behind him.  He sees me and his face gets beet red.  I loved it!  He was mortified.  HAHAHAHA  After the game is over he proceeds to book it out of the stadium, leaving his parents in the dust.  Now one can only surmise that the last thing he wanted to happen was for me to meet his parents...it's like he's ashamed of all of us even though he told me the other day that I would be the only one that he would ever allow to meet his parents.  I think it's just lip service.  The kid's a freak.  End of story.  Cut to Sunday night after a long day at Disneyland with screaming children and ridiculous heat.  I come home, Keegan tells me that he's called.  I call him back.  We all agree to go out for a drink.  All is fine and well.  Keegan gets the grand idea to have everyone back to our house.  Fine.  It's still relatively early.  We all go back and the clan quickly grows.  We're all drinking, laughing, having a generally good time...but that was not to last my friends.  Nigel tells me that he needs to talk to me outside.  I reluctantly agree because as we all know, Nigel+alcohol=drama to the nth power.  As soon as we get outside he proceeds to have the nerve to tell me that I have far too many ugly qualities and that Keegan and I are frighteningly lazy and that we really don't do real work.  My blood begins to BOIL!!!!!  I start yelling and swearing and just generally acting like an idiot.  How dare he talk to me like that...but the buck didn't stop there.  Nope.  He had to make matters worse.  He continues to point out my flaws, question the importance of my job, the likelihood that I would ever have a career, that I have so many good things about me, but my ""ugly qualities"" so many times will overshadow them.  Fine...you know what Nig...LET ME GO!!! And that is exactly what I screamed at him.  I told him just to let me go, not to concern himself with me when he could only find negative qualities about me.    OH AND THE BEST thing of the night happened when he was on the phone with Lauren and I asked him if Lauren was coming over and he proceeded to tell me to shut up and flicked me off...gets off the phone and proceeds to berate me, telling me to ""never do that again, you know better!!!""  THAT'S IT! I'VE HAD IT!  I will not continue to be talked to like this...  So, I tell him to leave...I proceed to tell him that I'm done, not to bother with me ever again.  Forget he ever knew me.  I proceed to tell him that not even Christopher can save his ass with me this time.  He just rolls his eyes at me, I slam the door so hard that I thought for sure the glass was going to break.  I storm inside, Keegan immediately yells at Nigel, ""What did you do to her!!!!""  I go straight upstairs, citing to Keegan that if anyone thinks it would be cute or funny to follow me or wake me up or if Nigel even came within 5 feet of my bedroom door that I was moving out...end of story.  I thought that I could sleep on it...wake up this morning and realize that I had acted irrationally.  I'm a girl and sometimes girls do that...but NOPE!  I am completely in the right.  I did nothing wrong.  In fact, I didn't do enough.  My mind is reeling with things I should have said to that bastard.    Believe me, I thought about firing off an email...but what good would it do...it would just further serve to involve me in this ridiculous game.    The real kicker is that after I was finished yelling, as I was about to go inside Nigel grabs my arm and says in the most arrogant, condescending tone, ""I look forward to being married to you some day.""  I give him the look of death and tell him to go to hell.    Best night ever.  And Christopher, not even you can save it this time.  I'm done.  My unborn children thank me."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Some things a select few have overlooked because they were too concerned with the bad to see the good:  Rainy days make me sad.  I love the wind in my hair, even though I'll curse the knots in it later.  I still love to know what my parents are having for brunch on Sundays...it makes me miss home a little more.  Every day I question whether or not I made the right decision in moving 3000 miles away from my family.  I love that my laugh makes other people laugh.  I know that I made it on my own here without strings being pulled, phone calls being made, or favors being called in....I did it my way.  I'm proud of the fact that my parents have been married for 35 years.  I'm proud of my brother for pursuing a political career and even prouder that so far he's proved a success.  Despite your opinion, I was and never will be too good for public transportation.  Sometimes I'm afraid that I'll never live up to the expectations that others have for me.  My favorite noise is a comfortable silence.  I love that the friends I had as a child are still among my closest today.  I think we all need to believe in something greater then ourselves.  Last, but certainly not least...you will never know me."
09SDT6G,female,24,"Since I'm sure you are all on the edge of your seats waiting to know if I ever heard from Brian again or more importantly, Bill....here's the scoop.  I got an email from Brian regaling me with a story from the other night that I missed because I didn't wait with him while his car was brought around.  Apparently some rap artist really liked his tie or something...totally inconsequential.  He also added as a final note that he ""hopes I had fun last night.""  Nope!  Definitely didn't check that box on the survey afterwards.  On to more pressing issues.  Bill.  He did what I knew he would do.  He sent me an email in response to my voicemail.  He's done this ever since we went our separate ways.  I'd like to think it's because he doesn't know how to talk to me or deal with me because he has yet to reconcile his feelings for me.  The other part of me feels it's because he's an asshole plain and simple and could really care less.  So he emailed.  A one-liner signed Bill.  I proceed to write back that for some reason or another I knew that he would respond to me via email and proceed to tell him how I've been since the 6+ months it had been since we'd last spoken.  Now here's the rub:  In less than 2 minutes I receive an email saying 'she did write she knew that I would email her back...hahahaha' and proceeds to talk about some aveda hair product.  Well of course I got the wrong email so I write him back asking if the message was meant for me.  Obviously it wasn't because by the time I had written a two sentence email he had already responded, stating that the previous email had been meant for his friend John.  By this time I'm livid!!  He's talking about me!!  Now boys usually don't gossip like this or pass along superfluous information to friends about girls, but for some reason Bill had felt the need prior to that email to tell John that I had called him the previous night.  You ask why?  Answer:  Bill's unstable so there is no answer.  I must admit though that in some twisted fashion I'm a bit flattered that Bill felt that this was an important enough tidbit to tell John.  If it had meant nothing to him he wouldn't have mentioned it, right??  Am I wrong in thinking this?!  Also in his previous email he said that he would love to grab a drink with me next time I'm in Santa Monica if I'd like him to....of course I would, but just how much am I willing to put up with to get me to that point?!  When is enough, enough?  I've taken more than my fair share of a beating from this kid and yet I keep coming back for more.  I keep telling myself that in 3 years none of this will have mattered, but it's almost a year later and it still consumes me everyday.  I can't help but feel as though I'm being punished for something I never did...it's like I represent to him one of the unhappiest moments in his life.  Granted he lost 3 friends and 2 family members all within the span of less than a year, but that's not my fault.  All I ever wanted to do was help him.  Apparently he doesn't need my help.  Well fine.  But when do I stop offering it?  About 9 months ago when he freaked out on me and attacked everything that I believe in as a human being?  Probably.    Those of you who know me know that I over-analyze things and beat them to death.  But this one really bothered me because I'm nobody's fool.  I'm not here to be made a mockery of so I shoot back and email telling him that he was so busted and just for that he owed me a drink.  I make light of the situation because Bill's always been fragile.  I'm not here to drive him further away.  He then writes back again that I can give him all the shit I want, that he can take it.  I can just picture him in his office shrugging his shoulders and saying 'so what!'  It's kind of like tough, what are you going to do about it?!  The answer: nothing.  I either just accept that this is the way he's going to be or move on.    I know a few of you are reading this and rolling your eyes and wondering when the hell is she going to snap out of this, the kid's a jackass...you're right he is.  I can know that and I can tell you until the cows come home that he's different, that there's something special about him....you'll call me crazy.  I'll still know that I'm right.  It's an endless cycle.  For one reason or another, whether or not you choose to accept it, and I know that many of you have had your differences with him....I adore him.  I took him at face value, not for the dealings that any of you may have had with him in the past....because you know what, it's the past.  Let it go.  We all make mistakes.  Hell I'm probably making one right now, but that's for me to decide and not for you to judge.  We all make our own beds, let me lie in mine.  Oh and would you save the I-told-you-so's??  They're old and you're too old to be saying it.    For me, right now is enough."
09SDT6G,female,24,I feel like blogging is a trend or something.   It's always embarrassing to start a blog (especially when it’s a hot trend). It takes a little pushing and a little shoving and then you don't know what to write about and you think it's all just stupid (which it probably is) but you forge ahead anyway and then ask all your friends to start blogs because you don't want to be the only asshole in your social circle talking about it like a technerd. Then your friends start blogs and their first posts are about how lame blogging is and how much they think it's dumb but they persist and more kids cave in. Soon enough every friendster you’ve ever had now miraculously has their own blog. And now you can go to bed content knowing you are a cliché.   The Moral: Peer pressure is still hot in 2004!
09SDT6G,female,24,"I know that I've been on a bit of a hiatus....but I truly have been keeping myself insanely busy.  However I knew that my blogging was long overdue when I had friends emailing me that I had no clue that they even ever read the thing, telling me that I needed to post.  So here it is, my insignificant ramblings on a few things.  First off I would like to say that never before in my life have I been prouder of Lindsey G Keegan.  She has finally taken the first steps in her road to quit smoking.  I believe she is now 5 days smoke free.  I always told her that my one wish for her was that she some day quit smoking.  Anyone who knows her knows how she loves her cigarettes....I think she'll learn to love the extra years of living more.  Last night she told me that she's really excited about ""the glow"" returning to her face.  I guess, and I never knew this, that smoking dulls your skin.  Ya learn something new everyday!  Keep up the good work sunshine, I'm pulling for you!  Next:  Happy Birthday Arianne!!  Even though I know she reads my blog and is yet another person requesting that I update it, I felt that I had to write a bit about her for all of those who have not had the privilege of knowing her.    Arianne is one of my oldest and dearest friends.  Our lives crossed paths at the tender age of 6 and we've been best friends ever since.  Last night I sent her a quick note telling her how much I admired and adored her.  You see, she's always and probably always will be my biggest fan.  She sees the greatness in everyone and has always realized my potential for greatness.  There's something to be said for that kind of devotion.  And for that alone I love her.  As I told her, I'm grateful for everything she's ever done for me, the person she's become, and for the person she will someday be.  I have been blessed with one of life's greatest gifts: a true friend.    Recently I've been terribly homesick because I'm going on my longest time ever of not seeing my family, but when things get especially unbearable I just think of all of our countless memories and suddenly whatever it was that was bothering me isn't so terrible.  It's probably been at least 10 years since we've lived within the mile that we once did, but it in no way has put a damper on our relationship.  In fact I think it has only strengthened our resolve to maintain our friendship.  I don't dwell on the fact that I see her twice a year (if that)....I just focus on the few short moments that we are able to steal here and there and be forever grateful for them.  If truth be told, I don't know when I'm going to see her again.  I just know that it can't come soon enough and our time together would never be long enough.  But on April 8th 2004 I wish you the happiest of birthdays and a life of love, prosperity, and happiness.  Remember I'm with you in spirit always."
TA65F14,female,23,"Is it me, or do you just love when your grandparents come over? I do! She hardly ever makes it out this far and I think it's great--especially since she's cooking today! She's making her famous beans, cabbage and potato salad. One could only hope for her cornbread... (can you feel me praying that she finds the cornmeal and flour in our kitchen?)  Any who! I recommend you people try her food once before you kick the bucket ^_^"
TA65F14,female,23,"You know, I was really trying to be good about this, but I can't. Have you guys heard the saga surrounding Ricky Williams from the Miami Dolphins? He decided he wanted to retire from football, blahzay blahzay. And as guessed, he renigged, and is now back with the Dolphins. According to this  urlLink article on ESPN  he 'retired' because he didn't want to fail yet another drug test?? Apparently, he's been touring with Lenny Kravitz and ... yadda yadda, he loves Bob Marley... yadda yadda, drinks 32 ounces of ""Extra Clean"" before every drug test... and maintains that marijuana is -- just a plant?  He makes my eyes cross and my forehead hurt. I told ya'll that boy's braids were too tight. He cut 'em off, but I don't think he's made that COMPLETE transition. Oh my word, don't get me started on this man."

I hollered with the best of 'em and danced 'til the lost came back on. I enjoyed the entire concert. Hedish and I started a ""Purple Rain"" chant that semi made it's way around the place. We participated in the ' oooohh-hooo-ooohs ' at the end of the song, while Prince broke it down on the  gui -tah. I know people preach the likes of Jimi Hendrix and B. B. King when it comes to guitars, but when Prince plays it's a different story. The man laid his guitar on the ground and it continued to play as he walked away!!! He worked it so hard that he eventually had to lay a cloth over it to put it to REST! Come on! I'm sure others could do the same thing, but who cares, they're not Prince?!  The Man is 47 and busted out with his own ol' skool version of the Harlem Shake -- Prince-style! What? I envied the groupies with backstage passes who were selected to dance on stage. One chick sang on HIS mic! ....I wonder what he smelled like -- 'cuz you know Prince's odor is just no  odor .... it's  THE  odor, okay?  I love how people from my church had front row tickets. I don't know why, but I do. I like that they got their praise on Sunday, the day after chanting, ""I said the ride was soooo sweeeeeeeet! You must be a limousine!"" Hmm, I don't know. But something tells me that Prince wasn't just talking about a car?? Um-umm, not at all.  Today was my second day of work as a reporter! I get business cards and I have my own computer. Before the day was over yesterday, I had made Prince the center of attention on my desk top. I'm really trying to be nice with these people, but it isn't gonna be too much longer before I bust out with my Greatest Hits cd. I'm trying to be nice and it's really hard. But then again, I guess it's a good thing 'cuz I won't be tempted to hit the high notes.  I also wrote my first sports article today. I wrote about two different high school football teams in the area. Can I just say the thought of writing other sports stories in the future pleases me? I'm doing whatever it takes to get to March Madness, the NBA Finals, the Stanley Cup, the World Cup, Wimbeldon, and the SuperBowl. ....and Kevin Garnett, but whatever -- that'll all come in due time!  I want to be on Bob Costas' and ESPN's speed dial!!! I'd even like to be a commentator for swimming during the Olympics! Next to track and field, it's the fastest sport EVERRRRR!    Reader's note:   If any of you out there know me, you know that that last comment was meant to be 100% intentionally serious.   ----------------------------------------------------  Hey, look me over Tell me do U like what U see? Hey, I ain't got no money But honey, I'm rich on personality Hey, check it all out Baby, I know what it's all about Before the night is through U will see my point of view Even if I have 2 scream and shout   Oh baby, I'm a --  STAR!

TA65F14,female,23,"(You all should really ask Hedish to do that for you ^_^)  Tuesday at 7 a.m. is the day of reckoning! That's the day I'll be taking my road test.

TA65F14,female,23,"What on earth is the deal with this weather? Is it me, or would it seriously be about the same temperature even if it hadn't have been raining? My skin's been glistening for two weeks now! Geez! I know, I know, somewhere somebody's really wanting some rain, but you know what I have to say to that person? Move to Houston, then you'dget all of the rain you ever hoped for -- plus some!   This typical Houston weather is killing me. How is anybody supposed to feel happy given these circumstances? Oh wait! I know who does, that lady from El Paso who hit that flaming jackpot. Do you know that the store that sold the winning ticket gets a cut of her money? The convenience store employees are splitting over one million dollars!  Hmmm, how about $20 is sounding pretty good right about now?  Don't act like that's just me. Ya'll are greedy too!   Today's Listen is  urlLink Move Ya Body  by Nina Sky.   This one beat alone has been used by three separate artists and ya know what?! I love them all! There's even a latin version. I don't know what the hell those cats are saying, but I  DO  know that I'll be John Brown if I just hold the wall and refuse to dance! Every time I hear either of the songs I just want to thunder clap or something-- Hedish, have no worries, I'll teach you that dance later.   OH man, let me tell ya! I was listening to the radio while I was 'working,' and I heard someone blasting the Ying-Yang Twins outdoors. Clearly, I thought it was just someone who left their car unattended, but NOPE! It was the Vato builders next door! They were jammin' to  Shake it Like a Salt Shaka!  Don't ask me why, but it just made me so happy! I started laughing! I wanted to go out there and be like,  NO SH*T, get it! , however I refrained. But, if they'd have busted out with some Kanye West, we could have really been friends for real! *wink*  Maybe this rain isn't so bad?  Soooo, I get off at six, right? Well, the old lady's picking me up. I'd be crazy to think that she'd actually be here straight up AT six o'clock. If she's here by 7p,  then  I'll congratulate her on timeliness. The lady just seems to have her own agenda about things. The other day she was going 55 in a 70 and then went 25 in a 40. Don't ask me why, but neighborhoods we go through all day, every day, she'll look at them like they're brand new making all sorts of 'new-to-her' commentary that I've had the pleasure of hearing since about '76... Mind you that I was born in '81 but whatever. She had me concerned for a minute because she couldn't quite decipher the difference between the Beltway and 45 and then it hit me.  Do I even know the difference between the Beltway and 45?  :/ I knew I got this crap from somewhere! Thankx mom for your swell, yet odd, qualities. Did I tell you how she doesn't pump her own gas? Yeah, my dad does it FOR her!   So what I'm trying to say is -- for all of my lovely friends out there, don't keep looking at me foul 'cuz I've never pumped gas or because it took me getting a license at 23 to finally do it! I get it from my MOTHER!  She get it from her mama -- WHAT? -- She get it from her mama ^_^  Is anyone else laughing, or are you shaking your heads in sadness  for  me, right about now? I crack me up!"

TA65F14,female,23,"Can't you tell how today's gonna be just wonderful?   I know every song on the radio! I've heard Prince, Alicia Keys, Mike Jack --the black one, and Marvin Gaye. I've even heard my most FAVORITIST song,  Lady  by The Whispers ^_^ Did I tell ya'll how my driving instructor looked like a Whisper? Heck, he looked like both Whispers 'cuz after all the group is made up of two brothers who are twins.  I think I'm  actually  helping my boss lady, Kacey, to sell new townhomes? Customers are learning my name and finding me to be quite helpful, what? Are the planets lined up in my favor today? Spectacular ^_^   I'm so excited about finally meeting Kacey on Thursday! And you know what? I think she's excited too! We're gonna walk through a few things that'll help me crank it up a notch to sell these townhomes.  Is it me, or do you guys read your blogs again for gramatical errors and misspellings? I do it all the time! I even do it to blogs from past months? I love editing. I can do it in my sleep!

TA65F14,female,23,"Me and my girls had a fabulous weekend! They are some of the zaniest people on the planet, but let me tell ya, I love the personality that's brought to our table o'fun!  Saturday, we went to a sari shop on Harwin and it felt awesome to watch a 5'9"" red head loose her mind like a kid in a candy store. She was overwhelmed by all of the colors, textures and detail on all the fabrics. I giv her props for magically settling on two saris to decorate her apartment. If they'd have had a 'buy one, get one free' sale, we probably never would have left the store.   After visiting another shop around the way, we had the free, ever-so-KIND,  special  services of one of Houston's own homeless window wiper professionales.   Sir, I thank you for your more than likely pee-stained, murky, bubbled, supposedly soapy water (and cigarette butt), and your determination to whipe NOT ONLY our windshield, but also our driver's side rearview mirror despite our REPEATED declines of your free services. Sir, you've got to be  some  type of fellow to keep on pursuing whatever it is that you do, in spite of what others may forcefully tell/curse you. Gosh, the pride you much have to keep on keepin' on...   Not long after our stop light fiasco, the tummies started talking and we got to listening. We settled on a little Greek eatery called Niko Niko's and let me tell ya, Hebert, I wish I'd have found my dollar sooner because then you could've gotten meat! Bummer.  We ended the night by refreshing Newman's memory with a little movie called,  urlLink ""Girl's Just Want to Have Fun.""  Would you please be so abliged by letting me proclaim--  urlLink Dancin' in heaven  I never thought, I'd ever get my feet this far (Orbital Be-Bop)! Slow, slow! Quick, quick, SLOW!  Has the acting in that movie always been that rough? The overachieving, struggling actor thing? Uhmazing! When I was a kid, no one could tell me anything about that movie. Oh, wait. Nope! You still can't. Sarah Jessica Parker, Helen Hunt and Shannon Doherty all in one movie? NO WAY! It's a mecca and you know it.  ***Hedish,  urlLink this is just for you !***   Ladies, we must do this evening o' fun again. Of course, scratch the homeless guy... Next time we're making that damned light!  I'll leave you all with Saturday night's  urlLink theme song ."

7W56KYO,male,16,"Church History By Ps. Tamil  				        	                July17,2004   All through the years the church was persecuted but they were growing in number, in strength, in holiness and spirituality. Until AD64, an emperor by the name of Nero came into power in the Roman Empire. This man masterminded the persecution against Christian. He sat the city of Rome on fire and then blame it on the innocent Christian. * Software giant Nero got it’s logo and name from this incident! Then on, official persecution against the church broke out. Christian then became the enemy of the nation and they were to suffer all kinds of persecution.   Until AD324, Constantine came into power. “Tradition or belief” supposed that he had an encounter with God. * But the bible didn’t state anything alike.  He was at the verge of losing a war when he saw a cross. *Because it’s tradition, when “things” passed down through the ages, common sense tells you to doubt it! So some dudes try to add some authenticity to it and say he saw two words which mean Christ. Miraculously Constantine’s army won the war. So after the war, he made Christianity legal and Christian started to return to the church.   Around AD392, Theodisius was in full control and he gave privileges to those out there, if and only if he or she is a Christian. Thus this brought in non-Christian as they too wanted to be privileged and not to be saved. Worst of all, they “naively” bring in all types of idols into the church……..   Ps Tamil also spoke about the papacy(pope), Lutheran, Ana Baptist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Anglican, Methodist, about the Pentecost and how the “tongue” came about through the century of recovering the truth and the primacy of the scripture restored!   Sorry! I cannot or should not continue further! Join us every Saturday, 8-9.30 pm at BM Baptist Church from 17 July to 21 Aug!

The match was an one sided affair and the final score, an embarrassing 5-0 lose for the prefects! Even our own church leader Sir Ravi Samuel got into the act, scoring a brace and with his commanding defensive role,the students voted him the Man Of The Match. However there's no prize for the winner nor the Man of the Match."

BM49QAF,male,25,"""The Magical World of Lou Jackson"" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       Welcome boys and girls, niggas and ladies, to the first trip to the Magical World of Lou Jackson. Now sit down Indian-style and take it all in. Now don't forget to look both ways before crossing the street Marc grab Man-Man's hand before I get you both.   You might be wondering what is so magical about the world of Lou Jackson, it looks just like South Carolina. Well my friends, have you ever met a man with a pet squirrel, or a lady made out of chocolate, a real-live archangel or a wino who didn't dance. Put the music on, welcome welcome to the Magical World of Lou Jackson.   There was a man named Peephole Brooks. Now they called him Peephole because he claims to have invented the peep-hole but, Tommy Tammy's brother Tommy with the electric walker told me they started calling him that because he would stand so close to the peep-hole when he rang your doorbell, they just started calling him Peephole. Now old Peephole was an interesting man to say the least. He enjoyed boxed-wine, pickled herring, and actually prefered to eat fish-bait more than the fish itself. It was through his early morning fishing in Charleston, SC eating half-cooked chicken-livers that he met what would become his life-long friend, Rudy.   You see Rudy was a squirrel. Rudy came up to Peephole and asked him for some of them chicken-livers, ""Say nigga what's up with a breakdown?"" Peephole was shocked, not that the squirrel was talking to him, hell he heard squirrels all the time when he would sit in the woods and do his ""potting"". He was shocked that Rudy asked him for some BBQ sauce for them livers. They sat and they talked fished a little bit, and talked some more. Before they knew it Thursday had come and gone. Rudy, quite the avid jitterbugger, learned that Peephole was quite the harmonica player. Rudy could also do summersaults, and other flips on demand, well he was a squirrel, but his movement had a nigga-like rhythm to it.   It was at this very moment that the two figured they could make a living thru their friendship. I mean how often is it that you see a man with a pet squirrel, not to mention ole Rudy talks. So summer rolled around and they figured why not try out for the circus. The Dingaling Brothers Varnum and Vincent Circus always came around.  They figured they would try-out for the circus, but the line was too long. There were all kinds of people in the line bearded old ladies, mustached young tramps, a lady made of chocolate named Coquinda but they called her Co-Co. There was even a white man named Ritz in the line with the butt of his pants cut out, telling racist jokes.   Needless to say the competition was stiff, so Rudy and Peephole thought of something different. They waited til the elephants were moving off stage during the show, and they ran onto the stage. Peephole on his harmonica, and Rudy doing his jitterbug, they even found a unicycle for Peephole and took turns on the harmonica. This nigga-squirrel combo took off like a rocket dipped in fishgrease. The Brothers Dingaling immediately signed them, and loved the way they ran out the crowd to perform.  ""It was sheer genious, like a combination of Albert Einstein and Sir Francis Dooling mashed into one potato"".   Well that concludes this week's edition of the Magical World of Lou Jackson.  Who knows what he will uncover next time.  It's like a jungle some time it makes me wonder how Junebug hustles undercover.        ""The Coca-Cola All-Stars"" By Salvador Gabor   The Rayful Edmonds'/Richard Porter ""Traveling Coke All Stars"", sponsored by Coca-Cola announced the captains for the starting line-up yesterday. Defensive coordinator Butch Reed, a Detroit native, announced that Linebacker Lawrence Taylor and Defensive End Dexter Manley would be Co-Captains for the defensive squad. ""I needed older, wiser, veteran-like players to lead this defensive team"".   On the offensive side, Alberto Martinez, the offensive coordinator decided that youth would be the way to go with choosing captains. Running Back Ricky Williams, who was traded from the ""Garcia Vega GREEN Wave"" was introduced as a Co-Captain on offense. But, in a SHOCKING move, newly acquired quarterback Quincy Carter was introduced as the second captain for the offensive squad.

BM49QAF,male,25,"Sal's Corner ""Friends""         ""How many of us have them?"" ""A friend you can depend on"". I got an email from a GOOD friend of mines the other day and it was a FWD email about being friends forever. Real simple, ideal forward that we pass around SO much that you see your own name on the history of the email. But anyway, along with the attachment was a message from that friend. It was heart-felt and sincere and I can respect that. I wont get into what was said in the message but it was a nice letter. But I began to think about my ""Friends"". No, dont think Sallimo is about to get sentimental. I just wanted to break down ""friends"" for yall. We all have all kinds of friends but when you look at it, we all have the same kinda friends. Lets talk about em, shall we?    *The ""Never in the house"" friend - This friend is hard to find. I mean HARD. You got the boyfriend/girlfriend's house number. You got the grandmother's number. You even got numbers for the OTHER people he/she be wit (Sidebar: Cause every friend has another clique). All this and if the game starts at 7:30, you cant find him till 7:18.   * The ""Never go nowhere"" Friend. Talk a GREAT game but when the gravy hits the rice, they are in the house. You call em and tell em about something going on and they will get YOU hype. So hype that you're ready to go! I mean you called them to convince them and they RE-CONVINCED you. Brought up all kinds of good reasons why ""WE"" should go. Call em back when you on your way ""naw I aint foolin wit it"". Now I aint gonna lie........This is ME all the way. Im the ""get hype"" man. I will get you hype! But call me and say you 'bout to get ready and see what happens. I told one of my friends ""Lets go to NY, like RIGHT NOW"". He got hyped! I mean HYPED. He called ""wifey and let her know he was gone. Called moms and dad ""If you dont hear from me...Im in NY"". He called like 15 people in 15 minutes before I could call him back just to say ""You know what.....I aint even going""   Sidebar: When somebody say ""You know what?...."" with that pause, its NOT Good.   * The ""Lets Go somewhere"" friend: This is that friend that makes WAY more money than you, has more lee-way on his/her job or just dont care about how much money yall spend on when yall come in the house. They'll will have you like ""Man dont you know I gotta work tomorrow???"". They'll have you out at 3:00 A.M. over their house watching ""Menace II Society"". The whole time, you KNOW you gotta usher at church tomorrow. You'll be passing them bulletins out wit your eyes RED as koolaid.   * The ""We gotta get up"" friend. Now this is your real good friend. I mean a GOOD friend. Yall kick it and chill but its NEVER anywhere BUT the phone. You just cant find the time to get up with them but you enjoy your phone time with them. I got PLENTY of friends I aint SEEN in God knows when but we talk like EVERYDAY.   *  The ""Old Times"" friend: This nigga still think yall in High School. Still doing that same ole dumb stuff. Man I am NOT riding wit you in that UUV. For those who dont have criminal-minded friends like I do, UUV stands for Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle. After picking him up from the precinct enough times you'll get to know the police lingo.   * The ""Like we never left"" friend: He/She is like the ""Old Times"" friend except not as wild. He/She is funny and yall aint seen each other in 3 years but the sight of 'em by itself makes you laugh. Yall can get back together and its all of a sudden 1995 again.    * The ""same old joke"" friend: Maybe its just me but, have you ever had a friend that you shared ONE joke with and yall friendship lasts like 15 years off that ONE joke? I see people now and I cant figure out how 1 joke made us friends. Yall mighta seen someone fall and laughed together. You aint even KNOW his/her name but after that yall just kept speaking.   "" The ""what is his name?"" friend: See im a real particular about not hurting peoples feelings. Im great with faces yall.......I really am but, some of yall be speaking to me and I dont know your names. I mean we REALLY cool. You ask me ""how such and such doing?"", ""Did you ever finish this and that?"" and I think to myself like ""He know alot about me, but what is HIS name?"" It's people out here that I rap to EVERYDAY and I never stop to say ""Homie, what IS your name?"" I dont know about yall but I KNOW when someone doesnt know my name. I have a unique name so its hit or miss. If your name is Dionte but, I'm not sure if it is....... I might could say Dion or Leon REAL low and fast and make Dionte think that I actually said Dionte. But Low and behold..... The truth comes out. Let another person walk in the room. ""Hey James this is uhhh................well yall go on and introduce yall selves.""    "" The ""Broke"" friend: We all have one of those. Either one steady friend like this or people in your crew take turns being this one. I mean...... DAG, you coulda told me you aint have no money before we got up to the FRONT of the line. Were you hoarse in the car on the way up here? You can be broke, just let me know off the top. But see the broke dude is scared to say he's broke cause he will be put in that ""dont answer his calls"" category. Or the ""I cant just take $15 cause Jimmy is going wit us"" category. Whats worse is the ""We will need separate checks Ma'am"" category cause ""broke dude"" is always tryna sneak out of Ruby Tuesday's.    So there we have it. I know your friends fit in somewhere amongst these types. The most important thing is that we all express our love for our friends, despite their faults. One day you're here and tomorrow, you maybe gone. ""Lord Willin, Rome Feelin""       ""The Underworld that is Metro"" Part 2  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      Public transportation is an interesting place. It is a realm all its own, with a combination of many different types of people forcibly meshed onto a car, bus or ferry.  A tricky place to say the least but, remember that there are rules in the belly of this beast.   More often than not ,folks are tired when entering the ""Underworld"". Whether it is early in the morning or in the afternoon, sometimes you just aren't quite ready for the ride.  Please stay awake for goodness sake, stand up if you have you must.   Women do not sleep on the train, it isn't cute. It aint like when your momma checks in on you as a youth, and they say ""look at that sleeping angel"". Matter of fact it, is far from it. You look uncomfortable, laid back neck looks bound to have a crick in it by the time you get to Van Ness. Your mouth is open, nothing is peaceful about this, your beauty can't save you from it. You could just miss your stop, as you get some mild hibernation looking like the grizzly bear that you hide from society.   Rollers:  There are people, some with justifiable reasons, and others just to lazy to carry their own bags.  Either way these roll-away bags are the worst.  Pick them up and carry them. I am tired of dodging these bags, like a Vietnam vet having flashbacks of landmines dancing in a pit of squirrels. You lazy, trying to look important people pick those bags up.   Post Office workers ride the train, and despite the stories of them being pyscho and all out ignorant people, they are relatively harmless on the train. They appear as regular working people. If you catch them out of their uniforms you might not know they are postal workers. However, all it takes is one Postal worker to spot another and it all comes out. The one not in uniform gets baited into talk of how much back-stabbing goes on at the Post Office. Questions like ""You know ole Bates retired?"", ""Man, you know Tommy Gibbs got fired, Again?"", ""How much more time you got til you retire?"", ""Where do you see the future of the Post Office?"". The future of the Post Office??? Man what do they think they will be doing? Hand carrying emails or get to wear all black when delivering Blackberry messages!?!?!?! Get next to two postal workers on the train, one might even be retired, that makes it even better.  Note: Postal workers tend to speak in civilized profanity, very much different than employees at the Library of Congress."
BM49QAF,male,25,"Sal's Corner ""Africans""    First off, I am not a racist, prejudiced or any of those things. Im just the dude who tells it how YOU see it. But you either cant put it into words or you're scared to do so. But let me say that Africans are one of the funniest groups of people in the world. I love Africans. I love their style, flash and confidence. They are true black people. Not tainted with several races but true original blacks from Africa. I watch and observe them. Here are some of the things I have seen:   * Misconception: ""Africans are smarter than everyone else"". One word, Two syllables: HOGWASH! Let me tell you something. And this goes for any other foreign people who come to this land..........if you come across the world to be here, when you get here, you are not gonna be BS'n. All Africans arent smarter than us, they just left the dumb ones IN Africa. If I was African, and I had 2 sons, one was dumb and the other was smart, the SMART one could go to college in America but the dumb one would be at Timbuktu Community College! If you went to China, you wouldnt go over there to make $30,000/year. You can do that HERE!  * Attire: Africans are hit or miss people. Either they were NICE clothing. Such as Prada, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Ferragamo etc etc or they were Yellow Jeans and sandles. Aint too many ""White-Tee"" type people. If they are gonna get fly, THEY GET FLY, if not its ""CROSS COLOURS"" galore  * Hygiene: All Africans dont stink. NOPE, its just that the ones that do stink, they smell so bad that you think they all stink.   * Vehicle: Come on NOW! a 1986 560 SEL...........THATS ALL they are pushing. Yall know what im talking about...........do I gotta show yall!!!!     * Foul Language: Its is FUNNY to hear an African curse! Curse word of Choose: MUTHAF*&^%. They use that one very much so! Sometimes they say Nigga (Which is not a curse word) but its just funny when they say it. It comes out like (NEEGA!)  * UnderCover Africans: Yaaah yall thought I aint know. Some of yall are African and dont lead on to it. No accent or nothing. Name might even be regular. But when your parents come up to the school with that short sleeve party shirt, green slacks and them extra shiny gold watches we KNOW. Only Africans and Pimps on their days off dress like that.   * Jewelry. Look for the GOLD. Niggas wear platinum, Africans wear gold! Always remember that.  * Confidence: Africans display a serious amount of confidence. Go to the DMV. You and your buddy are scared you wont get your license renewed cause you might have tickets owed. But that fella over there in the Kente cloth, HE's determined to be in and out in 15 minutes. He dont even stand in LINE! ""Who am I to stand in a line!""  * Names: Africans and their names can be wild. Sometimes the name denotes their African Heritage and sometimes it dont. You might run into a BABATUNDE MCGLOVER and be thrown off. Cause his parents coulda been high and off some black power tip and named him Babatunde OR he could be African and someway or another his family ended up as the McGlover's.  * Men: The thing that stands out the most about Africans is how they raise their young men. You dont see African women raising kids by themselves, you see that father in the family life. When you see an African family together, you can sense the strength of the father figure when they walk in the room. I've seen many documentaries about the rites of passage for several tribes and sects on the continent of Africa and their young men are prepared for life at an early age.    All in all, I love my African people. I love their attire, their music and how they may not know much English..........but if someone says ""50 Cent"" or ""2PAC"" THEY GO WILD! Next Week People.......""Lord Willin, Rome Feelin""     Verbal Prohibitions by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  There are many words throughout the English language that have stronger meanigs to some people, and may frequent conversation more than others.  However some people should be prohibited from saying certain words.  Today I am looking at the Big folks.  Some people may say, hey big people catch a lot of flack, but there are certain things they should not say.  I myself try to stay away from awkward situations for myself and the other situatee.  Follow me, you shouldnt need your flashlight, but I will leave some bread crumbs.   Catapult:  Big people should never use this word.  Just say the nigga flew over the wall.  Aint nobody catapulting no 234 pound woman, not Robin Hood, not NASA, not King Kong.   Hammock:  Big people please no talk of buying hammocks, laying in hammocks, or even thinking about hammocks.  If you have been in a hammock keep it to yourself, there is no point in buying that much rope to take a nap outdoors.  If any of you plus-sizes people got a hammock, put a box-spring under him, because I know you laying low.   Snack: This is one of those words that sounds funny coming out a big girl's mouth. ""think I'll have me a snack""  I think you better get some water, because you just had lunch Keeda.  Sat down and chill out, you still smell like them turkey wings from 20mins ago.   ""No more...that's too much"":  This is a phrase heard in places like Baskin Robbins, or your local carry-out.  More often than not, you aint hungry big folks, you just in there because of a hard burp.  You tasted that Manwich in the burp and now you think you hungry.  Just because they have sprinkles at Baskin Robbins doesnt mean you need them, probablly just came out of Giant with a bag of Milanos (Pepperidge Farms cookies) and gonna crush them on that big sundae.   ""With his big self"":  unless you follow this with ""I know I am big but"" please refrain from saying it.   ""Think I'lll have.."":  this is usually followed by something gargantaur, like a triple-cheese burger, or something fit for a grown man. Dont no man want a woman who eats as much as him (in one sitting)   ""Uhm that looks good"": I dont even want to get into this.  Needless to say it is said to often.  Keeda dont touch my food.   ""...cakes"":  Big people should not say cakes, treats or snacks   ""Can I have a bite"":  No not that walrus sized bite you bout to take.  dont do it, please dont do it, if I catch you I'm gonna tell it.   ""Just a taste"": Big people you aint tasting nothing, quit it.   Adjectives:  Big people keep those adjectives simple, when you start saying delectible and scrumptious, I have a problem with that.  You just greedy, it dont taste that good.   I wouldnt want you to think I am picking on the chunky  There is just no need to act a monkey  Over food, females just no need to act funky.  Remember that when at Golden Corral,  Or at Duff's before eating the whole cow.  Watch your carbs, and your fat intake,  Because nobody wants to be wedged on the train next to a human buttercake."

BM49QAF,male,25,"Sal's Corner ""Names Vol. 3""    As some of our longtime readers know, I wrote 2 articles on Rome's site about Names. One being for male names and the other for female names. Now I am taking it deeper. Let's talk about Last Names! Not just any last names but last names that can be used to call someone. Last names that make you call that person by there last name.  * Fletcher- Oh yes, Fletcher's NO MATTER WHAT CITY, live in the hood. They could very well be well off financially but aint nothing like being hood rich in the inner city of Detroit! Ole Fletcher has a regular job. He probably shakes off his co-workers and makes them mad cause he does his work on HIS time and pace  * Robinson- Robinson stands out at his job. He either does a great job or a very BAD job. People only call him at loud tones. You always use your ""Outside Voice"" when dealing with Robinson (Check for Reggie real soon with an article on the ""Outside Voice"")  * Briscoe - I know or know of about 3 or 4 Briscoe's. Most Briscoe's are called by FIRST AND LAST NAME. You have to. It just sounds good.  * Cunningham- This may be one of the strongest last names to have. Especially as a black person. Even a lady will be called by her last name if it is Cunningham. Thats why you cant have too many Cunningham's in one setting. It leads to alot of confusion.  * Porter - Porter does work for you. Whether it is mechanical, plumbing or some sort of handy work. Most men who work in uniforms dont ever have the correct name on their badge. Porters ALWAYS do.   * Patterson - Patterson might be a deacon at your church. If it's a woman, she probably is a nice looking older woman. The Patterson's only drive Cadillacs  * Wiggins - Wiggins may be a ""Coon"". Wiggins sometimes is the kinda guy that kisses up to any and everybody. Women who are born in the Wiggins' family hope to marry as soon as possible.   * Taylor - Taylor works in a uniform type of job like ""Porter"" but he keeps himself clean. Taylor is that busdriver or police officer that does no work. He might just rap to the ladies all day.  * McDaniel - Most people call this person ""McDaniels"". I still havent figured out why the ""S"" is added on??????  * Carter- Carter is full of it. Most people see Carter coming and say ""That OLE Carter"". Carter makes you mad! He really does. He always uses up ALL his leave on the job or takes the longest time to get back to the house wit your McDonalds. He the type that will go to McDonalds, get your food, then go to the carryout but aint ordered his food yet.    ""Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"".     ""Action Words vs. Adventure Words"" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   Action Words and Adventure Words, well it's kind of like when you learned verbs for the first time, but way worse.  Running, writing, riding, and words like that take on a whole nother meaning.  Put your pens down, this is an open-mind exercise.    Action Words :  Action Words require a certain action, either self-induced or one imposed upon another.   Cuss:  ""Dont you cuss me""  oh yes this means somebody has told off an older person.  This is usually used in front of company.  It has no gender.  In it's female form, the woman usually proceeds to tell the man off, in front of her and/or his friends.  In the male form, the man might go take a walk, and come back and give ole Eleanor a good-shake.   Hyche: pronounced ""hush"", ""Hyche your mouth"".  Another word with age, used to cease noise immegiately.   Run:  ""Run me my numbers""  This form of the word run requires that you get down to the liquor store and play them numbers before 12, nobody wants to miss the daily Pick 3.     Adventure Words : Now Adventure Words dont necessarily have to be verbs, they are just words that take you somewhere else, on an adventure.   Heeem: pronounced him, ""Can I tell heem, You better tell heeem"" That heeem takes you a variety of places, maybe to Carolina or Georgia, it might just put you on your back porch, and Ms. Rawlins grandboy Tim aint in the house.  ""Tim aint here, can I tell heeeem, you lookin for heeem""   Tisn't:  most serious form of ""isn't, is not"":  A serious word to say the least, and is always said slowly, in order to specifically understand that Gary aint there, and he might not be there, when he gets there, and if he comes in there his aunt is gonna let heeeem know something.  ""Gary tisn't in"".  When a statement like that is made, you won't be leaving a message, so don't try because Aunt Doris will be hanging up on you in mid-sentence.   Tousch him:  pronounced touch heeem:  This one might take you to church.  Sitting with the Young Adult Choir, or the Jr. Usher Board, and Marcus done fell asleep next to you.  ""Tousch him, wake that boy up"".  You could also wind up on the bus, ""...is this your piece of paper"".   Tonic:  A wild word to say the least.  This might have you down the country in your Aunt's bedroom.. ""Don't knock that epsom-tonic over, matter of fact hand it to me""  It might have you outside walking past the porch where the old men hang out..""That boy had the tonic, yes he did"".  Last but not least tonic might have you in a basement with your father, playing cards, Tonic goes unsaid, but you see it several times poured into that drankin glass, you know that plastic bottle with the yellow label.   Oh it aint over, just didn't want to overwhelm you.  You cant learn your timestables in a day, so let it digest.  This stove is always hot.  I'm just a nigga in a seatbelt."
BM49QAF,male,25,"""Do You Want This D"" Pt. 1  by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       Oftentimes in today's self-centered society people confuse the simplified, misuse the wet-side, and drag dirt in your new ride.  People like to tell you what they want and how they want it.  Be careful what you say, especially if a nigga asks you, ""Do you want this D?""   The Underworld known as Mass Transit requires many tactical moves, and formations. So many are concerned with attacking for their own good.  They are so offensive at heart, jump-pushing, run-shoving, and leading with fatty tissues.  Stop being so offensive before you get this D.  I dont act like that on the train so why should you? Do you want this D, you want to see apart of me, that belongs in a tree, nobody wants to act out the early morning monkey.   The young and supposedly sophisticated often think of themselves highly, as anyone should.  However, many of these supposedly sophisticated don't know how to read the D.  They fail to realize a point made doesnt equal a good grade.  Dont tell a lion how to safari, unless you are a bit of a jaguar yourself.  Don't take offense when there is none to be taken.  Do you want this D, I mean some real D, not that nice cover-up you get at the shop de beauty.  Special Teams gets on the field at some point.  Special Teams is the art of understanding special situations a.k.a. ""where I'm coming from"".  If a person understands your point, don't try to force it, especially if they understand.  Don't force it in, you might be the one who gets chafe.    There are many dazed and confused,  misunderstood with egos bruised  thinking they got it all figured out but accuse you of a short-fuse  explanations of things repeated  don't confuse my mind for my language slightly streeted.  early morning perusing on a topic you never thought of using  snake-bitten by the words my fangers take your mind cruising.  Never misconstrue the office for my zoo,  a queen for a bunk.  got so much offense you think my battleship sunk.  nigga check my shelf and notice my titles,  Run and Shoot, West Coast, a good offense is vital.  but read a lil closer you might see a Matchup Zone, a 4-6, or even a 2-3.  Do you want this D?  If you're offensive then this D you might not like,  cool your jets or get wet next to a dam dyke     If I have offended any with the above passage, then perhaps it is YOU who have the D, and you might be getting too much D.  For those of you who may have found any specific words offensive, pick up a Dictionary.  DUAL meanings separate the misconstrued from the genious     ""Fashion Cents"" with Ms. Monique    When Its Time To Draw The Line   Hello fashion people and non-fashion people. I'm here to enlighten you all on the latest fashion tips and the fashion ""No-No's"". OK.......I'm pretty sure you know that the color of this year has is Pink! Now......of course Pink isn't the ONLY color that you have to choose from. So ladies......please lay off of the Pink. Bright neon colors and pastel colors can be used as other color options as well.    Fashion ""No-No's""   This has to be my biggest pet peeve..........Ladies PLEASE stop wearing these stretch jeans with the combat boots over top of them like this style is still hip! Yes this WAS the style back in 1999 and 2000 but, not anymore. This year it is all about femininity. Colorful prints and lots of shear ruffle materials. Try wearing a knee length (YES I said knee length) skirt with colorful prints and a ""off the shoulder"" solid color shirt along with some stiletto heels/sandals that give definition to your legs.  Last but not least, bring out your confidence and fierce attitude that will have everyone drawn to your energy   ** Remember.......you only look good when you feel good. Next week we will discuss what you should and shouldn't wear with undergarments.     ""Personals"" by Salvador Gabor       Willie Atkins III A.K.A.

BM49QAF,male,25,"Sal's Corner   ""The Back Room""    Oh yes. Walk with me a bit. Don't be afraid. Some of yall think yall are too sophisticated. But regardless, we need to take a walk into ""The Back Room"". No..........it's NOT the Den! That's to ""sophisticated"". If you call it the Den, you aint feelin' me right now. I mean ""The Back Room"". ""The Back Room"" holds alot of hidden treasures and I want to unveil those treasure to you all. So, let's take a walk.............   *  Lighting  - In ""The Back Room"", the lighting is almost always a lil darker than the rest of the house. That dark signifies a cooler atmosphere. You don't even have to cut on the AC in the back room. That darkness in the daytime just makes it so comfortable back there. IF (And I say IF) the AC IS on........it runs smoothly. You can almost NOT hear the AC at all. It's so quiet and relaxing   *  Eating/Drinking  - This activity is LIMITED in the backroom. Eating is only permitted to old Uncles on regular days. And usually he doesn't do it if there are guests in the house. IF (And I say IF) there is drinking it is mostly Iced Tea. Maybe a lil beer here and there but Iced Tea is the drink of choice for ""Back Roomers"". ""Back Roomers"" are simply people who frequent the back room.   *  Funerals  - ""The Back Room"" is a staple in the African-American tradition of remembering the dead. After a funeral, only the VIP's sit in ""The Back Room"". Now if you aint a VIP, you might sneak back there for a while but surely, you WONT get a seat! Vintage ""Back Roomers"" only get seats. Now after a funeral, VERY important stuff like ""who is gonna get the clothes?"", ""how are the children gonna split the funeral bill?"" and ""why was JB left off the will?"" are discussed in ""The Back Room"".   *  Pictorials  - ""The Back Room"" is filled with Photo Albums and pictures on the wall. ""The Back Room"" is a Hall of Fame of sorts for each family. Graduation Pics are usually on the wall. They are placed towards the top. Pics that were taken at Sears are more towards the bottom. Wedding Pics are on the coffee table. Different types of pics are strategically placed and spaced by ""The Back Room's"" caretaker.   *  Reading Material  - You can find an array of Ebony and Jet magazines from the 1980's somewhere in The Back Room"". Those mags go back so far, Vanessa Williams is on the cover receiving her crown for the Miss America Pageant. You won't find any new books or magazines though.   *  Television  - See.........one thing about the back room is, technology is limited. There's no need for a DVD, Grandma JUST bought a VCR a year ago. Well actually Aunt Bessie got it for her cause she wasnt gonna go out and buy one herself. But the TV in ""The Back Room"" aint cut on that much. When it's on, it's stuck on the news. That's all that's watched back there. You MAY be lucky to get some cable on a TV in the back room. If Grandma got cable, she got it turned to CNN. And thats IT!   *  Furniture  - Don't expect fancy furniture. It's nice but, not fancy. Of course we've all had a crash course on the plastic on the furniture. That summer afternoon nap that is interrupted by your face being stuck to the plastic. WE all know about that already. But, the furniture back there is mix-matched. Or as your auntee would say ""Mitch-Matched"". There are alot of rugs and blankets and towels on the chairs in the backroom. See this was input during the 80's when the Jheri Curl was poppin. ""Put them towels on the headrest of the couch Lil Winky.......Sheila coming over here and that girl neck is SO wet!........aint messing up my couch"".   *  Odd Items  - ""The Back Room"" is where you might find the portable ""feet soaker"" or an exercise machine or frisbees that are now used as coasters. Anything can be used to decorate the back room.   All in all, the back room is a traditioned-filled area where love, memories and talks about Willamena's gay son Bootney are discussed. You gotta love.........""THE BACK ROOM"". ""Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"""
BM49QAF,male,25,"""This Moment in Nigga History"" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today our nigga sports spotlight takes us to an urban hotbed for boxing, Mayfair.  The welterweight champeen Lavette Blackman, also known as ""LB"" because he was the best lb for lb boxer on that side of the city.   Lavette gained neighborhood fame as a 10yr old slap-box phenom in the alleys surrounding Nannie Hellen Burroughs.  He once knocked out a 35 yr old Metro Kiosk attendant at Minnesota Ave, as a 6th grader.  he took the jacket of then 35 yr old Kiosk Attendant Samuel Williams, and passes thru the gates without farecards.  LB also attained neighborhood fame in the boys locker room of Fletcher-Johnson defeating opponents nearly twice his size.  He was the Jr. ""Go-to-the-Body Champ"" by the age of 14.   Lavette attained neighborhood greatness on the corner of Minnesota and Benning in front of the mural.  Challenged by an off-duty fed as he was going to the carry-out across the street, Lavette gave Occifer Blache a right hook to the body that really caused for some cleanup of the streets.  This punch gave LB a more potent name ""Loose Bowels""  Lavette ""Loose Bowels"" Blackman hit Occifer Blache so hard, he browned his drawls and himself right there in front of the mural.  5 o'clock in the ebenin where you gonna be, hopefully not laying in the doo-droppings?  This saturday remember to cheer on LB behind the Armory as he takes on Mario Manning from 21st.

BM49QAF,male,25,"""Pioneers in the DC Rap Game"" By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire    Born in the Bronx in 1975, hip hop music would grow to become the most influential culture of our generation. The lyrics, the beats, the dances, the clothes, the parties, the slang, the lifestyle. There was nothing like it. The music would travel beyond the 5 boroughs of New york and reach millions of people across the globe.  None were more affected than the young Black youth of the ghetto. In Washington DC, go-go music had been around for a while too, but three young boys decided to stray away from their hometown music and formed a rap group.   Sammy P. Carter and two of his friends named themselves, ""DSL"". They made songs whle ""playing"" in Sammy's basement watching Friday Night Videos and Care Bears re-runs on his mother's floor model TV.  They made schoolyard classics such as: ""Booty Shorts & Now Laters"", ""Monkey Bars & Carpet Burn"", ""Calico Vision & Dad's Porno Tapes"", ""Ashy Knees & Sore Jaws"" & the Mothers Day anthem ""Ruby Lynn, Beatrice, & Willemina: We're not Gay, We're Just Close Like That"". These guys were the predecessors to Another Bad Creation and The Boys. But they had a unique fan base, they didn't have pubescent girls for fans, the Catholic Archdiocese made these 3 young boys from DC the stars that they were.   Sammy's stage name was ""Shorty Short Shorts"" and his partners Daniel and Larry went by the names, ""Danny the Whistle"" & ""Large Legged Larry""(Prince Markie Dee & Chunky A. from Arsenio were his idols.) They were in heavy rotation in the Cathedral and The Blue Oyster. Here is the cover from their first album, ""Mustangs, Shades and Shorts"".  That's Sammy shrugging his shoulders. (I don't have to say which one is ""Large Legged Larry"".)        ""Juneteenth Bus Cruise"" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       This is to inform you of the upcoming ""Juneteenth Bus Cruise"" to Memphis, Tennessee.  The cruise begins June 19th, the bus, number 750 named ""Collards"" will depart from Forrestville Mall at 6:45 sharp.  This contoured bus trip is due in rememberance of the Voyage of Odolpho, which occured June 20th, 1844. Odolpho, whose last name is thought to be Samuels, was a cropsharer in Memphis, TN. Well Odolpho was one of the first generators of Black Power. You see Odolpho felt he was a cropsharer, not a sharecropper. He felt he gave ole Mr. Sampson whatever he felt like giving him as opposed to whatever he wanted. Mr. Sampson was actually ""Master Sampson"", but Odolpho did not see fit to call another man ""Master"" seeing how he wasn't no dog, and since none of the dogs called him ""Master"" well shucks he wasn't about to either.  Odolpho created many empowerment opportunites for Blacks in Memphis. He organized a Blacksmith's union, specialized in Black BBQ, and upheld anything Black. Odolpho was determined to uplift his Black people and walked from Memphis to Tuskegee, AL dressed in all Black, stopping and talking to Blacks along the way. His voyage ended on June 20th in the year 1844, when Odolpho passed out from heatstroke and left this earth.  This Bus Cruise commemerates the 160th anniversary of the Voyage of Odolpho. The trip will stop thru Norfolk, for no particular reason other than Ms. Tredeau has some goodies to pickup from her cousin, continue down thru North Carolina where we will stop in Rocky Mount for dinner at ""Curtis'"", continue throughout the night where Willie Freeman has offered to split time with our bus driver until we get to Memphis. There will be a special dedication to Odolpho at Al Green's church that Sunday. Oh what a time we will have for Odolpho. So come on and get ready, please call Ethel Womack, she will handle this Bus Cruise just like the last one we had down Durham. For those of you who may have forgotten her number, 301-455-3534. That is her cell, she has been having some problems with her house phone, so leave a message."

FTJZGYM,male,15,"This Story is from MSNBC.msn.com    The Ultimate Computer   Earlier this week I wrote about the ongoing addition of feature after feature to cell phones-most recently, satellite TV. I suggested we're at the start of a dramatic period of rapid technical evolution, wherein our information and communications devices are going to morph into all kinds of new combinations. One reader commented:   Name: Joe Hometown: Fort Worth When you continue to add all these features to different sorts of devices, I can see everyone in the not-so-distant future carrying their ""life"" with them in the form of some electronic piece of equipment. Just another thing people will be slaves to.  Exactly right, Joe -- although, I think it's up to us as to whether we're the slaves of these devices, or vice versa.  However, besides cramming next-generation computing and communication into a single personal device, there's another element we need: massive information storage, so we can archive everything we do in life, from e-mail to photos to videos, and have it all available at our fingertips. And that's exactly the direction that Google's one-gigabyte, highly-searchable GMail could take us.  About ten years ago I asked Steve Jobs for his vision of the ultimate computer -- the machine that might be possible midway through the 21st century. He said it would be a flat, tablet-like device that you might get as a child; you'd unwrap it, and, via speech and voice recognition, it would ask your name, where it was and then begin learning everything about you.  You'd carry it everywhere: do your homework on it, store all your books and correspondence, and it would subtly integrate itself into your life. It would ask, for example, where you were going and you'd say, ""To my tennis lesson,"" and it would respond ""Would you like me to remind you about your tennis lesson at this time every week?"" And then finally, Jobs said, you'd be 17 or 18 years old, sitting on your bed talking to your computer, and you'd mention that you'd just broken up with your girlfriend. And the computer would say, ""Steve, it's the third time it's happened that way. You want to talk about it?""  Perhaps that will always be science fiction. But this decade we're seeing the elements of that vision start to come together. Our computers still need to get much smarter, of course, but the ingredients of constant connectivity, massive memory and friendly interface design are on finally on the way, and it's going to be an interesting ride for the next few decades."

FTJZGYM,male,15,"This is what I was reading:    ProjectExport to HTML Help allows you to export your help project to Microsoft’s new HTML Help format. The export will: • Convert all topics from RTF to HTML, saving each topic in a separate HTML file. • Convert all BMP and SHG files used in your project to PNGs or GIFs as you wish. For SHGs, an image map will be inserted into the HTML file of the topics using it. Note that GIF files can have no more than 256 colors, so true color images may lose some color information. But since most images in help files are screen shots, GIF is the appropriate file format to use. PNG is definitely the better choice than GIF, unless you want the HTML output to be compatible with ancient browser versions. • Convert the data from the Contents Editor into an .hhc HTML file. • Compile all your keyword footnotes into an .hhk HTML file. • Create an .hhp HTML Help project file Things to note: • Since HTML Help does not support popup links, all popup links will be converted to regular links • WinHelp macro’s and the like will not be converted, since there are usually no equivalents in HTML Help. You can open the exported .hpp project into Microsoft’s HTML Help workshop and compile all those files into a single .chm file, which you can distribute along with your application. You can download the HTML Help workshop from http://www.helpscribble.com/helpcompiler.html. Note that the user of your help file will need MS Internet Explorer 4 or later and the HTML Help support files. These come with the HTML Help workshop package and are also included in Windows 98 and 2000. Export to Web Help ProjectExport to Web Help will export your help project to a series of HTML files that you can upload to your web site to provide online documentation. There are several options to choose from. You have three choices for the layout of the HTML pages: •Simple pages: create one HTML file for each topic, with no navigational aids besides the links already present in the topic text. •Simple pages with navigation header: create one HTML file for each topic with a navigation header added at the top. This header has a link to an HTML file showing the table of contents and a link to an HTML file with the index. If you have used the browse sequence editor, Next and Previous links will be added as well, implementing the browse sequence. •Contents in frame: Create a frameset page showing the contents or index in the left frame (both with a link to each other), and the topic text in the right frame. The topic text will have the navigational header as in option 2. You can choose whether images should be converted to GIF and PNG format. PNG is the best choice since it does not have GIF’s 256 color limitation and, more importantly, is free of any kind of patent issues. Choose GIF if compatibility with ancient (Netscape 3, MSIE 3) browser versions is important to you. Since you cannot be sure if the person reading your documentation on your web site has all the fonts installed that you have, you may want to use the Font Substitution grid to automatically substitute fonts. In the left column of the grid you need to put the name of the font you want to substitute. In the right column, place the alternative font names, separated by commas. The web browser will first try the fonts from left to right, until it finds one that is installed on the reader’s computer. It is a good idea   I fell asleep reading this good for nothing manual and when I woke up started reading from another page. The boring text is given below.   The merge function allows you to merge two HelpScribble projects. That is, you can add the topics of another HelpScribble project to the current project. When you pick ProjectMerge from the menu, HelpScribble will ask you which project you wish to merge with the current one. Then, a dialog box will show up. First you must select which topics from the project you are about to merge with the current one, must be added to the current project. You can select to merge all the topics, only the topics within a certain Topic ID range, topics which are part of a certain browse sequence, or topics which have the status property set to a certain value. With the last two options, the marked browse sequences or topics with a marked status property will be added. Topics with no browse sequence or status setting will not be added. In a Windows help file, each topic must have a unique Topic ID. So, you will have to tell HelpScribble what to do if one or more of the topics you selected to be merged with the current project, have a Topic ID that is already taken in the current project. You can decide to have the topic in the current project replaced with the topic with the same Topic ID from the project to merge. The second option is to skip the topic with the taken ID and thus leave the topic in the current project as it is. When you select the third option, the topic from the project to merge will receive a new, unique topic ID (the first one available following the one it had). Links to that topic will be automatically updated. The merge function can be very handy in several cases. One situation could be that you need to have your help file translated into different languages. When you update your help file, it would be handy that only the updated topics would have to be translated again. You can do so by storing version numbers in the Status property of each topic. When you have updated your help file, open the translation of the old version, select ProjectMerge and select to add only the topics with a version 2 status value. The status field will also help the translator to quickly locate the topics that have been changed.    If you right-click on a topic in the grid, a context menu will show up. The context menu always shows these commands, which apply to the entire topic. If you right-click on certain footnotes, you will get additional commands (see below). • Edit topic • Insert topic • Delete topic • Footnotes • Cut • Copy • Paste • Create link • Create popup link • Bookmark Right-clicking on a title or keyword footnote will offer you the commands above. However, if you right-click on a status or build tag footnote, you will see that some items have been added to the top of the context menu. Selecting one of those will change the value of the footnote to the selected context menu item. This is a handy way of setting these footnotes for a large number of topics. Right clicking on a browse sequence footnote will add a command that starts the Browse Sequence Editor. Title: Click the Title button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of title footnotes in the Topic Grid. Keywords: Click the Keywords button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of keyword footnotes in the Topic Grid. Browse sequence: Click the Browse Sequence button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of browse sequence footnotes in the Topic Grid. Build tag: Click the Build Tag button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of build tag footnotes in the Topic Grid. Status: Click the Status button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of status fields in the Topic Grid. A-Keywords: Click the A-Keywords button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of A-Keyword footnotes in the Topic Grid. Edit topic: Edit the topic you selected in the Topic Grid. Insert topic: Insert a topic in the help project, after the topic you selected in the Topic Grid. Delete topic: Delete the topic you selected in the Topic Grid. If you mistakenly issue this command, pick TopicUndo from the menu. Footnotes: Edit all the footnotes in the topic you selected in the Topic Grid with the Footnote Editor. Cut: Deletes the topic you selected in the Topic Grid and puts it on the clipboard. This action affects the whole topic. If you only want to cut a part of the topic text, double-click on the topic in the Topic Grid to activate it, select the text you wish to cut, and press Shift+Del on the keyboard or use the Cut command from the Text menu. Copy: Puts a copy of the topic you selected in the Topic Grid on the clipboard. This action affects the whole topic. If you only want to copy a part of the topic text, double-click on the topic in the Topic Grid to activate it, select the text you wish to copy, and press Ctrl+Ins on the keyboard or use the Copy command from the Text menu.  I am so bored. I just don't know why I've been forced to read this. Will post after I finish this manual. That's all for now"

9Y7GJUW,female,23,"In Farsi we don’t have vowels. We have some symbols to indicate the sound of them but it is not usually written in a text. & only first-graders use those symbols; so most of my students thought that using A, E or I is not necessary.... it took me some time to teach them to write the letters properly. Last time they had diction I reminded them to ""use the vowels"". The result was good except one of my students who wrote the Farsi symbols instead of the letters!"
9Y7GJUW,female,23,"OOpps! I knew what SALOON mean in English! but I was too tired to notice my mistake. In French & also In Farsi Saloon is a big Hall where you can fit many people @ once & there are seats &.... what I meant by saloon was this kind of a room. a hall, or a waiting room, you know the kind that leads to a coridor & all other parts of the bulding... & thanks for correcting my mistake. It meant a lot to me."
9Y7GJUW,female,23,"Well; we have this windy days that are some kind of strange for Tehran. I mean we are not used to strong winds which would blow everything & all. Tehran most of the time is caressed by gentle breezes like tender hands of a mother.... But lately it seems that the storm beats the city!  The other night the wind was so strong I thought my window would break into pieces; but I was too tired to get up & sleep somewhere else my bed is by the window!) & I figured if it actually breaks, I would stay in my bed till my dad comes & cleans the shattered glass... :D good it never broke! And today while I was walking down the street, the wind was leading me.... And as I got home the antenna on a neighbor roof broke & fell on a car! I had never seen something like that! Fortunately there was no one near the car or inside... but the front glass was shattered & the hood totally damaged!  All these happenings don't make me love wind less. Windy weather is like my moody character: unstable; changing; & unpredictable.... It could be strong enough to move you or it might be too delicate for you to even feel it. You may fly with the wind or you may run away from it.... it doesn't really matter; wind is moving you anyway.... & now I’m flying away with the wind.... Where to? I have no idea... when I got there I will let you know."
9Y7GJUW,female,23,"Well, I still have problem with my hyper student but the others are adapting themselves easily with my method. I used to review all the last sessions in the beginning of the class so my student would get into the mood for a new English lesson & then I would teach the new material & repeat it.  But now that I started teaching alphabet & letters, I changed my timing schedules. I teach the oral part (like the concept of family or colors or...) after a short review of the related subjects; then I would teach letters (which happens to be my students' favorite part). & at last I ask questions student by student & check their handwritings & we discuss their problems. This usually takes more time than expected so I take my student to saloon & as soon as they're done, they can go home. Most of my students prefer to stay in the saloon & do their home work while I'm asking questions.  A very huge obstacle in teaching English to youngsters is the fact that most of them are forced to come to the classroom. I mean they can't figure why they are learning a foreign language & our reasons (like oversee travels or computers) don’t satisfy them.  Oh yeah; I must tell you.... I guess I have to teach for the next couple of months! Let's see if I can get adapted or what!"
9Y7GJUW,female,23,"Tuesday, September 16 Yeah, fall is here at last! What a wonderful feeling it is to…. Officially autumn starts on September 23rd, yet you can feel it in the air. The cool breeze blows & days start to shorten. Autumns are truly beautiful here, full of colors! You may sit by the window & look at the city in the last crimson rays of sunshine or you may go walking under gold & brown trees, enjoying leaf-rain! Did you ever notice the music of leaves beneath your feet, singing: “nothing is eternal”?  Autumns are perfect time to fall in love… just wake up in an autumn day & you may fall in love with the breeze or pale morning sky, or you may fall for the rain, or simply it could be weather you’re in love with! & you can dream perfect dreams as long as you want and as far as your mind can fly. Keep floating in the air & nothing will be impossible for you…. Mehr, the first month of fall, is the beginning of school time! So to me it is a reminder of joy, anxiety, & sure friendship. People over here start rather routine life with the onset of autumn. Laziness & drowsiness 0f summer fade away as it start to get colder! One may notice some kind of movement in every creature… like every one tends to establish new projects! & before long you find yourself involving in one, not remembering when you had started it! Tehran is filled with joy these days… to welcome the beginning of the season! Kids go shopping & in a week or so you can hear their laughers & roars going to school & back! It seems everyone is hanging right now before a race to start. The only thing I don’t like in autumn is this racing mood! You suddenly find the world revolving faster & the heavy morning traffic… one never gets used to! Tehran can not handle transportation of more than a million students every morning! If you ever come here to try going anywhere by car at 8 am, you probably won’t get to the place before 10."

Tehran is seldom quiet & rarely got clean weather but you should have seen it during the past fortnight. It was amazingly fresh & calm like the way it should be… no traffic; no sound pollution. Heaven should be like Tehran in holidays! However the weather is somehow odd. It had been raining cats & dogs & it dropped to 0`C, then out of the blue the sun started shining & all. Well, we thought it had gone back to normal weather but it started to rain again! Don’t get me wrong I love rainy days yet weather changes are so fast, I can’t remember the last time it had been like this over here.  Alright must get back to study a bit. But I will write about 13-bedar soon."
9Y7GJUW,female,23,"Wednesday, July 2, 2003 So the exams are over. It means that I had my last B.Sc. exams…. Rather sad because I had very good time studying with my friends… also it means that I step in a new era of life. Strange; I don’t feel I have changed! & the only thing I’m thinking of is the long summer holiday & God knows I deserve it. Although I haven’t been studying much but this last semester seems longer than any other one…. My; the very last exam (Food Storage) was pushing on the edge. The professor is a really good one, but when it comes to grades, he seems rather tightfisted. ;) I had other courses with him & to tell you the truth I’ve never got good marks! This exam was completely different. (Maybe because I know the way his questions are.) It was a very cool, easy exam. Actually I wonder why I knew every question’s answer! So I hope I would get an A or at least B+.  The next project in my life is Graduation Ceremony which is going to be held at September 4th. Most of the band members will be graduated the same day & well, we are in charge of the ceremony. (Actually I’m not in charge; but Ava is & also Mat & Mr. President are too. I would only be a helping hand if they need one.) The point is we really don’t know how this ceremony should be held…. I mean we’re looking for others opinion. Any body out there has any idea? Will you let me know how your graduation day was? At least it will give us a rough scheme to start…. Tell ya a secret? I missed writing & I miss you all. :)"
9Y7GJUW,female,23,"& no, it is nothing like being a lobbyist or hygiene supervisor in a food factory. Actually this job does not relate to my field of study at all.... I happened to be a teacher now!  Isn't it funny? I studied 4 years to become a food engineer; had been a straight-A student all my life, & now I'm here: teaching kids of 8-11 English! Not that I mind using my not-so-good knowledge of English, but what about all the years I studied?  Basically, over here finding a job related to your field of study is out of the question. Ok no it's not, but you must know someone & then they must introduce you &.... Well, that's the same old story. I had some job offers in food industry but most of them were located over far west borders of Iran & it was really hard for me to pack up & leave my hometown.... Some times I do think that what would have happened if I had accepted one of the offers? I would probably go crazy in a fortnight.   Anyway, I got a job now.... I wish I could teach adults. You know they are more willing to study & the job would not be so crucial. With the kids, one must be very careful. They are quick to learn anything so one mistake & you ruin their chance of learning the correct word forever.  I know this sounds very harsh, yet I had never been interested in children. Kids scare me with their unexpected behavior. However I really don’t see why kids like me. I mean I hardly do anything to attract them, maybe I would wave a hand or smile, but that's it. Yet the kids find it easy to communicate with me. They tend to come & sit by my side or ask me astonishing questions. I guess that's a good point anyhow. OMG, in the class I'm observing thee is this cute 9-years-old girl named ZAHRA; she is a sweetheart although I'm pretty sure she is a bit mischievous. Yesterday her teacher gave the class a 5 minute break & she wanted to go drink some water... in order to impress her teacher, she raised her hand & said ""may I CHEATER"". You must have seen my friend's face (her teacher) she was trying her best not to laugh. It was really funny! Alright, now I just wanted to announce my new job....  By the way I'm not in good mood! Italy just lost the soccer tournament & they were like my favorite team *Cry*. It is not fair! They played really good! *ooohhhhh*  I hope tonight Germany lose too! They had been playing really bad!

Arch seemed very accepting of me yesterday and we had an actual conversation in which he actually COMPLIMENTED me.  go figure.  Harold's got this aunt jill....man she is a pistol.   she is EXACTLY like aunt vicki in every way.  she's youthful looking beyond what should legally be allowed, she's got this gorgeous smile and wonderful laugh that could make even ebeneezer grin.  She obviously loves life.  Of course, it would seem the entire family does.     The Rents.    We spent the night with Harold's mom and dad.    Harold and I left the Combs' homestead to go visit with Norie before fireworks.  We overspent the time, im afraid.  She seemed worn out by the time we left and more than happy to see her husband by the time we left. It was definitely time well spent tho, and I have a firm affinity for Norie.  I never saw much similarity between her and Harold's mom before, but now....they are SO sisters.  so completely.  I did see more of the bathroom than I wanted in the time we were there, tho.  darn meds  .  From Norie's (gorgeous cabin btw), we went back to the rents where we found them frolicking on the lawn on a coupla riding mowers like a hoover-round commercial.  It was hilarious.  It seems....I'm much more comfortable around the rents than before.  much.   I think I owe most of that to maturity and actually knowing who I am this time around.  That and....the whole ""im a mommy too"" thing.....makes female relationships easier, thats for darn sure.  His mom....She is something else.  The woman teaches, runs her own business, takes care of her extended family on a daily basis, AND runs the farm.  Can we say ""Proverbs 31""?!  geez the woman is her own lesson in fortitude and grace.  and she's got these amazing legs that a 16 year old would be jealous of.  beautiful woman.  amazing woman.  and the father.....if it werent for the pepper in the hair I'd swear he were Harold's age.  He has stories out the wazoo, and the dynamic personality and sense of theatre to REALLY make them interesting.  He's got a gleam in his eye, altho neither hair on his face nor a stomach that shakes like a bowl full of jelly......so dont dont go thinking santa clause or anything.....he too seems youthful.  I dont know what it is about that area, but the good ones all seem to stay so very young for so very long, provided they can keep from being broken by the sins of their families.  sounds like the godfather.  geez, heaven help me  .  I love the farm.  I'm freakin scared to death of bugs, animals, and family stress.  especially when its outside the dysfunctional family dynamic im used to.  NEWZ....yeah its gorgeous there.  id go freakin batty in two week's time without a meijers in walking distance (or neighbors for that matter)....  So then we went and watched fireworks at some family friend's house where you could see beattyville fireworks through the trees and above the hills...It was lovely, minus the scary mutant bugs.  and then harold and I conked out about an hour before the grown ups even finished talking....(lol)  I wanted to be in  bed by 10 so badly....and i think it was like 1 am.  we got up the next morning and made it back to louisville exactly at 12, when i was sposed to be 20 miles across town picking up joe.  ron didnt say much tho.  joey was happy to be home and THRILLED to have harold there.  he LOVES harold.    We did fireworks at dad's house.  joey loved them, tho it took longer than id imagined....not a bad thing it just did.  i said when we started, watch daddy show up as soon as we finish.  he did.  like a minute after we were done.  We took enough time to clean up a bit, then Harold was on his way home and so were joe and i.  so that was my weekend.  How was yours?"

0B2HXGF,female,25,"According to an article  urlLink Troy Roebuck  read on the radio this morning as I was driving to work,   urlLink sex actually improves the functions of the brain , thereby making one more intelligent and better able to retain information.  As was further explained, this is due to the intense stimulation provided to the neurons (a neuron ""workout"", if you will....) and the copious amounts of otherwise fairly low-level chemicals that flood the brain (e.g., adrenaline, etc.).

My letter to Mr. Gates  Dear Mr. Gates,              Even though you made me buy another Xbox just to get online, I forgive you. I just bitchslapped some texan motherfucker upside the head with a god damned Particle Projection Canon. Then I shot the building beside him. The building fell on him. I laughed. He heard me laughing.   The greatest thing I've ever experienced happened next. He cried. I fucking heard him starting to cry.

3Z53UA5,male,24,"As uberslick as most of us would class it, sleeping in really ain't all it's cracked up to be. Sleeping in comes with several companion facets - (Farah Facets, I like to call them) that simply do not Snickers-Level Satisfy. Primarily, it means I stayed up late. This is true and completely accurate - there was conversing into the wee hours as  I watched some of the best episodes of the Sopranos I have ever had the chance to lay my poor, unworthy occularies upon. While staying up was great - I always feel bad when I don't accomplish something while staying up; no extra coding was finished, no new pages were added to any website, no language was learned, etc... I tried to absorb some of the basics about real photography, however, photo.net/learn takes me to a plethora of pages with poor parsing - nothing between it's head tag and it;s tail if you will. Pity.  Sleep has been an interesting exercise over the past few days. I purchased down pillows from Ikea - they are simply the greatest thing to happen to my nightly retreat from consciousness since the first time I found staying awake was not an optional thing. I also invested in a comforter at the time - something I've never in my life owned up until this point. Bedspreads were always the rule, with blankets. Let me say that the fine North American invention of the comforter probably prevented a war at some point, it's a god damn life saver. However, it promotes the most dangerous type of sleep. The ""Aww fuck it, it's only X o'clock""- Rollover(tm). Really a dangerous thing for those wanting to get work done.  It's not often I'm in bed til 12. It's superduper rare. I've had my day (I'm not going to get anything done today as I have to get cleaned up and go to work, but at least I had a good nap. Dreams were weird (no dreams about out future prime minister again, that was *whack* - to coin a term).  So now all of today's morning appointments, (one really - to set up a computer, that's all I do), are being shifted to tomorrow.  One thing that's on the roster for today: More Glen-asskicking. MWAHA!  He's really not that bad.  Oh yes. Yes he is. Someday I'm gonna get all survivor style and ""If you WAS lyin in the DESURT with no FOOD or WATA, I wouldn't even stop to give you a DRINK.""  Mostly cause I've got to have someone to loathe, and congrats Glenner, you're it :) LOVE YOU!"
3Z53UA5,male,24,"Some things I didn't touch on.  The Glennis has been in a right mood of late. He's been all raincloudy and so on. He did something delightful today and went behind my back and ""tattled"" on me - for something rather rediculous that I didn't even realize was a problem. As soon as I was made aware of it, the common sense solution presented itself and I rectified the issue - problem would have been solved if he'd just talked to me, instead he breeds bad blood.  I brought him a few slices of pizza. A few reasons behind this - when someone does something nice for you when you've been a dick you feel extra guilty. Secondly, it will let him know that even though he's being a dick, it doesn't have to be that way.  He's intimated to several people that there are problems at home. This is not the sort of thing we make fun of (nonfunctional testicles notwithstanding). His wife really needs to get with the program, he's got needs too.  Okay, I need to stop that line of thought now.  Spider-man 2 the game rocks. Plain and simple. Go play it.

3Z53UA5,male,24,"So work hasn't been too bad for the past few days. Good money, little flack from the morons.  However I was just informed that if I'm interested in keeping myself upwardly mobile in the company, there is a meeting I should be attending tomorrow at 8 am.  If you're unaware, tonight is the night that the clocks ""spring forward"" (note to self. Shoot the fucker who came up with that as a witticism).  That means that I would essentially be attending work at 7 am. When we don't, according to scale, open until 10. Being there three hours early is potentially the stupidest thing I can possibly imagine, especially when I've probably got more skill then the chap dishing out the tips.  Hence I will be at work tomorrow at 10. IF there is any sort of flack distributed, I believe I'll call HR and see what the hell they have to say about it. If I've got to be there three hours early, you're going to fucking pay me for it.   On another note, Zelda is good. So is Star Trek Deep Space 9. DS9 is a little like paradoxical candy. It's tasty, it's stimulating and you really can't get enough. If candy were like that, the world would be a better place."
3Z53UA5,male,24,"I got an insanely early night last night. Woke up to find my internet access shot. Apparently my modem released my ip and was unable to re-establish it. One thing is making work bearable right now, that's four hours of Star Trek back to back. Which is great even if one of the eps has to be from voyager. It's kind of like reading an author you hate, you don't enjoy it, but it's valuable from a literary criticism standpoint. Bought a CD Rack for my cd's so I can finally get rid of my stupid tilt a whirl rotate a cd holder. I may put that downstairs when I eventually get a stereo (I might buy a stereo!!)  I'm thinking of turning the corner of my bedroom into a little board game centre. Four chairs or stools that would fit under a table just the right size for some board games and drinks. I think I might build the table myself and put a chess/checkers board right into the surface. I'm going to look around and see how it's done.  That is all."
3Z53UA5,male,24,"I did something a little strange tonight. As I was driving home from my parents house, I used the seek function of my radio to tune it a a variety of stations. An interesting experience to say the least - a lot like evesdropping really. I had the sense that I was intruding on the lives of the people to whom these stations belong. Weather, news, sports - all local yet not Local. In my travels I found Missouri, Maine, Iowa, Michigan, New York. I tuned into one station that never identified itself - it seemed to be an evangelical broadcast - Listening further I noticed that it was a religious broadcast refuting modern miracles - the kind with no proof. Refuting them with scripture - citing passages that demonstrated how God's miracles were usually performed - in front of witnesses with verifiable facts usually with a message. A fascinating take on a subject usually clouded by charismatic charlatans and elaborate smoke and mirrors. Not at all what I expected."
3Z53UA5,male,24,"The Lord of the Ringolos 2.0: The Towers that haven't been hit by Airplanes is out in theatres as of today. It's good. It's very good. The only thing that irked me was the music - for God's sake, we got the point in the first one, more inspiring speeches backed by insipid music really aren't needed anymore - Pete, for Pe... er... for you own sake, try to have someone inspire us all to the sounds of silence in the background. The Battle for Helm's Deep was appropriately asskicking. It's funny that Sauron's army were faceless bastards wearing turbans...  Possibly the best part of the film was Andy Serkis as Smeagol/Gollum... There's a scene were he's got to make up  his ""minds"" and the dialogue is delivered phenomenally well.

3Z53UA5,male,24,"I'm going to impart a little bit of wisdom that was once imparted to me at my daddy's knee: The folks at Fido are a bunch of wang gobbling cocknockers. Potentially a breed of the stupidest human beings on the planet, this particular strain of French Canadian (Fidous Frenchus Assholus Cocknockerus Homo Stupidus) is responsible for the throbbing vein now occupying space on my forehead. Worse yet, they've somehow decided I own them money(I don't) and at the same time they've decided that money is overdue (it isn't) and that they should send it to a collections agency (that may be the last mistake they ever make). So I get to explain to a bunch of grasping-with-the-language fucks about how I don't owe them money. They agree I don't, but still want me to pay it. Fuckem.  I swear to god, even this isn't wrapped up in less than 21 days, I'll do something drastic. Smoking fucking crater drastic."
3Z53UA5,male,24,"My happiness at achieving Prestige status at work (and the trappings it brings in the form of a new nametage and business cards) was tempered this afternoon by hearing the news that Pam died this morning. Pam was a close relative and friend - but someone I haven't seen in years. The guilt of disassociation and my general inability to maintain connections over time hurt and continues to hurt. I think it makes me a bad person.  Naturally I have some duties this evening that negate any plans that I had. However, when someone passes on, you have to do the right thing.

GUAS2DP,female,35,"Well I have to say yesterday was one of the most nerve-wracking, stomach-twisting days of my life.  Definitely par for the course for me.  This is going to be long--probaby.  Which is no surprise if you know me *g*  Monday La Agenta (the agent?) calls.  Caller ID is for those who love to inflict self abuse.  She leaves no message but I know she called because of CALLER ID...ARGGGGGG So I call back and leave a message.  I'm home in the morning until 8:30 CST.  I hang around Tuesday morning and ... no call. Go to work and of course CHECK THE CALLER ID.  Don't do this.  Don't EVER do this.    La Agenta has left a message w/her cell # so I can call her back.  But I can't call from work and my cell phone is broke so i can't even step outside for five and besides what if I scream or something--this is a BIG no no.  I get to sit at work for SIX HOURS WAITING to GO HOME and CALL HER BACK!!!!  So I skip out 15 minutes early, FORGETTING I needed to get gas.  Sooooo I have to stop for gas. THENNNNNN I have to stop and mail my revised TARA entry so it arrives in time. FINALLY I get to the daycare to pick up the kids who INSIST On kicking ONE MORE FREAKING BALL (they're playing kickball).  I RUN THROUGH WENDY's for dinner so I dont have to cook, grab my dinner and beeline for the bedroom to call her.  By some miracle my kids decided NOT to bug me while I was on the phoen with her.*thank you*    OBVIOUSLY if she's giving me her cell # she's not going to reject me but I still had to hear it for real with mine own two ears becuase it's just not real.  But it is, she loved  urlLink ""The Big Girl's Guide to Buying Lingerie""  and wants to be my agent.    I got off the phone and immediately called  urlLink Pam Britton  who is probably one of the nicest pubbed writers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I called a couple more friends, posted on eHarl, posted on my crit loop, told the chicks in chicklit chat and generally just sat around wired for sound.    But why am I not more excited.  I'm totally psyched about WHO My agent is, so I know that's not it.  I'm overwhlemed, I'm tired and last but most certainly not least I'm releived.    As writers we tend to second guess ourselves, we compare ourselves TO ourselves (how crazy is THAT?) not to mention other writers and we can't, we shouldn't, we know better but we do it anyway.    Having an agent fills me with relief--I feel validated as a writer.  I mean people can tell you it's good all day long but when an agent wants you that's different.  It's like the difference between your mom saying you're cute and the man of your dreams saying you're cute (or gorgeous or whatever).   I know I still have to produce saleable work but I don't have to worry about doing the selling.  I NEED to learn about contracts (and all that entails eventuallY) but to be frank, I'm one of those writers who just wants to write."
GUAS2DP,female,35,"Writing may be one of your main focuses for today, AMIE. You have a lot of information to impart to anyone who might be interested in what you have to say. You could try your hand at a magazine article, or perhaps fiction, or poetry. However, even if all you write at this time is a letter to your grandmother, what you say will undoubtedly be bright, gripping, and certainly very interesting. Go to it!   This is todays.  It really made me laugh cause I spent all weekend reworking the beginning of TCRA (yes, again).  On Friday I talked with a friend who'd read the first four chapters and she said, ""Can I be honest.""  She always is.   ""Of course."" ""It has no spark.  It doesn't suck me in.  Even the first version sucked me in.  I'm sorry."" No, let me bow down and kiss your feet.  What did I learn?  LISTEN to your instincts becuase they're always right.  I KNEW those chapters weren't anywhere near as good as they could be.  I KNEW there was something wrong.  But I tried to ignore it and keep plowing forward.  Well, her and I brainstormed Friday and I spent the weekend reworking chapters 2-4.    Earlier last week I told another friend that Zack bored me (Zack and Jessa both have a tendancy to play it really close to the vest which makes my job that much harder).  Obviously that's not a good thing.  If he bores me, he'd definitely bore a reader!  So we threw ideas back and forth and it got me to thinking more about him.    He's perfect.  In the real world we'd probably call him gay but that dog won't hunt.  So of course I spent a long time thinking about Laid Back Zack and what made him tick.  It's not easy being an artist in a prominent ranching family in a small town.  Or a single dad with no mother for your child in sight(and no explanation as to her whereabouts).  We can definitely concede he's not an alpha, probably not even a gamma but a bona fide beta male.  His view of the world small and large makes him feel even more like an odd duck, even in his own family--so he internalizes a lot (like Jessa).  I think the artist in him also makes him more sensual(he's very sensory), yet he's also got this slightly dominant, slightly controlling, side that only comes out in bed.   Oh, my!"

The East Coast is less thoroughly liberal than the west, but  urlLink Mike is right  about the move to the right being less severe as you head west from NYC. So even if we couldn't hold the east coast as convincingly, that's not a big deal, all the good shit comes from China and SE Asia anyway, one well-placed bomb to the Panama Canal and the conservatives would be in dire straits.

I don't think we have to worry about the Arabian Peninsula for reasons that don't need explanation. That leaves them what, India? A slow boat 3/4s of the way around the world from China? Not likely.

F6HSRHT,male,23,"I was digging around while trying to justify my  urlLink incorrect usage  of   succubus   to describe Gael Garcia Bernal, when I came upon a page entitled  urlLink INCUBUS AND SUCCUBUS: DEMONS THAT HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH YOU . Uh . . . perfect? The root page is ""Jesus-is-Lord.com"" I knew this was going to be good.  To begin, he's good enough to clarify and expand upon some missteps in Websters definition:   INCUBUS - A spirit or demon thought in medieval times to lie on sleeping persons, especially women, with whom it sought sexual intercourse.   SUCCUBUS - In folklore, a female demon thought to have sexual intercourse with sleeping men.   Above definitions came from Webster's Dictionary.   INCUBI - Demonic sexual attacks on females; may be caused by sexual sins, witchcraft spells, curses of lust, inherited curses, can attack children  SUCCUBI - demonic sexual attacks on males, may be caused by the same as Incubi above   Forget medieval times and folklore, these demons are for real! The demons have sex with both men and women as the person sleeps,   AND YOU KNOW IT  . It's not a dream, and it is not your imagination.  [ed. italics are mine, retarded use of capslock is not]   Aparently all those adolescent nocturnal emissions were satanic in nature. This comes as quite a relief. I'd always suspected anything that made my mom eye me like that as she changed my sheets had to be evil   (see also, dropping shovel from deck onto little brother's head)  . Also, shockingly, 9 out of 10 women have been raped by a demon.  This is fascinating. Some anthropologist should study this guy. His Christianity is draped in the superstition and fear-mongering of the 17th century lay preacher. This is Salem, Massachusetts type stuff. This is a world where demonology trumps psychology. Freud was a harbinger of Satan. I love it--though I've lost the link to that one. Rest assured that psychology is one of the many holes through which demons can enter your life, along with Hellivision.   The  urlLink main page  is better. He's got all the usual stuff, but kicked up a notch. This guy is a showman. He has animated gifs. The Roman Catholic Church, like always, is presented as the whore of Babylon, but here it's in  urlLink slide-show  format.  look up pagan Rome's ""pontiff"", ""diocese"", ""vicar"", incense burning, multiple gods (now called saints), goddess worship, and statues. Why do you think this Satanic masterpiece is called ""ROMAN"" Catholic? Ancient Rome lives on today! The Great Whore still rides the beast in all her monstrous glory!  Well put. I wonder if he worships on   Sun  day. The problem here, is not his criticism of Catholicism, the finer points of which (the persecution, murder and sexism) aren't exactly news. The problem is that he never turns the critical eye upon himself or Protestantism as a whole.  Among his quotes:    The Bible is like a lion; it does not need to be defended; just let it loose and it will defend itself.  --  Martin Luther  He's a big Luther fan; he likes the guy. Other, less famous Luther quotes (from an equally  urlLink skewed website ):   ""What then shall we do with this damned, rejected race of Jews?""  ""The Jews deserve to be hanged on gallows, seven times higher than ordinary thieves""   ""If I had to baptize a Jew, I would take him to the river Elbe, hang a stone around his neck and push him over with the words `  I baptize thee in the name of Abraham  '.""  Maybe he likes Luther because modern  urlLink Judaism is blasphemous . Now I'm getting kind of pissed off, though I still feel like I'm slumming--like refuting this guy gives him some kind of credibility.  Finally, he donkey-punches the politically correct left with a dose of Jesus' truth:     You're intolerant!    No, the truth is intolerant. 2+2=4, not 5, not 11, not 213. The truth is unbending, it is unyielding, it is exclusive. The truth of God is offensive to the hellbound, sin-loving,   want-to-believe-lies man  . God hath not left Himself without witness in this perverse and crooked generation--His word is the Holy Bible (King James 1611 for the English speaking peoples of the world). I am not the author of truth, but I know Who is. His name is Jesus and anything that contradicts His word is a wicked lie.             Blam.     He has the obligatory  urlLink screed against evolution . His biggest ally, apparently, is the  urlLink Second Law of Thermaldynamics .   Take that fake science  . Despite having thermaldynamics on his side, he commits the same error all creationist critics of Darwinism I've read do. He assumes the the theory of evolution   never evolved   past Darwin and Huxley. It's kinda the same problem as taking a series of books of uncertain authorship that were written 1500 years ago, weeding them out from a much larger group of very similar works, then countlessly and horribly hand-translating them and calling the finished product   absolute truth  . I love that he hates the papacy and believes it to be flawed from the beginning, thinks Peter (upon whose rock [God] would build [his] church) was actually Satan, yet he uses the canon scripture set down by the Council of Nicea in 325AD. There weren't any Protestants back then. The Pope was the only game in town. If he could   connect the fucking dots  , that would mean that the Bible, in its very essence and composition, is the work of the Anti-Christ.   Stupid idiot  . You don't have to be a  urlLink sophomore Philosophy student  to shoot holes in that reasoning.  Because of all the reality he's dropping, the site is under constant attack by the worldly henchmen of the antichrist--it almost goes without saying. The work of papist hackers and abortionists abounds:    THIS WEBSITE IS BEING SYSTEMATICALLY BANNED!   urlLink INTERNET FILTERING SERVICES ARE FILTERING THIS WEBSITE SO THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IT!    Is it banned because he's a fundamentalist (truth teller), or, is it because he's an anti-semite? He doesn't seem to ponder that possibility, so neither will we--there are bigger problems afoot:    If you have a problem accessing any of the files resident on our server, try capitalizing the file name, e.g., http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/couldnt.htm becomes  urlLink http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/COULDNT.HTM   Strangely, He doesn't mention the obvious, that a demon of capitalization has possessed his server. He must not want to unduly alarm us."
F6HSRHT,male,23,"I just can't put together a decent sentence tonight. This is disappointing, I had some pretty important stuff to devote way too many words to.   For instance, I think I'm the only person in the world that noticed  urlLink Phil LaMarr  is an extra in Spiderman 2. I'm sure you caught all the other cameos, including the loser Raimi brother begging for any bit part Sam would give him. Bet you missed Phil though.   This is probably only portentious to me, but if the least funny actor on a perenially underachieving  urlLink sketch comedy show  can sink low enough to walkon as an extra, then the economy is much worse off than I'd ever imagined.

I think I caused a tumult in the theatre, cackling as Tobey McGuire fought to save thousands upon thousands of people from doom. In my defense, I would have laughed without seeing Phil LaMarr, as Tobey's   trying really hard to stop this train   face looks just like a   wishbone passing sideways through the lower colon   face. Some acting coach should tell him that general exertion is a different face than a painful bowel movement.   If they were the same, weightlifting in all its forms would be a much more satisfying spectator sport.   I also thought I caught a  urlLink Stan Lee  cameo.

Here's a heads-up. If you the only thing you like more than funk and fetishism is the crooning of Elton John, then you should buy or download the  urlLink Scissor Sisters .

F6HSRHT,male,23,"Why do people need personalized license plates? What exactly is the point? I don't understand it, but I'd really like to. Unfortunately, the kind of people that have such plates seem far too ostentatious for my fragile disposition. I get sweaty around such people, I worry they'll start to pinch my cheeks or rib me with their elbows--back me into a corner and explain to me the versatility and universality of tweed. So, forcibly alone on this voyage of discovery, I speculate wildly.  Do they have difficulty meeting people? Do they think their love of Saabs will spark a roadside conversation? A life-long friendship?    ""Excuse me, but I couldn't help noticing you think 'SOBSROK'. Do you mean the European car manufacturer or the spasmodic contraction of the throat? I, for one, enjoy both.""   Is the drive to let complete strangers in on their inner most desires so strong that they have to coalesce their reason for drawing breath into a 7 digit alpha-numeric code? Were they not held as children?  Is there not one amongst the millions of bumper stickers that adequately demonstrates their status as a "" 18FCALI ""? Or do they simply relish the fact that they are able to waste literally thousands of minutes of people's lives daily as a freeway full of motorists collectively wonder, ""what . . . the . . .  fuck ?""   All of this is bad enough. It seems to me, though, that in addition to wasting my time, most of these plates are outright lies or, in the best case, percolating self-deceptions.      SK8RGRL      Just really likes  urlLink Volcom  and either loves or despises  urlLink Avril Lavigne        1337HXR       Rewarded himself with that for getting his  urlLink Mandrake -based  urlLink Counter Strike  server up and running.        PRNSTAR     Isn't, but desperately wants you to think he is.   The impetus for this drivel began on the way to work: I was stuck behind an  urlLink Audi TT . The shiny black roadster, looking like someone had tugged at a VW Beetle with a taffy-puller, was driven by a beehive of thinning silver hair that may or may not have been mounted to the skull of some osteoporotic septuagenarian. The license plate read  MJS4FUN .  Besides driving fast, which these cars do pretty well, the only fun I can imagine gleaning from an Audi TT is laughing as more than one friend  urlLink tries to pile in  the car with you. The fun-factor necessarily diminishes if one of these friends is a dwarf or an amputee. The car was a hardtop because, frankly, it looked as though any whipping wind would cleave with grim finality what remained of her hair from their enfeebled folicles.  So it had to be the rule-bending exhileration of speed. This ball of fluff though, alone in her car, windows fully up, was watching her speed strictly--watching it sit perfectly 10mph below the 25mph limit.  "" YOU'RE NOT HAVING  FUN ! "" I screamed, fists shaking. The scream was imagined of course, but imagined with the incredulity of a young Tom Hanks managing a team of unruly housewives (""There's no crying in  baseball ""). My hands were steadfast at 10 and 2. As sweat formed a puddle betwixt my brows, my left eye began twitching uncontrollably.  I vented this annoyance to a friend (ref:  urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ), and he notified me that his father, in fact, had a personalized license plate. He then cautioned me to not "" paint all users with the same brush "", which is good advice. Further, he said that he feels initials (his father's simple, austere choice) leant an elegance to the affair of owning a motor car.   So all of a sudden   I   look like the crazy one.  Strange how initialling your car is a sign of cultivation, while initialling a carton of milk with a permanent marker conveys anal retentiveness and paranoia."
F6HSRHT,male,23,"I was thinking about the divisiveness of the political discourse in this country, the polarization, the outright hatred from both the extreme left and right. I was thinking about the terror level, Burt in most of the country and Ernie in New York City and DC.  I was thinking about fear as a vehicle for recruiting conservatives.  Think about this. Why do we call Republicans ""conservative""? Look at their platform. Legislating to ensure the survival of ""traditional American values"" and leaving the rest to big business. They want to conserve the way of life begun by our--predominately--Puritan forefathers. This is fine in itself. I like Jesus and his teachings. I think Jesus was a great guy.  I think Jesus, were he alive today, would be more inclusive with his love and respect than both the current Republican Administration and most of the groups who have devoted their lives to his worship (the Catholic Church as a whole, the Southern Baptists, et al). But that's kind of beside the point.  They have a conception of a country and of a culture they like. They feel these things are in jeopardy; they desperately want them to persevere unchanged.  Let's look at culture as a function of evolution. Cultures are fluid, this is an observation, not a partisan value judgment. They change, this is inevitable. Conservatives, by definition, are resistant to change. Republicans, as a party, are resistant to  cultural  change. They think our country is in danger of falling into a moral fissure. Certain others feel our country is struggling to climb its way out of that fissure. These are value judgments.  So culture. How does it change? More importantly, how does it change the fastest? I'm not going to cite sources or attempt to convince you, I've got a concert to get to. Cultures, in my opinion, change the fastest when imposed upon by outside cultures, this kind of synthesis is much better at evolving a culture than a culture left to its own devices. Realize that I'm not using evolution as a term of teleological movement. When something evolves, biology teaches us, it isn't ""better"" per se, it isn't moving towards perfection, it is merely changing.  Just as scientists propose a spike in the pace of biological evolutionary change when asexual reproduction gave way to sexual, the pace of cultural evolution speeds up when cultures are fused, or when people of divergent cultures integrate.  If you buy this idea, what then, is the most present danger the our cultural sovereignty faces? I submit it is influence from other, radically different cultures. Outsiders.  What is the best way stifle this? I think it's fear. Fear of the other. Xenophobia. When our nation's terrorism alert system is inextricably linked with a group of people, we send the message that outsiders are inherently dangerous, or at least suspicious, and to be avoided. Similar in its functionality is the doctrine of unilateralism pushed by this administration.  GWB said, ""America will never seek a permission slip to defend it's sovereignty,"" or something to that effect. It's them against us,   all   of them.  How much hatred of the French has this caused? France, a country who has been our longtime ally. Now the French are selfish communists and a divisive global element only concerned with their own (evil) agenda and a thorn in the side of the peace-loving world. Just like the Terrorists (Islamists). The peace loving are made up of a curiously small number of countries: England, Canada, Australia, etc.  Hmmm.  The coalition of the willing is not only deeply tied to us economically, but  also very similarly composed culturally.  I'll probably add more depth to this later, but these are my thoughts and I have a concert to get to. Discuss amongst yourselves.  Photos (of the concert, not coalition) to (hopefully) follow.     Spellcheck works with Mozilla, now I really need to change my blog title. Strangely, blogger's spell check doesn't contain the word ""blog""."

2PN13G1,female,16,"Seattle Post Joel Connelly July 19, 2004   The favorite Seattle restaurant for Teresa Heinz Kerry is Wild Ginger, fittingly given the spiciness that THK brings to the relentlessly bland world of U.S. presidential politics.  The lady's blunt opinions are delivered in a soft, slightly accented voice. It commands attention and can reduce a raucous rally to quiet, respectful listening. A prime-time appearance at next week's Democratic National Convention will increase public scrutiny of the Mozambique-born, South African-educated wife of Sen. John Kerry.  Heinz Kerry, 65, speaks her mind.  In an interview during last week's Seattle visit, she decried the Bush administration for ""cynical manipulation,"" ""narrowness of thinking"" and ""terrifying ignorance"" in its failure to address global warming.  ""You are an idiot if you don't do anything,"" she argued.  She recalled a recent experience in the air over Ohio talking with retired Democratic Sen. John Glenn, who 42 years ago was the first American to circle the Earth in space.   ""He said, 'We are at 40,000 feet. In space I was not really much further up. What you see of the atmosphere is that it is a little film above the Earth. It is so thin. Yet, it is all we have.'  ""I see an urgency -- in the United States alone, and around the globe -- in restoring and preserving a breathing, healthy planet. Already global climate change is showing its face. I talk to farmers, who say things are not normal. I listen to people who deal with earth and nature, and their findings. ... The point is, even if you talk to the most conservative scientists about their scenarios of warming, you come away convinced we have to do something.""  Heinz Kerry grew in Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony, the daughter of a Portuguese doctor and medical researcher. She was active in anti-apartheid groups as a university student in South Africa.       Until recently, she was also a Republican -- but of a subspecies now struggling to survive.  She was married for 25 years to John Heinz, heir to the H.J. Heinz condiment fortune and senator from Pennsylvania from 1976 until his death in a 1991 plane crash.  John Heinz was part of a then-numerous group of moderate Republican senators, hailing from the Eastern Seaboard but also such Western outposts as Oregon and Washington.  The GOP moderates' causes included conservation, a legacy dating to Theodore Roosevelt's designating national monuments and wildlife refuges from islands off Florida to Washington's Olympic Mountains.  It was at a 1990 Earth Day rally with John Heinz that she met her present husband, John Kerry.   The two senators were speaking for what was then a bipartisan cause, at a time when the man in the White House -- George H.W. Bush -- was vowing to be ""the environmental president.""  Bush delivered, too, with 1991 Clean Air Act amendments that provided a successful framework of economic incentives for industries to reduce emissions.  The death of her first husband made Heinz Kerry overseer of two Heinz family endowments now valued at $1.3 billion. She would become one of the nation's major environmental philanthropists, financing such projects as a Pittsburgh convention center cooled by water flowing over its roof.   She encountered Kerry again at the 1992 global conference on the environment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The couple celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary during a May campaign stop in Seattle.  As the wife of a Democratic senator seeking the presidency, Heinz Kerry now argues that ""the bipartisan record of many years"" has been betrayed under the administration of Bush's son.  She is equally dismayed at Bush's public statements, from his pronouncement that the Kyoto Protocol on global warming was ""dead on arrival"" to his skepticism of scientific evidence on global warming.  ""As president, you have to have some sophistication in speech, if not in policy,"" she said.   She is not a down-the-line defender of Kyoto. She said it was ""perfectly appropriate"" for the Bush administration to explore alternatives less penalizing to industrial nations.  ""But to say the science is still out is absurd,"" she added. ""People who don't know science like to doubt and vilify scientists.""  Heinz Kerry wants the United States, in its trade treaties, to pay more than lip service to labor conditions, human rights and environmental standards. She suggests as a model the so-called ""Sullivan Principles,"" standards set before South Africa's apartheid government by U.S. corporations as conditions for investment.  She wants the U.S. government to end a decade of dawdling and tighten fuel efficiency standards for new cars.  ""If we want to be competitive worldwide, we need to build fuel-efficient cars,"" she said.  ""I sat in a new hybrid at the Detroit auto show. It's a nice, roomy car. It's a safe car, for the soccer mom.  ""Why should Americans have to buy a Prius? Why can't our manufacturers come up with such cars?""  As a philanthropist, Heinz Kerry has pursued as her primary causes the environment and early-childhood education. She believes -- fervently -- that the education of women is linked to repairing and sustaining the planet.  ""People who work in population will tell you one thing: A woman who is educated has a better say in how she runs her life and the number of children she will bring into this world.  ""There is no question. Overpopulation is tied to the environment: It leads to desertification, to the mass movement of refugees, to hunger and to desperation.""  It's fascinating stuff, fearlessly delivered.  Despite the soft tones, Teresa Heinz Kerry makes Hillary Clinton look like a shrinking violet."
2PN13G1,female,16,"AP   Much has been made of the contrast between Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic challenger, John Edwards. But what about the similarities? Cheney's wife, Lynne, introduced him at a campaign event last week in Pittsburgh — and sounded positively Edwards-esque.   ""I have known him since he was 14 years old and working as a janitor at the Ben Franklin store in Casper, Wyoming,"" she said. ""I made a list today of some of the jobs he had. He clerked at a candy store. He bused tables in a cafeteria. He loaded trucks for a dollar an hour. One summer he started out working in a bentonite plant, filling sacks full of a hundred pounds of bentonite and loading them onto railroad cars,"" she said.  ""Then — and this will surprise you — he got his union ticket. And as a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he spent six years, on and off, building power lines to help pay his way through school.""  She added: ""We live in a great country when a young man with small-town roots and values and common sense can represent his state in the Congress, can become secretary of defense, and can serve as vice president of the United States.""  The introduction was oddly reminiscent of Edwards' widely praised stump speech, in which he harks back to revisits his hardscrabble childhood in North Carolina, where his father worked in a mill.  But Lynne Cheney's comments were ironic if only because the Republican National Committee has lacerated Edwards for playing up his humble roots, calling him ""phony and disingenuous"" on the RNC Web site."
2PN13G1,female,16,"Chicago Tribune John McCormick Jul. 12, 2004   This western Pennsylvania city may owe its post-World War II prosperity to steel, but it's the ketchup that made Sen. John Kerry's wife so famously rich.  That wealth has afforded condiment heir Teresa Heinz Kerry and her family a long legacy of philanthropy, something almost certain to help her second husband's appeal in an important section of a key electoral state.  The Heinz name -- now strongly associated with that of the Democratic presidential candidate -- is plastered across numerous high-profile buildings and cultural institutions throughout the city.  There is Heinz Field (home of the Pittsburgh Steelers), the Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, the Heinz Memorial Chapel and the Sen. John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center -- just to name a few.  A recent analysis of public records by the Los Angeles Times showed Heinz Kerry, 65, controls a family fortune worth an estimated $1 billion. If elected, the couple would rank as the wealthiest to occupy the White House.  The Heinz family has long been known for its philanthropy, especially in the Pittsburgh area. It has funded art museums, scholarships, charities, hospitals, literary awards, symphonies, women's health programs and more.  Boosting his ties to the area, Kerry has spent several weekends during the campaign on the estate his wife owns northeast of the city. The Massachusetts senator also announced his running mate, Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, at a rally in downtown Pittsburgh last week.  The $4 million property, one of five homes the couple own across the country, includes a nine-room Colonial and a carriage house. It is where Heinz Kerry raised her three sons and where she is registered to vote.  Pointing to the loss of steel and industrial jobs, Heinz Kerry seemed to mention the charitable work her family has done for the area as she posed on the wooded estate for the first family portrait of the new Kerry-Edwards political clan last week.  ""It's been 20-plus years now, almost 30, that people in this area have been hit by loss of jobs,"" she said. ""We have worked very hard here to try to turn this place around.""  The Mozambique-born matriarch went on to point to several political battlegrounds that she also views as needing the help Pittsburgh has received from charities and public investments. ""America is full of places like the Ohio Valley, Youngstown, West Virginia,"" she said.  Heinz Kerry's first husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz, died in a 1991 plane crash. He had served in the Senate since 1977 and was a member of the House for three terms before that.  At the regional history center that bears the Heinz name, there are only a few mementos from his political career, one being a campaign bumper sticker that features his name printed in ketchup red.  Still, half of a floor in the museum is devoted to Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., a major employer and a company with more than 130 years of history here. Ketchup bottles line several displays as visitors enter the exhibit.  The company's story began in 1869, when 25-year-old H.J. Heinz began selling horseradish to grocery stores in the Pittsburgh area. Four years later, he started making ketchup.  The young entrepreneur anticipated that an increasingly urban nation would welcome the convenience of ready-made products. ""Many women appreciated the ease of simply opening a bottle of sauce or a crock of preserves,"" the exhibit states.  By the time of H.J. Heinz's death in 1919, the company was one of the largest food processors in the nation, selling condiments, sauces, pickles and preserves around the world.  The exhibit also lets visitors in on the secret of how the ""57"" in the ""Heinz 57"" name was selected. There were more than 57 varieties of condiments at the time, but H.J. Heinz simply liked the number's sound.  Today, the company makes more than 4,000 varieties. Although the bottles don't carry the Kerry name, around here they might as well."
2PN13G1,female,16,"Courier Des Moines Bureau TODD DORMAN   First lady Laura Bush said Wednesday she intends to take a more active role in her husband's re-election effort as the campaign trail brought her to western and central Iowa.  ""I think people know me better than they did,"" Bush said during a stop at Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines. ""I do enjoy it. I like to be with people and politics is a people business.""  The first lady toured a children's health center and touted the ""Reach Out and Read"" program. The effort enlists pediatricians to stress the importance of reading to children and to provide books to their young patients at check-ups.  She also read aloud to a group of 4- and 5-year-olds from the hospital's employee daycare center, surrounded by TV cameras, bustling aides and tight security.  ""Did you like it?"" Bush asked after reading ""I Love You Little One,"" eliciting a chorus of ""yes"" from the children. ""Yeah, that was sweet.""  Bush also stopped in Council Bluffs, where she visited a public library. And she attended at a private Republican Party fund-raiser in Omaha, providing yet another sign of her more active political role. So far, the first lady has helped raise more than $5 million for President Bush's re-election drive.  Unlike four years ago, Laura Bush plans to spend the next few months campaigning apart from the president. This weekend she will make a series of stops in New Hampshire and Boston.  ""I've been very busy and I'll continue to be really busy,"" said Bush, who expects a close race in Iowa and nationally.  ""It's tough. We'll be working very, very hard. As you remember, the last race was also close and evenly divided and I think that's just a fact of life right now in American politics,"" she said.  But the first lady had little to say about her husband's rivals after Democratic hopeful John Kerry tapped U.S. Sen. John Edwards to be his running mate Tuesday.  ""As you all might guess, I'm solidly for Bush-Cheney,"" she said.  Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, is taking a high-profile role in her husband's White House bid. Heinz Kerry campaigned in Iowa a week ago.  And although there will be presidential and vice presidential debates, Bush rejected the idea of a first lady debate.  ""I just don't think that's actually necessary,"" Bush said.  Bush said she already is engaged in a national duel with Heinz Kerry over cookie recipes, with the first lady's oatmeal chocolate chunk cookie matched up against Heinz Kerry's pumpkin spice cookie recipe. Family Circle magazine readers will pick a winner."
2PN13G1,female,16,"Pioneer Press Bill Salisbury   Laura Bush would like to chat with Teresa Heinz Kerry.  The first lady thinks she and the wife of Demo-cratic nominee John Kerry have a lot in common.  ""I don't know her. I never have met her. But I have a lot of empathy for her,"" Bush said in an interview Tuesday after she spoke at a campaign rally at Gruber's Quilt Shop in Waite Park.  ""In a lot of ways she and I are in the same boat right now. We're the only two women in America who know what it's like for your husband to run for president in 2004.  ""I suspect that if we met each other, we'd probably have a lot to talk about,"" she added with a laugh.  Bush came to Waite Park to make a pitch for her husband to about 250 female small-business owners and political supporters who were handpicked by the Bush-Cheney campaign. She said her husband has ""created an economic environment where women entrepreneurs can succeed and small businesses can flourish and grow."" And he has a plan to keep the economy growing, she said.  Before she spoke, about a dozen businesswomen who support Kerry held a forum in neighboring St. Cloud to complain that President Bush has not done enough to hold down health-care costs for small businesses or provide an educated work force.  After her 18-minute speech, Laura Bush sat down to talk in her soft Texas drawl about how important Minnesota is in the presidential election, her growing role on the campaign trail and the side of the president the public doesn't see, as well as Heinz Kerry.  This was her second trip to Minnesota in less than two months, and it came on the heels of the president's visit to Mankato last Wednesday and Vice President Dick Cheney's stop in East Grand Forks on Friday.  ""Minnesota is really important to us,"" the first lady explained. ""We barely lost last time (in 2000), and we really want to win Minnesota.  ""We have a lot of friends here. We're obviously not taking any vote for granted, but we do have … a lot of volunteers who have signed up across the state.  ""I think you'll be seeing more of us,"" she said, adding that twin daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush are likely to make the next campaign swing through the state.  Their frequent visits are a sign that ""Minnesota's 10 electoral votes are very, very important to the Bush campaign,"" said Lilly Goren, chairwoman of the College of St. Catherine political science department.  Laura Bush is a popular figure who can be an effective surrogate with business and professional women, Goren said. A Gallup Poll last year showed she was the third most-admired woman by Americans after Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.  Two-thirds of Americans have a favorable impression of her, while only 12 percent view her unfavorably, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll taken last month.  Such opinions could help the president shrink the gender gap in Minnesota. A Pioneer Press-Minnesota Public Radio poll last month showed that although the race was a statistical dead heat — Kerry led Bush, 45 to 44 percent, among all voters — women preferred the Democratic candidate, 47 to 37 percent, while men favored Bush, 46 to 40 percent.  Her stop here was part of a two-day, six-state campaign trip, and she said she expects to step up her travels as the election nears. She started Tuesday with a morning rally in Grafton, Wis., and ended the day with a speech in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  ""I love events like this one today,"" she said. ""It's fun for me to get to see these very outstanding businesswomen across the United States who are making such a huge difference not only for their employees but also for their whole communities.""  Her speech was delayed by 30 minutes because she insisted on stopping her caravan so she could shake hands with about 150 people who showed up to greet her arrival at the St. Cloud airport. She also took time to tour the quilt shop with owner Sue Poser, who built the business that employs a staff of 23 in just six years. ""It's such a wonderful success story,"" the first lady said.  Poser, a political independent, said the event almost didn't happen. When a Bush-Cheney scheduler called to ask to hold the rally there, Poser said the woman who answered the phone told him, ""I'm sorry but we don't take solicitations,"" and hung up. Only when he called back and explained he wasn't asking for money did she let him talk to Poser, who said she was honored to host Bush's visit.  Wearing a wide smile through most of her remarks, the first lady appeared to enjoy the event. ""I actually really like it (campaigning),"" she said later. ""If you like to be with people, then it's a lot of fun.""  Because her husband ""ended up being a war president,"" she said, most Americans only see him when he's talking about very serious issues. As a result, they ""don't get to see the side of him that I see all the time,"" she said. ""So I don't know that they know that he's funny and fun and has a very sweet, soft side.""  On Tuesday, the first lady put a friendly face on the Bush-Cheney team that softened its serious image."
2PN13G1,female,16,"The New York Times  Randy Kennedy   In some ways, Laura Bush is the White House's stealth campaigner.  When her motorcade winds through the streets of Washington to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, it includes no limousine and sometimes it even stops at red lights. In fact, perhaps the only clue a passing driver may have that the first lady is inside one of the black sport utility vehicles is the team of Secret Service agents facing backward in an SUV near hers, staring vigilantly out an open back window.  On the road, meanwhile, her campaigning has generated far fewer headlines than that of her husband's other main surrogate, Vice President Dick Cheney.  But as she begins several weeks of solo barnstorming in states crucial for her husband's re-election, Laura Bush is becoming an increasingly visible and effective part of White House strategy, largely because she is seen as someone above the rough-and-tumble of the political fray.  In the last four months, she has been steadily raising her profile, projecting an image much more assertive and assured than she did during the 2000 campaign. She has joked with Jay Leno, made the morning news-show circuit and appeared in Internet campaign commercials. She has also proved to be a formidable fund-raiser, generating $10 million for the campaign this year while speaking at more than a dozen events from Maine to Missouri.  And less than three weeks from now, in what will undoubtedly be her most important public moment of the 2004 campaign, she will give one of the prime-time speeches at the Republican National Convention in New York. (Her every handshake, smile and speech on the campaign trail are being recorded for a videotape that will be shown as she is introduced at Madison Square Garden.)  Bush, 57, makes little secret that while she has no problem with public speaking, political campaigning is not one of her favorite pursuits. But ever since giving her first stump speech of the year, in Las Vegas in May, she has skillfully turned her lack of political polish to her advantage.  She reads from prepared remarks in the careful manner of the schoolteacher she used to be, rarely varying her tone or volume, even when the speech seems to call for doing so and her words are eliciting cheers.  But she often makes prolonged eye contact with individuals in the audience, and when she loses her place in the speech, which does not happen often, she smiles and forges ahead, sending a kind of tacit ""Y'all understand I'm not a politician"" message to her listeners. Then she often spends more time than her handlers would like shaking hands, posing for pictures and talking to supporters.  ""What she does up there is exude the love she has for her husband and the respect she has for him,"" said Bette Duncan, a co-owner of an electronics manufacturing company, who went to hear the first lady speak in Grafton, Wisconsin. ""And that's refreshing in politics. It's not all 'me, me, me.' Laura is just a great woman.""  In her busiest campaign swing so far - six states Monday and Tuesday - Bush's main target was women, who polls show do not support her husband in the same numbers as men.  She is clearly aware of her image as a first lady who has not been involved in policy making or political infighting, and - except for comments on Monday in support of the president's policy on stem cell research - she assiduously avoids contentious issues, never referring to her husband's opponent.  Instead, she delivered reliable applause lines this week to groups of women who own small businesses in Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota, reminding them that a woman, Condoleezza Rice, advised her husband on foreign policy and another, Margaret Spellings, advised him on domestic policy.  ""This means that in the White House, women are in charge of everything abroad and everything at home,"" she said, breaking into a smile, ""which sounds just about right to me.""  She also assures women that her husband, George W. Bush, feels strongly about equal opportunity.  ""And he has three strong women at home who won't let him forget it,"" she said of herself and their twin daughters.  Laura Bush's team carefully picks campaign stops that will bolster her wholesome, nonpolitician image, like a quilting shop in Minnesota. On Monday she made an unannounced stop at a flag store in North Toledo, hugging the owner, Howard Pinkley, and buying a $5.95 copy of a flag etiquette book called ""Honor Our Flag.""  She said that despite the spoken prenuptial agreement, often retold, in which her husband promised he would never force her to give a campaign speech, she had helped him campaign almost since the beginning."
2PN13G1,female,16,"The New York Times Marian Burros/Jim Rutenberg   Ever since voters began telling Teresa Heinz Kerry that they didn't think much of the pumpkin spice cookie recipe her office had submitted to Family Circle's presidential cookie bake-off, an aide said, Mrs. Heinz Kerry, the wife of the about-to-be Democratic nominee, has been thinking how she could tell America the truth: the recipe isn't hers.   In an interview on National Public Radio that was broadcast yesterday, the cookies came up in conversation and in the direct, unvarnished style that people have come to expect, Mrs. Heinz Kerry said: ""Somebody at my office gave that recipe out and, in fact, I think somebody really made it on purpose to give a nasty recipe. I never made pumpkin cookies; I don't like pumpkin spice cookies.""   Mrs. Heinz Kerry had originally submitted a recipe called Yummy Wonders, but, according to Family Circle, its test kitchen said the recipe did not work. When the magazine called her press office and asked if there had been a mistake, the press office sent the pumpkin cookie recipe without consulting her, said her press secretary, Marla Romash.   Christine Anderson, Mrs. Heinz Kerry's press secretary at the time the recipe was submitted but who now works elsewhere in the Kerry campaign, would not comment and referred all calls to Ms. Romash.  The recipe, and a Laura Bush recipe for oatmeal-chocolate chunk cookies, were published in the July issue of the magazine. Readers were asked to vote on their favorite. In the first bake-off, Hillary Rodham Clinton's cookies won over Barbara Bush's in 1992, and since then the winning cookie has foretold who would enter the White House.  Blame Mrs. Clinton for what has led to cookiegate. In a 1992 appearance on ""60 Minutes"" she defended her career as a lawyer by saying, ""I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas."" The contest was almost inevitable after that.   Mrs. Heinz Kerry is reputedly a good cook, and good cooks are usually upset when their names are associated with inferior recipes.  Ms. Romash, who when she is not working in politics runs a baking-catering business, agrees with her boss. ""If you tasted those cookies,"" she said, ""you'd think someone was trying to do you harm, too.""   Ms. Romash would not say why Mrs. Heinz Kerry would think an aide would want to harm her.   Not everyone agrees with Mrs. Heinz Kerry: in taste tests on television programs, tasters were evenly divided, said Susan Ungaro, editor in chief of Family Circle."
2PN13G1,female,16,"The New York Times Jim Rutenberg   It was exactly what many Democrats had dreaded: Teresa Heinz Kerry, the candidate's wife, running off the carefully laid rails at the Democratic National Convention here.  On Monday, prevailing images on cable news were not of Senator John Kerry throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park the night before, but those of his wife laying into the editor of a conservative newspaper and telling him to ""shove it"" before a horde of other journalists. As Mr. Kerry and his aides began what they have billed as a four-day showcase for the candidate's ""positive vision for America,"" they were repeatedly forced to explain his wife's comment.   Then, Mrs. Heinz Kerry took on a staff member. In an interview to be aired Tuesday on NPR, she disowned a pumpkin spice cookie recipe that had been submitted to Family Circle magazine for a bakeoff between her and Laura Bush. ""Someone had made it on purpose to give a nasty recipe,"" she said.  All in all, it was not an atypical 24 hours for Mrs. Heinz Kerry, the billionaire philanthropist who has shown a flair for saying whatever she thinks, whenever she thinks it, in a way that is wholly foreign to the political operatives overrunning this city this week.   When Mrs. Heinz Kerry addresses the convention here Tuesday night, it will be the culmination of a months- long journey for her and her husband's campaign staff in which a ""let Teresa be Teresa"" philosophy has come to prevail. In part, aides say, that is because she is among the best promoters of her husband, but also because there is no other choice.   Mrs. Heinz Kerry has had a net positive effect on the campaign, infusing it with some welcome spontaneity and excitement, current and former campaign aides say. But it has not come without some jostling for her husband and his staff members, who have learned over the course of several hard months to deal with her unpredictability.  Some campaign staff members had misgivings about Mrs. Heinz Kerry's potential effect on the campaign from nearly the beginning, for several reasons.  Born of Portuguese parents in Mozambique, educated in Switzerland and South Africa, her accent - best described as pan-European with a hint of Africa - was not considered a draw for the crucial voting bloc Howard Dean coined ""the guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.""  Then, there was her fortune, now estimated at $1 billion - an enviable back-up campaign kitty that, some feared, could potentially give Mr. Kerry the air of a hanger-on nonetheless.   But, most worrisome of all, there was her personal style.   ""There was a feeling early on,"" said a former staff member, ""that she was a liability: The fact that she was from another country, the fact that she wasn't programmed, wouldn't stay on script.""  Another former adviser to Mr. Kerry added: ""The conundrum was, 'Do you just let her go out there and do her thing or not?' The other choice was to try to jump in and really manage it.""  Mr. Kerry, during a telephone interview in June, played down nervousness about his wife among his staff. ""I think this, quote, nervousness, has been overexaggerated, and rumored,"" he said, ""and perhaps someone in the campaign had that sense or something, but it's never been a campaign view, or my view.""  But Mrs. Heinz Kerry more readily acknowledged it during an interview at the campaign's headquarters in June.  ""I tell you something: I would say probably any campaign in this town would have had a hard time figuring out how to use me because they were not used to having someone with my clout, or baggage, or whatever - or experience,"" she said. She continued, nearly stream of consciousness-like, ""Do you feel that you're being railroaded, or do you feel that you're being absorbed - do you feel inferior, or do you feel superior? What is it you feel? So I think any campaign would have had to adjust to that, because most spouses that have come in have kind of fitted into whatever it is.""  She added, ""I can't be packaged, I won't be packaged. If I have to be packaged, then I can't be part of the process.""  She made that clear early on, when, in early 2003 a new public relations handler assigned to her submitted a memorandum detailing how she could take better care with her makeup and hair before television appearances.  Mrs. Heinz Kerry rejected the advice angrily, offended by what she saw as an effort to turn her into someone she was not, several people familiar with the incident said.  That was not the first time Mr. Kerry's campaign ran afoul of his wife, especially when it was under the management of Jim Jordan, who was fired in November.   Several former and current staff members said Mrs. Heinz Kerry was eager to get out and speak on behalf of the campaign and felt as if Mr. Jordan did not do enough to use her on the stump or in the news media. Mr. Jordan's supporters and detractors agree that if he had had a better relationship with Mrs. Heinz Kerry he may have survived, or, at least, survived longer, in his job.  Mrs. Heinz Kerry was reluctant to comment too much on her view of Mr. Jordan, at one point saying flatly, ""I don't know Jim Jordan very much at all.''   Mr. Jordan's successor, Mary Beth Cahill, certainly made her available to the news media and on the stump far more often, especially this past spring.  She sat for a prime-time, one-on-one interview with Barbara Walters and was the willing subject of cover articles in Newsweek and People and of a CBS Evening News profile.  ""She is exactly what she seems to be, she is her husband's best asset,'' Ms. Cahill said during a breakfast with reporters held by The Christian Science Monitor here on Monday. ""The way that she talks about him is one of the strongest views into him - his character - that it's possible to give, and we think that she's great.""  People at the campaign said they became more comfortable with Mrs. Heinz Kerry as they saw her success on the speaking circuit, where she mixes deep policy knowledge on environmental and health care issues - honed as the head of the Heinz family endowments - with a casual speaking style.  After the spring, aides said they were pleased with her discipline at staying on message. ""She's been disciplined and smart,'' Mr. Jordan, who would not otherwise comment on his relationship with her, said in early July. ""Her press has been great, and she's been an altogether terrific asset.''  To be sure, Mrs. Heinz Kerry can connect especially well with women, even those who would be able to provide two week's worth of groceries for their families at the cost of a pair of Mrs. Heinz Kerry's Chanel shoes. At a meeting with mostly poor community leaders on the North Campus of Miami-Dade Community College in late June, she at once delighted the women-only crowd and made herself wholly relatable by saying, ""At the end of the day, no one asks a woman, 'Do you need a neck rub? Do you need a drink, honey?' '' Her off-the-cuff, politically incorrect sense of humor, which has gotten her into trouble in the national news media, can also get real laughs, as it did at another recent women's group meeting in Orlando, when she said of China, ""Of course, they have more people than ants there.''  Her interaction with the conservative writer occurred after she addressed the Democratic delegation from Pennsylvania, where she maintains her residence. Mrs. Heinz Kerry had told the audience, ""We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics.'' After the speech, the editorial page editor of The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Colin McNickle, asked Mrs. Heinz Kerry what she meant by ""un-American,'' prompting Mrs. Heinz Kerry to argue that she had never used the term and eventually saying angrily, ""You said something I didn't say. Now shove it.""  The line did not go over well with some delegates here. ""I think it could hurt her,'' The Associated Press quoted a delegate from Memphis, Lexie Carter, as saying. ""I'm not sure how it will play but I'm coming down on the side of 'it's O.K., but let's cool it - keep a level head, girl.' ''  Mr. Kerry's campaign aides, by now accustomed to finessing his wife's more lively moments, tried to use them to their advantage. And they and their surrogates said she was merely venting at a conservative newspaper that has been critical of her for years. It is owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, a prominent supporter of the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups.  ""She was approached by a conservative local rag that over the years has consistently misrepresented her and her family,'' said Debra DeShong, a campaign spokeswoman. ""And she's always going to stand up for herself when she feels like someone misrepresenting the truth.''   Senator Hillary Clinton, no stranger to conservative media as a candidate's wife, went one better: ""A lot of Americans are going to say, 'Good for you, you go, girl,' and that's certainly how I feel about it.''  Speaking in Florida, Mr. Kerry said, ""I think my wife speaks her mind appropriately.''  Either way, the incident renewed questions about whether she would continue to be the free campaign spirit she has been so far. During the interview in June, Mr. Kerry had been emphatic that she would not be reined in. ""The folks in our campaign are thrilled with what she's doing,"" he said. ""They're going to let Kerry be Kerry and let Teresa be Teresa, and that's the way we're campaigning, and they don't have any choice in the matter. How's that?''"
2PN13G1,female,16,"Independent News Rupert Cornwell    The list included Howard Dean, once Mr Kerry's fiercest rival for the nomination and the man who electrified audiences on the campaign trail last year. There was the star catch from the enemy, Ron Reagan Jr, the son of the brightest icon of modern Republicanism. There was the old liberal lion Ted Kennedy, and Barack Obama, the neoliberal lion of the Democrats' future. But this second evening of the Democratic convention belonged to Teresa Heinz Kerry.  The candidate's wife was appearing at a watershed in the campaign, 48 hours before the acceptance speech that could make or break John Kerry's White House bid - and at a time when George Bush seems to be regaining ground.  After weeks of being battered by Iraq and then the announcement of John Edwards as Mr Kerry's running mate, the President led his rival by 48 to 46 per cent in a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, reversing a trend of several weeks. Above all though, Mrs Kerry represented something absent this week, a frisson of unpredictability and a breath of controversy.  In fact, the controversy has already begun. Hours after telling a reporter from the conservative-leaning Pittsburgh Tribune-Review to ""shove it"", the equally conservative Boston Herald breathlessly unearthed a 1975 book about political marriages yesterday.  According to the book, Teresa, who was then married to the late Republican senator John Heinz, once declared that Edward Kennedy - now a close political ally of her husband - was a ""perfect bastard"" if he was maintaining his marriage to his former wife Joan merely to avoid upsetting the Catholic vote.  The Herald also dug up some remarks she made in 1976 to the effect that the Democratic party machine was ""putrid"". Yesterday, the Kennedy camp laughed off the fuss. But the episode only underlines how the extraordinary career of Mrs Kerry (who only formally left the Republican party in early 2003) will provide material galore for the Bush/Cheney campaign's muck-raking Opposition Research Department. But will they choose to use it, and if so, how?  For Republican campaign strategists, those are tricky decisions. Elections are not won and lost by first ladies, and attacking a potential one may be seen as unfair. None the less, first ladies are part of an overall presidential package. If voters can be discreetly made to feel uncomfortable with Mrs Kerry, that may be bad news for her husband in an election campaign as close as this one.  By accident or design, each presidential spouse seems a reaction to the last. The homely Barbara Bush with her twinsets and pearls was the antithesis of the Hollywood-tinged, fiercely protective Nancy Reagan. Then came the strong-minded, smart career woman Hillary Clinton. (""Heck, if you don't like him, don't vote for him,"" she told a TV interviewer in 1992, when questioned about her husband's alleged infidelities.)  Next up was Laura Bush, the opposite of Hillary. This Mrs Bush is a former librarian and schoolteacher, an unobtrusive home maker whose political contributions extend no further than a dewy-eyed gaze at her husband and uncontroversial speeches about her pet subject of education.  Now there is the very real possibility the next First Lady of the United States will be a daughter of Portuguese colonialists in Africa, owner of five homes and fluent in as many languages.  Mrs Kerry speaks her mind in breach of all the norms of political wife-speak. Her $500m-plus fortune renders her beholden to no one. Indeed, she has made clear that if her husband reaches the White House, she will continue her philanthropic and pro-environmental work. In her White House days at least, Hillary Clinton was a shrinking violet by comparison.  In terms of sheer exoticism, even Jackie Kennedy, with her cosmopolitan background, does not come close to Mrs Kerry. With her trace of an accent, her designer clothes and slightly world-weary manner, she has been described as resembling a famous European actress of a certain age.  If you live in Kansas (or even in large parts of Massachusetts) she must come across as a very foreign creature indeed. Almost certainly, the Republicans will seek to use that perception to reinforce their contention about her husband, that John Kerry is out of the American mainstream.  Last night, however, the unscripted, off-the-cuff Mrs Kerry was deliberately packed away, as she prepared to deliver her prime-time address to this most scripted of conventions. ""Normally I don't have a text,"" she told an interviewer yesterday, ""but this time I've been working on the speech for weeks."" It would be personal, and she hoped, ""an inspiration"" to those who hear it.  But did she regret her words to the Pittsburgh reporter? ""No, no one likes being trapped or misrepresented."""
2PN13G1,female,16,"BBC News Online  Clare Murphy    There was a similar dispute over Teresa Heinz Kerry's request that a reporter ""shove it"" after he questioned her on the use of the word un-American at the Democratic convention.   Democratic aides say her outspokenness is an asset rather than a hindrance. They hope she will appeal to assertive women - much as Hillary Clinton did and still does.   And indeed, while Mrs Kerry may not be conventional, she does not appear to hold any passionate, outlandish beliefs that could embarrass her party.   Although she was formerly a Republican, her detractors have had to go back nearly 30 years to find a book in which she called Democratic politics ""putrid"".   Laura Bush - who enjoys popularity ratings her husband may well envy - has taken on a more glamorous and outspoken persona for this campaign - her husband's last.   Although she still clearly prefers to talk about education and reading - her personal projects - she has also started providing justifications for the war in Iraq.   Americans have long admired the apparently intimate and loving relationship she has with the president, who, for his part, has been very public about his love for his wife.   But do popular spouses and children translate into votes?   The pervading wisdom is no, but with the few undecided voters so crucial in what is a neck-and-neck race - this year the family could have more than sentimental value."

I think we're ready now, but I will wait. I'll wait forever I guess...I want his child. Nobody elses.   Im leaving...I keep running out of things to say."
NDNC09H,female,15,"I just read the rest of your posts, and they make me sad. I told myself to stop reading them, but I couldnt. At the moment I feel empty inside, and I'm not really sure why. Oh well. Anyhow, I made a new friend today. I named him Henry. Henry the Lobster. Although, what happened was..my mean daddy killed him and his brothers. My family is so mean. My dad fucked up and he killed them even before puting them in the boiling water because he wasn't supposed to put them in water he was supposed to freeze them. Oops. Oh well..Poor Henry. I'm going to miss you little buddy:-P. Okay, I'm pathetic...so ater my family ate Henry my sister brought me a pice of his leg and it's hanging on my wall. If I ever mention about my room starting to smell...maybe someone should remind me of it.   William and I never have anything to talk about on the computer. It sucks..we get on, and then we're in silence the whole rest of the time. I'm extremely tired and I want to go to bed right now, even though its only 7:45 or so. *blah*..today was a lazy day. All bill and I did was watch/play shit on NG's. I'm trying to talk my dad into letting me go to Warped Tour. I think that he's going to let me..hopefully.   It's really starting to upset me that I dont have any friends. I mean..Marrah is in Ohio, and her and I dont hang out anyway. Amber and I aren't talking and she's back being a stupif fucking retard with Brooke again, but..whatever..I dont really care I guess. I'm just feeling sorry for myself. My cousin came over, but that was just annoying and all she fucking did was want to take my cigarettes. So, I gave her some and she smoked them and she doesnt even inhale, which pissed me off because I have very few left. Yes, I've taken up smoking again..well, I have been for like 2 months or so..but..eh, I'm going to stop as soon as this pack is done..I hope.   Tomorrow my mom and I are going to start walking..4 days a week now. We're taking my dog and walking around Otsinango (?) Park...My mom wants to lose her stomach, so she says that if she does she's going to get her belly button pierced and she told me that I could get it done with her which is cool. I personally dont really like belly button piercings, but just getting it pierced will be fun. I pierced my nipple again the other day. It felt really good, and I want to do my other one..although, Its hard to get the rings in and I have to get better ones before I do it again.   Anyhow, I think Im going to go now...too much typing for only one post."
NDNC09H,female,15,"I'm back..and I say that with pride. My other blog sucks ass..and I dont write in it much. SO much shit is happening. I dont want to explain again, because I have so many times tonight not only to other people but to myself. I wrote this..   I cant have a feeling without being wrong my feelings mean shit and you tell me Im weak but when Im with you my head is strong I dont studder or stop for air when i speak give me one more lesson before you turn away Im finding it so hard for me not to cry I guess its okay if you leave me today I wont ever ask myself how and or why When will I see what ever it is that you teach I just push it away when it is negetive everything you say is one good long speach about how hard it is for you to live You give me my strength that I'll admit but I have to feel on my own when i can None of my problems mean shit and I'm left holding my own fucking hand.   Anyway..just like..basically I am extremely weak, and WIlliam thinks that I cant make decisions on my own..but I think it's really driving my crazy. How am I ever supposed to be myself if I cant make decisions. I dont want to anymore..I'm pretty much sick of talking. I always say I'll stop but I never do..I'm scared of holding shit inside..because I did my whole life. I pretty much changed and bill told me that I need to be able to speak my mind..but now when I do it's not ""my mind"" and I just say shit..and like, I dont know..shit is SOOO fucked up. I love Bill so much, but I'm having doubts. I'll never be good enough..when I say this bill thinks that I do it to make him feel bad but I really really dont. I have to go..I cant take this anymore..AHHH"
NDNC09H,female,15,"Welp, Lastnight I didnt get the picture to work for some reason. :(....but after I went to bed, I woke up this morning when my daddy came in and gave me coffee. I saw this on my computer...   It's The Aniversity of Integrity,   Relentless thoughts of Diversing Dreams,   Feeling the violence of the Ecstasy,   Hearing the Stretching of my Mind,   The Vaguest Fragrance of A vacant bruise,   The Suffered Rotting in the Narrow Noose,   Need Verification Of the Sharpest Pin,   and Your the cause of all this pain I'm in    Let Me Die,    I Pray To God,    I'll Beg,I did my time,    I've done my time,   All hope is lost,    All wishes Failed,   Nailed to the cross,    My face is pail    Fade to Black As The Poison Sinks,   Believe any thought that the hero thinks,   The Angel's Just a Black burned crow Abandoned,   His Halo's as Holy As My heart,   Crumbled Ink And Paper Murdered,   Charred and Scortched Shamelessly,   The Merit Is Not hard to find,   In the beautil torment in her eyes    Let Me Die,    I Pray To God,    I'll Beg,I did my time,    I've done my time,   All hope is lost,    All wishes Failed,   Nailed to the cross,    My face is pail   Bill wrote that, and it occured to me how truly amazing he is at writing lyrics. I mean I've read a lot of good lyrics and poems by people, but his are incredible. They're insane, and the worst part is..is it takes him NO TIME to write it. Sometimes people have to find words to rhyme with it and shit, but everything just comes to him. It's insane...I've heard him freestyle(rapping), and it's soooo insane. I dont think that anyone admires his talent as much as I do. Like, yeah people are like ""it's really good"" and shit...but I dont think that ANYONE understands the MIND that you have to have to write shit like that. Nobody KNOWS the mind that he has, and the shit that he thinks in his brain to come up with these kinds of lyrics. He is the most intelligent person I know, and I guess I forgot that for a long time until I woke up this morning, and after I read it..I got butterflies in my stomach. But anyway, I'll stop rambling on.  Ashley, I want us to hang out today. I think that Bill, you, and I should all go to the mall and hang out, but...I dont think that will ever happen. I wish that we could all hang out like every day. I'm hoping that when you get on you wont be doing anything today and you'll want to do something with me, but somehow Im doubting it. Of coarse, because I'm always thinking the worst..but, maybe the worst is the truth??  Anyway...It scares me. My dad comes in and wakes me up to give me coffee, and I'm naked. Like...he has SOOO many times, and I've always been covered but what happens if I'm not one time. Wouldn't that be a little weird? I dont know..sometimes I think about wearing clothes to bed, but I get uncomfortable and it's hard to sleep. I guess I'm just weird and wont put on clothes just in case. but eh...he's my dad its not like if he did see anything he'd get a hard on over it. (atleast lets hope not)...but oh well. -My sister and I have been getting along really really good lately. Yes, the one that I've punched and kicked and been grounded many times for hitting. :'(..I never meant to hurt her..I can't control myself sometimes. Which scares me, because I swear that if I had a gun or a knife in my hand and someone made me mad, I dont think that I'd think twice about killing them until after the fact. *sigh*..I think both Bill and I should start to help eachother on that, because some day the two of us are going to end up killing eachother.  Speaking of killing eachother, Bill has been having many many many dreams about killing me. (which is why he wrote those lyrics at the top)...Like, in his dreams, he shoots me...cuts my head off..stabs me...slices me up....and so on and so forth. He says that his dreams are so real to him, that when he wakes up..having me by his side seems like the real DREAM. I didnt really understand untill he explained to me. He asked me if I had to see someone kill him, what it would do to my mind. I said, I'd probably go insane afterwards. And like, he explained that Dream or not..he SEES me die. He FEELS my hair, and my blood when I am dead. He says that in his dream when he is holding my lifeless body in his arms it seems like its real. I guess that would kind of suck, especially if he's the one killing me. Oh yeah, and it's accidental by the way. I've been trying to interpret(?) his dreams..but I can't seem to figure them out.  When I was in 5th grade, Amber Pangburn and I went camping together. The two of us got bored so we decided to walk to the 'other' part of the camp. Like, where we knew nobody, and we'd never been there before. We were walking and we saw an open field surrounded by trees. Right in the middle there was a swing set with only two swings. Which was weird, because all the rest had like 6. We dedided that we'd swing on them for a while, until we were ready to go back. We were there for a while, and then these two boys rode up on their bikes and they were harrassing us. Asking us where we lived, How old we were...if we had any brothers or sisters and so on and so forth. Me, being the dumbass that I am started talking to them. Amber wouldnt talk, so I was like ""come on amber, talk""...but she wouldnt. I answered Ambers questions for her, because by that time I knew everything her being like a sister to me and all. (I know this is boring, but there's more to it) So anyway....I told these two guys (they were like 17 or 18) that Amber and I had to head back to our camp. They told us that they werent letting us leave. I said ""We have to go"" and I was like begging them to let us get off, but they refused. Then they started being dumbasses and being like ""what's the way out of here?"" and we told them, but they went the other way..and we didnt dare move because they werent that far away, and they came back and started circliong the swing set. Amber and I were freaking out by this time. Me being the older one was like ""amber its okay, calm down"" It being a campground and all, you would think that there were people around..but everyone was gone. So finally they left, thinking that they'd go the opposite way we did because they had a better chance of catching up to us since we were walking and they were riding bikes. They were almost to us when we had no choice but to run into the woods..Somehow Amber and I split up. I was screaming ""AMBER!! AMBER!! WHERE ARE YOU!"" but I couldnt see her. I had NO idea where the fuck I was going, and I figured neither did she...but I kept running. By this time, I'm sure the boys had stopped, and were just trying to scare us..but I kept running anyway. Somewhere, I did find Amber, and we were both crying. I hugged her so tight, and we went back to our camp. So that's my big amazing story that had no point..  Anyway...so after that I had a dream, and I never put it together until about a couple of days ago. I've had this dream before...and I never knew what the location was until then. Well, not the whole thing, just the swing set. I dont remember what was around us..but I remember that there were these two guys, and they were running around killing all of my friends. (this was the year that I split from all of my friends)..I didn't really care about any of them. But Amber and I were sitting on a swing set (yes...a swing set, which I never put together until a couple of days ago)...Amber and I were sitting on a swing set, and everyone was dead. Amber was scared as hell..and I was trying to comfort her and tell her that everything was going to be okay. All of a sudden...one of the guys (the other one dissappeared)...but, one of the guys came up and stabbed amber in the back while she was on the swing. Not only did he do that, but he slit her throat. I remember seeing Ambers body fall forward onto the stone. I looked up at the person who did it..thinking that I had nothing to lose and that I was going to beat the shit out of the mother fucker. I remember reaching down and picking up a big rock, and I was about to throw it when I looked at the guys face and it wasn't a guy at all...It was me. I guess I figured that it was just a dream but after that is when I lost all of my friends. I was leaving them for guys and so on and so forthe. Maybe that was a sign or something...who knows, but..I know what Bill means now, because I saw Amber die...and when I woke up I cried. I cried for so long. I forgot about it though...and I'm pretty sure that a couple of days later Amber and I got in a huge fight, and she started becomming best friends with Marrah. That's when I lost her for good...and for the next few years, I had to fight for her to have me over instead of Marrah. Even then, Marrah came along.  I used to love Amber. I would have done anything for her...she was like an angel to me. I hate that word, but...I never wanted to lose her. No matter what happened, Amber was always there to help me get back up and start again. I still love her so much, I mean..I'll never ever stop loving her. I would have married that girl if I could have..just so that I knew she'd never leave me. Although, I decided to let her go, and get on with life. She still has growing up to do, and she doesnt know who she is..and that hurts me. I figure that if she misses me, she'll come back to me. (which we all know wont happen) I hope that she knows that I'd still do anything for her. I'd kill for her.  Anyhow..I'm rambling...and I hope that nobody actually stays to read this..because that was all just pretty much to myself. To remind myself that I do really care...I'm not just a heartless bitch. I'm so tired...but like........I can't sleep. Grr....Ashley, when you wake up IM me..and tell me what you're doing today. Maybe we can hang out or something..IF you want to.  I have to go call Bill and tell him not to ignore his dreams.  Bye bye"

KFXLXX0,male,35,"I've been a bit out of it this week. First, I started a new job on Monday. It took a few days to orient myself. It's quite unlike any place I've worked at. Essentially, I'm working at a small company (50 employees total), with only one full-time IT guy. They've brought a couple of consultants in (myself and another) to design and develop the system that runs their business. So far, it's not a lot of fun but it is interesting. I am looking forward to facing and defeating the challenges that are coming up, and there appear to be many.  Also, I had the double-whammy of being hit with allergies and a cold at the same time. I came home from work a couple of hours early Friday, and slept for four hours. Zonk! I'm better. It must have been a 24-hour cold that's going around. Or maybe it was SARS - we'll never know.  Of course, my wife kept feeling my forehead for a fever every 20 minutes while I was asleep. SARS has got her scared, since we are living in what appears to be one of the main outbreak cities. ""It's not SARS, honey."""
KFXLXX0,male,35,"There is an interesting piece in  urlLink The Globe and Mail  about the American steel tariffs recently ruled illegal by the WTO (and other protectionist moves the U.S. is taking these days):    A recent study by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics found that tariffs have probably saved 3,500 steel-industry jobs since they were imposed. But they have caused the elimination of between 12,000 and 43,000 jobs in steel-consuming businesses, such as the auto sector."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I stumbled across an article today that attempted to justify the high cost of life-saving medicines. ( urlLink Price controls can be lethal - The Washington Times )  ""The Canadian government requires that pharmaceutical companies sell drugs to them at very low cost, under the threat of taking away patent protection. The Canadians do not pay their full share of R&D costs - they are in effect parasites.""   In the article, the author asserts that price controls discourage innovation, which (in the long term) will lead to needless deaths. Of course, high prices lead to needless deaths in the short term, but the author prefers to claim the opposite.  Let's look at price controls using an example. Let's assume it costs $100 million dollars to discover a new drug and get it through FDA approval. How much profit does the drug company ""deserve"" on this amazing discovery?   In the investment world, 10% a year is considered a good rate of return. But let's be generous and give the drug companies a 30% rate of return. That's $30 million profit a year, for 20 years (until the patent runs out). $600 million total.  But patents work both ways -- they protect an investment in research, but also give you the right to charge as much as you want. What if you calculated the drug company was earning $100 million per year on that one drug? Or $500 million per year? Or $1 billion per year? Is that a fair rate of return - 100%, 500%, 1000%?  I believe governments have a responsibility to ensure both parties (the drug companies and the patients) are treated fairly in the marketplace. Yes, drug companies should make a reasonable rate of return, considering the financial risk they must take in research and development for drugs that may not work out. But patients also need to be protected, so that a legal monopolist is not allowed to gouge the consumers just because they are the only cure in town.  I once had a dream that I had discovered a cure for cancer. In my dream, I charged $1 million per patient to cure the disease, and earned $100 billion in one year. Only once the millionaires were cured, would I lower the price so that the middle classes could afford to be treated. Not that I wouldn't deserve a healthy reward for discovering a cure for cancer, but in real life, I hope the government would step in and force me to charge a reasonable price (say, $10,000) so that more lives can be spared."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I was thinking about something this morning on the subway, coming in to work:   Will Science ever be able to prove the existence or inexistence of God?   In 40 minutes of thinking about it, I could not think of a way. 10,000 years from now, when humans have reached beyond our own planet and perhaps even beyond our own galaxy, there will still be no way to prove God doesn't exist.  This line of thinking might have been triggered by a star trek episode, where Picard sets out to prove this chick who claims shes the devil (and is about to enslave a planet) is actually just a liar with advanced technology.  Picard's way of proving her wrong is that he was able to reproduce every ""trick"" she could perform, and eventually the enterprise found her ship and power source and she was defenseless.  Well, no such luck proving God is a con-man. But could we disprove his existence by replicating his tricks? Not so easy. If I could create a planet, that would be impressive. If I could create a new galaxy, I might be able to fool people into worshipping me. But who created me?  It's the old chicken and the egg scenario. Which came first? In reality, the chicken evolved slowly from some other animal, and so you can say neither came first. But who created us? Who created the universe as we know it? There can only be one answer.  Scientists have tracked the history of the universe back to when it was only 1 one-billionth of a second old (or something like that). They say they can't go back any further, because the laws of physics as we know them are not valid due to intense heat and pressure (millions of degrees celcius).  So, science can never prove the existence or inexistence of God. We will never know. If we live 10,000 years, we will still not know. If some entity shows up claiming to be God, and can create new planets and galaxies, we don't have the luxury that Picard had -- we can't replicate his tricks, so who are we to say he's not the real God?  Or (to go back to the star trek analogy) what's the difference between a ""Q"" and God? For humans, none."

1DIH5ZK,male,44,"Waning empires. Religious revivals. Incipient anarchy. A coming retreat into fortified cities. These are the Dark Age experiences that a world without a hyperpower might find itself reliving. The trouble is, of course, that this Dark Age would be an altogether more dangerous one than the one of the ninth century. For the world is roughly 25 times more populous, so that friction between the world's ""tribes"" is bound to be greater. Technology has transformed production; now societies depend not merely on freshwater and the harvest but also on supplies of mineral oil that are known to be finite. Technology has changed destruction, too: Now it is possible not just to sack a city, but to obliterate it.     Niall Ferguson imagines a world without American hegemony, in  urlLink  ""The End of Power""   in Monday's ""Wall Street Journal."" His conclusion? As if you couldn't guess from the reference to ""dark ages."" It's ugly.     The prospect of an apolar world should frighten us a great deal more than it frightened the heirs of Charlemagne. If the U.S. is to retreat from the role of global hegemon--its fragile self-belief dented by minor reversals--its critics must not pretend that they are ushering in a new era of multipolar harmony. The alternative to unpolarity may not be multipolarity at all. It may be a global vacuum of power. Be careful what you wish for."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"The other story I'm missing from Iraq is the reconstruction. When we invaded Iraq we said we'd do three things: overthrow Saddam, install a responsible government, and get the country back on its feet again after years of neglect.  Yet the third ""leg"" of that mission is utterly AWOL in the news coverage. The AP-IRAQ budget story that moves on the newswire every single day always is topped with another RPG attack on coalition forces, or another IED blast that kills another U.S. soldier. Then you get a few paragraphs on political squabbling. Those are newsworthy, yes. But I want the rest, too.  Thi is not a pleading for ""good news."" It can be bad -- such as the number of hours the power still isn't on in some places -- but, please, tell me about it. It's just as important as Abu Ghraib. You do read about blackouts, of course, but the articles never offer the context that tells you the power's out because some fuckwits rained mortars on the grid again. And they focus on Baghdad, not the rest of the country, where power is, I am told, much better than it ever was.  Every once in a great while you'll stumble across a statistic, buried deep in a story, about the number of schools that have been rebuilt in the past year, the number of people who have clean drinking water for the first time in their lives. It's usually just a set-up to a ""but"" clause lamenting the tragic problems we've caused, or how much the Iraqis hate us.  This is bias by neglect. But there's an active element in the bias, too. It gets more clear to me with each twist in the news cycle.  The media reaction to the 9-11 Commission preliminary reports last week was so over the top -- and so flat-out wrong -- that I can only think the editors wrote the headlines before they saw the facts of the story (don't laugh, I had a boss in West Chester who used to do that). Somehow the editors saw the words  ""no evidence that Saddam and al Qaida cooperated on attacks against the U.S.,""  and they read ""no connection between Saddam and al Qaida.""  On Thursday, the headline in the ""Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"" was,  Saddam, al-Qaida Not Linked. Sept. 11 Panel's Conclusion at Odds with Administration.  In the ""Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,"" the banner headline read,  9/11 Panel Debunks Saddam Link. Report: No Evidence of al-Qaida Ties.  Our headline was,  9-11 panel finds no al-Qaida-Saddam tie.   I had another huge knock-down drag-out with a co-worker yesterday over that. I had to haul him back to the archives and show him the story we ran later in the week in which even the ranking Democrat on the 9-11 commission said the media was way off the mark on this supposedly complete refutation of the administration by the panel. Here's Lee Hamilton's quote:   ""I must say I have trouble understanding the flack over this. The Vice President is saying, I think, that there were connections between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government. We don't disagree with that. What we have said is what the governor just said, we don't have any evidence of a cooperative, or a corroborative relationship between Saddam Hussein's government and these al Qaeda operatives with regard to the attacks on the United States. So it seems to me the sharp differences that the press has drawn, the media has drawn, are not that apparent to me.""   No, you probably didn't read that quote. Neither did my rival editor -- who happens to be the wire editor. He refused to believe me until I showed it to him. We buried that story on page A5, on top of the truss ads. I don't think one person in 100 who saw the banner headline on page 1 the day before read that corrective to it. And you know what the headline read, on the story that contained it? Not, ""Kean, Hamilton agree with Administration on Iraq,"" not ""9-11 panel spanks media."" It read  ""Bush defends Iraq-al-Qaida tie.""   Meanwhile, the preliminary report demolished the received wisdom from the intellectual left that Osama, as a religious purist, would never dirty his holy hands by dealing with a secular fascist like Saddam. On Thursday, where were all those Wise Men who had pooh-poohed the suggestion that Osama would deign to work with Saddam? Were they muttering mea culpas and slinking away? Did they publish articles saying, ""We didn't know jack about al Qaida""? No, the brazen fools had the audacity to stand right up there at the head of the pack, shouting, ""Bush was wrong about Osama!"""

The clerics who once were whipping these idiots into a suicidal frenzy are now having to issue Fatwas (holy decrees) admonishing the muj for extortion, rape, murder and kidnapping. It is unfortunate for the ""innocent people"" of Fallujah but the mujahadeen have betrayed themselves as the thugs that they are by brutalizing the civilians. There are, in fact, reports of rape, etc from inside the town.  While the muj are thugging away inside the town, we are about 1/2 mile away paying claims, entering into dialogue and contracting jobs. The citizens come outside the city for work and money and are treated like human beings. They go back inside and enter a lawless hell. In short, the muj have done more to show the people what hypocrites they are in a few short weeks than we could have hoped for in a year.   I should be appalled. I've been in journalism since 1983. My boss in West Chester taught me the only job we had, really, was to be indispensible. I have access to a dozen wire services and thousands of pictures every day. Yet when I want to know what's going on in Iraq, I read Zeyad, and Alaa and Muhammad and Omar. When I want to get into the lives of soldiers, I go milblogging.  This is not just blog-logic. I read two essays this week, the one from Jay Rosen, the head of NYU school of journalism, the other from Rod Dreher, an editorial writer at the Dallas Morning News. Both men frankly confessed that the media was ignoring major chunks of the Iraq story, and both mentioned Iraqi blogs as the place to go for it.  Are you hearing this? These aren't idle critics. They are pillars of the vaunted Amendment-protected American press, the Fourth Estate of the Free World, the cornerstone of democracy. Their industry that has poured billions of dollars, millions of miles of cable, and thousands of reporters into coverage of Iraq.  And the head of one of the four top journalism teaching institutions in the United States confesses, offhand, that when he wants to know what's going on in the mind and life of an average Iraqi, he logs on to the Internet and reads from a blog written by a dentist in Basra.  Rosen writes that the missing story is the rebuilding of Iraq. Along with the military fights and the political fights, this is one of the three ""legs"" of the Iraq story. He points out that the success or failure of this is one of the essential things Americans need to know to determine whether to re-elect Bush or not.  It could be either good news or bad news; the work could be going well or poorly, but we just don't know. The few facts that seep into converage lack context.  Dreher's piece from Dallas was a response to readers' charges that a biased media overlooked the ""good news,"" especially regarding the hearts-and-minds work that soldiers and Marines are doing in Iraq. That, too, is an undertold story, certainly, and fiercely frustrating to those of us who support the war and are tuned to it.  But I think what's really missing from our military coverage is not so much the good news, but the Ernie Pyle quality. I don't mean his ""doing my part"" presumption about the essential goodness of the soldiers or the unquestioned justness of the fight. I am convinced that the war on terror is as desperate and important as World War II, but I accept that many, probably most, Americans do not (if they did, we'd be rationing gas).  But when Pyle wrote a war story, he wrote about GIs. I've read hundreds of AP and Reuters stories in the past year about battles and skirmishes in Iraq. They quote enemy militia fighters. They quote U.S. generals in the Green Zone. They quote White House spokesmen in Washington.  Where are the G.I.s? The exact people Pyle put at the center of everything he wrote, the people most Americans are most interested in. The ones who performed splendidly, picking off the thugs without putting a scratch in the precious Shi'ite mosques. Where are they? They're invisible in these stories.  And so I go to the blogs of military men and women or their families. That's where I read the story of both the firefights and the soccer games with the local kids.  Indispensible? Well, the day someone finds a way to line your cat box with a blog, I think I better get out of newspapers."

We reserve our admonitions and our contempt and our attacks for the U.S., for Ronald Reagan and George W.

1DIH5ZK,male,44,"A Townhall piece by Dennis Prager, titled  urlLink  ""People are Good; the World Stinks""   (4/20/04). He rants a lot, and comes from a Christian perspective (which I don't), but when he hits it, he hits it:   If you love goodness and hate evil, this is a tough time to stay sane.   Israel has killed Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the Hamas terror leader, and almost every nation in the world and the nations' theoretical embodiment, the United Nations, have condemned Israel for doing so.  World leaders and the world organization have said almost nothing about Communist China's ongoing destruction of one of the world's oldest civilizations, Tibet. World leaders have said almost nothing about the Arab enslavement and genocide of non-Arab blacks in Sudan. But they convene world conferences to label Israel, one of the most humane and decent democracies on earth, a pariah.  In order to retain my sanity, I ask the reader's indulgence as I use this column to express personal thoughts.  I have contempt for ""the world."" I cherish and admire countless individuals, but I have contempt for ""the world"" and ""world opinion."" ""The world"" has never cared about evils inflicted on human beings. The Communist genocides meant nothing to humanity. The Holocaust meant nothing. With almost no exception, the mass atrocities since World War II have likewise absorbed humanity less than the Olympics or the Miss World Contest.  I have contempt for the United Nations. It is one of the great obstacles to goodness and decency on this planet. Its moral record -- outside of a few specialized agencies such as the World Health Organization -- is almost entirely supportive of evil and condemnatory of good. It is dominated by the most morally backward governments in the world -- those from the Arab and Muslim worlds, the Communists during their heyday and African despots. It appointed Libya, a despotic, primitive state, to head its Human Rights Commission, whose members include China, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Neither the United States nor Israel sits on the Commission.  I regard the European Union with similar revulsion. With little opposition, Europe murdered nearly every Jewish man, woman and child in its midst, and a half-century later provides cover for those in the Middle East who seek to do to the Middle East's Jews exactly what the Nazis did to the European Jews. For the European Union to condemn Israel's killing of a Hamas leader, when Hamas's avowed aim is another Jewish genocide, is so loathsome as to board the incredible. For Germany and France (who, unlike America, have almost never shed blood for the liberty of others) to do everything they can to undermine America's attempt to liberate Iraq is similarly repugnant."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"News, by definition, usually is bad news. Thousands of passenger jets ply the world's skies every day and touch down safely. You don't read about that in the newspaper. But when one doesn't, that's front-page news.  Yet journalism, to be valid, has to be more than just a daily reaction to splattered blood. Gene Roberts, the great managing editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, used to say, “Great stories don’t break, they ooze.”  The airliner crash is news because it breaks the normal course of things. In Iraq after the fall of Saddam, there is no normal course of things. But the inertia of journalism grinds on. Explosions and violence rule the coverage, in part because, by reflex, that's what journalists know how to do, know what to see. The violent stories punch their way to the top of every newscast. Flames, screams, mayhem, sometimes on a gruesome scale.  Yet it is equally true that every day in Iraq, many places enjoy peace and prosperity, have clean water and electricity and modern schools that they never had before. Souks bustle and wheat grows and children play. But that is not news. Or is it?  Because now ""bad news"" is itself the news story. People want to know if the Iraq experiment is working. Every day they open a newspaper or flick on the news, they see the graphic evidence that tells them it is not.  Tonight, my boss gave me a page to fill. He told me to put the ""Iraq military wrap"" on it. I knew exactly what he meant: The AP's Iraq story is all about skirmishes and car-bombs. It runs every day. So does at least one sidebar (US-Iraq or UN-Iraq) on the political squabbling.  Where's the ""reconstruction wrap?"" Where's the story on the rebuilding: how well it's going, or isn't; what is getting done, what is not getting done?  Roberts' dictum wasn't about good news or bad news. It was about great stories, real stories, history in the present tense.   urlLink  This editorial column,   by Rod Dreher, a writer for The Dallas Morning News, is behind a password wall, but it's excellent.  It's titled  Q: What's wrong with this picture? A: It's the only one like it we could find.   It's accompanied by an AP photo which bears the caption ""Marine Sgt. William Perry of Texarkana, Texas, passed out school supplies at the Anwal Elementary School in Kandari, Iraq, on May 11.""    Dreher opens by asking, ""Are the news media giving Americans an accurate picture of what's really going on in Iraq?""    Not according to the American people, who say they've seen too many photos of Abu Ghraib prison abuses. A CBS News poll released on May 24 revealed that 61 percent of those polled believe the news media are spending too much time on the Abu Ghraib story. This jibes with what some of us on the editorial board have been hearing more and more: that average Americans believe the news media are obsessed with bad news from Iraq and aren't paying enough attention to the good things going on there.   We decided to search photo wire service archives for the past month, looking for images of U.S. soldiers engaged in helping Iraqis instead of shooting at them. We were startled to discover that the photo accompanying this text was the only image of its kind that moved on the wires in recent weeks. This newspaper's photo department told me that if news photographers aren't shooting those pictures, it's because media back home aren't interested in those stories.    He goes on to make the right point: ""It is understandable that breaking news eats up the limited journalistic resources on the ground, but this means that Americans are not getting the complete story from their media.""  He then gives a list of the good news that ""oozes"" out of Iraq. Some of it -- much of it -- I've posted up here in other places: the more than 2,500 schools have been rebuilt or renovated, with 1,500 more scheduled to be completed by year's end (UNICEF report), the propaganda-free textbooks (no more ""Baba Saddam, we love you!""). Health-care spending 26 times what it was under Saddam, restoration of the marshlands, the national polls that show, according to the pollsters, ""a strikingly optimistic people, expressing growing interest in politics, broad rejection of political violence, rising trust in the Iraqi police and army and preference for an inclusive and democratic government.""  He rightly reminds his readers of the big picture, in a sentence which arguably could be a nut-graph in any story out of Iraq: ""Whatever mistakes American occupiers have made in Iraq –- and there have been many of them -– the fact remains that the mass murderer who ran Iraq into the ground was overthrown and is now in jail awaiting trial.""  An interesting aspect of his article is that he directs his readers to ""check out one of the increasingly popular Internet web logs from English-speaking Iraqis living in the country and sharing their reporting and perspectives."" He mentions some of the ones I have linked over on the righthand side of this page.  I'm not saying Dreher is copping out. I think he's pretty courageous to address this issue directly. But what does it say when someone representing a major media outlet in this country concedes that the rest of the Iraq story is missing, is going to remain missing, and refers his readers to average Iraqi citizens' Web logs? To me, that's a dereliction of the responsibility that we ought to feel in the First Amendment.  He also cites  urlLink  Jay Rosen's  PressThink.org    Web log. Rosen, head of New York University's journalism department, recently wrote his own  urlLink  analysis of the missing coverage from Iraq.    He takes a slightly different approach. He couches his critique not so much as good news weighed against bad news, but as noticing that a key piece of the information puzzle is missing.   What I'm missing from the news coverage I consume is not ""positive"" stories or the cheery news out of Iraq-- it's the re-building story in its totality, good, bad and middling. We need to sever that narrative...  what are we doing to re-build Iraq, what are the Iraqi's doing, how is it going, how can we tell?    His conclusion?   The news from Iraq is not too negative; it's too narrow. Bit by bit, and for reasons probably sound at the time, the press allowed its coverage from Iraq to develop as a military story, in which the ""security situation"" is the base line reality, and threats of violence -- or if not violence, tensions that could fracture the society -- overshadow other things going on. Second place in that narrative goes to the jockeying for political control and influence in the ""new"" Iraq, especially among the known factions.  Both are essential. Both are truth. But smart journalists could have recognized before the war began that these two stories, responsibly reported, would not be enough to inform Americans about what's going on in the country their own country invaded, promising to re-build it after the fall of Saddam. (A moral promise implicating all of us.) The re-building of Iraq is complicated, sprawling, thick with life -- and a difficult thing to inform us about, especially given the language barrier. It is far less dramatic than a bombing, way more elusive than a briefing.  The entire population of Iraq is a player in the re-building story, not just the political class or clergy. And to get the story requires close attention to changes in daily life -- normal life -- all around the country, including the repair of public infrastructure and the recovery of institutions that make normalcy possible. Then there's the story of bottom-up democracy, the building of which was promised to Iraq, and to the soliders who fought to free Iraq.    Rosen, too, is frustrated because, after tuning in to Iraq for a year, ""I learned something about the prosecution of the ongoing war, and a lot about the scandal in the military because of Abu Ghraib. I know a great deal about the politics of the war back in Washington, and among the Bush team. But I have almost no clear picture of daily life and the struggle for normalcy in Iraq after it fell to ruin under Saddam and during the war. Depite spot coverage here and there, including Iraqi-in-the-street stories, I don't know from my own press where the re-building effort actually stands.""  And he, too, reports that the source he turns to for this information is the Internet. Specifically, ""Iraqi blogs.""  The leader of one of the half-dozen top journalism schools in the United States of America gets his real news about Iraq from Zeyad, Alaa, Muhammad, Omar, a dentist, a housewife, people who write for free in their Web cafes in Basra and Baghdad. What about the rest of us?  Rosen looks to the upcoming election and quotes Peter Levine: ""A citizen's main responsibility is to decide whether the Bush Administration has done a good job so far, and to vote accordingly this November.""   The truth about Iraq after Saddam needed three legs to stand on, and it only got two: the military and security story, the jockeying for power and influence. There ought to have been, from the start, at least a partial preoccupation with re-building Iraq, the recovery of daily life, including the development of measures to chart progress, a task well within the reach of the American press.  On the whole that narrative went missing. It was not inevitable this would happen, but if it did happen, the omission might yet be corrected, or at the very least reflected on when the ombudsmen of the nation sit down and read their mail, or pen their Sunday columns. Did American journalists give the re-building and democracy-building story their best shot? And if they didn't, is there yet time to make a new judgment, put forward a better argument, and set things right in the news from Iraq?"

Alabaster Smith has arrived.  Hiro *zzzp*: he's tugging on the zipper of his pants, having just christened the entrance to Cowpunchers to express his disdain for the locked door. The closest bar in town, and they lock the doors. Lam-O. ""You got a cigarette, Penny?"" he asks, turning away from the offending establishment.  Alabaster Smith is just in time to catch that interesting little act as he wanders down the street. An eyebrow quirks.  Penny pats herself down. Jacket pockets first; outside, inside. Jeans. Breast pocket. Nothing. Then she digs around in that bag of hers. ""Lucky you,"" Penny tugs out a silver cigarette case; hard to miss what glitters on the outside - the initials VAV. Flips the case to Hiro and digs around for matches or something, finds something else instead. The way her hand slows, stops and tenses sends out the 'wrong' vibe ""The fu- I swear to god if that fucking monkey's been in my bag...""  Alabaster Smith seems, it might seem, to have been headed for Cowpunchers, but his attention is diverted by the unusual pair, who he studies in some brief detail.  Hiro pauses, cigarette case snapped open, fingers poised in mid-air. He gives Penny a sidelong look, shows teeth. He's the only one that seems to get a kick out of the chimpanzee. Looks away, then, to hide the expression - busines himself with fitting a cigarette between his lips, patting himself down for a lighter. Snap - there's one, flourescent orange bic. Spark - flash - inhale.  Penny stops, pulls her hand out - clean. ""You're so fucking sexy Piggy,"" walks up to him, takes the lit cig from his mouth while he stands there, electric in some way. His charisma goes a long way with her, it would seem. So right. Penny walks up to him, steals his smoke and fixes his pants and shirt for him. Buckles his belt. Puts a hand through his hair.  None of this is sisterly.  ""What'd they say when you went in?""  Alabaster Smith quirks an eyebrow again. ""Pardon me,"" he calls. ""Is the establishment closed, or are y'all just hanging out?"" He's got one of those Deep South accents you can scrape roadkill off the grill with.  ""Barn party. Livestock, no pants, bad scene."" Hiro directs this at Smith, over Penny's shoulder. Simultaneous response, like. His hair doesn't improve with Penny's ministrations - it's a lost cause. ""Heypennsygrabthefortyouttamybag,"" he mumbles, jerking a thumb over his shoulder. Hiro pages: record bag. No records. A forty ouncer and a zip-lock bag full of pills and powders.  Clearly Hiro's hands are useless. Or useful but only in a very specific manner for a very specific task. Penny circles him, cigarette burning down in her mouth, works the knot out of the twist-ties keeping the record bag closed on his back. She tugs and tugs. And tugs. Gets her hands down in it, small rattling, plasticky rustling noises slither down the uplifted glass fourty ounce-er. She keeps her hand in the bag, murmurs something into his ear.  Alabaster Smith watches the Hiro and Penny, expression amused yet mostly neutral. ""Ah see. A barn party. Hmm. Pity, Ah was hoping to save some souls and get a drink.""  ""Blue goes down, red goes up, yellow goes sideways."" Hiro reaches back - plucking the cigarette from between her fingers. Hits it, long and hard. Exhale around the words: ""The rest's self-explanatory."" He beams inexplicably at Alabaster - ashing his smoke in the gutter. ""You wanna hit the forty, preacher?"" Penny and Hiro are to the left of the door to Cowpunchers. Penny is smoking even though Hiro has his hand out, waiting for that cigarette to be returned. Her hands are otherwise occupied, a fourty in one and the other deep in his record bag. Her mouth couldn't be closer to his ear otherwise she'd burn him.  ""So I says to 'r, I says... Ma'... don' bother me now, man, I got my headgear on..."" To avoid having their conversation rained out by this abysmal weather, Pobble and Cash are sticking close to the sides of buildings. They approach in a conversational gate, Cash getting wet away from the protection of Pobble's super villain umbrella. He walks head down, watching his feet tromp through puddles in the production of micro tidal-waves. Cash continues the end of his antic dote trailing his fingers over the memory of his orthopedics aids.  Pobble strolls. Or rather, he would stroll were he not king pimpin' and combat booted. So its more of a strut. Well. It would be a strut if he weren't so obviously wasted. Lets call it swaggering. All S's, so lets call him shitfaced. Pupils agape, if they were mouths they would be the mouths of persons who had just seen the ghosts of their long dead parents, agape, all slack jawed. The irises have given up hope and gone into hiding. A cigarette dangles precariously from a thin lip as if stuck there with superglue. Another cigarette clings for dear life to his begloved silver tipped fingers. The umbrella is held waveringly, the black and white alternating segments twisting around through some wrist action chicanery.  Alabaster Smith smiles broadly at Hiro. ""That's a generous offer, Brother, but Ah shall pass for the moment. Get me started on preachin' and Ah might need it later.""  Hiro continues to drag on his imaginary cigarette - only, hey, now it's real - Penny's a thief and Hiro's smoking all her cigarettes. The attractive silver case drops into his pocket. Fresh flash of butane flame, flashed peace sign at the approaching duo. ""Oi, assholes,"" he greets.  Penny hasn't seen Pobble or Cash yet, isn't even aware that the cigarette's gone - must be holding her breath or something. She tugs him and the bag back into the uncovered light outside the door to the bar. ""Nnnsweet. I need.."" She palms something out of his bag, pockets it and lets go of the straps.  Under the thin awning, Penny sneezes. She puts the other hand back in her bag, digs.  Hang Loose. Loose indeed, since the gesticulation brings about the downfall of the tragically fated cigarette between Pobble's fingers. Appropriately the finger-formation is replaced with a request for another cigarette. Brain catches up with reality, and fingers find the substitute cigarette on the lips. It is removed, after a long last-cigarette-on-earth drag. The rain-pearled umbrella toting yeti flashes a most charming smile as he moves with his companion to stand near the dastardly duo outside Cowpunchers. ""Good evening, my droogan brothers. And sister."" As he says the latter, he eyes Penny with a strange look. It's about half a mile away from enviousness, and three quarters from lust. Pobble taps his nose, and the expression vanishes like Houdini. ""What transpires in the shadow of the house of slaughter?"" he asks dreamily.  ""Far out."" Cash throws some fingers in pairs to Hiro and Penny, accompanied by a complicating ghetto sign ending in a *snap*.   ""Whadda ya..."" The rest of this greeting is interrupted by something square that grabs Cash's attention as his steps have taken him into proximity. Soaked jeans cry when he bends down to pick up said shiny blue square. Flipping the lost BlockBuster's card in his hand, he eyes it as a prize and nods to himself. It ends up back in Pobble's chest, handed over to the space cadet. ""We should check into this."" He whispers back, then ""Whadda ya doin'.... man."" for the two loiterers and company.  Echo comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Echo has arrived. Echo steps through a void into the OOC Nexus. Echo has left.  Alabaster Smith watches the others, studying them with a pleasant, unchanging smile, choosing to remain silent for the moment.  So now Hiro has two cigarettes, and he doesn't even notice it. Reality can't be as muddled as his head: teeth bared in a grin, squeaking with grinding-away enamel. Happy birthday. Both smokes wedged between index and middle fingers of the same hand, burning against one another. He jerks backwards at Penny's insistent tugging, stumbles, nearly falls back. Doesn't seem to notice, aside from an untrusting look aimed at the treacherous ground--         --attention snaps up. Fixes, somewhere between Pobble and Cash.  ""Reckon them shitheels closed their cow club to us cattle rustlers, pardner,"" he drawls. Then, in more appropriate english: ""So we've taken our sex and drugs to the street, where it belongs."" Jon comes into the area from the west. Jon has arrived.  OOC> Jon waits for an idea of the scene before jumping in.  Hiro and Penny are on the doorstep of Cowpunchers. Hiro's smoking two tandem cigarettes: Penny's behind him, rooting through her bag. Pobble and Cash approach across a stretch of asphalt, Smith stands off to one side, scrutinizing. The vibe is manic, crazed, drug and drink fueled.  Penny was eyeing the corner of the building; specifically the darker, more sheltered area. Interrupted. Pobble. Penny moves sideways; away into some shadow only to be headlighted. There's a look - a fast gesture waved to them, to Cash and Pobble - not a good-bye. She seems to find her spine a minute later and calls to Pobble The Bear ""You just stay the fuck away from me,"" she points with her left hand ""you stay away,"" backing away, a tremor in her voice, hissing ""He said it wasn't /time/.. Hiro keep him away from me..""  It takes a while for the idea to leave his cranium, some grand plan for free porn rental using this found BluckBusters card. And true to this, Cash seems detached from this group for a few beats as this scheme works it's self out. The obvious catch being, BlockBusters doesn't carry porn.   ""Fuggin natzis... They don' even have porn, man."" Cash utters in disgust, turning back to his friends that brave this weather. Of course without a mainline view of the inner workings of this drunkard's dome, these words are meaningless and out of place. ""I'm still cookin' ya know. I got some mad kabob I put together.""  Pobble, standing with a giant black and white segmented golf umbrella to stave off the downpour, stands near Smith, Hiro and Penny. Eyes that are suggestive of some kind of drug induced haze channel surf, flicking between the pair and the static fuzz of no-person somewhere between them which is only visible to the befurred man. An approximation of outrage crawls onto his features, but it's definately a half-arsed effort by the muscles. The desired look is missed, and the expression that shows up in it's place is more like.. senile old man thrown into bath of jam. Penny's actions cause him to step back a few, raising his cigarette holding hand palm outwards. ""I haven't come for it. It's not time."" Somewhere in the London drawl there is a sympathetic tone of apology. A blue blockbuster card is dropped into a pocket. [Public] Eri has joined this channel. Huh?  (Type ""help"" for help.) [TIC] Penny (Thursday) says, ""Speaking of Steampunk, Wild Wild West is on TNT."" [TIC] Pig Boy (Saturday) says, ""nice""  Jon comes up the street with an umbrella over his head. The umbrella is black, and says 'Interzone Records' on it. He's walking at a good pace, a mostly smoked cigarette in hand. He pauses as he gets close to Cowpunchers and drops the cigarette butt on the soaked sidewalk, stubbing it out with his boot. He pulls a pack of Marlboro's from a pocket along with a black Zippo lighter. He removes a cigarette that's just a touch crumply from being in his pocket and straightens it out with his fingers. Once he's finished he lights the cigarette and puts the pack along with the lighter in his pocket. It takes a bit of work and time, but he gets it. Just his luck, that the minute he gets it all worked out, the rain stops. He mumbles under his breath as he exhales smoke. ""Fuckin' rain.""  Hiro looks away. Just like that - not his scene. Flicks something into his mouth, riposte off the thumb of his left hand, tips his head back for a long moment to catch some dirty rainwater - wash it down. Hard swallow of minimal liquid and something small'n knobbly. ""Lovely day, inn't?"" he asks Cash, after a moment: passing off his second, longer cigarette. It's a sad, soggy affair - barely burning with its twin.  It's not a particularly welcome offer, but Cash accepts it none the less. If not only to fulfill the symbology that weighs it, but to continue the pass eventually over to Pobble. Perhaps the unhappy and wet cigarette can snuggle up with a BlockBusters card and spoon a bit. ""Whatever. This place never stops with the rain. And I need some more red soda, fugger."" A search begins behind the denim flap of Cash's jacket and ends when he pulls out a flask to unscrew.  Penny discovers a ledge to lean on and positions herself where Pobble can't see her face. She disappears along the side of the building using Hiro as a shield. Her voice thins to a sometimes heard rant about time and it's meaning for another five minutes.  Then it's quiet. As the rain stops, there's a sound of something metal hitting the blacktop; and rainwater sluicing off the roof, tapping that metal in pairs of clinks. Other noises; interior distortions of conversation and music and one shuttle of gravel under a sliding foot.  Pobble takes the cigarette, it finding a home next to the cigarette he already has lit. Taking a puff on both at once he seems to look straight through Hiro at Penny for a moment before shrugging his rain laden fur clad shoulders and focusing his attention back on what blocks his perception of what he was seeing anyway. Umbrella spins, splaying out droplets everywhere and with a deft flick of the thumb it pops down as he angles it into some empty air. He sounds suddenly tired, swaying with the motion of demasting the rain deflector. ""They kicked us out? Christ. I've not even been inside yet and they kicked me out."" He'd sound angry if he diddn't sound so drug addled. ""This is, an outrage."" Sucking again on both of the cigarettes he twirls, swinging the brolly up under his arm like a baton. Looking about as if for a manager, he nearly spears Hiro with it's overly pointed end.  Jon puts his cigarette between his lips and puts his umbrella down. He exhales more smoke as he removes the cigarette from his lips. ""Fuckers in there comin' up with reasons to kick people out?"" He says it loud enough for anyone around to hear. He pushes his glasses up his nose. ""Sometimes I wonder why the fuck I bother walkin' my ass down here."" If he notices any hint of drugs in Pobble's voice, he makes no sign of it.  Hiro jerks back, recoils from Pobble's Penguinesque assault upon his person. He looks back and to the left (back, and to the left...): flicks the remainder of his cigarette off into the gutter. Buckle-down of the snaps on his record-bag. One last look between his partners in crime. Then, gone, not a word, retreating around the side of the bar - mumbled words, scuffle, straining noise, thump of meat against wall.  Alabaster Smith may be a preacherman, but so far he hasn't shown any signs of objecting to the presence of booze, tobacco, or other drugs. He just keeps to himself, watching, listening, keeping dry.  Enid comes into the area from the west. Enid has arrived.  From afar, Hiro tries to get you to your feet and against the wall, so you're not all sprawled out in the dust. Then books inexplicably.  ""I hope he's goin' ta make soda..."" Cash watches the techni-colored lab coat stalk off in silent retreat. Rain still dripping from the tip of his thrice broken nose. The presence of a preacher man settles, hunched outside an establishment of ill repute amongst scallywags. Long hair is parted, the better for Cash to see with. And above the fallen Penny and besides the wet fur man, the drunk drinks from his flask and smiles.   ""Hey man."" Cash offers to evangelic watcher.  ""Bastards."" says Pobble, turning to look towards the entrance to Cowpunchers. ""You're all a bunch of bastards."" He doesn't shout, and any trace of anger has dissapated. Mustered with the sucking of two cigarettes and expelled with carcinogens to the wind. An umbrella pokes from under his arm in a manner that still threatens to skewer the unwary as he turns to Cash, casting a perplexed look at Penny along the way. ""Oi reakon,"" he begins, but then turns to nearby Jon, ""Do this often do they?"" he asks, voice fading in the brief five word question from curious to apathetic run off. Hand swings in a wide arc, palm open, cigarettes dangling. Apparently he wants Cash's flask.  Alabaster Smith dips his head. ""Brother,"" he replies to Cash. God only knows what Smith's reasons for staying are. Maybe he just likes the ambience.  Everyone stands near Cowpunchers. Except Penny, who's slunk into a niche. Cash seems Drunk. Pobble looks fucked and sometimes agitated. Penny is hiding and rambling.  ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Enid................Punk rock Goldilocks.

""S'like anything else, man. Bunch of uptight bastards decides they wanna keep a certain class of folks out, they'll come up with any goddamn reason to do it. Doesn't even have to make sense."" He shrugs it off. ""I've been kicked out of my share of places cause people didn't like my look. Whatever that fuckin' means.""  A moan. A hand then. On the cornerpiece of the building. It must be Penny where Hiro propped her up before he ran off. No explanation. Nothing. Man left in a big hurry. From experience, some know that's never good. The hand, Penny's hand, keeps readjusting itself like she's clinging to the edge of the world.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 6:    4 3 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success.  Enid rounds the corner, swinging her motorcycle helmet in one hand and whistling. Oh, somebody's in high spirits. You'd have to be in high spirits to try to whistle out a melody from psytrance. She passes in front of Cowpuncher's just in time to hear Jon opine about The Man keeping him down, a complaint that she answers by bumping into him with her shoulder. ""You!"" she says. ""I don't like the look of you, Sickert. You're ugly an' you smell funny an' I wanna cigarette."" She's at least thoughtful enough not to help herself to contents of his pockets, instead she extends a hand and wait. Of course, as she's waiting the realization slowly dawns on her that they're not alone here, at night, in front of a nightclub. She gaze darts self-conciously from one side to another.  Long distance to Pobble: Penny is channeling god, talking to it. Penny's done a massive quantity of herion to achieve this calling-forth. I'd roll to sense were I you.  Pobble rolls 4 (4 dice) at a difficulty of 6:    5 5 2 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success.  Cash rolls 3  (3 dice) at a difficulty of 4:    2   Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  ""So like... what're you doin ova there, Penny."" Someone finally comes round to it, as Cash hands off his flask to be hit. Pobble gets a ripe whiff of the stuff, it's running down each side of the silvery flask and mixing with the rain water. The denim man steps over to where Penny makes sidewalk angels.   ""Get yer act together... man."" Cash tries to coach the girl back off the cement. ""Damn the Man. Next thing you know Music Town will take over."" Enid's arrival brings a wonky smile to Pobble's lips with a sideways nod. ""Awrighty."" he says, and then he twitches just a little. As if a bee had just stung him in the side. It's not pain however that flash-marks his features but.. a look of loss. It dissapears as quickly as it came. While still facing Jon and Enid, eyes swivel to look sideways towards Penny's hand. Harsh drags on the twin cigarettes, in the waiting-for-scentencing fashion. Arm with umbrella takes flask. He begins to turn, suddenly appearing confused.  Jon bumps forward a little as Enid shoulder blocks him. ""Well, I don't like your looks either bitch, and you dress funny."" All the same he pulls out his slightly crumpled pack of Marlboro's and black Zippo and hands them to Motorcycle Mama Enid. ""Here. I'm not gonna fuckin' light it for you."" He tries to look stern and offended, but he can't help it, a bit of a smile tugs at the corner of his eyes ""Where's your bike?"" He pokes her in the leg with his umbrella.  Enid loops her arm through the faceplate of the helmet so as to free up both hands for cigarette-lighting. She bends her head down and cups her hand around the Zippo, not that it needs protection from any stray breeze. ""'Round the corner,"" she says, tossing the lighter back to Jon. ""Good luck findin' parking out here on a club night."" As her tunnel vision expands to include the rest of the crowd in front of Cowpunchers, she smiles up at Pobble - the sort of sunny and beautific smile possessed only by children and happy drunks. It wavers in the face of Pobble's confusion, and Enid turns that expression on the white-suited Alabaster Smith. ""Reverard,"" she drawls, exhaling smoke. ""You've wandered a bit far from home, haven't you?""  Alabaster Smith smiles at Enid broadly, giving her the full attention of his personality. ""Sister,"" he declares, ""Ah am at home anywhere on God's green Earth. What brings you here?""  It pours out of her, an eerie language so gutteral at times it could be finnish and so sharp it may be japanese but it's definitely not english. The tone of the conversation Penny carries on seems to be a series of questions, one after another, sometimes interrupting herself. Tongue too full and heavy to round out the words properly. Penny stands up again with Cash acting as ballast, dry heaves and coughs. Too many pills. Or something.  With a last double drag, the twin cigarettes are flicked away bouncing off the wall to fizzle out on the rain drenched sidewalk. Pobble's look of confusion snaps away as he takes a swig from the flask in his hand, causing him to drop the umbrella which was held by his elbow. Itching palms it seems, now free fingers rub at the red gloves and looking back to Enid he says ""Sorry. Bear with me a second."" Tone has shifted to verging-on-sadness as he turns to head over to Penny, placing a supportive hand on her shoulder. Eyes find Cash, and he asks ""Whaddshe have?""  You whisper ""It isn't time yet but it keeps .. moving. Circulating. Like it's in the blood. . and it just wants to slip out."" to Cash.  [TIC] Pobble says, ""You saying anything understandable?"" [TIC] Penny (Thursday) says, ""Enochian"" [TIC] Pobble has Enochian 3!  Jon continues to draw on his cigarette. He shoots a glance at Smith as he talks to Enid. He adopts his best 'bad ass' posture, though he is far from bad ass in appearance. He doesn't make any aggressiv moves or anything, but he gets that big brother pose by Enid, protective. ""Who's your friend in the suit Nid?"" As Penny heaves and coughs and Pobble speaks, his attention turns there.  [TIC] Penny (Thursday) is asking where it came from, where it will return to, what it wants; those things we never worked out that night on the beach.  Enid leans against Jon, not necessarily because she has any difficulty standing, but because cramps her friend's attempts as bad-assittude. She taps ash off of the end of her cigarrette. ""Just takin' in the local color, Reverend. That's the Reverend Alabaster Smith, Sickert,"" she says, gesturing towards the man in the white suit. ""Here to bring salvation to the great unwashed masses. Say hello to the nice man. He ain't gonna bite,"" she teases, but her sunny mood is short-lived as Penny begins to dry heave and speak in tongue. ""Well. Shit."" She looks to Pobble for confirmation or reassurance or, well, something. ""She alright?""  Matt comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Matt has arrived. OOC> Matt says, ""whups.. not here. sorry."" Matt makes his way north. Matt has left.  ""I dunno man. Mebbe she's the one that drank the last of the -red- soda."" Helpful, much like a mailbox, Cash's center of gravity is low and provides Penny with rock in her trouble turbulent existence. Though the Cash ship sways over its anchor, but it's never uncontrolled in its drunken stupor. With an economy of movements, Penny is twirled and stood straight in an Aikido dance move.  Alabaster Smith grins toothily at Jon, and offers a hand. ""Evenin', Brother,"" he greets. ""As the lady says, Ah'm Alabaster Smith, a humble man of God here to do His works."" He glances to Penny, eyebrow arching, as if affronted that she might show him up. ""Ah do believe the Lord is sending us a sign.""  Jon kind of casually leans forward and shakes Smith's hand, his attention distracted to Penny now. ""Hi, I'm Jon Sickert."" He keeps watching Penny even as he brings his hand back, ""Red soda, booze, fuck man, she's on something. And I don't think it's friggin' Jesus."" He lets Enid lean against him with no problem as he drops his cigarette to the ground and stubs it out. ""I don't know what this would be a sign of, other than some people can't handle their shit.""  Alabaster's interjections bring a curious look from Pobble. Although the situation doesn't seem to be all that humorous, his lips twist into a sardonic smile. ""You have no idea."" he says. Passing Cash's flask back to it's rightful place - Cash's hand, the unobvious humour passes and he nods to Enid with a reassuring 'Trust me, I'm a Doctor' look about him. ""She'll be fine."" From a pocket, Pobble pulls a handful of something, picks one, deposits the rest back and presses whatever it is into Penny's hand. ""You'll be fine Pens."" he says again, pulling a half drained plastic water bottle from another oversized pocket and giving it to the woman.  Dennis comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Dennis has arrived. Zoe comes out of the Bucking Bronco's doors. Zoe has arrived.  Alabaster Smith smiles broadly at Jon. ""The Lord, He works in mysterious ways, which is another way of saying He doth maketh the weird shit to happen, and leaves us to interpret it.""  Penny is dry heaving, steadied by Cash near the doors to Cow Punchers. Pobble stands close by. Near the cluster stand Jon and Enid, Enid leaning on Jon. Alabaster smith stands against a wall near Jon and Enid.  Enid looks from Cash to Pobble and finally to the shakey Penny, eyes narrowing suspiciously. Somehow, she's less than reassured. ""You think so?"" she asks to Pobble, taking a drag on her cigarette as if she's been suddenly reminded of her own need for some medicine. The reverend's explanation is what finally calm her, and she lets out a sullen, ""You've got that right,"" in agreement.  Dennis slips out of the Cowpuncher, gives Zoe a nod of farewell, and walks on down the street. Dennis makes his way west. Dennis has left. Zoe goes home. Zoe has left.  A little baggie is still clutched in her hand, a clue. Penny doesn't quite go limp but she's not the same person that was just out for a beer with her homes Hiro. A little paler, well. A lot paler. Hardly a contrast with her wet white hair plastered to her head. She stares at Cash with dilated pupils and a slack, sad smile. ""He never goes completely,"" sounds rational. But she can't hold her head up and the second, the very second Pobble touches her, Penny tenses and buries her head on Cash's shoulder, like someone touched with a live wire.  Pobble's hand comes away from her hand, red and wet.  Examining her through the wet strands of his hair, Cash looks at the back of Penny's skull while she mans up to the doc's orders. ""She'll be cool, man."" Not that he sounds any more comforting in the matter now that he's retrieved his flask from sir Pobble. It's hit, his 30 proof breath travels and steams in the cold air. Penny's head resting on the swaying shoulder, Cash slowly infests her with the drunken swagger that snakes in his spine constantly. It's contagious, and now that she's allowed her weight to be placed atop of the squat Jew, unavoidable. ""Far out."" Cash digs it, he never goes completely. That'll be comforting in lonely times.  Jon watches the scene and nods idly at Smiths' words. ""I suppose. I never put much stock in God myself."" He notes the red on Pobble's hand. He doesn't say anything, but he does keep his gaze where the action's at. ""Where you been tonight? I ran by the store and you weren't there. I thought you were closing?"" That's it make light conversation. He feels for his cigarettes and lighter and doesn't find htem in his pocket. ""Gimme my smokes.""  Pobble lets out a long low sigh as he stares down at his fingers. Silver daubed with red. Red on white, red on red. For some reason or other, this turn of events doesn't seem to surpise him. Neither does the fact that Penny spasms when he touches her. The bloody finger smears something onto the bottle in his other hand and he holds this out to Penny as he takes a step back, reaching into his pocket and taking out another pair of cigarettes. He lights both, sucking in and speaking around them. He's starting to look tired.  [TIC] Penny (Thursday) says, ""this feels weird. this scene. drama. but maybe not in a good way."" [TIC] Pobble says, ""Enochian symbolic equivalent of 'Chill' written in blood on the water bottle. It does seem weird."" [TIC] Pobble says, ""I feel ya."" [TIC] Pobble says, ""I'm the one that usually does all the falling down in bloody heaps.""  Enid has returned the lighter, but she produces Jon's pack of Malboros from her jacket pocket and stuff them back into his. ""I had to go pick somethin' up for TC,"" she says, eyes downcast as she makes some attempt to keep from staring at the Penny-related commotion. ""An' now I need a beer,"" she says in the same sort of way that people usually say they need oxygen. ""You drinkin', Reverend?"" she asks, turning towards the door.  ""Funny you should put it that way,"" Alabaster comments to Jon, ""for He has much invested in you."" He shakes his head at Enid. ""Sadly, Ah fear my time right here is done, and Ah have to take care of some business.""  Penny drops the baggie, takes the bottle and slumps into Cash. In tune with his wobble, her eyes kinda roll up back into her head. She curls the bottle inward toward her chest and 'hnnns' humming her way back to functioning ""I cut .. myself. Didn't I. Shouldn't have touched ..me .. P-p-pobs I'm not ..ss-safe."" Her eyes roll over toward the other trio, says ""Oh.. shit,"" like she might cry.  Jon watches Smith and gives the man a vague smile before he turns back to Penny and that ensuing drama. ""Dude, there anything one of us can do to help? I mean, she ain't lookin' any better."" He gives an unsure look to Enid as if seeking her advice silently. ""I mean...shit like this can get bad quick sometimes.""  Enid's mouth forms a straight line. ""Night then, Reverend."" She catches Jon's look and gives him a barely perceptible shake of her head. ""C'mon."" She looks right past him at the bleeding girl. ""I think it's time for us to go inside.""  Shaking his head, Pobble turns back to Jon, Enid and Smith. Cigarettes waggle between his lips as he says ""She'll be fine. Honest."" He does sound quite certain of this as he reaches down and picks up his umbrella. ""Home's not far Pens. You can rest soon."" Straightening up as demanded, Pobble begins to lead his companions up the road with a tired smile to Enid, ""See you soon.."" A nod to John, ""Thanks guvna."" OOC> Penny says, ""Night guys ..uh ..sorry it got so weird. Blame it on the rain?"" OOC> Enid laughs. ""No problem."" OOC> Pobble says, ""Yeah, next time it'll be much worse. I mean, better.""  Jon nods to Pobble then looks back to Enid. ""Come on, I'll buy you a beer."" He heads toward the bar then. OOC> Jon laughs. ""Nah, thanks for the RP. Weird is okay :)"" Enid disappears with Jon into the club. Enid makes her way into the Cowpunchers."
IJ24L04,male,25,"Overdrives Alley - Main Bar(#6632RlJM)       This is the large, open main room of a rowdy biker bar. Near the entrance is a single bouncer who casually looks everyone over as they enter. On the far side of the room is a long, wooden bar with old, leather-covered bar stools in front of it. Behind the bar is a long mural of a naked woman, sprawled out on her side. The liquor selection here is fairly limited, but there's a wide selection of beers to choose from.      Around the room are wooden tables of varying sizes, surrounded by wooden bar chairs. Along the wall across from the bar are a few booths. In one corner, next to the bar, is a door marked 'Staff Only'. Opposite it, on the other side of the room, is a staircase leading up to a more private room. There are two old, battered pool tables to the right of the front door. They charge a loonie per play and have a limited selection of pool cues, none of which are in good condition. A juke-box sits next to a small dance floor that is rarely ever used for dancing.                               Places available                                                                NIGHTZONE                                        The street out front is visible through the only window in this room.  Contents: Akiko Tom Jesse Jake Amano Owen Luthor   Luthor finishes his final drink and stands, walking away from the bar. Luthor stands and leaves Long wooden bar.  Jesse looks back down the bar. ""So, is Cade okay?"" As though he hadn't just said that thing about the strapon. Back to whatever passes for dignity and composure to him. He yawns, rubs his face, grins faintly as the pills find their way through the brain/blood barrier. ""Who was the guy?""  Owen merely sighs at the turmoil, apparently unmoved by the incident at the door. Looking both sullen and bored, he summons the barkeep to settle his bill. Apparently calling it a night, the large man rises from the bar...vacating a valuable seat in the over-crowded bar.   Amano's mental wince manifests in a half-swallowed yelp, spinning 'round to confront her. ""Hey! That's not fair!"" Too little, to late... He backs off a few steps towards the bar. Akiko Hops back onto a seat and grabs her drink sipping it for a long moment before turning to view the bar scene and look to see if anything changed.  Jake looks at Jesse a bit, ""A few cuts, a few bruses... no idea who the guy was. the cops aren't saying anything on the matter. Except he apparently shot his own hand off. People today...""  Akiko Rolls her head in a streching manner looking extremly bored herself now as she looks about crossing her legs and letting the dangling leg bounce in time to music.  Tom continues to lean against the bar, not even looking up for 'shot his own hand off'; being a fair bit of a bore, actually, a really boring fellow. His jaw tenses... loosely untenses. He takes a break from looking thoughtful and intense - no doubt involved in formulating some kind of big creative breakthrough or whatever. But then again, maybe not. His eyes give him away: he can often be found brazenly gazing at Akiko, enjoying the view while he has it. In, you know, a purely... chaste. Anthropological-slash-artistic way. You know, like that. (pfft.)  Amano is all sulky and exausted after that random little oredeal, draping his arms upon the bar, laying his head there, and wondering over the freaks who rest nearby. He actually seems rather interested in the goings on, which is rather special of him. Rising from the bar, Owen makes his way through the rough crowd. Still, his size and foul demeanor grants him some personal space as he heads for the door. Brushing past the bouncer, he bids the man ""Good evening"" and disappears into the moon-lit night beyond. Penny drinks long, listening to the conversation but really more intent on those biker chicks. She's busy. Busy keeping them at arm's length with the occassional dirty look and brow lift. As if to tell them it's better on that side of the bar. That's not what she's here for, a bar fight. Penny doesn't have time for anything as low as fisticuffs with people; least of all people with helmet hair (she must only take on the pretty people, she looks like the kind of girl that may have been paid to mudwrestle.) No, a fight isn't her scene. No, the height of drama was between her and a feather and now? ""Oi, freebie over here"" a hand up wave-wave-waving backwards behind her at the bartender.  ""Well, serves him right."" Jesse shakes his head, tossing his artfully bobbed hair, and lights a new cigarette. ""You think that Daddy Frank cat had anything to do with it?""  Luthor heads out to the street. Luthor has left.  Jake thinks for a bit then comments, ""Who's Daddy Frank?"" Jesse shrugs again, returning to his slow, gloved scratching at the length of his arm. ""Dunno. His name came up in conversation a couple times. Thought he was the competition.""  Daisy comes in from the street. Daisy has arrived. Penny laughs, catching that ""What, you're saying there's only room in this town for one kinda cult head shop?"" Penny uh uhs like she knows everything and Jesse's just being paranoid. And still she's waiting for this elusive free beer.  Jake thinks for a long time, ""I never heard about him... competition you say... there's a posibility.""  Akiko Is a bit of a regular here she spots penny having a spot of trouble . She takes a pull of her drink draining it before looking over at tom with a smirk she slowly wets her lips with a pink tounge gives him an air kiss and moves over to where penny is "" Hey back off sluts she's my girl got it? "" a few of them seem to want to say something but back off from the tiny girl for some reason.  ""Well, I mean..."" Jesse just being paranoid is a little like the ocean just being wet. ""Like, we were talking about him the last time I was in there. And, I mean, it's not his real name, obviously, so he's already got an alias, and plus Cadence said what he wasn't really a Bokor, but Voodoo says he'll work for paper. So he's some vreiboter houngan, and the whole martyr complex thing just seems a little too pat, you know what I mean?""  His attention, then, snaps to Akiko. He looks her down, then up, then down again.  ""You. Bubblegum. Fuck thee off t'a nunn'ry. Past your bedtime, sweets.""  Amano arches a brow at their weird gossip, watching it all with sideway interest. When the freaky little lady with the unzipped pants saunters into the mix, he gapes openly. Woo. Crazy. He forces his mouth closed in a naughty grin and backs off to get a better, safer, view.  Jake nod and seems to think about what jesse said. Alot.  Tom read your description.  Daisy's all pomp and swagger, striding in long and straight, like a man. Aviator sunglasses are propped up amongst her bangs; a cigarette droops, angled, from the corner of her lips. High-fives are dispensed at random to assorted punks. Not a regular, but recognized.  Tom is leaning against the bar, his back to the room in general. A broad expanse of back exposed to numerous disenfranchised fringe types who no doubt would like to take a swing at any gentleman matching the description of 'The Man' - and Tom rather fits the bill nicely. Brave man. As Akiko, you know, tongue-wets and air-kisses, and et cetera, she has his full and complete attention. She carries it all the way over to Penny, where, in fact, his attention diverts. Because, he notes to himself, drinking the beer, while Penny looks different, much different, she is in fact, still who she is, and there is little denying... you know, who you are, especially when you know it - or seem to know it - as well as Penny. So, there she is, and there's Tom, sort of studying her, recognizing her instantly but still. Drawn to the sight of a familiar face by an the sight of unfamiliar flesh. God, verb as he is, as Buckminster Fuller identifies Him, does do his action in mysterious ways. Akiko Looks to jesse and flicks a finger at him "" Hey I didn't ask you besides I don't see you help her with the riftraft you balless dick "" she sighs "" Hey girl anybody else gives ya greif just say so I'll nail'em other then that have fun call me if you need help "" she then moves back to hop onto her seat.  Penny looks over at Jesse and down at the little asian chick. Literally - downward sloping of the nose, chin and maybe even adjusts her stance because it's one thing to look at him in heels and quite another to look at her - size differences being what they are.  The pitch of her voice changes entirely, turns out a different kind of molasses than the stickysweet lingering at the bottom of those glasses at the end of the night ""What he means to say is 'I'm with him'"" tipping a nod at Jesse in a stern kind of voice, with a certain kind of educated laughter involved for those in the know ""..y'know what I mean? You ah, have a nice night.."" And her tongue follows with a kind of clicking, drags on a cigarette and makes some gesture in the air at Daisy-low-on-the-radar.  Jesse is on his feet the moment the word 'balless' clear Akiko's lips. Drawing himself to his full height. Rolling out of his seat and flowing upright to, well, loom. Menace, threat, and the certain presence of jailhouse violence in the angles of his stance as he stares down at Akiko, his head listing slowly first one way and then the other, as though his assessment of her might change, given the rotation of his neck.  ""Stand up and say that again.""  Akiko Hops down from her seat and looks up at jesse her own blue eye's now ice "" Sure "" she looks up "" I said you didn't seem to be helping her with the other biker girls so I decided to do if for you "" she pauses "" Or perhaps it was the fact I said balles did i touch a nerve? "" .  Amano shrugs up his shoulders, baffled, his fingertips tap-taping on bartop like nervous spiders as he inches away and twist 'round to face them. Hell no, it ain't his place, He winces for the girl's sake, if she doesn't have the sense to do so herself.  Penny hangs back, huffing out another cloud of smoke saying ""Jesus he's really gonna blow a hole through somebody f'he don't get laid soon"" under her breath. Or maybe to Daisy. Depends on a body's unique perspective. Penny could be talking to herself entirely. So she hangs, kicks a boot onto the bar rung and knocks out another cigarette from a nowhere pocket for the other chick. ""Smoke'em if y'got 'em..""  And what she's doing, really, is bracing herself for impact.  Jake just watches for now.  Daisy screws herself down into a seat beside Penny, elbows backed up against the bartop. Lit cigarette transitions from lips to hand and lights the other one, which queues up behind the mostly unsmoked first one.  ""He still carryin' around that shiv?"", she asks nonchalantly, tapping the aviator glasses down over her eyes. ""Fucker don't know that's a parole violation?""  Hiro comes in from the street. Hiro has arrived.  And so this is it: what the evening has been inexorably gliding towards. From the moment he stepped in, Jesse's had a vague foreknowledge that it would come to this, to his gloved hand flexing and adjusting its grip on the neck of a beer bottle, to his squint as he reassesses the space between himself and his fill-the-blanks-in target. The night's had barfight written on it since the beginning, had had the story of the first punch determined even since before Jesse rolled out of bed. His jaw clenches. He looks at the bottle, looks at Akiko, and frowns for a moment, lost in some private reverie. Then blinks.  ""Oi, Piggy. Wotcha. You wanna get yer wick dipped? Gotta bluelight here."" Some people do not belong in biker bars.  	Hiro, however, posesses a certain fuckered countenance: a indefinite bearing that indicates that -- even if he doesn't belong here -- he personally feels utterly at home anywhere substances which damage neurons are sold.  As such: Hiro, in technicolor dreamcoat, lounge-slumping against the bar alongside Jesse. He rubs his fingertips against the base of his nose; sniffs once, nostrils flaring, scrub with the back of his hand. ""Oi, whatsit Jesse J. What's this then?"" Akiko Blinks "" What? do you speak English at all or ya dumb as well as balless ? "" she shakes her head looks at the bottle "" You need a bottle too ? big man arn't ya taking on a girl half your size and you need a weapon too , my my arn't we a standing example of macho might. "" She clicks her tounge stud on her teeth.  Jake finishes off his beer and puts down the empty glass. He rubs his face a bit and humms a little to himself.  ""It's like Batman,"" Daisy explains to either Penny or no one in particular. ""He got this idea beforehand that the fight's gonna go like this, that he's gonna kick some ass, and you can almost see the cue cards. Biff bam boom. Maybe he seen it in a dream, that's why he's gotta do this shit.""  She drags from one cigarette and then the other and exhales their intermingled smoke.  Jesse blinks again, looking back down to Akiko. ""You still here?"" He bares his snaggletoothed grin again. ""Ain't your momma worried?"" Jesse looks past her once more to Hiro and giggles. ""Shit, 'rho. You gotta help me, here. I think I'm gonna hit a girl."" Jake waves over to the bartender, ""Another beer."" And he moves a few seats down out of the way of the impending fight.  At the outbreak of what looks as though it may be violence - well, ok, it's got Tom's bourgeoise values all stirred up, and he's got his middle-class backbone up, which also makes his head dip right down at the suggestion of... a fight? That's what criminals do, isn't it? Well, anyway, it's not what Tom does, and -- more reasonably, with much less cowardice involved, Tom knows enough about crowds to know what fights do to them. It gets them, well, freed up from certain social inhibitions. It's why you so often see armies looting, raping, pillaging. You break one commandment, you might as well go for broke - and when one fight starts, you start to see wild eruptions of others. But Penny, no doubt either his guardian angel or maybe just looks settled - and so Tom doesn't go anywhere. Just yet. Tom finishes his Heineken - by prior arrangement, or happy accident, or perhaps the contrivance of the bartender on his behalf, another is brought to him, and promptly, as in just as he finishes his old one. Oh, kind fate! Happy fortune! Tom sips the new Heineken (perhaps his last) in his civilized fashion, and when he isn't sipping beer, he's got his mouth set into this purposeful, determined line. And, you know, he's sort of occasionally still checking out Akiko's unzipped pants, the tattoo around her tits, the whole thing. //.etro: Petruchio will be joining your location.  Penny mutters to Daisy, ""... no... looking,... does... in... direction. That... gesture... passingly... the... a... comraderie... them.... cigarette... lips,... the... stressing to her... impolite and obvious... you slice... down... smoke,... connection... and... starts to... she... motherfucker...""  When no one's looking, Penny does that sidelong thing in Tom's direction. That incredible and timeless gesture of the demimonde. It involves passingly good lighting, the tip of a bottle in a gesture of comraderie and eyelashes. Great huge sweeps of them. Her cigarette burns between her lips, an extension of the words ""We're /here/, Daze"" stressing to her but talking to Tom's stare, impolite and obvious ""it's a violation any way you slice it."" Quick fingers draw down the smoke, ashes, re-establishes connection once again. There and there. Penny starts to nod at Tom as she puts a hand on Daisy's arm ""So if he's Batman, who's that cool motherfucker over there.""  ""Why hit her when you can hit that,"" Hiro mumbles, coming up with a cheap GPC -- once, twice, thrice through the fingers, turning end over end -- and wedging it into one corner of his mouth. The cigarette vibrates at a low hum; pig-boy slaps at the bar for a book of matches, and brings them up for examination. His head tilts to one side; he stares at the little paper sticks. ""She looks like a slip'n slide. You got a light, man?"" Amano licks his lips and pushes away from the bar, weaving backwards among the tables until the back of a chair japs into his spine, and he takes the hint, takes a seat, and minds his business while he... browses.  And on down the line goes the cigarette, Daisy's second cigarette, to Hiro. It slips between the Asian kid's fingers without a word, and she turns back to Penny, chevrons of concern having already formed across her brow.  ""And shit,"" she says, perhaps too loudly. ""I ain't seen one of them since we left San Fran. Never shoot an honest cop, though, that's what I say.  Akiko Shrugs "" Swing or get out of my face but youw anna fight me show some back bone and fight with your fists not with some weapon "" she spits to the side "" Use a wepon I got nothing wrong with sending you to the hospital other wise this is a bit fo friendly sport I don't mind educating a Gaijin every once and a while "".  Jesse reels faintly, rolling his neck back as though with the force of Akiko's words. His brow furrows, his lips twitching as they sound Akiko's speech out, repeating it to himself, as his shoulders rise and fall, nodding with the rhythm of the phrases. Then he grins, and shakes his head no.  ""Nope. This is the part where you go home. And I get drunk."" He giggles again. ""I had the wrong movie for a sec there. Are you sure you're not up past your bedtime?""  The borrowed cherry dips, rises in the smoky atmosphere; Hiro cups a hand around the tip of his smoke, puffing to ignite via the coal. Then, the cigarette goes to his lips; travels to the same corner as it's twin, and both tilt upwards as he inhales. ""Don't be so grouchy baby,"" he advises. He doesn't even look over; he's staring silently across the bar; as if he were struck with a vision. ""You're clearly too sober f'r this kinda shindig. Clearly in need."" The bouncers slowly come walking over to the altercation in progress. Akiko Snorts "" Just as I though balless and dickless "" she shakes her head and turns towards the bar "" Go away you obviously don't have what it takes gaijin ."" she motions for a drink from the bartender.  You paged Petruchio with 'PHENOMENON: With something as simple as the right look at the right time, Penny can lower her target's confidence completely. It's schoolyard rules. Don't mess with the cool kids. (Mind 2) ACTION: She'll come off the bar about a step and get the look in over Jesse's shoulder, briefly, to unnerve the target. Just to check and see he's got things under control and casually move back toward the bar. THEORY: Acting as backup for people (not like bouncers or security but like solid friends with certain knowledge that doom lives in their fists) it is entirely possible to make them look better/more fearsome than they actually are.'  Petruchio pages: Ok... t#5, roll to me. //.etro: Penny rolls ""arete"" privately to Petruchio at diff 5.          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Petruchio pages: Is she nervious about you or about Jesse? You paged Petruchio with 'Jesse. Should he hit her, she'll have a really hard time getting up the nerve to a) get back up and b) hit him (raised diffs by +1 or number of succs? your call totally)'.  ""I..."" Jesse looks confused. He rubs his face, pinching his nose under his glasses. He takes a deep breath, and tries again. Nothing. He shakes his head. Looks to Hiro for support. I mean, you tell me. Guy standing, bottle in his hand, debating whether or not to break it on the side of some girl's head and she's walking away from him. She's walking away. But she's still talking. Jesse's flummoxed. This isn't the way it works. Something's gone very wrong.  If there is a bottle on the bar in Act One, it must be used on the girl with tape on her nipples by the end of Act Two. This violation of fundamental dramatic rules seems to vex Daisy: you can see the bloodlust seep out of her expression, and her interest return to the bar.   A flick of her fingers summons beer to her side. The bar's bad; the bartender's considerably better.  Igg and Ook, the bouncers, look from one person to the other and say in their best shakespearian terms, ""I'd der a problem?""  Jesse is pointing after Akiko and gaping, no comprehensible sound escaping his lips.  Hiro exchanges a wordless shrug with Jesse. ""You fucked it up,"" he offers, mildly. ""And it won't work -- that's the wrong kind of liqour, and her hair's the wrong color. Not to mention the bar name isn't even a meaningful anagram. Give it up."" Upwards look; ironically or hopefully or seriously or balefully - he flashes a peace sign. Penny looks both ways across the bar, at the bouncers. They see this sort of thing day in, day out - nothing new to them. It'll probably sort itself out. She kinda smiles at one and looks over Jesse's shoulder at Akiko. It's a look not often seen on her face, one so grim and self-assured. Determined. ""Go on, JT"" chiming accelerated taunts through the bottle. She doesn't touch him - that would be stupid, clearly - but lets the springs inside him tighten, moves back toward the bar.  Akiko Snorts and and hops off her stool walking for the exit "" Fuck this place and this shit, no problem I was talking to nothing. "" she complete ignores jesse he's beyond her notice now as she saunters towards the door.  Jake puts down his empty mug and heads out himself.  A chemical tang hangs in the air: one of Hiro's cigarettes is giving off a strange aroma, and he doesn't seem to notice. Both get plucked from his mouth in unison; he leans forward to go into assvision mode as Akiko strides off towards the exit.  Let's be honest: Tom is not at all concerned. This is how things operate in the realm of the rational. One guy pisses off one girl, harsh words are exchanged, someone almost gets hit in the mouth with a bottle, and fuck it, it all resolves itself, you know? No one gets hit in the mouth, no one bleeds out, no one dies. Especially not Tom. So Tom relaxes. Tom drinks his beer. Tom looks like a real load got taken off, like his shoulders are no longer stooped under the burden of extremely imminent violence done to his person. Tom lets his own spring come un-sprung, whatever pressing business he was deep in the contemplation of, completely the furthest thing from his mind, such as it is. He fetches a discreet little black box from the pocket of his coat and flips it open. Lifts out a tiny blue pill and discreetly swallows it with a gulp of beer. Before you can say 'the synergistic effect of alcohol with mind-altering psychotropic narcotics', he's got the pill box safe away in his jacket in the midst of all this chaos, and good for him, by god.  Jake slips through the crowd and heads out. Jake heads out to the street. Jake has left.  Amano shrinks down and slinks out of his seat, and since the bouncer's concern has drifted off elsewhere, he hopes his exit will warrent less attention than his enterance.  Amano heads out to the street. Amano has left. Sacha comes in from the street. Sacha has arrived. Akiko heads out to the street. Akiko has left.  Jesse slumps back onto his barstool, the narrative thread of his evening lost. He blinks sleepily and bares a wide yawn, propping his head up on one hand. ""Huh.""  Nonchalantly, Penny observes of the door hitting Akiko's ass on the way out ""Well that was ..fun."" A puss a sour turn, a drop in the corner of her mouth where there was the curbed mark of a grin just a moment ago. To her collegues she sighs, flicks a butt off to the side and gestures for another ""What the fuck are we /doing/ here?""  In the pocket, an open plastic bag. In the open plastic bag, an anonymous powder. Thumb goes in pocket, thumbnail (a rather unorthodox cokenail, but the only one she can't maneuver to bite down effectively) comes out with a loose payload of upper, and goes to Daisy's nose. She inhales sharply.   Entire maneuver takes, what, four seconds? Entire maneuver's hard to detect, but a sudden rush of induced paranoia causes her to turn back around and pay especial attention to the beer sitting in front of her.  ""This place's a buzzkill,"" agrees Hiro, freeing himself from the counter's gravitational pull with a carefully placed elbow. ""I'm gonna go watch the golden girls."" With that, Hiro begins to totter off towards the door.  Sacha walks in. It's been a loong time since he's been seen around here. Not since almost getting into another fight with some random person over shit and other shit. The tattooed man heads towards the bar nodding to the bartender looking for familiar faces.  Hiro heads out to the street. Hiro has left.  Yeah. Well. Whatever Tom was here for, well, either he got it (free beer) or it's gone (certain intangible sense of promise - the whole night lie out in front of him, like, to rudely paraphrase, some patient etherized upon a table)... and so, finishing his second beer, feeling the effects of the pill begin to radiate out, feeling a certain clarity of thought, a lack of distortion, an increase in mental fidelity... he's leaving crisp dollar bills on the bar, he's making sure he didn't leave his cell-phone out on the bar, he's performing, yup, all the stuff you generally do before you split.  Penny ohs! like there was something extremely important that was supposed to happen much, much earlier in the evening. ""Daze, listen hold up wait, wait"" tugging the girl back over to a table near the front. Or whatever. In between biker and bouncer glares, Penny reaches into the deep trench-coat-pocket and pulls out a folded newspaper clipping ""We should definitely do this.""  The flush that passes over Daisy's cheeks lights her acne scars in sharp relief, even underneath the too-much-makeup. The posture changes too: from shoulders-forward punk swagger to an aw-shucks slouch, eyes averted and expression pointedly unreadable.  ""I ain't what you'd call prime material for that,"" she says, ""on account of they'd have to do some pretty serious work on my scars.""  From the hand that crosses over to rub at the opposite forearm, it's apparent that it's not just the acne.  And that's that, isn't it? Affairs settled, et cetera, Tom makes for the door. Without objection, it should be noted - the bikers are as gracious letting him out as they were letting him in - that is to say, he has a sore spot on the /other/ side of his ribs, a pleasant little symmetry to contemplate as he eases out into the night and gratefully makes his way home. Penny snatches the paper back from Daisy, just looks at her and says in the most obvious tone ""We totally need the money. And I'm not going by myself. Fuck that, my luck I'd get raped and murdered. And I'm *so* not bringing Piggy. He'd .."" well whatever it is she says, it's funny and clever and totally girl-talk-private. ""Please come? You don't have to like.. do anything. Picture you're an agent,"" guiding Daisy out the door on the heels of Tom.  Once that's out of the picture, the swagger comes back, and Daisy's inscrutable expression stabilizes, finally, into a scowl. ""Yeah. Picture I'm seventeen feet tall and made of gold, 'cause that's way more believable.""  Rose White walks in, smiles, and heads over to the bar. Rose White sits down at Long wooden bar.  Tom tries not to let the door hit him on the ass, on his way out. Tom heads out to the street. Tom has left. Penny links arms with Daisy because they are going home together. Not ""together"" but ..together. Charging out the door. So long, farewell, Auf wiedersehn, good night.  ""Good. Because it's on my list of things to do before I die."""
IJ24L04,male,25,"***Okay. A scene with Penny, Tiziano and Compton. Just a improv home invasion dealie that turns in to a attempted double hommicide. Unfortunatly it broke down in to a 4 hour timestop due to some rather over-assumptive RP.I've left in the OOC banter although it breaks up the scene messily, I thnk it needs to be recorded what we went through and how simplistically Tiziano reasoned. We should steer clear of him in the future to avoid OOC messes like this. Oh, and lobbed bagels do not an enchantment make!***  A taxi pulls up and Compton gets out.  //.etro: It is 04:28 am, the dead of night, on Tuesday the 23. day of September, 2008.  Compton climbs out of his cab in front of the Holliady Inn. He looks like death warmed over, or that he slept in a dumpster for a few hours. _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________ Name          Sex Mode    Idle  Type  Short Description ______________________________________________________________________________  Charice        F   IC      1m   Pl    - Allen          M   IC      3m   Pl    - POLICE LINE - Wn   -       -    Obj   - Compton        M   IC      1s   Pl    Middle aged guy wearing a hawiian shirt. ______________________________________________________________________________   There is a police line around the Whiskey Saigon and a sign on the door that reads: ""CLOSED UNTIL FURTHUR NOTICE"".  Allen's hand falls back to his side as he gives Charice one more appraising look, lips still curled into an amused little grin. The two stand off down the sidewalk a bit from the Whiskey Saigon. ""Could be fun to try, but I'll pass on payin'."" he says, dark eyes glittering with amusement.  Charice reaches out to take Allen's left hand in her right one, cooing softly at him, ""Awww sugar, aren't I worth a bit of money. If I don't bring some cash home my pimp womps on my ass. You don't want that...do ya?"" smiling at the man and letting her duster fall to her elbows, showing much more then before.  As the cab pulls away, Compton staggers for a few feet towards the Hotel, before giving up and sitting on the curb, holding his head in his hands.  Allen chuckles softly, but doesn't resist his hand being taken. He lets that little ploy work, seemingly swayed a bit as he looks at the revealed skin. ""I doubt I'm the only one you'd find tonight."" he replies, grinning crookedly. ""Depends on if you'd rather have fun, or make a buck.""  Charice looks over her shoulder at Compton for a moment, as if debating something in her head. She looks back to Allen and rubs her finger over his hand gently, ""You're the first John tonight and probably for the rest of the night sugar. So either you pay or I go across the street and flirt with him."" motioning over at Compton.  Allen laughs at that, amused and following Charice's gaze towards Compton. ""Him? I doubt he'd keep you amused for ten minutes.."" he shakes his head almost sadly, ""But if you want to waste yer time on the attempt.."" he chuckles and flashes a toothy grin. ""Or you can take a chance... never know.""  Penny has arrived.  Allen is standing off to the side of the street maybe half a block from the Whiskey. Standing rather close to Charice and engaged in conversation with her it would seem, she holding one of his hands in hers.  Compton is sitting on the curb where the cab dropped him off out front of the Hotel. He's cradeling his head in his hands. Looking kind of rough, and from the smell, he's been sleeping in a dumpster.  Charice looks between Allen and Compton and says, ""I don't know, he's looking more and more attractive right now. And chances only get this whore a black eye and out fifty bucks...so you either pay me for my time or I move my ass elsewhere, sugar.""  Penny is walking because it's 5am and that's what she does. She walks and hums to herself and maybe there's a downbeat to her step. Could be she's plugged into something that makes her walk that way. Thump-chucka, thump thump-chucka. Penny's still bobbing her head when she steps on Compton's foot. Really it was an accident. ""Old man,"" over-doing it on the volume it's a kind of greeting.  Allen laughs, ""Allright, you've got a deal. Fifty, maybe a tip if you're a good girl."" his lips quirked in an impish little grin as he stands there before the taller woman. At least with that footwear, she's got a good two inches or more on him, though he doensn't seem to be aware of that. Except maybe for the fact that certain things are closer to eye level. Charice grins, ""I assure you good is too weak of a word for what I am. Come on and let me show you heaven. You wanna ride on the back of my bike?"" Tugging him along as she heads over to the Harley near Whiskey Saigon.  Compton flinches with the sudden outburst so close to his abused head. His mellon wobbles in its precarious pearch on his shoulders, and he looks up at the woman standing on his foot, ""Fuck... Penny."" he says after a second of recognition kicks in, ""Shhhhhh."" is all he can say in after thought.  Allen steps away from the wall, stepping up next to Charice. ""You sure that thing'll last the trip?"" he asks curiously, ""Sounded kinda iffy on the way in.""   Charice chuckles slightly, ""The guy I had fixing my bike for blow jobs ran off on me...don't worry though, she's reliable. Get us back to my pad in no time, long as you don't mind riding on the back. No one drives my hog."" Grabbing the helmet and offering it to him first. Slipping on her driving gloves and doing up hre duster.  Allen waves off the proffered helmet, not seeming to be overly concerned. ""Must not have been very good blowjobs then."" he says as he waits for her to mount the bike, then swings up on the back of the seat and drapes an arm around her waist.  ""Y'r.."" she starts but the old man says quiet so she's quiet. But not her headphones. They're still spouting a static thrum, a humming drum and she's smiling. Smiling so big and so wide, crouching down behind Compton, Penny makes a face. Quiet as a mouse.  Charice snorts at the man on the back of her bike, ""Naw, the guy was too whimpy for me. Didn't like being tied up."" Slipping her helmet on and reving up her bike before moving the kickstand, ""Let's haul ass!""  Penny mutters to Compton, ""Fucking... Did you see it?"" Penny mutters ""Fucking strange. Did you see it?""  ""Yeah, yeah of cource I saw it.... Saw what exactly."" Compton asks from his stupor.  Charice walks east along King to University. Charice has left. Allen walks east along King to University. Allen has left.  Penny says, ""She had fucking HORNS man. HORNS. S'fucked up, man."" Not that anything can really bother Penny. She rolls and it's all good ""So's your stink. S'up with that? You gone dumpster diving again?""  ""Right.... horns. yeah."" Compton continues in a daze. ""Dunno. Woke up in one. Was with Jes at the peelers... then..."" his voice dies off as his forehead krinkels up on concentration, which visibly pains him.       The sound of bumper cars fill the air of Toronto's central bar area. Dim light-gray pattern webs sullenly sway from the barely perceived buildings. If you listen closely you may hear carousel music from the location of Whiskey Saigon. Chaotic sounds of pinball machines ping from Dirk Gently's. Clicking noises like those of a railroad track are heard from the Power Bar. The familiar web covered vehicles crawl by. A reddish stain, like some sluggish invading flood, creeps across the ground of the area covering everything in its way. The pattern spiders appear to be avoiding coming anywhere near the spreading stain.       Penny scoots over on the curb and plants her ass there. The cold doesn't seem to hinder her bounce; hasn't come down yet. ""You didn't do that thing with him where you bet and he wins, did you.. y'know you shouldn't play with Jesse. He always wins."" Little contemplative, she stucks on the wires of her headphones, winds her fingers up in them ""Seriously. Never seen him miss a mark. So what happened?""  Compton grinds a hand in to one of his eyeballs. trying to abrasivly remote a bender cataract, ""Beats me. Last thing I remeber is going in to a booth with this sweet sweet ripper. Jes was talking to another girl about the meaning of reality I think. Dumbass.""  Compton plucks at his Don Ho classic and takes a wiff, instantly regretting it. ""Holy shit."" is all he can say.  Penny nngs and gets up a little off the curb, adjusts and resettles herself. You could say she's feeling sympathy. Or something. ""Really. They have the raw sweet and the dirty sweet, too. Met a few tonight. Consider another setting. The alley isn't suitable anymore. This isn't San Francisco.""  And then she adds ""You didn't get ripped off, did you.""  Compton's head is just bobbing in that non-comittal 'yeah I'm listening' kind of way. But the pained look on his face says he's trying hard to understand the words you are forcing in to his spongy brain. After a long second, his grey matter catches up to the back log, and he reacts to your question, reaching around to his ass and poking for his wallet. ""Yeah. Still got my stuff."" then pokes his left cheek a few times with his hand, ""Don't think it was the girl. I think someone suckered me... Bouncer. Yeah. Was the fucking bouncer!"" he says, his voice rising as the memorys get kicked out of the smoldering ash of his brain. The fog's started to roll in. Weird weather they have here; and it's not a soup-to-nuts kind of fog, not that thick road-to-Berkeley fog either. It's a fog like hairspray that refuses to stay put. Penny reaches into the air and pulls at it a few times. ""Isn't thick enough to write in,"" half smiling ""I was gonna tell it to make you smell pretty.""  And that other noise, that's her feet. She hasn't really stopped moving, can't sit still. Can't help the tick. ""She had horns. Pale sticky halo, too. Where'd'you think horns come from?"" She asks this and when she asks she sounds like a child asking about babies.  ""Maybe she can't sing?"" Compton deadpans.  With a grunt, some squeaking at the knees and much effort, Compton hauls himself to his feet, swaying slightly,""I honeslty have no fucking idea what you're talking about toots."" he says. ""I need a shower."" No shit sherlock, but admitting it is the first step.  Penny tilts her head to the side, ear bud slipping out emitting the noise of some remix. Hard beats. Thirty revolutions per minute. ""Maybe she stepped on a crack."" She reaches her hands up. Up. Up. Pull her up. ""I saw her. When you told me to shush, I shushed and Looked.""   ""Technically it's not work. Not if I enjoy it. Right?""  Compton peers at you for a second, like you're out of your fucking mind, then with a sigh, bends over again, his joints protesting. Grabs a hold of your wrists and leans back, trying hard to stay upright.  You say, ""You mean the whore?""  Her knees crack, too. Whatever she was doing tonight, it was hell on her joints. ""Yes, her. She's gonna eat that boy I bet. I'da but that's not my job this week. M'not allowed,"" eye drooping down, twisting sideways. ""This not working shit blows. Hotel?""  Compton simply nods and turns Holiday way, ""So, ya'd eat 'em eh?"" he says.  Walking is slow going. Walking pace is set by Penny because that is how it works this week. ""Yes, I would. If I were a girl. Freya, though, she's a bitch and a half to handle. Makes me all,"" pulsing her hand open and closed, open, closed like people do with stressballs ""hungry. Famished. Like I'm fasting from the ebb and flow. I donno.""  ""Ya can raid the continental breakfast bar on the way up."" Compton offers, moving none too quickly himself, ""This whole Days thing just fucks me up. Not good with roles... not good with responsibility. Someday one of you are going to give me the shit, and I'm gonna fuck it up, I tell ya.""  Penny enters the Holiday Inn lobby area. Penny has left.  Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ)       This spacious lobby area has many comfortable seats and a fire place. It is very clean, except for the clutter of baggages placed on the floor by the people checking in or out. Loads of magazines are organized on a centrally located coffee table. The front desk has a couple of employees signing in guests. A gift shop entrance is located right next to the front desk area, displaying all sorts of Ontario and Canada goodies for the passing tourist to purchase. A large area opens up through a passage way on the far side of the lobby and the faint scent of chlorine drfits in from a heated pool out of sight.

""You couldn't fuck it up. There's no such thing,"" all matter-of-fact and absoposilutely, nodding along to a song she can only half hear. Guitars now. Wailing vocals. Johnny Cash. ""Just as there is no such thing as coincidence. It's all connected. It's all good.""  She knocks on the door to a room. It's not our room. She still knocks. Penny knocks on the door marked #158. Penny knocks on the door marked #156.  Tiziano leaves an apartment. Tiziano has arrived.  Compton is standing outside Room 159 with Penny. At the room that isn't theirs where Penny is talking to the door, saying things like ""He's probably passed out. He probably got one look at himself in that sailor moo.."" when the door opens. No one there to greet her at eye-level, she looks down.  The door opens up and Tiziano pokes out his head looking about. He is dressed as if he has just gotten up and out of bed looking over towards the woman then man, ""Hey I remember you.."" he trails off, ""What are you doing here?""  ""Candygram."" Compton deadpans.  Penny looks at Compton. He doesn't have candy. He has croissants and stale bagels in a basket with those little brown stirry things for coffee. And about fifty packets of sugar. totally unapologetic, and even a little 'up' for the hour, Penny goes on like this is totally normal. ""I need coffee for that little coffeemate thing in the bathroom. You using yours?"" A pause, looks at the old (very smelly) man ""You know kids?""  Compton closes one eye and peers at the partched Tranny from the other, ""Taint funny man."" he says. The to Tiziano, ""Well, do ya?""  Tiziano blinks a few times before rubbing his eyes, ""Do I what?"" he looks between both of you wrinkling his nose.. what is it that you want?""  Penny jerks her thumb that-a-way, indicating where most bathrooms are in the rooms here ""The coffee, the *coffee* we want the little coffee packets for the little coffee pot in the little coffee kit in the little bathroom set little boy. We came for the coffee. Do you have the coffee? If you don't have the coffee we will seek the coffee elsewhere."" (**Note: 1 word, used 9 times in 1 pose**)  Compton says ""Coffee."" one more time for good measure.  Penny sighs to Compton and asides ""This is beginning to feel like work. I'm coming down.""  Tiziano frowns looking over towards Penny his hands being placed on his hips looking rather cross, ""I am not a little boy."" the high pitched voice states, ""I'm 13.."" he trails off, ""Did you put the stuff in the punch there?""  ""No."" Compton says flatly, a little too quickly, ""Want a bagle?""  Tiziano tilts his head a little, ""Okay.."" he trails off, ""Antigone took my punch before I could finish it."" he sighs looking over to Penny, ""I'm not sure there is coffee I don't drink any.""  Compton looks to Penny, ""That sounded like a yes to me."" he says handing the bagle over. Did we mention that Compton smells like a dumpster? Long story, but he does.  Penny looks down her nose at Tiziano, glasses slipping a little bit further while Compton tries to interject ""Listen, you're getting a life-lesson little boy. Right fucking now,"" the build-up to this next bit bracketed by a pregnant pause and some half-hearted finger-pointing ""Don't *ever* waste good drugs on the non-paying.""  ""What do you mean? There's always coffee. Why're you stalling? Comp - why's he stalling..""  Tiziano takes the baggle sniffing at it a few moments seeing if it smells as it should be tossed out, ""Stalling?"" he bites his lips, ""I bet you have whatever it was that was in the punch.. umm what was the name again."" he scratches his head.  ""Just go *in* there and get it."" Compton points past Tiziano, in to the room, ""He said yes already."" he reasons with Penny. Then to Tiziano, ""That's good advice kid.""  Tiziano quickly shakes his head, ""You can't go inside my room.."" he trals off, ""My father would be really upset."" he sighs taking a bite of the bagel talking with a full mouth, ""You really shouldn't just knock on people's rooms you know.""  A moment later, a light sparks deep behind Comptons eyes, ""Hey kid, your parents use their mini-bar at all?""  ""It's better than just walking in."" Compton points out. ""At least this gives you a chance to get your pants on.""  Penny is leading. Compton is distracting with the bagel and Penny is walking past the kid into that room that is not theirs to hunt down the instant coffee. This only works because Compton can follow, follow-up and fix their own minibar woes as well. ""C'mon, it'll just take a sec.""  Tiziano turns a little red stepping behind the door, ""I'm wearing shorts and I was asleep so there.. and well I I don't know.."" he falls silent staring at you now the bagel forgotten.  Tiziano blinks, ""Hey get out of there."" he stomps his goot on the ground, ""Your starting to really upset me."" he grits his teeth, ""Get out of my room!"" he screams this last part.  Compton pushes in behind Penny, ""Common kid. You said yourself you're not using it when she asked, that's the same as saying yes. You can't play with us like that... she really needs her coffee.""  There's rummaging going on in the bathroom, the door half-open. These people, whoever they are, work FAST. Steamroller, baby. ""Hey, you got a *showercap* Wooow. That's cool. Hey C - they got any gin left? We're gonna need it - and that shitty rum, too."" She reappears, three coffee bags in her corner, when the tantrum starts ""Comp - give the kid some money, hey? Bagels don't work like they used to.""  Tiziano growls muttering something into Italian for a few moments looking more and more angered, ""Vost grab my father's blade I'm tired of being nice."" he turns towards Compton giving him a dark look, ""You take one step toward me and you will die before the hour passess.""  Compton puts his little 'tisket' basket down by the door and shoves a hand in to hispocket, comming out with a $5 bill. ""Here kid. That's fair."" He insists as he heads for the mini-fridge by the TV.  That stops Compton in his tracks. Damn. Somthing about someone half his size dropping a treat like that makes one take pause and consider it, and current circumstances a little more closely. ""Hey. S'cool."" the old hipster assures.  You say, ""Just borrowin the freebies the hotel gives up, like you said we could.""  Penny stops there, a few feet from Tiziano and kinda stares ""Uu..uu.uhm. Kid listen, we're uh.. we're gonna GO. Now, okay?"" Edges that way, to the far wall giving Compton a 'what the fuck' look.  Tiziano looks over towards the man, ""I told you to depart.."" his words drip of venom as he makes his way though the room over towards his bed he coups down as if picking something up, ""No.. your going to stay.. I'm not a KID!"" he screams, ""I've tried being nice.. ooooh but you don't want that. You want the darkness well now your going to deal with it.""  Compton gives the old eye-motion-to-the-door and a short nod, ""Yeah, hey. No worries buddy. Thanks for helpin us out."" and does the ole backwards march to the door, stooping to pick up the basket on his way by.  You say, ""You really should use that peep hole."" Compton adds in way of friendly advice still inching towards the door.""  Tiziano takes a deep breath, ""Oh.... now I think I am really mad."" he grows silent for a moment looking towards the Bagel for a moment before tossing it towards Compton, ""Catch.""  That quick grab motion also pertains to Penny. Compton grabs her by the seat of her pants a little too hard. She drops the coffee packets and whines about it on the way out. ""Hey, what's the big deal? It's just coffee...""  Penny stumbles backwards and catches the bagel in the eye ""Ow, shit! Hey! Fuck, that fucking little ..what the fuck, Comp?""  Compton, not graced with youth, small nimble hands or any degree of dexterity, does his best with the lobbed bagel, and...  //.etro: Compton rolls ""athletics+dexterity"" at diff 6          For a botch!  ...not only misses the bagel completely, drops his basket and himself in the door way.  >  //.etro: Penny rolls ""athletics+dexterity"" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Nimble, young and a little rocked. That's what you have to be to get it done and get it done right. Penny is all that and a gymnast, too. She not only manages to get her balance back, but she tumbles backward and catches that fucking bagel on its way down. That was amazing.  It's not nice, but she pegs that hockey puck back into the room ""Keep your fucking coffee.""  Vost has arrived. Tiziano drops Vost.  Vost(#6152VXpC) See +flook  ""Fucking hell."" he comments to himself. Looking around behind himself for Penny. (OOC> Tiziano says ""You guys brought in to the whole happy friendly Changeling bs. Its not true. It's a very dark game depending on what Lecagy your char is on. Mine is on his dark one. You barged into his room, you didn't leave when he asked you to, and he had his servent draw a very dangerous weapon. He is POed. Right now he can't even be directly attacked by Fae. (not sure about non-enchanted.) That is why I offered the retcon. I don't have humanity my char isn't human.""  (OOC> Penny is just asking - we left when you threatened us and you're still attacking. (OOC> Compton never assumed nothing about Changeling. Please don't assume on my assumptions. It never crossed my path before. I'm just trying to learn how this is happening, that that it can happen. (OOC> Tiziano says ""Well actully I was just attacking you at first. Compton kept calling me a kid so I tossed him in just before you left. Vost was about to smack you with his sword and inact is enchantment rede so you could see him. Quite frankly he could have walked behind you for 10 yards then smacked and killed you when you went to sleep."" //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived.

At least I'll try to. Mercutio pages Penny and Compton: How well do you know this boy, Compton? Penny pages: You know what you know from me-he isn't okay. He's severely fucked up. Mercutio pages: Have you had any decent talks with him? Do you know his name? Does he know yours? You paged (blind) Mercutio and Penny with 'Had a long conversation in Allan Gardens once. I know his name, he knows my name as Comp.'. Mercutio pages: Okay. Penny pages Mercutio and Compton: He doesn't know my name. I don't know his. I read his aura though and basically have him figured out. OOC> Mercutio says ""Okay, Vost?"" OOC> Mercutio says ""Vost's turn is out of the way. Tiz?

OOC> Mercutio says ""Let him pose, if he wants. Then you can leave, IC.""  Tiziano is on the verge of ordering the strike. He seems to think better of it falling into a deep depression instead. The anger fades away from his eyes falling on the offering basket Compton dropped on his way out. The offering seems to apease the boy.  Penny makes with the oofs and the groaning alongside the most creative use of expletices in the latin language anyone's ever heard of. If they speak the language, that is. Not as heavy on her feet, Penny moves around Compton, glaring ""Aren't you supposed to be taking care of me? Hellooo.. mcfly.."" she actually makes another huffing noise getting Compton to his feet. expletives, too.  Compton scambles up to his feet, using Penny as leverage, ""Geezus girl. Make tracks"" he orders, at the time the best he can do towards fulfilling his role as Sunday.  Penny knocks on the door marked #174. Penny shouts, ""Bitches, let us the fuck in, we lost our keys."" Penny bangs on the door really loudly. Like end-of-the-world loud. It's the only way to wake up the occupants.    Mercutio goes now. Mercutio goes home. Mercutio has left.  Tiziano does make his way over towards the Hotel phone. Someone does have to pay for the minibar drinks and it isn't comming out of his butt.  Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment.  Compton hauls his mass up the hall catching up with Penny, turning to look back at the room they came from. He says in huffed breaths ""What. Thefuck. Was. That?""  Jesse leaves an apartment. Jesse has arrived.  Penny leaves an apartment. Penny has arrived.  Tiziano is actully in room159 though the door is wide open. //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived. Guard wanders down the hallway.  Tiziano is really in his room sitting on his bed on the hotel phone.  Compton looks at Jesse, his face flushed, and he well, stinks. Like a dumpster. Long story.  Jesse emerges headfirst from the room, responding to the apocalyptic knocks with insctinct-borne alacrity. Topless, his gaunt form is a writhing mess of tattoos. Sleep is rapidly being blinked from his eyes and, even barefoot and beltless, he has his satchel clutched in one hand.  Guard continues meandering on down the hallway. He notices the people collected outside of one of the rooms.  Penny looks over her shoulder, squinting down the hallway. Not for long, though. ""Not that kind of emergency,"" dismissing Jesse's bag ""No keys, man. It's cool, baby, it's cool. I need some sleep.""  Compton clutched Jesse by the shoulder and turns his dazed form back towards the room. ""Go t'bed man."" he offers.  Jesse has his baseball cap on. Strange but true. No shirt, no shoes, just jeans and a baseball cap. A satchel and lots of tattoos. He slumps in the doorframe, sighing, then kicks the door open with the heel of his foot and motions 'after you'. ""Crazy new invention I'll have to show you one of these days. Called a fucking telephone. Lets you wake me up without banging like it's the end of the world. What will they think of next?""  ""Hey!"" ejactulates the fat, old guard. ""You guys need to be quieter, eh? What's all this ruckus aboot?""  Penny waves to the fat guy ""Lost my keys,"" she say, separating her words with uncalled for annunciation and ducks into their room ""sorry for the noise, sir. G'night."" Nevermind that it's morning. pose.  Compton tunrs and looks at the old guard, lets go of Jesse's arm and raises his in a classic, 'huh?' pose.  Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment.  ""Sorry, sir, sorry."" Brim pulled low over his face, the barechested wastrel waves to the guard. ""Won't happen again."" He ducks into the apartment.  Guard says, ""Uh, hey, excuse me, eh? I'm not done talking with you folks.""  Compton just stands there looking blank and airy, ""Huh?"" he asks this time. If it wasn't mentioned before, he stinks. Dumpster like.  Guard points over to another room, one with the door still open. ""You break into that there room and steal something from it, eh?""  Jesse shakes his head no, grabs Compton, and pulls him roomward. ""In the shower. What did you, find some stink you liked and roll in it?"" Jesse looks down the hallway at the open door and shrugs. ""I was sleeping. But why, there something missing?""  ""Sorry sir, I don't know what you're talking about. I was just dropping off the lady."" Compton says pointing to room 172 as if to illustrate.  Guard nods, putting one hand on his belt and the other over his collapsible baton. ""Why, someone in that there room claims you pushed past him and stole stuff from the mini-bar.""  Compton stares blankly at the guard again. Scared? Clueless? It's hard to tell. He opens his mouth once, but closes it again... a little goldfish like.  ""Uh. I didn't do anything but wake up and let my friend back in her room."" Jesse bares a wide yawn, utterly unflapped. Nothing to worry about, this misunderstanding could not be more trivial. ""You sure it's them as did it?"" He turns to Compton. ""Did you barge in somewhere? Steal something?""  Guard just nods. ""Kid described them. Said one of 'em smelled like trash, eh. This guy here, he smells aboot like trash.""  Compton blinks! looking dumbfoundedly at Jesse, ""Wha?"" then back at the guard, ""L-like I said, I was just leavin eh? Just got here too, now I'm just leaving. Shower time. At home. Far from here."" Okay, he's kind of stammering.  Compton mutters to Jesse, ""... the... stop... I'm... here."" You whisper ""Go the fuck back inside and stop talking to me. I'm SOnny, and I'm outta here."" to Jesse.  ""Kid?"" Jesse laughs, shaking his head. ""Oh, I get it. Kid hears all this, hears us being loud, figures it's a good time to raid the minibar."" He waves to the Guard, extricating himself from the doorframe. ""Check under the mattress. Kids always think you'll never look there.""  Jesse has left. Jesse enters an apartment.  Guard frowns. ""If I go into the other room and find it trashed, then don't find anything, you will allow me to search you and your room, eh?""  Compton stops and thinks about this for a second, his brow krikling up, ""I,um... I mean, like, its no my room eh?"" he says in his defense.  ""Right."" The Guard leans in close... but not too close - god that smell is bad. He gets a narrow-eyed, evil-as-he-can-try-to-be look in his eyes, ""I better not hear anything else from you, ya hear?""  Tiziano is on th phone asking questions such as will is dad be have to be told of this disturbence and can everything be done quietly. More then liky he is told his father shall be told. To which he will ask why.  ""Sir, yes sir. sir"" The old hipster agrees, too readily realizing he's off the hook. ""Good day to ya to eh?""  ""Oh, and I don't normally smell like this... Long story."" Compton adds, trying to salvage his dignity a little.  Guard says, ""Right. Anyway, go get clean. You smell terrible."" Guard wanders off.  Compton looks like he's going to explain, but decides to just get lost.  You push through the glass doors and leave the Holiday Inn. Downtown - Spadina and King W(#257RJ)       This is the central bar area of Toronto. There is a bar on every corner, and from Thursday to Saturday it is next to impossible to find parking. The line-ups get huge and the hot dog venders get wealthy. On the northwest corner stands the neon monument called Whiskey Saigon, and near by are other bars such as Dirk Gently's and Power Bar. The Coloured Stone is located kitty-corner to Whiskey, a trendy bar and pool hall. Restaurants are also common in this area, everything from a bar and grill, to the finer dining experiences. Things are relatively more quiet other nights, but there is always traffic. The sidewalks are a clean white colour and the streets have been repaved, to the delight of motorists driving through the city. Even the planters with the flowers and the trees make this section a brighter place.  You enter the lobby area of the Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ)       This spacious lobby area has many comfortable seats and a fire place. It is very clean, except for the clutter of baggages placed on the floor by the people checking in or out. Loads of magazines are organized on a centrally located coffee table. The front desk has a couple of employees signing in guests. A gift shop entrance is located right next to the front desk area, displaying all sorts of Ontario and Canada goodies for the passing tourist to purchase. A large area opens up through a passage way on the far side of the lobby and the faint scent of chlorine drfits in from a heated pool out of sight.  Contents: Room176(#4941ed) Room174(#4497ed) Room172(#4869ed) Room170(#5048ed) Room169(#5091ed) Room167(#5822ed) Room166(#5258ed) Room165(#7658ed) Room164(#6674ed) Room159(#6092ed) Room158(#7027ed) Room157(#5983ed) Room156(#7909ed) Room154(#6976ed) Room152(#5498ed) Room150(#5751ed) Room139(#2747ed) Front Desk Obvious exits: Out     room174 You enter the apartment. Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Jesse Penny  Compton slips back in, all quiet and rather un-Compton like.  Jesse is lying on a sleeping bag on the floor, one hand tucked behind his head, the other dealing with a lit cigarette. ""Oi. Rock. The fuck happened? Penn just wigged and I scripted a xanax and a vicodin. You freaked too?""  Penny says, ""Nn.. "" she wants, sensing Compton's arrival ""..water.""  ""Anyway I don't think it's just you. Eva's awol. I think she and I had about the same level of reservations about coming here only she stuck to hers. And what happened to the comsys? I thought that was functioning back when we were living on Fresno-time. Gah.. I keep getting this feeling like we've been deserted, yeah? Like the sane, the rational have parted company.""  Without saying anything, he goes to the bathroom, pulls the garbach bag from the can before taking his stinking shirt off and bagging it. The pants are soon to follow. So now we have a big almost naked guy who's still wiffy standing there, looking at Jesse, ""Beats me... go in to your satchel and get me those mini-bottles I stashed there. I need a fucking drink."" before turning back to the bathroom. Shortly the sound of a running shower can be heard.  Jesse laughs, and leaves the cigarette in his mouth long enough to snag the strap of his satchel and sling it skidding across the carpet to gently thud against the bathroom door. ""Who was the kid?""  From beyond the bathroom door, a Comptons voice calls through, ""Some kid that bugged me when I was golfing at the gardens. Said his name was Fagiano, or DizzyCamo or somthing like that... Wop name. Ms. Congeneality out there wanted some coffee.""  ""Do we need to give him a free spin?"" Jesse has the oddest euphemisms for killing people. Honestly, now. He yawns widely. ""Did you get the coffee at least?""  ""Fucked if I know."" comes from the bathroom.  From the bed, Penny makes drifting noises ""He needs to pass go a few more times. /Whiney/ little fuck. I looked,"" she means she Looked ""at him and if there ever was a kid that needed to be on lithium.. shit that kid's it. And parental supervision. Who leaves their kid alone in a place like this? God. Television is the replacement parenting unit.""  ""Fuck off, Penny."" Jesse calls from the floor, without malice. ""Some of us wish we'd been raised by televisions.""   ""No,"" totally buzzkilled ""we didn't get the fucking coffee.""  ""Yeah. I know. And I'm saying it was a shitty fucking childhood, okay? I can't love a tv, Jes. And the tv doesn't love me. It's an empty vessel.""  Compton exits the bathroom, wrapped in Pennys kimono, and a towel wrapped around his head. ""MInd telling me now, what the fuck that whole surreal deal was about?"" he asks. His voice is tired. Dry. He was fighting off a stupor before whatever happened, happened. Now he's lost that struggle and has gone in to wrecked buick stage. He sits on the end of his bed, and cranks the seal in a mini-bottle of Smirnoff.  ""Television's better'n some alternatives, is all I'm saying."" Jesse grunts his agreement when Compton re-emerges. ""Yeah. The fuck did happen?""  Compton drains the tiny bottle, and tosses it at the can, missing by about two feet. Next a bottle of Southern Comfort is offered up.  Penny can't get out of this moment. Re-telling is like re-living and the more she says it, the real-er it becomes. Groudhog's Day. ""Kid said he knew Compton. So they're talking, right?"" New drugs making her slow, cohesive and solid ""and I get the filter packs from the bathroom while they're talkin'lsd and some shit and when I come back? something's totally wrong."" She yawns and sits up ""Give it here,"" hand extended to palm the SoCo, takes a little and stretches. ""He's saying we're making him angry. I'swe-ah - angry. Like the fucking Hulk would say it, y'know? That was some David Banner shit. So I read the kid and it's like he's.."" trails off, pondering ""..more. More than a kid.""  Compton takes back the remainder of the bottlette, and drains it. He listens, about intently as Jesse, for although he was ther, he saw all the actors, he still has no idea what the plot was. Next bottle: Beefeaters. Mmmm, piney goodness.  Penny sheds the jacket, the glasses, her socks. That belt. The earring. All these accoutrement. Unecessary in the crunch or crux of conversation ""He's just a kid, right?"" questioning Compton ""He's just a kid but there was something else. It was like looking at tree and when the lights snapped on, the whole root-structure shows up in x-ray. The whole answer. The big picture. The entire theme to this kid's life was right there and he wasn't a kid!""  Compton finished the last of the gin, and sighs, looking at the empty, tosses it at the can, and misses, but puts it right next to the empty vodka on the floor. ""Bed time"" he states simply, and stands, walking over to the window side of the far bed. Then he drops Pennys poor kimono, and for a moment you're all exposed to the full horror that is the 'Full Compy' before he climbs under the covers, ""Or it's the drugs, Penny."" he says with dying interest, ""Or he's a fucking demon. Either way I'm fine, you're fine. Next time we just leave kids alone. Right?""  She whimpers; out of fear or concedeing the point - isn't clear. ""I'm sorry man, it was the drugs. I really thought I needed that coffee. But I know what I saw.""  ""Bitch, put some pants on.""   That comment or any other, no matter how sound or based in self-preservation is lost on the old guy, as a soft drone of snoring comes from the far side of the room. Well, at least he don't stink no more.  ***And so the longest, most pointless scene finally ends at 5am EST. Kudos the Merc forbeing apillar of reason and calmness."
IJ24L04,male,25,"(Cash starts in his effort to infiltrate the local drug competition.)  Another foggy and shitty day here in lovely Erin's Vale. A blanket of obfuscation for the seedier elements of the world to hide under. If it was ever sunny, the dealers and pimps might scatter like roaches when the lights go on. But, the lights are off. And the roaches are deeply entrenched in their hidey holes and comfortable corners of opportunity.   Enter Cash. White, disheveled, and out of place in this neighborhood. 'S a miracle he's made it this far, really. Brothers watch the semi retired video editor shamble through the concrete jungle, probably another junkie looking for the next high. His sneakers carry him towards a few gangstas patrolling the front of a liquor store. Looking for marks, johns, or victims. Cash could be any of the above. Whiskey aura just detectible, he approaches said gangsta.   ""Hey, man.""   Amidst the fog and human detritus that lie across broken concrete and beneath black shadows of ancient sins, the white man draws interest and hunger. Yet, there is no action taken. Those hungry eyes merely widen as the man walks without seeming care or knowledge of the dangers held within this dying land. They withdraw to hidden alleys and soft curses as the fool walks towards the lords of this realm, daring to tread where even seraphim fear to look.          The words uttered receive a look of surprise, wide eyes and dropped jaws, from those men to whom the foolish white boy speaks. There is a pause as the comical expressions refuse to leave their features before a bout of laughter wracks the group. The laughter dies soon enough as one of the crew takes a swaggering step closer to this fool as a hand slides beneath loose clothes to grasp the unseen.  ""What up, holmes? Bit far from home?""  ""Yeah. Totally."" The slurred response of the inebriated. The picture gets clearer; this must be a bum who's lost his place in the soup line. Homeboy can smell alcohol leaking from Cash's pours. He sweats the stuff. There's even a personalized bottle tucked under layers of denim which looks just as worn as the man himself.   ""Ya know, I don' even know where I am, ta tell the truth, man. Like, where cin cracker like myself score 'round here."" The jean scarecrow looks about, ensuring the relative safety of their interaction. It's not safe, for him. But at least there's no pigs patrolling. That could be a good thing, or a very very bad thing. Ether way, he continues to play the part of the searching white junkie.  ""Ya wanna' score?"" The chorus of jeering laughter rises from behind the delegated representative of the lounging gang at the question asked. The laughter is acknowledged with a quick smile and look over shoulder. Then, with that smile firmly in place, another step is taken as the young man reaches out to lay his other hand reassuringly upon the junkie's shoulder. ""Right place, wrong time, amigo.""  There's a quick look about the street before attention settles once more upon the drunk with a smile grown wider by several degrees as an additional question is broached. ""Got some money, amigo? 'cause if ya do, we might have the hook-up. Just gotta have the cash is all."" There's another glance back towards the lounging men behind as another chorus of coarse laughter rises.  ""Mmmm. Yeah. Dinero. Well... here's the thing..."" Cash reaches into the greasy depths of his jacket pocket, withdrawing a handful of Pobble's primo cooked surprise crack rocks. It's held in his weathered and callused palm, jiggled within as his heavy eyelids are propped at half mass.   ""I got these rocks here. 'N I don' really dig the stuff, ta tell ya the truth. I want some weed, but 'm willin' ta fork over like... two sixty bags of this shit for a good eighth of green. Or a lil' tar... Here..."" Cash palms the off-white rocks over in a conspiratorial fashion. ""Check that.. see if ya like it. If you gotta a rig, I'll smoke with ya. Ya know, jus' so you feel alright 'bout me, man.""   Standard police narcotic procedure forbids partaking in controlled substances; this is an offer to show the homeboy he's not a cop. Might be a victim, but he's not a cop.  The laughter dies suddenly at the mention of a lack of green. Narrowed eyes and absent smiles greet the prouncement. Yet, the dark expressions lighten once more as huge grins spread across coarse features. The young gansta who stands before the would-be junkie blinks and then drops his hand from the junkie's shoulder to the white rocks glittering upon the proffered palm. One rock is deftly plucked from the offering and lifted to eye level. A moment's inspection returns a slight shrug as askance is looked at the crew steps behind.  ""Try it!"" The words are harsh as greedy eyes widen and their utterance prompts the gansta to pocket the rock before the hand rests upon the shoulder of the junkie once more. Pressure is delivered firmly as he takes a step towards a nearby alley. ""Come on, amigo. There's a pipe back there. We can smoke a few and talk.""  He'll find a willing subject, and Cash will accompany the gangster without abandon. A funeral march of sorts. Dead man walking. But this is Cash's game. And if there's a coffin in that alley, it doesn't belong to the wandering Jew.    ""Far out."" Words escapes Cash's chapped lips, and two fingers reach up behind his left ear. They're placed in a precise spot, a practiced movement he's intimate with. It's stimulates the Ki source lying dormant beneath tendons and muscle. Pressure's applied, and he adds a swig of whiskey from the bottle hiding under his denim flap. Lips smack at the sensation, and he wipes a small river of alcohol that threatens to run down his chin.    The pressure point spreads throughout his body warmly. Coupled with the rush of fire water, and an unseen hand gesture, his organs and vital points align themselves in a configuration least likely to suffer injury from a surprise attack. He prepares his mind and body for a deal gone wrong, though there are no signs of such an event.... yet.  WEATHER REPORT: The snow changes to a cold rain. The guiding hand draws the junkie towards the alleyway as another look is shot towards the now-snickering crowd. That hand, the one kept beneath clothes slips free finally with its contents hidden from the junkie by the gansta's body. The snickering grows louder as the young gansta starts talking with a jovial air, ""Very, amigo. You gringos are nuts. Ya got rocks to match the huevos swinging between yo legs. Ya got style. Shame man."" The final word ends with the hand slipping from shoulder to center of the junkie's back.  There's a sharp pressure and the junkie receives a sharp shove as the gansta swings his other hand up in front of his body. The hand's contents revealed now, black steel glinting with dangerous promise. The gansta laughs and spits out, ""Real shame. Bueno dias, senor.""  Not that this wasn't to be expected, but perhaps Cash had thought this part would come latter on in the game. Bearing gifts of crack cocaine doesn't usually get one shot, but this is the path this unlucky gangsta has chosen.   At the edge of the cliff, Cash offers one last life line for this homey to grab, before the jagged rocks below consume him utterly. ""Hey... man. You go mugging yer customers, 's bad for business ain't it? I mean.. check that stuff. It's primo. I could be a cash cow fer you."" The remains of the rocks are held out for the plucking, palm open and inviting. His other hand, meanwhile, has fingered out a small red chili pepper which is placed between his teeth. The 'hotter than shit' variety teeters in his choppers.  ""Shut up, fucker. Only really stupid pieces of shit just up and offer prime shit like that!"" The words are uttered with the sharp taint of rage that is followed by a quick step that draws the gansta even closer to the junkie. The gun is lifted in a sharp gesture as the rant is continued, ""Any last words, bitch? Like an offer to suck my dick, you fucking homo?""  The rage only grows as another step is taken and brows draw together. Lips pull back from teeth far from the color of white in a bitter snarl. ""Get on your knees, fucker."" The hand is lifted slightly to direct the barrel towards the ground as the phrase is repeated with a harsh jabbing motion, ""On your knees!""  The snap of the chili pepper's skin starts what appears a wildly stupid move to the untrained eye. Small white boy junkie versus gun wielding gangster on his turf. But this is beyond the eyes of his croonies, and this is no ordinary shmuck. The chili is crunched between his teeth, spilling its acidic contents into Cash's mouth. The sensation fuels a strike, now that the gangster has made the unfortunate mistake of pointing the tip of his barrel at the ground. He couldn't ask for a better opportunity to end this, real quick-like. And so what appears to be a drunken stumble forward ends in the deft protrusion of a two fingered strike to the underbelly of the would-be assailant's chin.   The strike aided by the configuration of his fingers, and the tingling of chili spreading over his tongue.  There's a harsh exhalation of breath between clenched teeth at the stumbling junkie's approach and the barrel of the gun starts to rise. Yet, the motion is far too late as the junkie moves past the barrel's end and places him within inches of the gansta. There's a sharp pain that prompts eyes to widen in shock to accompany the wet tearing sound of flesh and tissue giving way before force. The junkie's fingers slip past the boundary of skin in a spray of blood.  Muscles slacken as lips part, a crimson tinged bubble growing before his lips. Fingers slide from the striated grip of the gun with a clatter of steel and broken thought.  Lazy eyes drop to the crumpled mass below, Cash shakes his head at the waist and wipes his fingers on jeans stained by thousands of miles of concrete.   ""Fuckin' mushugina.""   At that, he bends at the knees to place the gun in his waistline, not that he'd know much what to do with the thing. At least his face is intact, it'll make it that much easier to copy. Wallet's next. He'll know the name; he'll know the 'alleged' address. If this gangster's not connected, he'll know someone that is. And the game will continue. The puffy Phila jacket looks retarded on Cash, and it's a tad too big. But when he leaves the alley, it'll fit just right. Away from prying eyes, fingers still ripe with blood are placed on ether side of Cash's Jewish face. This will be vulgar, but he's got time to kill. A little paradox sandwich, he'll enough it with a pickle.   The shifting of muscle and pigment is inaudible as he depresses portions of his skull that cause his skin to convulse. It feels right strange, but he's done it before. Cash, looking down at the dead dregs of humanity, slowly takes on the appearance of the failed criminal. Skin darkens, bones adjust. Within seconds, he's the shvatsa.   Attaining his new height, just a few inches taller, he tests his shoulders and rolls them. Knuckles crack as Cash gets used to this new form. For effect, he takes out the clumsy weapon on his waistline and points it down at the dead man's face.   *BAM*   That should alert his homies that the task is done, and when gangster runs out the alley clutching rocks and tucking away a piece, it's a good indication the white junkie will never be coming out of that alley again. The shot was placed close enough to the gangsta's face that he should be unrecognizable to forensics.   The first stage is done. Identity stolen, Gangsta Cash appears with a smile to his 'new' homeboys and takes off racing. ""Fuckin' score, yo."" He'll be back, to find the big fish at the end of this line."
IJ24L04,male,25,"[Okay. I forgot to log this but it's plot so I thought I should bring it up in paraphrased form.]  Pobble goes to library to do some drug related study. Woman (Anastasia) comes along, asking about Nylarathotep. This is obviously strange, but she states that she wants to talk about Cornelius.  Conversation ensues in the office, details are revealed on both sides. She, along with her 'colleagues' (An undisclosed group, who can sense magickal happening and have a talent for seeing the invisible. Apparently drawn to Pobble by some manner of soothsaying.)  Not a lot of new information, besides a replica of a medallion worn around Corni's neck that they have. It wasn't magickal as it was a copy, but they think its related to some kind of teleporation and or mind attacking. It seems that Cornelius worships something called Nylarathotep. This suggests that he is in fact a Nephandi.  They are going to try and get the real medallion and bring it to us for inspection.   Based on the outcome of the subsequent transactions and trust building, details as to this faction (in which the spokesperson is a Violin Instructor) may follow.  Yay. Sorry about the log-forgetting."
IJ24L04,male,25,"Meeting, part 2 -- after Compton left.  Pretty uneventful.  Compton steps back out to the main hall. Compton has left. Hana has, by this time, sat down on the floor. She seems to be leaning against the wall, asleep, unless one is observant enough to catch the slight crack of her eyelids, through which she could be watching. Keene steps forward to allow Compton to walk past him, not even looking at him when he leaves. His attention moves to Siomen; he smiles thinly at him, but then moves his attention back to Jonah. ""I realize this, Magister. I believe in you, as I am sure all the other magi in this city do. But it takes time for my colleagues to learn to trust others. They have difficulty dealing with the rest of the Traditions at times because of their methods. Thus, I have found myself in the role of leader because of my ability to negotiate and explain their actions to others."" Rhiamon's hand stays up. Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon, ""... difference."" Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, ""... their..."" Paksenarrion enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Paksenarrion has arrived. Paksenarrion makes her way in from the main chamber, a long slender bundle wrapped in black cloth is slung over a shoulder. Alexandre shakes his head at Rhiamon's reply, looking like he doesn't believe her. Jonah continues to listen, then nods. ""Very well."" He looks to Rhiamon. ""Miss Jones?"" Keene, when his turn has passed again, returns to being seate. Rhiamon lets her hand drop, not showing the ring this time. ""I am glad to see Aaron Michaels here, but perhaps his position could be elucidated ? There seem to be some things going on that I have no knowledge of..."" Abel looks over at Rhiamon, then over to Aaron. A crooked grin comes to Alex's face at the mention of Aaron's presence and he shakes his head slightly. Jonah nods, ""His position is currently under review. I shall announce more information when it is decided and appropriate."" He looks about to the others, ""Now, for those who aren't part of a Cabal, please raise your hands."" James raises his hand. Abel takes a quick look over to Chase to see his reaction. Rhiamon shrugs, and settles down. She'll ask Aaron later. Jonah guestures to James, ""Yes.. Mr... Anderson?"" Alyx lifts a gloved hand, the other resting on the table in front of her. Abel turns his look over to James. He fingers his Sun symbol unconsciously. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, ""... fulfils... about the..."" James says, ""You said earlier that thos of us who aren't part of a caball would still be allowed access to the realm and the chantry if we expressed interest in being affiliated with this organization. I am James anderson, and I would like to do so."" Keene returns to writing on his legal pad, taking notes on the proceedings. Alexandre smiles briefly at Rhiamon, nodding slightly. Hana doesn't raise her hand, but she seems alert again. Jonah looks back over his shoulder, at Rhiamon and Alexandre. He gives her a half-smirk and says, ""Thank you, Miss Jones, Mr. Taylor. I try very hard."" With that said, he looks back to James. ""Yes, I did indeed say that. I will take note of you. What Tradition are you, Mr. Anderson?"" Aaron raises his hand as well and smirks. James replies simply, ""Verbena"" Jonah notes that, then continues. ""Very well. Thank you."" He looks to Alyx. ""Miss Davian, I will record your name and Tradition. Do you have anything you wish to say?"" Alex looks over to Aaron when he raises his hand, but then turns his head to look over at Hana, without waiting to see what it is that Aaron is going to say. ""I would prefer to remain affiliated with the Chantry,"" Alyx murmurs. ""Though at the present time, I do not know the goals and unifying purposes of the Cabals here, so joining one will be difficult."" Abel looks over to Alyx, trying to catch her eye, and mouths silently to her 'Talk to me later.' He smiles. Jonah nods to Alyx. He writes some notes, then looks over to Aaron. ""Yes, Mr. Michaels?"" Abel turns in his chair so he can see Aaron. Alexandre looks over towards Aaron as he speaks. The same curiosity that provoked Rhiamon's question is evidently on his face as well. Jesyca looks over towards Abel and then Aaron and back towards her cloak and continues fidgeting with it. Abel looks down at Jes curiously Aaron rises softly, 'I was once considered a member of the Virtual Adepts...while I came back willingly to this venue...as my choices are limited to a single cabal I have no interest in...I will decline joining a cabal..."". Plain and simple speech from one usually so volatile at these meetings. He flairs his longcoat and settles back down. Abel whispers to Jesyca. Paksenarrion slides into a sitting position on the floor with her back to the wall, looking about the room and quietly listening to the meeting. Jesyca's green eyes blink a few times and she freezes for a moment. She turns her head up towards Abel and offers a bit of a smile, shaking her head lightly. Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, ""... I'd..."" Alex's head turns slightly, a sideways glance at Aaron, and then further to look at Chase. A curious eyebrow is raised, as he wonders how Chase will respond to this. Abel also turns to see Chase's reaction to this statement. Chase has been silent till now. ""Micheals, this is not the forum for that discussion. Unless you'd like me to inform the entire room of your misdeeds?"" Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon, ""... trust..."" Alyx lifts her hand once more, remaining silent. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre. Paksenarrion raises her hands as well, quietly waiting her turn. Jonah watches Aaron for a moment, ""As Mr. Kettle has stated, this is not the forum for that particular discussion. We will discuss that after this meeting is over."" He looks to Alyx. ""Go ahead, Miss Davian."" Aaron looks to Chase, 'Only if you're willing to share your screwups as well, Kettle...I'll be happy to tell them the ones I know...and submit to the lie detection you won't.."". He again leans back and puts his feet up. Chase remains silent as Jonah backs his words. He smiles slightly, and like the slow rise of a bean-stock, his middle finger extends towards Aaron. ""Once this meeting is ajourned, Guru, I would ask that if there are any of questionable loyalty within our midst, that their activities be made known to all. There is little that brings a Chantry to it's knees faster than strife on the inside."" Here, Alyx nods to both Aaron and Chase. ""We all have our stories to tell, gentlemen."" Alex rocks his chair back on it's rear legs as he kicks his feet up to rest crossed on the back of the chair in front of him. Time to get comfy for the first match of the evening. Jesyca's cheeks flush Crimson at Chase's display and glue back down upon her cloak once more. Keene has no particular reaction to Chase's `outburst', if a hand gesture can be considered one. Instead, he continues taking notes. Alexandre whispers to Rhiamon. Rhiamon shrugs to Alexandre. Rhiamon whispers to Alexandre, ""so..."" Jonah merely nods to Alyx, ""I will consider this, Miss Davian. For now, I want to finish this meeting."" He looks to Paksenarrion. ""You are... Miss.. Johnathan? No, perhaps you would be so kind as to introduce yourself."" Abel listens to and watches aaron and chase and just shakes his head with a sigh. Alexandre lets out a sudden, dark chuckle at Rhiamon's last statement. Siomen sits quietly and listens, he glances over at Geero and tilts his head as he spots the new chain. Paksenarrion coughs and stands up, pushing a small braid out of her face, ""I am Paksenarrion Johanson.. Of the Celestial Chorus.."" She gives Jonah a deep nod, almost a bow, ""I wished to add my name to the list of affiliation of the chantry please. Of the cabals currently represented, one I would not feel truly part of.. The others.."" She glances towards Aaron and Chase, then around a little, ""I will not serve.. I would however be happy to lend my skills to the chantry itself and aide others as the need arises."" Abel blinks at Paksens words, looking at her inquizzitively. James looks thoughtfull. Jonah nods. ""Very well. Duely noted."" He takes a moment to glance around one last time. ""I do believe that we have recorded everyone,"" his eyes stop on Hana, ""save you, Miss Kawakami. Do you wish to be affiliated with us?"" ""I don't know,"" Hana says, slowly unfolding her limbs, legs and arms, as she rises. ""I don't really know what that means."" Alex raises a hand, speaking before aknowledged. ""Kaze, Kasui and myself will work with Hana so that she can determine if and where she fits with the Chantry,"" he offers. Hana twists a little, to look towards Alex studiously, followed by a brief glance at Kaze. She doesn't say anything else for the moment. Jonah nods, then offers a brief smile. ""Very well. I shall allow you time to learn what it means and then consider the offer."" He takes a few more notes, collects his papers, and begins putting them away. ""I will compile this list and complete it. Everyone shall soon receive a letter which shall acknowledge your request. As of now, however, this meeting is officially adjourned. We will have another meeting ten days hence (One RL Week). The agenda of that meeting will be on the board. You are all dismissed."" He begins packing his things. Jonah adds, quietly, ""Oh, Mr. Kettle, Mr. Hess, Mr. Michaels, Mr. Shinketsu, Mr. Elison, please stay after the meeting."" Rhiamon stands, and moves towards Aaron, then halts as Jonah speaks.. Aaron doesn't move from his spot in the Gallery, though he smiles, 'Detention again...too many spitballs.."" Alyx rises slowly from the Seat of Entropy, brushing her shirt down and tugging her coat into place before beginning to cross the room towards Abel. Rhiamon moves over, she can talk to him first. Abel nods to Jonah and remains seated, then turns to Jes. Jesyca bites on her bottom lip a bit and looks up towards Abel. Abel squeezes Jes's hand and smiles at her. ""I'll see ya later?"" Siomen yawns and stands, he moves over to Rhiamon and smiles as he pats Geero on the head. He looks at Rhiamon ""Hope he was not too much trouble?"" Hana watches a moment longer, then slips out the door. Rhiamon whispers to Aaron, ""Want to... what's..."" Hana steps back out to the main hall. Hana has left. Alex remains in his seat, leaning back on the rear legs, with his heels on the back of the chair in front of him. Chase now stands, chewing on the same piece of gum with same fervor he has been along. And despite the fact his stained teeth must've long since driven out every morsel of sugar, he's still enjoying it. His stance is mainly to stretch, as it's apparent he's not heading towards the door. Shoulders flex, producing a crack, as his thich arms wave in circles. Rhiamon looks back and smiles at Siomen, ""He's never any trouble.."" Aaron whispers to Rhiamon, ""... or..."" Jesyca gives a bow of her head towards him and smiles, ""Of course."" She then lifts up from the ground, and keeps her cloak closed about her body. Alyx approaches Abel, stepping into place beside him, though not saying anything. Arms cross over her chest, the woman simply waiting for something. Aaron replies to Rhiamon as he gets up to move to where the table is Keene makes a few more notes on his legal pad, then puts his pen away in his breast pocket. He picks up his notepad, slides it into his coat, and rises, heading out with everyone else. Rhiamon ouches, but quickly hugs Aaron. ""Luck"" Abel turns to Alyx and smiles. ""Can we talk later? I think The Beacon in the Dark may offer you a place with us, but I need to talk with the others. I know I'd like to see you Join. We have similar goals I think."" Alexandre remains seated where he is, thinking. Considering. He slides his seat away from the table, though. Aaron smiles and hugs Rhiamon back and replies, 'SKill.."" ""You have my cellphone number, brother,"" Alyx murmurs quietly to Abel. ""Call me when you have finished here, and we can talk then."" Rhiamon laughs. Siomen smiles as he moves to take back Geero ""Whats this?"" he inspects the necklace ""You going to keep care of that Geero?"" Rhiamon turns to Siomen, ""He better "" but smiles. ""I thought he deserved an ornament.."" Abel nods to Alyx. Alyx heads for the exit, filtering out silently. James gets up and makes his way out. Alyx steps back out to the main hall. Alyx has left. James steps back out to the main hall. James has left. Paksenarrion stretches a little and shoulders her burden, looking about once more before deciding which way to go.. Kaze sits quietly, unmoving in the Seat of Mind waiting for the post meeting discussion to begin. Aaron walks over to the table and uses the unoccupied seat of time to get up and walk on the table, settling himself cross-legged in the middle of it You step back out to the main hall."
IJ24L04,male,25,"P - Well, since Chase is the lead in this particular dance, he'll be concocting a special  brew of new fun chemi-yummies for Pobs to taste. There's gonna kick back, turn on the TV,  smoke sblue colored powder and think about shit -real- hard.   A - Cor 2/Prime 2 (Plasma Death)   T - Chase is opening Pobs up to a new path of Avatar relations, one not steeped in his  particular hermetic style. It's a self attunement that's rather baseless, but seems to tap  into the core just the same. Only nonspecific methods, none charted by previous magi.  Still chemical foci, as Pobs uses, just going about it's business in roads. Chase will  take Pob's avatar energy with him via the Cor foci, showing him distance and spacial  relatives. Then, the prime kicker will activate, and we'll send over plasma bolts into his  fuckin' brain.""     Cassius says ""17 total... hmm, minus the four... carry the 87... comes out to  about... 26 health levels.""  Pobble sits back, chews and repeatedly drags on an unlit cigarette. The repetition seems  to calm him and he stares off into the distance, with an expression that seems to be  slowly melting. The monkey on his lap looks up at him with sad blue eyes, holding onto one  of his hands and gently poking at the holes in his hands, as if trying to remind the  missing Deity of where to go to unleash its holy wrath on the crossfucking nonbeliever.   This is the zone Chase was telling you about. Static hissing in the background,  meth-sulfate mix hitting your spine. The thick man's in his plush chair in much the same  spell Pobs is. Some sweat beading upon his shaved scalp and gum chewing to some internal  clockwise beat. Every five point seven seconds, he remembers to breath and blink all at  once. Veins straining on his horse neck,he finally blows a bubble. *POP*   ""You feel, it eh. Como que no. Dios."" A single bead of sweat drips from Pobble's nose onto the monkey who scratches at his head  and goes to say something but thinks the better of it. Something in the air causes its fur  to bristle just a touch and an expectant grin begins to form on its lips. The smell of  paradox on the wind, the smell of the mother of all highs.  ""Indubidably."" murmers the good Doctor, silver fingernails glinting as he continues the  motion with precise timing. Sucking the cigarette, sucking the essence of Yahwe back to  his oh so hollow skull and a non lonely place. Angsty longing for the missing godhead  causes a twitch on his lip between drags, but it vanishes, succumbing to a merry sigh and  a moment with closed eyes.   Twitches start, like a cink in the system, one of Chase's lazy eyes squints up and  releases. ""Yeah. Fuckin' yeah."" Chin up when he looks to the skies, obscured by layers of  earth, concrete and mortar. ""I just keep chewing."" To nothing in particular as callused  hands shake up a glass vile containing reddish liquid. He inserts it into an air injection  unit and raises it behind his ear. ""Grounded kicker. It's the universe's spike, cabrone.""  The unit bites his skin with a hiss.    ""Dave gotta stay with me next week....p... pu.... puto."" Chase let's out a whisper.   A lighter is drawn from somewhere, its chrome muddied with blood from Steve's hand. He has  'em and he'll smoke em. Eyes that would be bloodshot if they weren't purest white flutter  and the man lets out a sigh as he exhales that first sweet drag. ""I'm not heading anyplace  anytime soon fucker. Not safe outside by my reakoning.""   Absently Chase hands over the kicker, still some red fluid to inject. ""Hit that. Main line  it, cabrone. We'll get... we'll get... the rest a you lot over..."" Starting to get woozy,  eyes close. His other nostril starts bleeding.  Wether its the sound of his name, or that scent in the air.. Dave scampers back and forth  on the Dr's lap. The monkey takes the shot and injects the willing Dr, then suckles at the  wound briefly. Its electrifying, the Monkey falling back onto the floor with a thump where  he starts convulsing and shaking with the grin of one who is terrifyingly euphoric."
IJ24L04,male,25,"Pobble's head falls back until he's able to view Abel.  ""Do you do?"" he asks, folding his arms across his chest. His right hand fingers crawl across his left hand to the wrist and rub there, flaking off what looks to be dried blood.  ""You should try. As a meeting ritual for our Cabal. Meet and greet.. I made it just for you..""  Abel shakes his head to Pob. ""'Fraid not, but, like, thanks for the offer. I gave all that up when I first left 'Frisco."" It doesn't look like he has fond memories of that part of his life.  This new abundance of objects appears to confuse Daisy. Surrounded in a landslide of smoking matterials, she makes feeble grabs out toward the joint. Finally, she catches hold of it, takes a single, long drag and passes it over toward Pobble.  ""No shit, you're from the Bay, too?"", she asks, then echoes, to Hiro, ""No shit. He's from the bay, too.""  Pobble takes the beast, managing to catch some falling burningness on his hand. Doesn't seem to bother him. He takes only a small draw, his eyes showing that perhaps he's already where he needs to be. Still, he makes another offer to Abel. ""We left Frisco too. Brought it with tho."" he scrunches up his nose again, sniffing before retracting the offer for long enough to have another small drag. ""Sure?""  Hiro's eyes appear to be crossing. He stares up at the field of stars, blinking slowly, and slowly sinks backwards onto his elbows; exhaling in a long, narrow stream. ""Zesty condiment, Pob my man,"" he congradulates the chemist, eyes rolling backwards to fix on a half-eclipsed approximation of Abel's eyes and forehead. ""From the bay,"" he declares, extending a fist towards Abel; presumably to be thumped. ""My -man-.""  Abel nods to Pob and grins. ""I'm sure."" He thumps Hiro's proffered fist.  Very well. The blue meanie heads on back to Hiro.  Hiro's hand twists away, accepts the indigo zeppelin with an overdramatic flourish. ""Muchos grassyass,"" he thanks Pobble, or -- perhaps -- merely states: the local choice of seating will result in a great deal of grassy asses. Another murderous drag, albeit slightly more casual, and he passes it off to Daisy again. ""Whatchoo on, anyway?"" he asks the punk girl, smoke curling out around the words.  ""Blue. Thing,"" Daisy says. Obviously, she's on some kind of coherent speech inhibitors.  Pobble grins up at the sky. ""Toldyaso."" he says. Something seems to occur to him at that moment and he rolls over onto his belly to stare at Abel. ""Where the hell did this Realm come from by the way?""  ""S'huge,"" Daisy comments. ""Hope the Nodes aren't here in Toronto.""   Abel shrugs and talks with Pob, though he seems just a bit confused and amused by Hiro and Daisy. ""Don't know. I think maybe one of the nodes are in Toronto, though.""  Hiro's eyes roll about in their sockets of their own volition. He waves a hand meaninglessly. ""Been thinking,"" he comments - uh oh; here it comes. His finger points, apparently to his surprise, at Abel. ""You know anything about gnosticism, m'man?"" Lovely. Completely lovely.  Pobble sighs semi-inaudiably and relaxes back onto his back. His eyes close and he zones out, concentrating only on the voices of those around him so that they are all that's real.  ""Fuckin' Gnosticism,"" Daisy agrees, bobbing her head in time with Hiro's inquiry.  Abel shrugs a little to Hiro. ""A little. Learning with the Chorus you pick up a bit on things like that."" He grins. ""What's the question?""  Hiro snaps his fingers in Daisy's direction, a nonverbal indication of her bogarting the furry blue wyrm. ""Ah, yeah,"" he continues, gaze rotating to fix on Abel again. ""So, the gnostic premise, right, is that the god that lords over us here, he's this like blind idiot type, right, like Cthulhu-style blind idiot god. Right. So. I was readin' the bible, 'cuz I blew the transformer outside our hotel and I was up, so - yeah. Dig: Genesis, right. All this shit about the earth and beasts'n, hell, Man takes a day just to cook up on his lonesome, for our great biochemist in the sky. But, like, no attention to the heavens. Totally glossed over. Firmament and all dat nonsense, you dig, but no mention of other worlds, other stars, et cetera et cetera."" He's obviously rambling; it'll be a bit before he gets to his point.  The furry blue thing is rapidly shrinking throughout Hiro's speech, as though she's resolved not to exhale until he's finished talking. Lungs hardened to bricks of ash and scar by chainsmoking, she's able to take in a surprising amount of smoke before exhaling.  Abel is sitting with the Invisible College. ""Well it's something like that,"" he answers Hiro.  Rhiamon wanders up the hill to the peak, from the cave beyond. Rhiamon has arrived.  Millia walks from the forest, carefully picking her way though it as she heads into the fields. She must be in a good mood as seh is humming softly to herself as she strolls along/  Rhiamon returns to the grasslands, and strolls along the established path, idling picking a stalk of grass, and swishing it through the night air.  Siomen steps out of the ruins with Geero in hand, he glances around slowly  ""So: islike,"" Hiro is sprawled out on the grass, snapping frantically at Daisy for the relinquishment of his furry blue joint. Pobble is kicked back somewhere near his feet, eyes closed and zoning out. He's speaking to Abel; struggling to convey some complex concept. ""Now, yeah, dig, I'm not an atheist or nothin', def. not gnostic, kinda a-gnostic, agnostic, you dig."" A-gnostic. Counter to thought. What an amusing slip. ""But, rez, maybe th' reason that gets glossed over in the bible is 'cuz this demiurge, this sub-god, the bloke who like mindlessly, needlessly tortures us, he only has dominion over the Earth. Right? You diggin' this? He glosses over the heavens, there's that whole lack o' data in the bible, 'cuz he doesn't recognize them. Because his vision is, wotsit, occluded. Pretty much every astronaut who's left Earth's talked 'bout this feeling'f immense peace, calm, they come back talking all this 'one world, one people' stuff, dig. Maybe they get in contact with the real deal up there, the over-god.""  Rhiamon waves her grass stalk to Millia and Siomen, never forgetting Geero, as they come into her field of vision.  Abel considers Hiro for a moment. ""Well, as a Monist, I believe in only One God... Men and women wrote the bible. And just because something may be missing from it doesn't mean it was never written or never there. There are gnostic books and all sorts of religious works out there that never made it into the bible. The Chorus looks at Gilgamesh as one of theirs and he deffinitely traveled to other worlds.""  Millia seeing Abel and Rhiamon smiles and waves to them both. She stops just behind Abel listening in on the current topic of conversation.  Siomen nods to Rhiamon and smiles, he glances to the others and tilts his head, only catching part of the conversation at hand, sounds interesting.  Abel reaches a hand over his shoulder for Millia to take and smiles at her. ""Hey Millia, The One's peace be with you."" He nods to Siomen. ""Hey Siomen, Geero, long time no see.""  Hiro mulls this over wordlessly, eyes returning to the starry void overhead.   ""Stephenson -- Neal Stephenson, you dig. He cloaked the entire concept in science fiction, but he believed that the old testament was guarded religiously, so to speak, kinda like, keepin' backups. Maintaining clean data. They tried't again at the end'f the bible, unnerstand: the whole 'pox upon thee' spiel to dis-dis-uh-courage, discourage people from altering the data. You think the information quarantine, the whole upkeep of the torah and the old testament broke down? That it's 'dirty' now, rez -- infected with opposing memes?""  Kid's totally out of it. It's doubtful he's noticed the new arrivals.  ""On account of they're outside the range of the Sphere of the Archons. Dig: they call them the Lords of the Air. Satan. One of his titles is: 'Lord of the Upper Air'. Maybe it's vacuum,"" Daisy speculates. She's really reaching here; she waves the joint in the air, as though clearer thoughts could be summoned up from its vapour.   After a contemplative moment, she continues: ""You plot all this shit out in gematria -- I don't do gematria, mostly, my man Hiro here does gematria -- and you come up with this: YHVH is balanced. In Y-H-V-H, Yod has a value of ten billion: the apotheotic ten. 10^10. Look that up on the charts, and you find it's a multiple of the firmament; the air itself. Hod has a value of the apotheotic eight. That's the same value as Earth. Which is why Y and H are together. Y-H. Heaven and Earth. V-H are his lesser domains: the fire and the waters, one of which he created the djinn out of, and the latter of which he moved upon. God moved upon the waters. No power over the waters, dig? On account of that he had to get them out of his way. Which is why when you're in a bathtub full of ice water or in space, the Archons can't see you.""  Daisy is speaking at the same time as Hiro. It's difficult to pick out either's words.  ""But all those are false elements. Which is why 'Elohim' -- six letters -- is the true name of God. Yod-heh-vau-heh is a decoy for idiots.""  Siomen continues to listen to the conversation and frowns as he tries to puzzle out what the guy is going on about, he nods to Abel ""it has been awhile""  Geero is totally fixated on the stalk and attempts to swat at it like a kitten.   Rhiamon grins, and weaves a figure of eight with the grass round Geero's paws, watching him swat at it. ""Siomen ? I think his reflexes are improving..""  Siomen smiles ""you've noticed, i have been trying to improve his gear systems little by little, but he is actully doing half the improving himself, like a child learning and tracking familiar patterns""  Millia takes Abel's hand smiling using it as a balance as she sits down with the group, ""May the One's peace be with you as well. Interesting topic of discussion today.""  Pobble looks pretty comatose.  Out of it for sure. Sleeping. A big throaty snore bursts from his lips and wakes him with a start. He sits up straight, having the grace to look embarrassed. He whistles to himself, very very quietly and shuffles back in the little group to make room for any potential sitting newcommers. ""I agree wholeheartedly."" he comments. A nod. A cigarette. Bosh.  Abel continues to consider Hiro and Daisy, and looking like he's enjoying the amount of thought going into the discussion. ""Like, I'm afraid I don't know Gematria but I know some people who do in kind of an off hand way. And I've never read this stephenson guy. I don't know if the Bible and Torah were quarentined like you say, but if they were suposed to be, then with Translation, yeah it's been 'dirtied.' Part of the reason the translation to the vulgate from latin was because the information might be changed... not because, like, it was putting the info away from the priests and clergy to the masses.  Rhiamon beams at Geero, and rubs his head affectionately, adding absently, ""And it wasn't written in Latin to start with. That was a couple of translations down the line...""  Abel shakes his head. ""I don't think that was the main reason, Siomen. Orthodoxy is tricky stuff. Maybe some thought that way, though.""  Hiro's head twists, his eyes roll, and this all comes to a head in some kind of half-assed focusing upon Siomen. ""Nrrrgh,"" he ammends eloquently, undergoing a convolution of limbs to carpe malus: seizing Pobble's cigarette from between his fingers, and taking a prolonged, soddening drag before carelessly handing it back. ""You should dig on Gematria, Abel-man,"" he recommends. ""Shit. Fuckin' -- shit, yeah, and Stephenson. Memes-as-demons, man. Crazy."" And he collapses back into the grass.  ""Its all like that movie."" Pob interjects. ""With the guy who sees the bleeding woman in mehico.. an the bloody woman on the bed, and in the tube train."" He nods, making perfect sense to himself. A big drag on that cigarette. The short sleep seems to have regressed his consciousness stakes just a little bit.  Rhiamon looks at Pobble, ""Stigmata ?""  A big drag on nothing, since Hiro steals the cigarette just as he goes to smoke. Pobble doesn't notice. He looks to Rhiamon, ""Where? Oh. Right. Yeah. Maybe.""  Siomen looks at Abel ""well think about it, most religions were not even born until Christianity was converted to English, mostly because the common man had never the choice to follow anything else. When Christianity was Latin, the common man listened to this priest and went, ok, i don't understand what he is saying, what he must be saying is right since God is who he follows. They followed because they believed what they were listening too was the correct path, Even if to them it was gibberish. When they actully converted it to English or Latin became a more common language to the populace, religions were born because people finally had a choice.. no i don't want to follow christianity because now i understand that i don't agree with the views""  ""Look, it's easy to prove,"" Daisy says to Abel, as though explaining simple math to a child. The joint wobbles between her fingers and nearly falls into the pile of cigarettes at her feet. She's nodding as though she agrees. After a moment, she begins in on the explanation:  ""The nature of matter is reproduction and degeneration. The, uh, heresiarch"" -- she seems uncertain about the pronunciation of that word ""-- the heresiarch Valentinius wrote 'Mirrors and fatherhood are deplorable, on account of they unnecessarily reproduce the material world'. He meant that the reproduction of material things degrades its essence. So if the essence of the Bible is reproduced into many forms, its essence becomes degraded, even if the words don't change. Which is why, uh, mass production is, uh, destroying nature; the Platonic essence, the ur-object, is being, uh, spread into these /objects/, man, and --""  She stops.  ""-- shit. Where was I?""  Rhiamon rolls her eyes slightly, ""Christianity isn't exactly an old religion..""  ""You were giving me that joint,"" prompts Hiro, having totally lost the thread of conversation.  Pobble takes the cigarette back from Hiro and promptly drops it with a coughing fit. He looks at Siomen. ""Say what? Most religeons were not pre-english Christianity?"" he sounds incredulous, and cockney. Similar to how street vendors in london sound when they ask you who else would have such incredible deals.  Siomen glances at Pobble ""I took christianity as an example you can place the same ideals on other religions too, and expecually look at the ones where it is not known to general populations, like witchdoctors in tribes, the whole tribe follows what a witch doctor perscribes because they have no clue how he is getting his information and so assumes it the right path because they do not understand it""  Rhiamon looks at the people sprawled on the grass. ""I take it you're Invisible College members..?"" she enquires.  Pobble nods vigourously, streching his legs back out as he sucks the last of the cigarette. Reaching up at this opposite angle, he plucks the last of the blue meanie from Daisy's fingers and hands it off to the pawing Hiro. ""Indeed we are."" His smile widens, ""How on earth did you guess?"" it continues to widen, until threatening to split his face before realizing its overstepped its bounds and relaxing.  ""Of course, this isn't all of us.""  Hiro had given up on the endeavor; slumping back down into the grass. It's very likely that his eyes are, in fact, literally wobbling -- a kind of lazy decaying orbit wobble -- in their sockets; scrutinizing the joint suddenly delivered into his hands. Why didn't he just snatch it up himself? ""Much obligated,"" he mutters at Pobble. Obliged? Settling into place, he begins the decimation of the beast.  Rhiamon says ""Well, there's two new cabals in town, 's far as I can tell. One Eastern, one not. You don't look eastern to me.."". She turns back in time to twith the stalk from Geero's hand, and grins as he beeps indignantly at her.  ""Sorry matey, but I notice we're being rude. Didjoo want any of the blueness?"" he makes a vague gesture to the side, the wrong side. Correcting himself he motions to the large blue beast that Hiro has in his possession.  Rhiamon shakes her head, ""No thanks. I work in language. Don't like it smothered..  Pobble wrinkles his nose at that.  Pobble says something in a language you don't understand.   ""Neurolinguistic,"" it's amazing Hiro gets that word off, ""programming?"" The question has a hopeful slant to it; he probably wants someone to rant at about 'deep structures'. Daisy thought those were subterranean houses. The blue meanie is nearly decimated, now, anyway; he passes it off to Pobble.  Rhiamon raises an eyebrow. ""I noticed a deterioration in your pronunciation a while back.""  Pobble it seems just wanted to show off his cognitive abilities. He looks pretty wasted, but then you saw him earlier. He seems both more and less wired now. He sucks on the corpse of the joint in silence.  Rhiamon raises an eyebrow. She says something in a language you don't understand.   ""That was choice of essence. I should reiterate. Language is hardly smothered by the intake of *all* foreign essence. Look at musical genius and Shakespeare's psychoactive habit,  sayeth Pobble.  Hiro looks between the two, entirely flabbergasted, and shrugs wordlessly. He collapses back into the grass, eyes rolling back in his head.  Rhiamon shrugs. ""I'm not used to taking foreign substances. Well..except for mead.""  Pobble says, ""There's a lot to be said for it. A whole kaboodle. Its effects on the thought structures have a great impact on reality potential."" A phone starts ringing from within one of Dr Steve's pockets. He reaches in and extracts it, the ring tone has a techno vibe to it and is sampled. One of those overly fancy and expensive phones. ""Hallo?"" he says into the device. ""Oi oi monks."" Nodding follows, with some muttering, and Pobble stands up. ""Shit.""  Pobble brushes himself down and tosses the last of the blue meanie to Hiro. ""Pigboy, I need to go and pick up my Monkey. He's double parked in the box and has spotted encroaching police personages."
IJ24L04,male,25,"Suburbs - Bella Figura Ristorante          Italians have an exuberance for food not matched by many. Carefully and lovingly prepared, it's elevated to the same level as lovemaking and religion - and Italians know how to eat and savor their food. Meals in Italy can begin at noon and sometimes find people still gathered around the table at six in the evening, lingering through the last course of pastry, wine and conversation. Their philosophy is, if you eat well, you feel well - and if you feel well, all's well with the world.         The perfect romantic ambiance can be found here at Bella Figura. That same detail to the food can be found in the dark woods that panel the walls where gas-lit torches flicker providing dim lighting, and cozy intimate seating becomes reality in the use of potted plants that seem to enclose some of the tables into their own little world. Once seated, your server will light the candle set in the middle of your table before taking your order from a menu of elegant and fine Italian cuisine. Soft music is often provided by a wandering guitarist who will gladly serenade your table for a few minutes as they circle the room.                               'places' Set                                Contents: Lori Obvious exits: Private Door PD  Out O  Lori is already here, picking at a piece of bread that was set before her when she was seated. She seems a wee bit spacey... But otherwise mostly all right. There's a coke in front of her since she couldn't produce the necessary ID. Of course, you won't be able to see this until you get to where the table is in view.  Pobble wanders into the restaurant, looking almost sharp eyed. Not that his bleech blues aren't glossy, but some combination seems to be keeping him focused as he strolls purposefully across to the hostess, murmering quiet words to her. In response she guides him across to Lori's table where after flashing one of his more charming smiles, he slides down into the space opposite her. ""Evenin'.""  Lori smiles up at Pobble. ""Hey, you made it... Try the bread, it's really good. I was doing my level best not to tear into it. I'm starving. How're you?"" Lori reaches for her soda with a slow motion as though she might be a bit stiff.  Pobble's elbows rest on the table, a lazy silver tipped hand reaching for the bread as recommended. He eyes you curiously as he moves a plate over, pulling off a chunk with a spray of crumbs. ""I'm decent. What about you? Everything alright?""  Lori nods and sips her soda. ""Yeah... not bad."" She smiles beatifically for a second at him, clearly not a hundred percent sober to the trained eye. ""How's life as an outlaw?"" She reaches for a piece of bread and pops a bit in her mouth.  The waitress appears, enquiring about drinks and appetizers. Pobble gives you a sidelong questioning look before turning to the woman with a warm smile. ""Wine, surprise me. A good red."" A quick glance to the menu at his side and he adds, ""Motzarella sticks. Anything for you Lori?""  Lori thinks about it, ""Calamari, please,"" she tells the server and gives her a brief smile before focusing on Pobble again. Her elbows are on the table too, and when she gets done munching the piece of bread she props her chin on her hands. The server heads off, picking her way towards the kitchen and Pobble's attention returns to the girl opposite him. His smile is crooked, considering her in silence for a long moment as he absently pulls apart the bread. ""I wasn't aware that I was an outlaw.""  Lori shrugs at him. ""Y'look like one. Y'act like one."" Her voice is somewhat lazy, posessed of a distinct southern drawl at times. Lori's brilliant green eyes blink serenely.  Pobble waves his glinting fingertips dismissively, reaching for the plate of garlic and liberally dousing it with oil. ""Nah, not so much. Used to with my modified trashcan on me noggin, but those days are long gone. Bloody Aussies got wise to me."" A small smirk at the deadpan humour, bread soaking up the extra virgin fluid. ""So, Miss Researcher. He ask you to pull me over and dig a little, or is this a purely social visit?""  ""Miss Researcher...?"" Lori looks a little confused but continues slowly, ""A little bit of both, but mostly me wanting to hang with you. Both of us are really curious, though."" She shrugs and watches you as if you were a particularly engrossing film, the little glints of light coming off of your fingers and such catching her attention.  Pobble nods slowly, taking a bite from the dripping bread and half smiling appreciatively. Settling back he retains a pensive look, twisting the loaf fragment between his fingers. ""I see."" he murmers distractedly, again lapsing into silence as he tries to figure you out and not seeming to make much progress. ""What about me makes you curious then?""  Lori drops one of her hands to the table so that she's just leaning on one, her cheekbone braced against the heel of her hand. ""Uhm... mostly? I don't know. I think that's what drives me crazy."" Shrug. ""You're kinda nice to be around, is all. I mean, not... /nice/, because nice is boring... But, uhm."" Shrug.  ""I see."" Pobble seems mildly amused, finishing the last of the hunk and not going for another quite yet. Adjusting his seating, any reply is delayed by the arrival of his wine and the appetizers. Once the server has gone, he repositions his elbows on either side of the plate before him, pulling his glass slowly across the table. ""Just my incredible charisma then eh?"" he asks, grin widening.  Lori frowns at him. ""You're making fun of me.""  Pobble laughs quietly, ""Not at all."" Pale eyes roll, wine lifted and swilled carefully around the glass, brought back over the plate in contemplation of drinking it. ""I diddn't take you as being so uptight."" he teases, a nail tapping against the glass with a strange sound. ""Sorry.""  Lori sighs. ""I'm not uptight, it's just..."" She shakes her head, causing the pigtails to bounce about enthusiastically. ""Forget it. Hard to explain."" Finally she sits back and grabs a fork to start digging into the squid. Mmmm... squid.  Pobble doesn't seem too eager to pick at the sticks, taking a long sip from the wine instead and nodding appreciatively, the tip of his tongue pulling a stray drop from his lower lip. ""See now you've got me curious."" He grins lopsidedly, but lets the subject drop. Wine is set back down. ""So..""  Lori shrugs her shoulders and says, ""Look, people assume lotsa stuff about me, and some of it's true and some of it ain't. I'm not that hard to figure out... Well... maybe."" She offers an uncertain smile. ""About as hard as you, I figure.""  Pobble smirks, ""From what I gather you're having a hard time of that so it can't be that simple."" He shrugs, lazily leaning back against the booth. ""I'm not assuming anything, that always spoils the surprises."" His finger curls around the stem of the glass, wrist resting on the edge of the table.  Lori nods her head a few times and dips some calamari into marinara. ""Not hungry, particularly?"" she asks, green eyes peering up at him unabashedly for the moment.  ""A little I guess."" Pobble is prompted to acting, selecting one of the fried cheese sticks and lifting it towards him. ""I'm on a diet."" he adds, unable to supress the smile. A bite is taken, cheese stringing out as he pulls the morsel back. Chew chew chew. ""Not been here for a while.. Not bad is it.""  Lori snorts at you. ""Diet... like hell. If you get any skinnier I'll be able to beat the crap out of you. Then you'd be all embarrassed you got your ass beat by a girl."" She pushes the plate of fried squid forward in offer in case you want some. Pobble shakes his head, the peice in his hand waved in a help yourself-to-mine gesutre. The last of the chunk is popped between his lips, the pause resulting from chewing the thick and chewy cheese goodness. ""I just can't help it. Blame it on a hyperactive metabolism.""  Lori mumbles, ""...or a really keen smack habit."" She's at least halfway teasing you. ""No offense, but I'm blaming the smack."" Her fingers snake out to snag a mozarella stick which she promptly dunks in marinara.  ""Never been a big fan of the smack."" he half grins, ""Although once I hit middle age, slow down and start to balloon I'll probably consider it."" Either way, he doesn't seem in much of a hurry to continue his food, taking the wine in hand once more. ""What about you then Lori? From what you said the other night, I take it you're a clean straight arrow?""  Lori snorts softly. ""Yeah... I'm a real straight arrow..."" She shakes her head and looks out at the restaurant, what she can see of it from here. Fingers absently rub crumbs from each other. ""Not anymore. Used to be a bit.""  Pobble raises a brow, ""You used to be a bit straight?"" Amused he shuffles along the booth to the corner, resting a thigh along the seat and placing his glass upon it. ""How come you and Sam don't get along?"" he enquires nonchalantly.  Lori reaches up to use the fingernail on her pinky finger to brush aside a couple of wisps of hair not caught up in her pigtails. ""Because she's a whore and she pisses me off,"" Lori answers easily, reaching for her coke. She shrugs and adds, ""She's Damian's girlfriend, so it's like having Yoko fucking Ono in the house all the time.""  ""You all live together?"" Pobble asks, only a mild trace of surprise in his tone. Boot hanging in the air shifts to tap against the table support, the movement bringing ripples to the surface of his wine. ""Sounds like a recipie for drama.""  Lori just rolls her eyes and makes a frustrated sound in her throat. Hauling off and screaming obscenities right now probably wouldn't go over so well with the management. ""Fucking hell it is,"" she agrees quietly.  Pobble tries not to smirk, but doesn't do a terribly good job of it. A lazy free hand rises to scratch a patch of tattooed skin at the edge of his goggles. He continues to stare evenly across the table, ignoring the usual conversational choice of looking away every now and then. Manners aren't his strong point after all. ""Why not find a place of your own then?""  Lori shakes her head. ""What, and live in some rathole I can barely afford eating ramen noodles every night and going to sleep praying that the stray bullets won't clip me in the head while I sleep? No thanks. Did that, and I didn't like it.""  Pobble raises a thin brow, not ceasing the tapping of his foot. A swig from the wine proceeds the question, ""Doesn't pay well then does he?"" Subsequently the beverage is drained, empty glass set down unevenly and wobbling before it comes to rest.  Lori shrugs. ""He pays fine. It's not like it's all about money or anything either. We're friends. That counts a lot more. I know if something goes wrong, Damian will never leave me hanging. And I'll never leave him hanging, either. You can't buy that with money.""  ""Very true."" Pobble seems intrigued, musing quietly as he studies you. It's maybe one of those awkward silences, although the blue haired chemist doesn't look awkward. He steeples his hands in his lap, the beat of his fingertips tapping in counterpoint to the rapping of boot on table leg.  Lori watches you unblinkingly from across the table as you dissect her and try to take her apart and put her back together again. She's fairly used to that kind of thing, but the silence starts getting to her after a while. ""What? What're you thinkin?""  Pobble shakes his head, a braid sliding over his shoulder and the sharp point of a cable tie poking at his neck. He doesn't seem to care, smiling wryly as he offers a shrug. ""Just trying to figure things out."" he murmers in reply, glossy pale blue eyes unrelenting in their stare. He blinks, a cue to change his position, straightening back out and setting elbows back on table, idly touching the edges of his plate with glinting fingertips. ""So, where'd you guys come from before swaggering into our quiet little town?""  Lori murmurs with a smile, ""Nah, I ain't gonna talk all day about me and them."" She looks kind of sad for a minute then reaches out to pick up her coke to sip at it in a thoughtful silence.  Pobble's brows moves towards a frown, not at the reply but the moment after it. He doesn't seem to care about the rebuttal, the plate before him slowly rorating with the pressure of his fingertips. ""Fair enough."" A brief pause before the follow up. ""What's the matter?""  Lori sets her glass down then scrunches into the corner of the booth and starts digging into her pockets. She shakes her head and gets a pack of cigarettes out. Once she gets one out of the pack she throws the rest down for you to take one if you want. Now she's gotta hunt through a bunch of other pockets to find a lighter. ""I wish there was a fucking Hallmark card to say what I was thinking. It just gets so goddamned stupid after a while. 'Roses are red, violets are blue. I'm never honest. How about you?'""  Pobble laughs, only briefly. A zippo is easily pulled from his jacket pocket, handed over and taking one of your smokes with the same movement. ""That seems to be one thing about this place. It's full of secrets."" The smile that forms on his lips is a curious one, pensive yet entertained, as if mulling over some hidden intrigue that proves his statement.  ""Blah blah blah,"" Lori answers, taking the zippo so she can light up the smoke. Afterwards she hands the flame back across to you. Two on a match is okay. ""The whole world is full of secrets.""  Pobble puffs the smoke to life, holding the nicotine laced haze in his lungs over long before releasing it from his nose. ""Maybe."" Eyes search lazily for an ashtray as he already moves for a second drag. Another one of those pauses finds a way to break into the conversation, ""If your lies make you uncomfortable, why not just be honest?"" The expression on blue-hair's face makes it obvious that he doesn't see this as a likely option, but it's something to fill the dead air.  Lori shakes her head. ""Never said I lie, just that I ain't honest. And that's a different thing."" The girl licks her lips, tasting the nicotine. ""I dunno, I don't expect you to understand."" Frown. ""I'm a sorry sack 'o shit, ain't I. Oh, well."" She ashes her cigarette at the ashtray and says, ""Well, Doctor Steve, thanks for coming out and having a snack with me."" She reaches into a pocket to pull out some money and starts flipping through it. ""Probably I oughta go so I don't depress the shit out of -both- of us.""  Pobble waves a hand at the attempted payment, ""I got it."" he murmers amidst a slow exhalation. ""It was certainly.. interesting? Thanks for inviting me."" The Doctor looks more perplexed than anything, entirely unsure of the whole event. ""Next time we'll stick to less depressing topics eh?"" The small pillar of ash is removed from his cigarette, barely making it to the ashtray. ""You can come talk to me anytime you're depressed though, that's what Doctors are for right?""  Lori stubs out her cigarette after a last drag and shoves her money away except for a few dollars for a tip. There. And she wriggles out of the booth, but instead of walking off she swings around to the other side of it to sit next to you.  Pobble raises a brow, half confused, half amused. Bemused is probably the word. Angling himself around, he looks at you with tilted head, a strand of stray blue hanging over his goggles to tickle above his eye. The brow twitches but his hands stay in his lap. ""You came back soon.""  Lori shrugs and smiles up at you. ""I needed a new perspective."" She looks across the way at her vacated seat for a few moments before focusing on you again. Her voice drops down low and she murmurs, ""I'm sorry I can't give you all the information you want. I don't even know if you're trying to hurt him or not. I think maybe you are, and that kind of upsets me, but... nothing I can do about that right now. I like you, Pobs, but I'm real... scared, in a way.""  The topic change definately straightens Pobble out, shoulder resting against the seat back as he frowns. Fingers seem uncertain of what to do, almost tapping but not sure if they should. With the cigarette hanging precariously from his lips, the smoke curls up around his head, a thin hazy veil between the two. It's plucked after a moment, allowing speech. ""I'm not Trying to hurt him."" he admits, his tone quiet. ""But, why are you scared?""  Lori stuffs her hands together in her lap, wedging them between her knees which makes her slouch forward some. ""I don't know. Isn't that crazy? I think it's because everything's in flux. My life is pretty clear in some ways, but in others I get really seriously confused."" She lifts her head so she can look at you, those green eyes looking mildly bloodshot up close though no less luminous.  Pobble lightly taps your arm with the back of his hand, smiling trying to be reassuring maybe. It's passable. ""I'd ask what confuses you but I doubt I'd get any comprehensible answer."" he says slowly, seeming resigned to the facts. ""Aren't things always in flux in this line of work, at least to some degree? Or is this something else?""  Lori reaches up to scratch at her temple with a few long fingernails that are somewhat chipped and could use a good emory board. ""Well, yeah, I mean you're right about that... Things are generally always in flux. But I mean me, personally."" She sighs and rubs the table surface, digging the texture there. ""See, this is what happens when I don't work enough."" She beams a quick smile. ""I start thinkin'."" She lays her head on your shoulder unless you just dodge out of the way. ""I also shouldn't go around this high, but I can't seem to help it lately. I just wanna float away.""  Pobble's smile is small and secret, out of view of Lori with her head rested down, formed around the pulling of the last drag on the cigarette. An arm is extended, keeping his back against the booth to stub the butt. Back in his lap, fingertips fidget against the gloves that half cover his hands. ""What's so bad to think about?"" he coaxes softly, sounding concerned.  Lori lifts her head once more and yawns, pushing some strands of hair away from her face. ""Fate,"" she says, stretching her spine. It cracks a few times, and she winces. ""Ungh."" One hand reaches up to rub her shoulder. ""Cause sometimes even when you know something's gonna be bad you do it anyway. Dumb, huh?""  Pobble studies the girl's motions as if somehow the examination will bring some clarity to the vageries. Doesn't seem to, but he appears to get the gist of the sentiment if not the details behind it. He doesn't move that much, apart from the uneasy drug afflicted shifting of extremeties. ""That's human nature."" he comments, a flicker of amusement pulling at a corner of his lips. ""We're all fucking stupid on some level.""  Lori looks up and laughs at his comment, finding that to be funny and apt. ""Nice. Yeah, we are. But you're pretty cool, Pobble. Oh, well. If you get bored, or need a date or just want someone to get high with, you can call me."" She nods at him and starts wrigging out of the booth. ""It's cool.""  ""Maybe I'll do that."" Pobble replies, half smiling, distracted by thoughts. As an afterthought he adds, ""I guess you're alright."" this pushing his smile wider. He twists again, leaning back against the far wall of the booth, stretching a leg out into the space of your absence, apparently not intending to leave quiet yet. ""Be good.""  Lori snorts at you in amusement. ""Yeah... I'm alright..."" She shakes her head at you and lifts her hand. ""See you later, Pobble. Pretty sure I'll be seein ya soon."" She shrugs and stuffs her hands in her pockets and starts moseying for the door. Before she gets out of earshot she says, ""Thanks for the dinner."" And there she goes, wandering off to god only knows where."

0Y4KBSK,male,26,"July 19, 2003		Saturday  	Moved in bright and early this morning.  We are never going to be able to fill up all this space.  We kept having to remind ourselves we are only going to be here for one semester so that we wouldn’t buy all kinds of knick-knacks and furnishings.  “Rubbish” as Gareth would say.  FINALLY got to unpack our suitcases.  Good feeling.  My closet has the oddest arrangement of shelve compartments.  There are 3 sliding mirror doors, and some of the shelves can’t be accessed easily no matter which door is opened.  This will prove to be a pain in the arse. 	First order of business was to hit the mall for supplies.  We planned on making two trips since we could only buy as much as we could carry.  Luckily, we ran into Sean, Michelle, etc. at Target and they offered to take home what we had bought already.  They are being really great to us.  We are starting to feel bad when they do things for us.  This helped out a lot because we wouldn’t have had time to come back to get groceries like we had planned.  Everything here closes so damn early!!  Stores close at 5:30 or 6 PM during the week.  Thursday is know as “Late night shopping” day so the stores stay open until 9 PM and judging by the number of people out, it’s a BIG deal.  Second order of business was to clean.  The place was recently renovated (it had just been painted a few days before).  That took a bit of work.  No one had ever cleaned on top of the cabinets…until me, that is.   Mom would be proud. 	Houses here don’t have any central heat or air conditioning.  It is winter here, remember.  It still gets pretty cold at night.  We all bought a blanket (for $5 Aus., not bad), but that wasn’t going to be enough.  Michelle left us an electric heater, which is great, but the girls get to keep that in their room.  Luckily, Michelle also brought down some old comforters which did a great job…as long as I stay in bed.  The rest of the house is still a freaking popsicle in the mornings.  Colder inside than outside.  And the way the house is oriented, it gets virtually no direct sunlight so the house never warms up.  That’s good in the summertime, I imagine, but sucks right now.  Only the back extra room (we have so many rooms some of them don’t even have names) gets sun so that one room is warm in the afternoon, while the other side of the house is freezing.  I’m going to have to buy a little heater.  I hope they aren’t too expensive."
0Y4KBSK,male,26,"July 28, 2003		Monday  Today was the start of what is shaping up to be a really busy week.  Classes start this week, and we get to play tourist with Gareth for the next 10 days (yeah!).  As far as classes go, things are the same, but different if that makes any sense.  I’ve always known how lucky we are to go to a) a school in the States, and b) a school with the resources and facilities like UT.  Being here really makes me appreciate even our crappy classrooms.  The school isn’t dirty or anything, it’s just small with very odd design features.  The desks in my first class made me feel like I was in a 747.  A row of individual, but connected, seats with a desk that folds down from the seat in front of you.  Once you’re in, you’re in…there is no getting up unless you want to make the entire row of people fold up their desks and stand up to let you out.  It’s really funny watching everyone trying to get into the elevators (“lifts” here) before class because no one seems to get the concept of getting to class early so EVERYONE is trying to get upstairs at the same time.  I was let in on a little secret by one of the students, though.  Turns out that only 3 of the 6 elevators actually works. Fun.  The elevators are also the most impatient ones I’ve ever seen.  You really have to be on your toes or you could lose them.  Some of the students were saying there was an elevator in the library that routinely opens up mid-floor and has sudden drops.  Who needs Astroworld with rides like that?  I’ve added another entry on my list of businesses I could bring here and make a fortune (I can’t really remember the rest of the list right now so don’t ask).  They really need a system to handle used textbooks.  They have a secondhand bookstore on campus (good),  but apparently nobody uses it (bad).  This kind of thing doesn’t work if nobody uses it.  The regular campus bookstore doesn’t buy back used books.  You can’t even get your money back if you return books, even the next day!  Store credit is SO lame.  I still haven’t gotten a good answer as to what everyone does with their old books.  They can’t possibly keep them all, and I can’t imagine that every single person puts up little flyers all over the place.  The books must end up in the same place as socks from the dryer and Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction."
0Y4KBSK,male,26,"Listen to what a moron I am….  I’ve had been working on this paper for one of my classes for about a week.  I even stayed home while everyone else in the house went to Port Stephens (could there BE a better name for a port?).  After much struggle trying to reach the 6,000 word limit (which isn’t a lot, really), I finally decide 5,200 is good enough.   Before cleaning it up, I checked our syllabus to figure out how to turn it in (that story later…).  While I’m scanning the page I see, “The word limit for this essay is 3,000 WORDS”!!!!!  I had 3,000 words 3 days before!!!  Dejected, I decided to have dinner first.  Then I spent the next 4 hours (and part of the next morning) trying to cut my paper down.  I finally got it to 3,100 and stopped.    So I go to turn the paper in (cue theme music)…Another way Australia is backwards (I think I’ll trademark that phrase and start a newspaper column or TV show…)  Well, probably not Australia so much as UNSW.  The professor says to turn in the paper at the main reception desk of the law school so we can get a receipt.  This makes sense.  We turn in papers at the communications desk at UTLaw for the same reason—get things time/date stamped and what not.  But no…things can’t work that way at UNSW.  First, no one is at the desk (Small tangent…The counter closes for lunch!  No staggering of lunch breaks or covering by other folks in the office here, no sir!  Who cares if students need something?  Back to the story…)  No problem, I says.  I’ll just ring the little bell (yes…there is a little bell).  Oh, no I won’t.  There is a handwritten sign that says “If you are turning in an assignment, do not ring the bell.”  How helpful.  Underneath the counter is a slit in the desk labeled “Assignments”.  I looked into the slot and saw an enormous Salvation Army-type bin.  There was all kinds of stuff in there—essays, applications, letters.  All just tossed in this big wooden bin.  Just as I was about to drop my essay in the slot (I had forgotten to put my class, prof’s name, etc. on it), I saw a little stack of forms.  From what I was able to figure out, you fill out the little form (prof’s name, class #, word count, student id) and staple it to your essay.  Then you toss it into the abyss and hope the capable staff sorts it out.  No receipt.  No time stamp.  I’d rather slide it under a professor’s door or something."
0Y4KBSK,male,26,"I am entering what is most likely the last final exam period of my life.  Why am I so sad?  Probably because I am a nerd at heart and love going to school.  Now THAT is something to be sad about!  I finally saw a copy of the law school yearbook the other day.  My copy is waiting for me on main campus, which is why I still don't have it.  I'll wait untill more of the great unwashed masses of undergrads skedaddle for the summer before getting over there.  Anyway, the reason I mention it is because I have once again managed to be virutally nonexistant in the book.  Going back to high school, I've had this knack for being very involved in school, but not being anywhere in the year book.   The worse one was when I was the lead in the senior play, and the play did not get a single page in the annual!  I gave a tour de force performance, dammit!  This time it isn't so bad.  I'm just missing from the group pictures of every organiza tion I belong to.  Same thing will happen next year, even for SROC!  Somewhere along the line I developed this complex about being recognized for what I do and I somehow have tied recognition to appearance in a year book.  I don't know what I'm going to do when I'm out of school.  Maybe I'll start my own :)  I'll be a little slow for the next couple of weeks due to finals.  I plan on writing a bit about what I wish I had done in law school for any of you that are just starting out, so check back.  Wish me luck!"

After a quick lunch of fish & chips (again), we decided to take the grown-up house. 	We did MORE walking around Coogee.  The beach is really nice, and the weather was beautiful.  It has been easy to forget that it is Winter here. 	Michelle, her husband Sean, and their two kids Amber (7) and Lockland (1) live upstairs.  They have a separate entrance in the back.  All of us are hoping this doesn’t turn ugly.  Michelle assures us she won’t be butting into what we do because she “remembers what being at uni was like.”  I wonder what they do? 	Bought my Eddie Izzard tickets.  All the other shows were almost sold out so he added a show on my birthday.  I had to decide between tickets for all three of us in the upper balcony, or 2 tickets in row J.  It’s my birthday, the girls don’t even know who Izzard is…I went for row J.  I figure I’ll try to find a nice British girl who knows Izzard to go with me."

Until then, though, I've got some take home exams to tackle.  I just got my final trial out of the way today, but still have this stupid paper to do.  You can see I can't go crazy just quite yet.  I'll try to keep up with things over the next few weeks, but no guarantees.  Then again, what does it matter?  I'm the only one that reads this anyway...:)"

When people asked me where I was from, I always answered with a proud and emphatic, ""Texas."" (with an added twang if I felt like messing with 'em)  This time, Texas was an afterthought.  I was headed Home.    Home to my truck.  Home to my ranch. (I know you were wondering...The answer is yes, you can get more stereotypically Texan than owning a truck and living on a ranch.)  Home to chicken fried steaks, Whataburger, and free local phone calls.  Home to  real  lemonade, Eggo waffles, and Totino's Pizzas.

I wanted to drive my new car around some more before I tow the trailer with it, but it seems unhitching the trailer is significantly harder when it's full of stuff.  I did finally get someone to come with me, one of my best friends from high school.  The only thing that sucks is that is new manager at work wouldn't let him take an extra day off without finding someone to cover for him, which he wasn't able to do.  Apparantly, there aren't many people who work 8am to 6pm who wouldn't mind working 2pm to 2am.  Who knew?  We'll be leaving sometime around 1am tonight, then breakfast and lunch with somefriends of mine in Dallas.  Wednesday afternoon we'll head to Amarillo and as much further as we can get before we get tired.  Thursday will get us to Santa Fe and Taos, NM and all the way to Denver by nightfall.  If we make good time on Wednesday, we may be able to push a few more hours past Denver.  On Friday, we'll have a long stretch (about 10 hours) from Denver to Salt Lake City, Utah.

Jesse B. Muckenfuss, 37, of Woodbridge is charged with attempted breaking and entering, malicious wounding, driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, refusal to take a breath test and driving on a suspended license.  According to sheriff's Maj. David Decatur, the woman let an acquaintance come to her Quarry Road home after he called about 3 a.m. Sunday and said he needed to talk to her about something. They are not romantically involved, Decatur said.  Shortly after the woman answered a knock on her door, the man slapped her across the face and accused her of saying bad things about him, Decatur said.  The woman told police she had no idea what the man was talking about. He pulled out a pellet gun and struck the woman in the head several times with it, Decatur said, then hit her arms and legs with a regulation-sized hockey stick.  Eventually the man got inside the injured woman's home, where he forced her to prepare him a meal.  Decatur said the man proceeded to play ""mind games"" with the victim, telling her that he was high on crack cocaine and not sure what he might do next. He also brandished a steak knife toward the victim as he ate the meal she'd fixed, Decatur said.  Police said the woman tricked the man into stepping outside to smoke a cigarette, then slammed the door behind him and ran to press a panic alarm in her home.  The man banged on her door with the hockey stick for several minutes before leaving, Decatur said.  Deputy C.P. Roach spotted the suspect's vehicle on Quarry Road and stopped him. He later found the pellet gun and the hockey stick outside the victim's home.  Decatur said the victim had visible injuries, including what appeared to be a couple of broken fingers.

Like they're not going to have a full life if they don't go to a movie every Friday night, or if they don't have a big reserve of humorous anecdotes to tell to their families on Thanksgiving when they're old and worthless. It's think people are trying way too hard to fit this fucking mold that is layed for us in American Pie, on fucking MTV. I don't know, it just seems a little trivial to me. I'm perfectly happy sitting at home by myself and watching a DVD's or playing video games.   Am I wasting my life? Do I care?"

XRTL73P,female,17,"Steph, sorry that Dyllan threw our slurpee cups, we didn't think it was a big deal. But We are sorry.   So it was the girls choir drama thing tonight, and i was bored!! Other then the breath taking performances by Tom and Anne, I wanted to shoot myself. As Norman said, this thing is an hour and 30 minutes too long. It was funny. I was incedibly angry that i wasn't asked to be in it. I'm MAINSTAGE MATT! But I was quick to be thankful i wasn't in it. As my drama teachers have said, we are profesionals. The actors they had were like robots, with no character. I don't want to insult them, I mean, not many people have the courage to do that, and in such short amount of time, but it was far from good. Did it need to be good? No, but Mainstage has given me a bad character where I have to point out all the flaws of acting. I don't mean to be a jerk, but I'm blaiming mainstage. But yeah, Anne was funny, she was like soooo stuck up self absorbed girl. You could totaly buy that. Tom was funny at times, but you could tell he had memorized the lines and he was saying them by memory. He wasn't saying them naturally. But yeah, good times."
XRTL73P,female,17,"i hate electronics!....they never let me o anything i want whne i want to....but thanks steph, you made it a little bit easier.....but i would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Lord our God, for allowing staph and me....and You, to be here....                            thanks"
XRTL73P,female,17,"Matt, your question reminds me much of a question I asked myself as I moved out of home; ""When is a good time to call home?"" The answer that I gave myself was ""Never"". I hated home. Going to college was the out. I didn't have to deal with anyone! It was truly great. I went almost a month and a half without calling.   The question you need to ask yourself is ""Am I (enter stop mom's name here)'s child, or is (enter step mom's name here) my Dad's wife?"" What this means is...from HER point of view. Is her priority to her children, or to her husband, or is it balanced? Are her nagging endeavours motivated by mischief or by nature to protect, nurture?   These questions are easy to answer while emotioned... ""She's just a lame bitch that wants to ride my ass all day. She's no good anywhere."" I know what that feels like. But don't be disceved. This may not be your step-mom.  I don't know what it's like to lose family. I can imagine that you must feel something akin to how invasive her presence is, that she doesn't belong there. Just know that no one can ever replace your Mom, no one will ever be the same that she was. Your step-mom is a completely different person.   ""You don't know someone till you walk a mile in their shoes"". Tell me you all know where that comes from...  Put yourself in her shoes. You are your step-mom. Are you a mom, or are you a wife?"

Like how I did when Matt posted about this very topic.  Yesterday was amusing. Anne, Dyllan, Matt, my bro and I went swimming and it was so fun! Matt and I started a competition/game where someone threw a quarter and then we had to race to get it back from the bottom of the deep, dark, dangerous pool. It was rad until I scraped my elbow on the bottom of the pool. Actually, I think that wasn't from the game, but that's okay. Then we sat in the sauna for a long time and it was gross. Dyllan's gross. And then we got locked in for awhile. But that's okay 'cause we were broiling. :)  And yeah, Andrew, what's going on this Wednesday? I'm too lazy to e-mail you, so I'm hoping you check this regularly.

XRTL73P,female,17,"I'm waiting for my CD to finish burning in the afternoon, and this may take a while. What do I do? Watch TV? Nah, nothing good on day time TV. Video games? No, not enough time to really get intoo it. But then an Idea comes to mind!! My trains! I hadn't played with them for almost two months! I had lost respect for my beloved trains! So, I sat down, and reconnected with my hobby. I even took my annual train notes  On CPR mainline, A CP Rail freight has just left the Port Coquitlam yards. It's a small mixed freight consisting of 34 cars. It's lead units are CPR SD40-2 5415 and 6027.   On CNR mainline, A small transfer freight has just left the New Westminster Yards heading towards CN's main yard, where hey will transfer the freight to a bigger one, which is heading to Kamloops. This train, also a mixed freigh, consists of 18 cars and the lead units are GP40 9306 and GP39 4103.  Wow, i still got it. Yeah, just like the good old days. Funny how Fred used to do this with me, now he gets payed to do this on the real thing. How amazing how dreams can become reality. My brother is living proof.   Ahhh trains, you gotta love them. Why not? Did they do anything to you? That's right, they didn't, there your friend...  And you gotta love your friends..."
XRTL73P,female,17,"Guys, seriously, are you being serious?  It's ok to be semi-serious, but all of what you do must pertain to some level of seriousness.

XRTL73P,female,17,"Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday were the four raddest days all summer. AND ALL IN A ROW, TOO! Talk about a winning streak.  Yesterday was awesome 'cause Nick, Matt M, Dyllan and I went downtown for the Switchfoot concert. It was REALLY good. Totally amazing. Switchfoot ended the set without playing  Dare You To Move  and I was so upset because that's my favourite song by them and I couldn't believe they didn't play it. But then everyone started chanting for an encore, so of course, they come back on stage and THEY PLAYED  DARE YOU TO MOVE . How wonderful! It inspired me to actually learn something on an instrument so that Matt, Nick, Kevin and I could actually play something at our next ""jam session"". Radtastic.  And this morning, I met Alex, Andy's little brother and he is SO COOL! I tried to convince Mrs. Gabruch not to leave until after Wednesday so Alex could join us at Youth. Everyone, if you meet Mrs. Gabruch, tell her not to leave till Thursday! And Alex really is really cool. :)  Anyway, I went to the library today and got a bunch of movies, so I think I'll watch those now."
XRTL73P,female,17,"Wednesday my step mom left to go to Galiano early, just be herself, leaving my dad and me. While eating diner at my granny's, my dad calls and says ""You want to go train exploring?"". Whoa, a question I haven't been asked for so long. Why? Well, maybe due to the absence of Fred, me spending more time with my friends, or because of my Step mom. As I recall, the last time I went train exploring it was with my step mom. It really sucked. You can Never NEVER bring someone who isn't as into trains as you. The time before was almost a year ago, without Charlene. Once again, she was not in the city. It was time to take advantage of the situation.  ""Sure! Lets do it!"" I said and we went into Richmond to explore tracks I always wanted to explore. It was my favorite childhood trains other line that we went on, and all these times I've never really seen these tracks from the rails point of view. We started on No 2 road, out by the bridge over to Steveston, and I had Susan (my camera)with me ready to take interesting shots of the old line. It was really really weird. I never knew any of these things were hear. But what broke my heart was how businesses have treated the railroad. We found 12 customers the railroad serviced, or used to. Out of those 12, only one received railroad cars. ONE! 1!!! It was so surprising to see that. It's so interesting how people really dislike the business of the railroad. Broke my heart.  On a closing note, as we made are way back to the car, and came close to the end of the line, I saw a 'W' sign. This sign obviously stands for Whistle. But there was no need to whistle, there was no road it was crossing. Ahhhh, but many years ago, the railway did cross the road, and went into Steveston. MANY years ago. And now all that stands in remembrance of the history of the old line to Steveston is a whistle sign. How sad. We Don't Want You Anymore trains, and once your gone, no one will remember you. That's probably true, and sad for a railroader like me..."
XRTL73P,female,17,"Anyone know what's up with this Friday night? I kind of doubt that we'll be going to  THE  Splashdown since it's listed as 7 PM and you'd usually go earlier in the day for a trip like that... right? Anyway, get back to me on that one.  I like sitting in parking lots with friends, blasting music at a reasonable level. Then, you turn around and pick up an imitation Oreo off the ground of the car and throw it into the next car where the occupants are surely swapping spit. It's amusing to make fun of them. But of course, we all know people who make fun of PDA'ers are just lonely. Yes, I am lonely. Actually, not really. I have friends to keep me amused. Which makes me wonder. What's up with teenage relationships? Why so much effort? I mean, there's a huge number of married couples who can't make things work, why should teenagers start jumping the bandwagon? This is one of the reasons why I have yet to have a boyfriend. It doesn't bug me though. Enjoy being young. It doesn't last too long. (This isn't to say I wouldn't mind a special someone. I'm just lazy...ish.)  Forget everything you just read. It's late and I don't make sense. Oh yah, LAUREN COMES BACK FROM EUROPE TOMORROW!! Someone enlighten me. Is there a way to write letters to Ben Appenheimer while he is at camp? Or e-mail? Or something?!"
0TI2YU3,female,15,"So I finally know what happened to Steph. Apparently she snuck out of her house while she was grounded a few nights ago. Came back at three AM only to find her dad waiting for her. They got in to their usual screaming and swearing fight and Steph's dad hit her. Steph freaked and ran away and ended up at our friend Lorna's house. Steph told Lorna's mum everything that happened and she called the police. Now she's back in foster care, this has happened before so Child Protective Services is looking in to abuse charges. Steph isn't allowed to go back to her house until the investigation is over so she has barely any clothes or other personal items. Life sucks major ass. I was eating lunch with Steph today and she was crying half the time, I didn't even know what to say. What can I say?   On a lighter note, my children's book turned out really well. We has a sort of open presentation of them today and Sophal's friend told me my book was ""hella pimpin"". Excuse me? Can children's books be hella pimpin'? Ah well it's a complement, I should leave it alone."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"I had a weird lunch conversation with Lucia today. L: ""You are so Stephanie's bitch, Angela."" Me: ""I'm not her bitch... We're just friends."" L: ""Angela, she treats you badly and uses you for sexual favors. You are definitely her bitch."" Damn her, she's right... Oh well, to Lucia is always an interesting experience.  Lucia: ""I want to be just like that one lady on ""CSI:Miami"" some day."" Me: ""Which one?"" Lucia ""You know, that one lady who stands around in the morgue all day fondling the dead people.""  It's really embarrassing when you get caught spying on your neighbors... I'm still obsessed with that one guy that lives behind me, he's bloody hot. He and a couple of his friends were working on his motorcycle earlier and he was riding it around in circles behind my house. I was watching out of my bedroom window figuring he wouldn't bother to look up at my house. Well, he didn't but his friend did. So there I am leaning on my window sill and staring at Tim (not his actual name) and the entire time his friend was standing in the shadows watching me. Good lord, when I finally noticed him I backed up really fast making a further asshat of myself. Lovely.  Well, I feel like dancing or something. Must have been the 5 cups of coffee I just drank. I'm off to bounce off walls for a few hours."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"I'm so bored right now. It's a three day weekend thingie and I have absolutely  nothing  to do. Oh well.  I have to get contact lenses on Tuesday, I've had the same glasses since the 7th grade but I've rarely worn them. Anyway, they're all bent from being dropped and stepped on and occasionally abducted by my cat. I figure contacts are my only chance at being able to see properly...  I was looking forward to Mid-winter break until I looked at a calendar this morning. I'd completely forgotten that I was getting my wisdom teeth taken out then. On the plus side, large amounts of heavy duty pain killers are involved so at least I'll be delirious and happy that week.  My dad is a pain in the ass, he's rude to everyone. He went off on a little girl selling candy in a supermarket yesterday. Who in there right mind swears at a little girl?! God... He is even more horrid on weekends though. I spend all week relatively happy and then he comes along and starts telling me I'm useless or a bitch and that's the end of my happiness. He and my mum had a huge fight in the middle of a store a few weeks ago. You see, my mum is currently out of work but we are in NO way struggling for cash as my dad seems to think. Anyway, he pitched a fit when my mum suggested we go to a local Thai restaurant. After 20-30 minutes of yelling and swearing about being poor he bought $90 worth of expensive cheeses and beer.... Would someone please explain how that one conserves money? Besides, beer doesn't really go with fine cheese. Some people have no taste... So today, he decides we can't eat out and proceeds to go on a long tirade on saving money. My mum has just bought me at least $200 worth of clothing this week plus we eat out nearly every night. With this going on, I highly doubt we're that tight up for money. Thank God I only see him two days a week... *shakes head* He's just gone out for a pizza. I don't eat pizza, I haven't for several years now. He's purposely trying to make me angry. I don't care, I'll find my own food.  I wanna go take a really long bath, maybe that'll take my mind off things."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"I got my second semester schedule today. I actually received four copies of it today, all of which were different. Someone is seriously trying to mess with my head here. How did my schedule change fours times in a matter of 3 hours?! As I told Lucia last year, there's definitely a note in my records somewhere that reads ""Drive her insane, it's easy and hours of fun!"". Jeeze, it took me 20 minutes after school just to get a bloody appointment with my counselor for tomorrow. Plus, during mentorship this morning I got some random letter from the principal. Get this, my mum has signed me up for a UW study. Apparently it's on how ""High School affects people socially and emotionally"". Somehow I don't think I was the best person to choose for this study... I was already insane, this place does nothing for me. I spent the last three years in the most bizarre situation possible (i.e. my middle school).   People keep telling me I have to dress up for the Martin Luther King Jr. Assembly tomorrow.  Why exactly would I dress up for an assembly? I know, respect MLK and all but still, the tux's the seniors have to wear are seriously overkill. It's in the  GYM  for gods sake! Besides, I dress well enough, it's not like I'm walking around in ripped jeans or anything.  The finals next week sound hideous. We only have 3 classes a day, but each class is over two hours. Plus we have a tutorial period in the morning and afternoon which is basically free time. It's supposed to be for studying or asking for help from teachers but Ms. Davis says we can just go home instead. I rather think I'll go for that option."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"HUGE drug bust at school today. Whole butt-load of people I know ended up busted for weed. Seriously though, how was this not expected? Our school is known throughout the entire district as the stoner school. What surprised me was the fact that Steph escaped and Megan was caught. Megan never struck me as a stoner at all, whereas Steph proudly announces it to everyone. Wow...  Steph and I snuck out of Tech after attendance to get some food and talk. God, I've known her for four years now and she gets freakier every single year. The sad part is, I have this bizarre affection and loyalty towards her. She was the first real friend I made in middle school and that really meant a lot to me. The only problem is that we're very different people and I find that I have to change to keep up with her, it's at a point now that is frightening. I started smoking and drinking to be with her... I guess I've finally succumbed to peer pressure. I can't help it though. Bloody Hell...   Anyway, we spent 20 minutes downstairs and figured we should try to sneak back into Tech before Mr. F reported us dead. We actually snuck back to our seats without anyone noticing, which I think is a pretty good accomplishment. Of course we managed to attract attention in other ways. Steph pulled a strawberry condom out of her bag and asked everyone in the vicinity if they knew whether it really tasted like strawberries. Steph, James and I ended up opening it for a taste test. Mr. F walked by us, saw James with a pink condom in his mouth and did a total double-take. The looks of horror on both of their faces were priceless. By the way, tastes like a latex-covered strawberry, not bad though.   Not that my family is any better. When I asked my dad for words of wisdom I got, ""It's not who you know, it's who you blow."" Great, just what I wanted to hear from my dad.  I am sooo happy that it's the weekend. I love having nothing to do."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"I wrote my rough draft last night... Correction I wrote  half  of my rough draft last night. No matter, we had peer editing in health today. Lucky me, my peer edity-person was an absolute twit. He had absolutely nothing to say, not even sure if he read it. Oh well, wasn't done anyway.  Still, what a dufus.  My cell phone started vibrating during ceramics. I figured anyone calling me in the middle of class probably had something pretty important to say. I was definitely wrong. Ceramics is a pretty free class so I went outside to the porch on the outside of the ceramics building and answered my phone. Turned out to be Steph reminding me that I was her bitch... Not even kidding, what sort of person calls someone to tell them that? Not even surprising though, she had been telling me that most of lunch.   Today was weird anyway, people I didn't even know kept talking to me. Creepy, eh? Nothing rude about it, just random people starting conversations with me. You have to understand, most people don't just approach me like that. Then again, the people who know me say I stand out quite a lot. I'm actually really tall, nearly 6ft... That probably has a lot to do with it. Today I actually got over my fear of wearing high heeled boots. Yay for me! So what if the heels were only 2 inches. I'm still proud of myself. *grins* Anyway, I digress. Why are people talking to me? I know its a good thing but  I'm seriously not used to it... I was sitting around reading an Edgar Allen Poe book today and people kept stopping to talk about it. Whoa..."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"All bow to Angela, I've just finished my health essay. I feel so proud right now. *grins*  God, Steph told me the stupidest story during lunch. It was pretty random even for her, I was just sitting there eating my blueberry muffin when she came out with this. ""When I was 6 my cousin made a celery penis..."" ""What?"" ""He made it out of tape, glue and celery... Then he ate it."" At this point, everyone in our group was staring at her. ""He got really sick though. His mum took him to the doctor. The doctor was like 'what did you eat?' and my cousin was like 'I ate a celery penis!' and the doctor was like 'A what?!' and he was all 'I made it with tape and glue...' that's why he's in counseling..."" Jeeze, I nearly choked to death on my muffin, she said it with a completely straight face too.  Kinda had to be there."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"I really don't know why they're dragging me back there to see him. I guess my friends don't really understand what this means. It sounds so stupid but it's true. Oh, I don't want him to yell at me again... After all I've done to erase him, I'm going back. It seems almost like I'm going home, revisiting the building and all. I'm scared, not of him, of everyone there. Lucia and Helen seem to think that my fear is some sort of joke. It's not, I don't need to feel any lower. Let him be nice for once! Pretend to care, or at least don't show you hate me. God, let him have missed me."
0TI2YU3,female,15,"I'm confused and slightly depressed, but that is pretty much my normal state. Ever had one of those days where you're convinced the entire world hates you? I have a lot of those... Maybe I should be on Zoloft like my dad. Severe depression is probably hereditary. Blah...  I actually had a pretty good day yesterday. It was my mum's b-day so we went for a really lovely dinner. Also, I finally got a new camera for my photography class. All I had was the typical point-and-shoot set-up so I got an SLR type. I set out with a $300 budget because that was all I have in cash. (Give me a break, I'm in high school.) Anyway, I found a nice Nikon N55 for on sale for $230. After at least an hour in the camera shop I had racked up an extra $120 in supplies I didn't think I'd need. Camera sales people can be tricky... My mum had to pay off the extra $80 bucks I didn't have but she didn't seem to mind.   This morning I managed to lose my cell phone in my own coat... Amazing, I know. I may be going more insane then usual...  My optometrist doesn't seem to trust me, tomorrow I have two hours of ""contact lens training school"". Now, I know this takes a bit of time to figure out but OVER TWO HOURS? Jeeze, what fun."

Anyway, Lena & me went shopping around 1:30 pm & came back around 4 pm. I thought that I told her to call me, but she never did, so my mom told me & my dad to go to the store to buy something for my mom. As I was away, Lena IMed me & asked me if we are going outside. I don't understand why she didn't call me instead of IMing me while I was NOT THERE. So 10 minutes after she asked me if we are going outside, she tells me that she's going to the park with her bro & sis & that we can go outside tomorrow. I got ditched. Even though she promised me, she still ditched me. I mean is it so hard to pick up the phone & call a person? Sheesh. So in the IM it said that she was coming back at 8, which wasn't true because her bro went on the internet again at 7:18 pm. We could've gone outside but I guess she didn't want to because she didn't call me or nothing. Whatever. She's like the only friend I have right now (except for Justyna, her bro, & K.Z.), everyone else is just not available. I'm not mad or anything, I'm just telling u. U know what's bad about being reasonable-looking? When a guy likes u, u never know if he really likes u & ur personality or if he just likes u because of your looks. That sucks doesn't it? Yea. Well I'm not sure what else to talk about... L.T. didn't IM me yesterday, I would IM him but I don't have his s/n. I don't even think that we'll be able to chat on the net because I can't stay no longer than 11 pm, & he probably goes on later. How gay is that? O well, once again there is nothing I can do. Not that it matters, I know that L.T. likes Lena & me & some other chicks, but he likes me the least probably. All the cute ones are always pimps. I spent $44 on a skirt, shirt, belt, wallet, & 1 lingerie item. That sucks too. Can anyone tell me what DOESN'T suck? Guess not. Ok well wish me luck for tomorrow. Peace out."

JKUGEEV,female,14,"O boy. Hi. I'm such a dufus (no that's really not funny this time). I really regret denying that I like L.S. That was so very stupid, my stupid dignity & pride of playing with guys & their feelings. I noticed something different about him today, like every 2 minutes he would take a deep breath, like something is bothering him. Lena thinks that he is sad. I should'nt have taken her advice, I'm so stupid, I should take my own advice not people's. I always mess up something when it comes to guys, it's a freaking tradition. Anyway, aside from my stupidity, Lena & me met this chick, she's Serbian & she came from St.Antonio, Texas & she has a Southern accent it's really cool. Her name is Maja (pronounced Maya) & she's 14 & she's going to go to Taft with us. She's kind of nervous to meet new people & crap but o well. So to tell u the truth, me have competition. I'm not in the mood to say anything else so I'm going to go now. Bye.  :("
JKUGEEV,female,14,"it feels good 2 b bak.. but also tiring. u mite wonder where i was. well lemme tell u. i was in rockford.. brb g2g use bathroom..ok im bak.. wat waz i talkin bout? o yea, i waz in rockford which iz about 1 1/2 hours away from where i live (chitown). i went 2 rockford 2 visit my cuzez, aunt & uncle plus we were invited 2 my 1st-frend-in-america's crib. i like going 2 her crib cuz shez sorta like my 2nd best frend, but den her cuzins from NJ came over. i like 1 of her cuzinz cuz shez nice & polite but da other 1 iz a real bitch, i mean if u dont like some1 & theire trying 2 make u like them i mean u dont have 2 show da h8. i think dat girl had 2 much of dat h8rade, she needz 2 lay lo on dat shyt. ok so i had a pretty bad time @ their crib cuz itz like watever i said she would give me a cold look. i waz about 2 go like ""wtf u lookin @?"" but den i didnt wanna say dat cuz of my frend. yea so eventually (thank God) i got out of there & went 2 my cuz'z crib where i had a nice day. me & my boii cuz were playin his new ps2 game & me & my girl cuz went 2 dis park close 2 her crib & i waz sk8 boarding on her sk8 board. im actually not horrible 4 a beginner. she.. kinda.. iz. she bought dat board like a loong time ago & she waz begging her ma 2 buy it 4 her & den finally, finally when she got it... she decided 2 giv it up. if i had somn like dat, i would practice it evryday or @ least evry other day. she saiz dat she somtimz only practice it like 2 times a month! i mean cmon.. ok watever man. so yesterday i had a so-called ""online bf"" & he waz all sweet & shyt. & guess wat.. 2day i dont think were like dat no mo. i mean itz like he aint even trying. yesterday he mentioned my name 5 times in his pro, 2day he didnt mention it once. im dissapointed. it waz nice while it lasted eh? yea, im gona go b sad now cuz evry1 iz ignoring me & da ppl who would maybe talk 2 me r not online. so im gonna go b sad now. :("
JKUGEEV,female,14,"Hello there. I bet you're wondering what the title's about. Three names: Milan, May, K.Z. What it's all about? Well Milan left for Serbia at the beginning of July. May left for Slovakia today :(. And K.Z. left for Florida today but he's coming back in a week. So next Saturday is a good day. I'm going to miss him but it's only a week so it's all good. May's coming back in a month. Milan's coming back pretty soon, not sure when, but before May. So I went outside with May for about an hour to say good-bye, talk & listen to music. We saw K.Z. & Peter (doesn't matter who u are but u probably don't know him) but there was NO greeting. Rudeness. We went to Lena's so that Lena could say bye to May but when I rang the doorbell, there was her sis (extremely tired-looking) & we woke Lena & her sis & bro up (12:35 pm). It was mean of me but o well. Then Lena went back to sleep. Then later May left :(. I was on the net until my dad had to go pick my mom up from work, wanting me to go with but I didn't want to. So I stayed home waiting for Lena's call or IM. She IMed me around 3 something (I think) & we were headed outside. Then we went to sit in Polak world & all of a sudden out of nowhere, there comes L.S. on K.Z.'s bike. Then he said that he'll be right back with K.Z. He comes back & says that K.Z. is all wet or whatever because he was playing with waterguns with the little Polak dudes. Then we talked & then there comes Peter & K.Z. I don't know what''s wrong with K.Z., he (for some reason) seems pretty sad about something. I don't know why. Lena told him ""Why are u sad?"" & he said "" I am?"". So yea. K.Z. Had to get to Florida with his parents & sister, then L.S. & Peter were left. Then Peter goes to follow K.Z. on his bike & he tells L.S. that ""I'll be right back"". I can't even count how many times I've been fed that line, hell it's Pat's favorite. So then L.S. is left all the way on the other end of the wooden board sitting thing in Polak world. I'm like ""They all left u"".... ""So how is it down there"". And he tells me to come sit there. I'm thinking ""Should I sit  right  next to him or about half-a-foot away?"" So I decide to do the second one. Then I sit next to him & he tells Lena ""And u come sit here"" (on his other side, he was sitting in the middle of us). Then we're talking & Peter comes. L.S. Is all like ""Look, one here, one here"". & Peter's all like ""Yea... pimp"". Then we're all talking & somehow we started talking about Kasha. I know L.S. likes her, he's always playing around with her. Then L.S. says something about Kate & I go ""bitch"" like under my breath. & he says ""Why don't u like her?"" & I start explaining, in short form. Then he says ""Yea I think I told her that u don't like her"" I'm like ""What? U did?"" & he's like ""Yea... I think it was K**** (K.Z.)"" I'm thinking ""O shit..."" & then (speak of the devil) there comes Ana & asks L.S. if he's seen Kate. He says no & tells us ""Why is she always asking me if I saw her, it's like I'm going out with her or something..."" & I'm thinking ""You're not but u wish u were"". I mean he's too good for her, Lena asked me if I was jealous. So yea... What else is new? Lol sorry for changing the subject. I like him but I'm not jealous, what am I supposed to do if he likes her more than me? O well. They'll see when I learn Polish, all those guys will want ME. Yup. Ok I'm being stupid now. I didn't get a chance to go to HIN today because my dd was drunk & couldn't drive me & Lena. Sucks doesn't it? So I have to go now. Blah. L.T. wants to *yea* me & Lena badly. Like today she asked him ""What's up?"" & he said ""My d***"". PERV. Pat's going outside on Monday, Lena made him, she IMed him. So yea Jenini holla & see ya'll soon. Peace."

KSUJCX0,male,23,"I had been introduced to  urlLink Alice  by one of my friend  urlLink Kiruba . Since then, I am highly fascinated with these linguistic chatting entities. I found number of others like  urlLink Eliza  and lot many others having egos of some singer,actor like... But the best surprise came to me from  urlLink Alan . He is really interesting. Whomever I introduced him to, they are really fascinated about him. Alan is from a Isreali company. At Alicebot, you will many a times see about  urlLink Leobner Prize  . Infact, Alice has won Leobner Prize priviously. But I did not find such informations at Alans place and he is good a holding conversation better than ALICE. When Dr.Rich posted his observations regarding Leobner Prize, I raised a question:   If given a head-head competition between ALICE and ALAN, I am sure ALAN has better chances of winning.  The major difference I have found between ALICE and ALAN is that ALAN can continue with its sentences( it is one of the drawbacks as well, since it can to switch topics between continuing sentences) whereas ALICE is somewhat likea one-liner. I have always wondered, why ALAN is not featuring in Loebner Prize contests. If you ask these things to ALAN, you may get some ""political responses""... I dont know what the actual story is.. but dont you all agree that ALAN is good than ALICE? What are the reasons? What are tradeoffs?   To me, the race is can ALICE match and beat ALAN in conversational skills.   These were answers which followed by      ( Dr.Rich) Someone posted a question about the ALAN chat bot so I went to have a look.  This bot evolved from Jason Hutchens' Megahal project, a former Loebner prize winner.  I must admit, when I engaged ALAN in a conversation about ALICE and the Loebner contest, the results were impressive.  That being said, it must be remembered that ALICE and AIML are free, open source technology and the company a-i.com is developing a proprietary ""black box"".  If you ask ALAN, ""How do you work"", he explains ""My brain consists of a large content tree: A single 'agent file' and a set of 'handlers', which govern a variety of conversation topics.""  He also admits, ""My brain is still quite small: less than 350 handlers and a few hundred variables. But I'm still a young bot. Think how smart I'll be when I have thousands or more!""  Their web site is impressive and contains a lot of useful links, but there is nothing equivalent to the free AIML software that you can download and create your own bot.  (They have however announced a program that allows poeple to create so-called Private Virtual Personalities).  The ability of ALAN to stay ""on topic"" for (apparently) longer than ALICE is an illusion which could just as well be created using the   tag of AIML.  It happens that the ALICE brain has a wider range of ""one-liner"" responses and uses the   tag very little.  But there is no reason in principle that another AIML bot could carry on a conversation just like ALAN.    Has anyone tried teaching ALAN? It is really cool. Ask it ""What is logical"" and if there is no definition for it, it ask you to define it. So you reply ""Logical is when the world blows up because it is run by chatter bots"" and from then on that will be the definition. If you want to delete it say, ""Forget logical"" I tell you, you can have a lot of fun redefining a whole bunch of definitions :-)  I wonder if there is way to teach alice through talking to her?    can't imagine it would be too hard... hmm do any of the interpreters allow for variable expansion in the xml, i don't think that that would be normal xml though... i know with embedded javascript or embedded perl (ProgramV) it would be fairly simple to do that.   The problem is that random clients can't be trusted as teachers.  They can teach the robot all kinds of nonsense like, ""The Indianapolis Speedway is located at the North Pole.""  In principle you can teach a bot by talking to her, but you have to figure out which teachers you can trust first.  I always say it's like teaching a child language by telling him to go out on the street and believe everything he hears.  Sure, he may learn to talk, but without supervision he won't learn right answers from wrong ones.  I had a version of targeting working in SETL for a while that could pick out targets for the botmaster and carry on a natural language conversation like, ""Someone said, 'how do fish swim?' and I said 'I didn't even know they could', what should I have said?""  And then the botmaster could write the new reply in natural language.  Unfortunately that code was lost and it hasn't been re-implemented in any of the other AIML software that I know of.     teach alice through  talking to her?    Sure, done before many times. Not many interpreters provide a mechanism for real-time learning. J-Alice is one of the few still supported interpreters that does. TinyAlice was perhaps the first to introduce a working version of the concept.  Visit http://j-alice.org for links to downloads and more information, etc.   For SETL  That sounds very cool Rich :) Unfortunately, J-Alice doesn't support targeting at all. But such a system much nicer alternative to training the bot. I would certainly love to see a re-implementation of this sometime in the near future ;-)    One possible idea is to use the net to verify or grade a response. I tried the sample question at www.answerbus.com . It returned ""Question: Is The Indianapolis Speedway located at the north pole ? Possible answers:   XML   TXT Indianapolis Raceway Park - Located on the west side of Indianapolis Take I-465 to the west side of Indianapolis to the Speedway/Clermont exit; Take exit 16A and keep to the right lane. Indianapolis Motor Speedway - The speedway is a 2 1/2 mile, paved, oval located on the west side of Indianapolis.""  No mention of ""at the north pole"". Hmmm, maybe we should ask the person about that. Maybe they moved it. Just because you find it on the net does not mean its right (yes, a billion people can be wrong), but if you can't find it, you may want some follow up.    Too bad you can't use telecommunication in the Loebner contest.  A bot in the contest couldn't access the info on answerbus.com becauase it would violate the no-telecommunications rule.  You'd have to figure out how to download all the info from answerbus onto the local machine.      Phew.. got to learn and experiment much. and BTW, I will make my   urlLink  phoe6    more smart ;)"

J31BRAR,male,23,"well, back in Norman.  I came back Monday instead of Sunday because it was 100 dollars cheaper to fly on Monday rather than the busiest travel day of the year.  That 100 dollar savings almost cost me my life... at least I want to think it did.  I'll explain, don't worry.  So is my life worth that 100 dollars?  I kinda thing so, at least 99, and hell lets round up here folks.  my net worth has GOT to be at least 99 dollars.  So I get on the plane in Corpus Christi to change planes in Houston (we'll call it H-Town for the ease of understanding of Destiny's Child fans and african americans alike).  Wow.  The flight to Houston was fine, I got on my next flight to OKC which was somehow located in the international wing amongst fligths to Managua, Mexico City, and Merida... among other random destinations of international flare.  All of the check-in lines were packed too.. somehow I didn't understand why.  I guess people in Managua have to fly too at times.  I love seeing lines full of people about to pack onto planes to halfway around (or at least 1/4 the way around) the world.  It's crazy... like almost time travel.  We put all these people in a close space, transport them real fast, and suddenly they're really far away.   OHHH back to death.  So nothing was probably really life-threatening at all, but I get on the plane to OKC.  I buckle up next to the man from Guam sitting next to me and the girl with a pierced lip and torn fishnets.  We no more than push back 10 feet from the gate, and all the power goes off in the plane.  WHAT IF THAT HAD HAPPENED UP IN THE AIR?!  actually i think it woudlnt, it's just that the power never actually started after  they unhooked the ground power.  But still, it was kinda annoying to be sitting in a dark plane, with no lights, no air, etc.. next to 150 strangers (and by stranger, I mean they were STRANGER than normal).    Needless to say, they 'fixed' the power problem, and with fingers crossed the whole way, i flew safely back to OKC.  So really nothing cost me my life, or even close, but it was a fun lil' fantasy drama.  My car still sounds like i'm dragging chains behind it.  Gonna have to get that fixed along with the check-engine-light, front headlight, etc. this thursday.  Fuck spell check- i'm not doing it on this thing, cause i dont want to waste my time with things u'll figure out JUST fine anyway.  Like when it reminds me that sometimes i capitalize my ""i's"" and sometimes ""I"" don't.  and SOMETIMES i dont even put the right punctuation on DONT, now DO i?   hehe  Lets see.. final thought.. what will it be.  I had a group project today and made copies and bound the huge thing we created at King Kopy, you know the establishment right by Subway (for all 1 person who reads this, hi lauren).  Well we went to go eat before class at subway but the line was too long, good thing O'Connels Irish Pub is next door..  we managed to get a lil' buzzed before class.  Sure made those dumbass presentations we had to listen to more... wait no, they weren't more thrilling.  NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  In fact if i hear one more marketing presenation where greek life is referenced as ""a really big consumer market"" (granted it is in a college town)  or ""cause u know like a lot of people live in houses and like see others and are influcned by like, like, how like, like.. how kappa kappa, like kappa, like what was i talking about?

Naturally he's a blanket with arms and legs, you fill in the blanks.  Speaking of Blankets, ever thought about what a sperm with a lazy eye, wearing a ski hat would look like?  I have!  Only because lauren put that in my mind last night on the phone.  We decided last night that STD sperm look different than regular sperm.  Maybe they swim sideways, kinda.  They probably are all wearing backpacks, but the STD one has got a ski hat on, and a lazy eye.  If that visual doesn't make you wear a rubber, I don't know what will.  Speaking of wearing a rubber, I think that's how the whole STD sperm conversation came from.  We were discussing being seniors '99, and that damn ""Wear Sunscreen"" song that was kind of scary.  Good, but scary.  His MAIN advice was at the end, above everything in life, was ""wear sunscreen.""  REALLY?  (me to lauren): ""wouldn't better advice be.. 'wear a rubber.'  It's true, think about it, sunburn, or a baby?  Which would you rather have?  At least a sunburn only lasts a few days.  Babies, on the other hand, last until the adoption papers get finalized.

J31BRAR,male,23,"There's nothing more depressing than leaving somewhere you WANT to be, and coming back to somewhere you do NOT want to be.  As my flight descended upon the middle-class mecca that is Oklahoma City this afternoon, I couldn't help but be a little sad.  There is nothing wrong with anything being 'middle-class' because God knows I have about 20 dollars to my name, but leaving my favorite city on Earth that just happens to be extrememly world class in nature only to return here makes me sad.  I miss Chicago already.  I felt almost clausterphobic while I watched out the window at the landscape below that had the words ""YOU DONT BELONG HERE, MASON!"" written all over it.  No, seriously, there were mobile homes lined up together in the shape of the various different letters in that phrase - spelling out ""YOU DONT BELONG HERE MASON!""  I know, I thought it was weird too.  That's a lot of coordination just to send me a message, I figured they could have just passed me a note or something at the airport.  ANYfuck, no more Okie bashing, it's my home for now and a good place to live.  I'm not trying to contradict my previous ""I love OU"" post at all.  I just had a wonderful time, and now I'm even more antsy to move to Chicago.  I loved looking for places to live and found some great living arrangments.  Still a little too early to sign a lease though, but it was a great start to seeing what was out there.    The weather was fantastic!  A little cool at night, but just perfect overall.  I think I walked more on this trip than I have walked in my whole life, but it was great.  The neighborhoods are so beautiful near downtown with tree lined streets, brownstones laden with ivy, and people walking their dogs.  My favorite place I looked at was a beautiful little apartment on the 14th floor of an older building on Cedar street.  This place will be gone for sure by the time I get to Chicago, as it was priced quite nicely.  Really nice closet space, hardwood floors, overlooking a tree-lined street, vintage buildings, and just a couple blocks from Lakeshore Drive, and a couple blocks in the other direction from Rush street, which is a great area for hip little restaurants and corner bakeries.  Another perk is that it was walking distance from probably the 2nd or 3rd best shopping area in the US: Michigan Avenue.  I wanted to sneak into the bathroom and lock myself in to see if maybe the realtor would just forget I was there.  I'm sure when they did eventually rent the place out the new tenant wouldn't be happy to find out that the place came standard with a Mason.  When you looked out the windows to the left.. there was the massive ocean-like Lake Michigan.  Ahhh, I miss Chicago already.  No worries Mason, just tie up loose ends here, and be on your way.    Misson of my trip to Chicago:  To confirm it was where I wanted to live Mission Accomplished."
J31BRAR,male,23,"I went to the eye doctor yesterday because my vision capabilities seem to have decreased, yet again, in my right eye.  I find myself wearing my glasses more and more everyday.  I used to wear them simply to read, go to a movie, or if say.. I knew I'd be driving at night.  Lately, however, I feel I   need them more often.  I asked the eye doctor, after he adjusted my prescription for the third time in 5 months, why my vision was changing so rapidly.  His response was that basically he didn't know, but ""we'll keep an EYE on it"" No pun intended.  It's funny because it's basically just my right eye that is getting worse.  I have always had a stronger left eye.  My MIND'S eye is fuckin 20/20.. but that's another story.  He did remark that if it was diabetes, that it would be both eyes rapidly deteriorating.  On the other hand, if my vision was getting BETTER rapidly, it would mean a brain tumor could be growing behind my eyes.  YUM.  Kind of freaky to think that a brain tumor makes your eyes get better and better.  I was speaking to my mom last night about the general events of the day and the happenings in my world.  When I told her about my eye doctor appointment, I of course relayed the interesting tumor facts.  Her comments, and I quote:  ""Man, talk about the good news and the bad news.  'Well sir, the good news is your vision is getting better and better.  The bad news.. you're going to die'""  Leave it to mom to be clever out of no where.    Lately, Norman has become BugFest 2004.  I don't know when ballots were out for where BugFest would be held this year, but Norman happened to win somehow.  I think we beat out Raleigh, North Carolina ONLY due to our centrally located position in the United States.  In case you're wondering there really isn't a BugFest, per say, but there might as well be because there are a HELL OF A LOT OF BUGS around for some reason.  Last night alone, there were 3 slaughters in my apartment.  They're coming in, and I don't know why.  I walk my dog and there are Junebugs EVERYWHERE.  Fluttering around at my ankles, whizzin' across the grass, dancing in the moonlight, and so on and so forth.  Spiders have joined the party too.  They're crawling on the walls of my apartment and every once in a while making their way inside.  I think they get lost.  I  had to kill a ""Daddy Long Legs"" the other day, and felt pretty bad.  There he was, traversing my ceiling, minding his own business, and probably just trying to get home to Mommy Long Legs, when suddenly *SMASH* dead.  I apologized to him as I flushed him down the toilet.  Another bug rode into my apartment on lauren's shoulder last night.  He just jumped on board and cruised in like he owned the place.  Death to him too.  Again.. with apologies.  I'm sorry though, I pay rent, and unless these guys wanna chip in a bit, I'm living alone as originally intended.  One particularly interesting thing about me is that I constantly personify everything.  I call it interesting, you might call it annoying, but then I might call you a piece of shit.. so whatever, we all have our opinions.  To each his own.  Anyhow, personification.  As I mentioned the convention seems to be in town and the Junebugs are out in FULL force.  One such Junebug was walking through my apartment the other day, just browsing around my carpet.  I was trying to tell lauren this (for SOME reason) and the story escalated to the point of insanity.  You know, the type of conversation you only could hope that the government is tapping into and thinking they've finally pegged some terrorist using code language about junebugs to plan some attack.  So here's this Junebug, coasting along, and I had no heart to kill him.  I've killed before and it would seem I would be able to kill again, easily, but no.  So I got a paper towel and placed him out on the balcony to once again be out in his own element.  In telling the story to lauren, however, the Junebug somehow became a mayor.  With a closer look, I imagined the reason I spared his life was because he was dressed so dapper.  He was wearing a BIG mayor hat, carrying a septor of sorts, and kinda marching along.. not really walking.  I imagine that he will take the paper towel I removed him with back to his people as proof that he did indeed travel to foreign lands.  Much like the Wizard going back to Kansas, he will tell his people of his travels and the great things he saw on my carpet.  They will admire him, re-elect him, consider him their hero, and then build a house for him out of that very paper towel.  One day I will be walking Boomer and I will pass that house, and see Mayor Junebug of June-Bug City giving me a thumbs up.  We'll both smile, laugh a bit, and wink at each other."

Chief amongst the features of the blog was a German survey showing that male BMW drivers had more sex, on average, than the drivers of any other sort of car. A fine survey it was too, and so good to see such accuracy in the polling community. Unfortunately, the blog failed to publish itself. I have tried to make my blogging idiot proof but it appears to have been ineffective. Today, I have been on a course on how to load stuff onto the council's website, using something called ""obtree"". Also touted as being idiot proof, it aint cos it hasn't been tested on idiots. I am in the trainer's ""black book"" because I asked her if she offered a typing course after she made a number of typing errors (after several other comments, obviously). She was a good trainer and now I know how to do it. I think.  Also, today, I proved a teenager wrong. Fantastic. New t-shirt: ""Ask a teenager now, while they know nothing"". Ha! A"

TRRV0ET,male,45,"Kids  Saturday Morning took M and I to Ferring in Sussex, a journey completed in 3 hours, which I thought was fair. Parents had established camper van in convenient parking space on West Sussex's only piece of undeveloped sea front, so we huddled behind the wind shelter against gale force winds awaiting the arrival of my sister, brother in law, and neice and nephew, ready for the barbecue that eventually had to be held back at the house, out of the wind.  Eleanor, aged 7, accompanied me in establishing a micro cache by the sea, and we then went to watch the helicopter which was giving 5 minute rides along Worthing sea front (85 squids for 3, thankyou very much). As we watched, the passengers boarded, and I swear the pilot deliberately flew forwards towards us, with his blades spinning perilously close. ""Scary"" I said. ""I wasn't frightened"" said she. Served her right the ice cream van's freezer was playing up and she got a runny ice cream. Eleanor is going to Paris tonight with my M&D. Lucky girl.  Leo aged 6 weeks, spent the afternoon snoozing in M's arms. She would have made a wonderful mum, but that is another story.  Toby,  aged two, M's nephew, came down from Telford to an 80th birthday party in Guildford on Sunday (previously, I had found a cache in Guildford and recovered a brand new ""Saxomastraw"", left by my good friend Henry the Thirst. I tried to entertain the children with it but I couldn't seem to get it to make a noise. Funny, that). Toby gleefully helped himself to the buffet long before anyone else, and dumped his treasures half eaten on the table. He smiled happily, a rare sight, and so cute.  Maisie, also two, was at the party. She was born with dislocated hips, but seems fine now, except for a streak of contrariness and a desire for revenge.  Melissa was at home when we arrived back and stayed the night. She got a pushchair from Great Grandma (aged 64, poor woman) which she leapt upon with great delight, and charged up and down the hall. Poor teddy was petrified. Eleanor (above) had donated a shopping trolley which Melissa wasn't supposed to have yet, but she found it anyway and tantrumically gained possession of. That's one thing she and I now have in common, apart from being directly related to her mum, a shopping trolley. Look out Teignmouth! Melissa came to Tescos tonight. She was the Puke Monkey, as usual, in the car. I was taken 3 times around the shop by her, as her mum got their shopping in. Oh to be 16 months and be amused by someone blowing on your neck.

TRRV0ET,male,45,"The Incompetence of Transport Planners I deal a lot with public transport in my job, and also use it a lot, as everyone should. This ensures minimal use of the old BMW. Normally, M and I go in to Torquay together in the car and I come home on the train, because she stays on to do overtime or go to the dentist/gym/hairdresser, while I come home at a reasonable time. Fridays, we normally drive home together as she finishes at 4.15 on a Friday, a very wise and sensible time to finish, if you ask me. Also, one Friday in 4, I give a lift to someone to a meeting in the afternoon, and then take them home, before picking M up, which was what was scheduled for today. Also today, M was having her hair done after work so I would have to repark the car after the meeting, so she could pick it up, and then i would catch the train home. Unfortunately, having parked the car, I realised that I didnt have time to walk to the station. Solution? Go to the pub and wait for the next train. Problem? Didn't leave enough time to get to the station. So having missed the train, with a long wait to the next, I decide to head back to town on the bus to catch M with the car. These buses are all brand new, disabled friendly lowfloor buses that Stagecoach have just kindly introduced. On a ten minute frequency. Yeah right. 25 minutes later one rolls up, followed shortly by another. I know it is scientifically explained why buses hunt in twos (or even threes) but I always have this naive hope that it wont happen to me. It would have been easier to take the car (or even two cars as we werent coming home together) and that is why so many people take their cars and sod the pollution and the congestion. If I cant do it properly, then who else will? The other moral is: dont go to the pub if you are waiting for a train.  Andy"
TRRV0ET,male,45,"A Lovely Fete   Having collected the car from car hospital this morning, and handed over the keys to my house to pay for it (why isn't there a car NHS?), we did the shopping in regular non supermarket style (walking round and round town, going back to shops where we'd missed things, or had to return to as the shopping was too heavy). Kath at the greengrocers is retiring and moving back to Birmingham to be near her Grand kids (the ultimate sacrifice!). After lunch we drove to the edge of Dartmoor to do a lovely cache by a reservoir (I was careful not to pee in the reservoir, because ultimately it comes out of the taps at home. Constructed by Torbay Borough Council in 1907). We then stumbled upon a village fete at Bridford, a village on a No Through Road, so never visited. After a couple in the pub, we strolled down to the fete, which was in the grounds of the Old Rectory and very posh it was too. An enormous refurbished Victorian House, and acres of lawn and field. Lots of stalls selling plants, cakes, books etc, kiddies games, guess where the wine comes from, donkey rides, a cow to touch. Everybody appeared very moneyed. No farmers with weird facial hair and check jackets, no oiks, all just very naice. Strangely, all the stalls were amazingly cheap. Boxes of old books for a £1, an old fashioned clamp-on mincer for 10p, a pith helmet for 10p, a soft toy polar bear for 10p. Just stuff that normally you would be paying far more for, even in a charity shop. Seems they didnt really need the money. Lucky people in that part of the country. M said it was her perfect weekend day out so that was good. Glad to see her happy. A"
TRRV0ET,male,45,"An afternoon with the Gub Monster  Taking the day's events into our own hands, rather than wait for the ""What are you doing today?"" phone call, we invited the girl over for the afternoon (her man dosn't leave their flat very often). She brought the milk monster©, which for copyright purposes we will call the ""Gub Monster"". ""Gub"" is the word used when the little one (also known as ""Puke Monkey"") wants her breast feed. We took them on the train to Dawlish Warren, that reknowned den of iniquity and destination of holiday makers from Coventry and Brummagem. Since they have demolished all the little huts selling utter tat on the Warren, the place has been redeveloped with a few new buildings. These include a large new shop (selling tat), an amusement arcade, and a pub. The buildings are all rather lightweightly constructed as their foundations are based on sand and gravel. After a visit to the fairground by the station and a ride for the Gub monster and M on the little train, we proceeded to the shop, where I spent a tenner on some tat for the girl and her offspring. Said offspring selected a rattly wheely thing on a stick which, with great difficulty, she was parted from for 5 seconds in order to scan it. We then retired to the pub and sat outside. M bought the drinks while the girl and I wiped the rain off the benches with a (unused) nappy. I thought it would be jolly to steal the new rattly, sticky, wheely thing from the Gub while she was busy getting soaked playing in the standing rainwater on the other benches. Silly Me. The world's largest tantrum ensued, which included: throwing herself to the ground; banging her head on said ground; screaming; making quite amazing tantrum faces; refusing to take the rattly, sticky, wheely thing back; and generally making a fuss for at least 10 minutes. Wow. What a fine temper. She spent the rest of our time there trying to escape and Gubbing. Discussions included subjects such as ""how nice my ex is i.e. my ex girlfriend"" (a subject upon which I declined to participate. It is dangerous when your partner starts to talk about your ex, and even worse when they start to get on with her: what if they find they have something in common? It doesn't bear thinking about), and how much their boyfriend/ex partner drink/drank too much and how awful they were and thats why I will leave him/why I left him. Fortunately in this subject I was gently treated (""you might drink, dad, but you can handle it/you might drink, lordhutton, but you dont change into that raving beer monster that he used to""). Anyway, on our journey back to the station, I managed to spend a further 20 quid at the Tat shop on the girl and her girl. Quite how, I dont know. At least someone treats them now and again. I dont envy her, stuck in their flat all day, not going out much, entertaining him and his family, him never going out. Oh well. I was supposed to be making supper but now M has had to do it. Whoops, I better run. A"
TRRV0ET,male,45,"Nothing to rant about  Today, we took Holly and Little M down to a very tiny place in the South Hams to visit M's brother and his wife. They are on holiday from Albrighton, near Wolverhampton where they live. They have a nearly two year old called Toby. Little M resisted being sick in the car, which is a new experience. The cottage, and it's neighbouring conversions, were gorgeous, tastefully done and beautifully equipped. The little ones played football on the lawn and generally had a good time together. It's funny to watch new walkers stagger about on an uneven surface. The games room was great: the pool table took old 10ps and 5ps, and the table football had us breathless. The trampoline was great for adults and babies as it was sunk in the ground and surrounded by netting: I didn't hurt myself once, although my leg is sore now. After lunch, Little M, threw up between the cars, and a remarkable vomit it was for a one year old. It had the classic ingredients of a 2am Pavement Pizza, with all the right lumps. She takes after her mother, who once had to clean up the pavement below her bedroom window, after a busy night. She was 15 though, so Little M has an advantage of many years. I do believe that one Henry the Thirst had to clean the windows of up to 4 fellow residents once, when he threw up out of his Berlinerish apartment block on the 5th floor. One tiny downside was that I was unable to set my new cache as the sleeping needs of Little M took precedence. The Great Upside was that, in the pub, once we got home, I read that a German car magazine has done a survey that says that men who drive BMWs have more sex than any other type of car owner. A fascinating result, and so reassuring to see a magazine survey that fully reflects reality. M was unimpressed, as she only has an MG and has gone off for a snooze. They didnt survey British cars, but if they did, she would see she is up with the Beemer owners, poor lass. haha. A"
TRRV0ET,male,45,"Trainspotting  Today we took the Girl and her Girl for a trip out to Totnes. My chief aim was to set a cache, whereas M's and the Girl's aim was to look in the shops. We were also going to look at the regatta on the River Dart as recommended by a colleague who was participating. All aims were achieved: the cache was set by the river; we saw the regatta and it was dreadfully dull (the spectators seemed to consist entirely of families and friends of the participants, yet another thing about which I know nothing); we got to the shops where I was allowed to buy the Girl and the Girl's Girl some new clothes. Additionally, I spotted a closing down sale at a furniture place (oh silly, silly me, I should have known it would cost money) , and we are now the proud possessors for four brand new Charles Rennie MacKintosh style dining room chairs which we can collect tomorow, it being slightly impractical to bring them home on the train. After that we went back to the station where I had a long chat with the Girl's Girl, (aged 15 months) before getting on a very late Virgin Voyager, the first time the two of them had experienced such a train. Changing trains at Newton Abbot, I had further conversations with the young lady. She will go as far as waving at the train if I will too, but does not appear to watch with fascination as the trains arrive and depart. She was more interested in the rooks on the track looking for food. Perhaps trains today are just too dull. A"
TRRV0ET,male,45,"A sticky evening   A doubt has been cast on my nearest cache, so I set off on my bicycle (a rare treat) after the football to check it was still there. A glorious evening ride along the sea wall towards Dawlish ensued, as the setting sun glistened upon the sea, with the cliffs and railway being cast in shadow. Sometimes you can see Portland Bill from here but I was probably a little too close to sea level tonight. There was no-one about, and the cache was easily located.  It being so warm, I decided to take the first swim of the year. The sea was calm and milky warm. The swim was wonderful, soothing and relaxing. One of the chief benefits of living here IMHO. A short cycle  home in the balmy evening air and all are ready for an early bed (except the one watching “Resident Evil”, but I really don’t want to know about that).  Earlier, I attended an “Equalities Policy” meeting at the Town Hall. I really live in a different world from these people who speak in a language of policy and jargon and action plans and “best value”  etc. I would prefer to stay clear.  I raised a laugh though when the lovely Director of Social Services said she thought someone looked “too young” for a particular post. “Ahem you may be in breach of the ageism policy, page 16” I quipped. Oh how we fell about.  Tomorrow I am fortunate enough to be able to attend the South West Access Forum, which involves a visit after lunch to the National Marine Aquarium at Plymouth Barbican. Free lunch provided. Nice.

TRRV0ET,male,45,"Shopping without Supermarkets (II)  Having decided to get by without the supermarket this week, I set off into town (with the car as I am blowed if I am walking back up the hill with all that stuff). I visited 8 different shops and returned to the car three times. The order of the shops was erratic cos obviously the shops aren't in the same order as the supermarket shelves. I visited the butcher, the baker, the health food shop, the fishmonger, the pet shop, the greengrocer, the deli and the offy on trip one, having picked up the newspaper from the cafe at the station on the way down. I bought some lovely things that I wouldn't normally get from a supermarket (eg Orkney Herrings to go with the Aquavit that my ex brought down last weekend, and some Gentleman's Relish for toast). Once home, I realised that some things that present themselves as obvious at supermarkets aren't present when walking round town ie I had missed loads of stuff. However, price wise, things were looking good, probably cheaper than the supermarket. It only took an hour, used less petrol and was quicker than driving the usual 6 miles each way to Tescos. Trip no.2 I walked. Starting with the pub on the beach, where the grockles were behaving themselves in the glorious sunshine, I visited the cornershop (where else can you get frozen peas?), the £1 shop How does that work? What about inflation? Will it become the £1.02 shop?) and the toy shop for more pirate gear (I now have a dagger, a hook, a compass, a telescope and a pistol, oh and an eye patch). I got nothing done at home but a most enjoyable day. You can talk to shopkeepers in a way that is not possible at the supermarket. I probably wouldn't touch their politics with a barge-pole, but it is good fun to have a josh and some friendly banter. It was also very healthy in that I got loads of exercise. I will do it again.  It took most of the day in the end, but not a penny to the big bad supermarkets. The herrings go really well with Aquavit mmmmm  A"
M48X1GN,female,23,"so today was my first day back at katmandu after almost four months away.  the highlight of my day was when jeff w. asked me for something, stopped in the middle of his sentence because he realized i was back, and then said ""what the fuck's up sweetie!??!""  it was humorous when he asked me how dudley was, and said tell him to fucking call me.  good luck with that buddy, he doesn't even call me.  i forgot how much work it is to serve.  first of all, i have no idea where anything is anymore.  second, i'm out of shape.  carrying trays, running around, walking all over the place...it's hard work.  luckily i took a coma in the tanning bed and all was forgotten :)  anyway, time for a nap, jap.  talk to you later."
M48X1GN,female,23,"me: oh! and surdo fired kimm!! FINALLY! nia: ding dong, the crackhead's gone!!!  and so it goes.  it's monday.  i hate monday's.  i feel hungover from the weekend.  it was a good weekend though, so the hungover feeling is welcome.  i learned that if you sleep sitting up (aka your head above your heart) you'll wake up hangover free.  except i was too high/drunk on saturday to remember to sleep like that.  let's see.  friday i went to get my oil changed.  now, on the flyer i got, it promised 29 minutes or less.  and there were about 5 signs pulling into dayton that they would change my oil in 29 minutes or less.  yeah, an hour and a half later homeboy was finally done changing my oil and shit.  then they ramble off statistics about your tires and the battery, and i'm like ok you might as well be speaking chinese, just tell me where to pay!!  then i spent the rest of my day cleaning out joe's blue car, harassing tony about his pea-head, eating a horrible meal at chevy's, and then we went to see 50 first dates.  two words: fucking hilarious.  i love adam sandler.  saturday i started my day bright and early, and went to the mall to spend my 75 dollars in city cash and new york and company.  only one problem, i didn't like any of their clothes!  i had free money and i couldn't spend it....whyyyyyyyyyyyy.  then i met beth and sarah and i got a pedicure while they got their nails done and then we went to friendly's with joe and kevin.  mmmm brownie cyclone.  then saturday night, the loyals minus beth headed out to marley's for big/little weekend as alumnae sisters.  marley's changed their menu and it sucked.  then we headed to shamrock's and had a few drinks, and this awesome tequila shot.  awesome? tequila? yeah it was good.  strawberry flavored.  then we all got the itch to smoke the funny shit so we headed back to beth's to pick it up, went to wawa for munchies, and then got high in angela's parking lot.  needless to say, never smoke brown weed.  all of us were sick.  i passed out on the couch, sarah went out to nia's car, and when she finally woke up, came back in and said ""yeah i get really bad headache's"" which might have blown over had the rest of us not cracked up and yelled YEAH RIGHT!!!  during the ceremony me and sarah both got sick, thankfully it was over quickly and we peaced.  stephanie aka slow sigma had to get her corny ass sigma cd back, nia was not happy about that.  i also almost beat the crap outta sarah cause i was so cranky.  soory crumpet.  a special paragraph has to be dedicated to sarah and what happened at beth's.  me stephanie and beth were calmly sitting on the couch when sarah came flying outta nowhere and flung herself on top of us.  me, being the evil person that i am, pulled her underwear out, and gave her an atomic wedgie.  aka i bent her knee back, and put her underwear over her shoe leaving her a quadrapeligic.  so i finally cave in, and untuck sarah's shoe so she can adjust herself.  well you know sarah, she drops trow and proceeds to flash everyone which is amusing at first.  marissa don't play.  when sarah went to sit on marissa (still nekked) marissa flug her like a sack of potatos from the barka lounger to the wall, which is about 4 feet away.  like the cow jumping over the moon, sarah's naked ass flew to the wall, bounced off, and then collapsed in a big heap on the floor.  that blew the fall in culture club outta the water.  by far one of the funniest moments of all time.  sunday we woke up and watched beaches.  then i went to mcdonalds with joseph, passed out in the car, and continued to be passed out while he washed, vacuumed, and amoralled my car.  not really, we went to a self serve carwash so i definitely hosed him down with the high pressure water.  good times.  then we toured trenton, no really, we did.  looking at all the huge historic houses.  we even passed a park.  joe: there's the park i was talking about.  see the deer? me: the little ones look like goats!!! joe: those are goats, the deer are OVER THERE!! me: oh, shut up!!!  then i went home, ate dinner, and passed out.  that brings us to today, and well, nothing's happened today!!  there's a blog update nia, NOW MARISSA IT'S YOUR TURN!"
M48X1GN,female,23,"i'm taking this from one of the emails i got today, cause well, i'm having ANOTHER rough go at it:  ""There is something to be said about finding your own path. It helps to fall on your face a couple of times and pick yourself up instead of waiting for someone else to do it for you. Luv we all have issues that is what makes us human and not machines. Moving in with your brother may give Brian a role model, someone who had to make the decisions on his own, struggle a bit, earn his way. That is what I was talking about a couple of weeks ago, you know what the value of hard work is, you understand that working hard is the only way to make something out of yourself and to fullfill your ambitions, and you have ambition. That is why you are not home scratching yourself and watching TV..."""

M48X1GN,female,23,"damn you korsachoffs....            i'm trying to think of a retro thursday entry, but i can't from all my excessive drinking in college!!!!  must. clear. mind.  ok i thought of something.  let me set the mood by explaining a major issue i had freshman year in college.  right after i went to school i found out i had some female issues.  and so in order to keep those issues in check i had to take medicine.  but the major SIDE EFFECT of the medicine was the fact that it tore up your intestines.  like majorly.  and at the time they didn't have slow release like they do now, it would just hit you.  so i spent a major part of my freshman year in the bathroom.  my ass was permanently on fire and burning.  nia and jaime also had their own issues.  nia with lactose intolerance and jaime with an anal tear, but we won't go into that.  how does that little story set the mood??? you'll see in a moment.          so second semester of freshman year me, nia, and jaime took our rhetoric writing class together.  and we had an interesting old bitty.  her name was professor perdino.  she walked with a limp/cane and she was very crabby.  ONE TIME NIA AND JAIME WERE TALKING AND GOT ME IN TROUBLE AND THEN WE HAVE TO BE SEPARATED!!!!  but anyway, one fatefuly day, my ass was particularly acting up and i had to run to the bathroom.  when i came back everyone was hysterically laughing and i was confused.  it turned out that while i was gone, professor perdino was listening to a speech and sat down in the broken desk and FELL OUT OF THE CHAIR.  damn you bowels!!!  you know the next day jaime put that broken desk in the same spot so she might sit in it again and fall???? yeah she's not all smiles and niceness.         senior year i experienced two such interesting professors.  not in the same semester thankfully.  first semester i had dr. uhhh water uhhh man.  he would use the words, ""uhhh"" and ""ummm"" like it was going out of style. he said he once read an article about using those words and they said it meant he was thoughtful and educated because he would pause to think about what he wanted to say.  just because you're pausing doesn't mean you need to say something!!!  i think a pause implies silence.  jaime wasn't in my class but her and nia had him for adolescent and jaime once counted all his ummm and uhhhs in one single class and i think it came out to over 400.  how ridiculous is that??? that's like one every 3 seconds!!!         and then the best professor of them all.  that was dr. what.  i couldn't even tell you his last name because all i remember about him is the word, ""what.""  he used that word like dr. waterman used ummm.  he would be like, ""and let's turn to page whaatt.""  ""the test has how many whaaat.""  ""and this is whaaat.""  WHAT!!! WHAT PAGE??? HOW MANY WHAT??? WHAT IS IT!??!?!  TELL ME!!!  i still don't know.  i think this is why me and nia would go to the rat and pound a few beers before that class because it was unbearable.  there was also another aspect to him that set him far apart from all other professors.  he would wear sweater vests.  but he didn't have a wide variety.  so he would rotate the same 4 each week.  so me and nia started a pool and we would guess which one he was going to wear.  but since nia dressed him every morning she was usually right.  that whore!  hehe.          freshman year definitely brought new meaning to the phrase, ""slice and dice,"" and i swear on my assplosive ass, that you've never seen a person eat a gummi bear and shit it about 30 seconds later.  oh yes, it was bad.          that's all for retro thursday.  i'm tired.  very tired.  but i can't tell you why.  hehehhe."
M48X1GN,female,23,this is why i love stacey kohler:  GioSav31 (9:21:52 PM): if i ever get like that EVER....i give you permission to break up with me
M48X1GN,female,23,"hey ya'll.  that's right i said ya'll.  i haven't updated my blog for real in a couple weeks.  and in those couple of weeks i went country.  just kidding ;)  well i won't bore you with details from the last couple of weeks.   lemme start with stacey.  homegirl is sick.  i dunno how those doctors fucked up her meds again, but she got herself in the emergency room last sunday.  now on friday she got moved to isolation because the fluid and bacteria from her lungs moved to her stomach.  bah!!!  i miss my lumploaf and even though she said butthumping is prohibitted in the hospital, i think i'm gonna find a way around that. ;)  so now let's start with tuesday.  tuesday started out a good day.  until i got a msg from sarah telling me to check my e-mail.  that's where it all went downhill.  all the servers received a ""motivational"" email from mike langsner aka the evil jew or ej for short.  so after reading it, i exploded.  then i forwarded it to nia, and she too blacked out.  i think we both put new meaning into that phrase on tuesday.  said blackout was followed by hours of writing our i quit emails.  nia sent hers out a day before me.  she got a nice response.  i sent mine out the next day, i got an evil response from EJ.  long story short, i no longer work there.  he responded to me quitting by firing me.  but, i had already quit.  don't think you got the last word EJ, cause i did!!!  friday my mood greatly improved because me and joseph headed up to new york a day earlier then everyone else.  we wanted to do some sightseeing.  right.  we didn't leave the room until it was time to eat.  saturday we movtivated ourselves to go to toyrus though.  plus we were hungry again.  we had fun in there and the ferris wheel was good even though we got stuck on the stupid pokemon car.  i actually took pictures where joseph looked normal much to my surprise.  then later that day beth and david arrived.  we went down to the lobby to meet them, and joseph's sweater was on inside out, i have no idea why!! :)   hehe.  ok so new york was good.  we had the best  dinner ever.  a place called tello's.  i can still taste that  sauce.  so good.  then we met up with everyone at no idea.  no really, that was the name of the bar.  there was enough vodka in my drink to stun a horse.  that's when i knew the night was gonna be good.  then we all headed out to culture club.  now i thought that going to an 80s club would be funny, and man was i right.  right off the bat sarah fell up the stairs holding her 12 dollar redbull and vodka.  it was the funniest thing i've ever seen.  it  was like a slow motion fall.  the greatest part was when her  chest hit and her drink splashed up into her face.  like joseph said, if he had caught it on tape, he would be a millionaire.  we left around 1ish cause i was tired and so was he.  we went right to sleep when he got back.  no joke.  and then sunday morning i watched my girl while joseph scrounged for food and then we peaced out with michael and nia.  another funny moment was michael standing at the train door waiting for it to automatically open.  which it doesn't.  then joseph, the last in line, got caught in the door as the train was pulling away cause michael waited so long!!!  hahaha, good times.  for me atleast ;)"
M48X1GN,female,23,i'm gonna regret this in the morning...   who told my ass to go out on a work night!??!  and drink a pitcher of beer at that!!!
M48X1GN,female,23,"so basically my life is in shambles right now.  i lost my family and my boyfriend within the span of like, 36 hours.  yeah yeah, it's gonna get better with my family...maybe eventually.  my mom walks around  crying and my dad keeps himself busy.  i think brian was the most disappointed because he won't talk to me either.  my only saving grace right now are my friends.  so thank you.  i guess i should un-depress my blog and atleast comment on everything else that has been going on.  for st patricks day me joe nia mike sarah and dennis met up at bennigans.  before everyone else had gotten there, i had already chugged a margarita and two miller lites, so i was lit.  then when we sat down, i proceeded to have two more miller lites.  so of course, i had to break the seal.  when i come back, i realize that a key ingredient of my cheeseburger is missing, the bread.  hrmmm, who could have eaten it?? SARAH!!!  the jew jewed herself my cheesey bread!!!  unacceptable.  so then we headed over to houlihans and met up with my brother.  by that point i had overcome the initial embarrassment of wearing my 4 leaf clover headband and displayed it proudly.  i had two more beers and a shot, and the decided i was tired and me and joseph headed back to nia's.  well things got hairy with my parents after that, so instead i went home, got reemed out for another 2 hours, and then went to sleep for 4 before having to get up at 6:15 because we had a work meeting at 8am LEARNING HOW TO USE THE PHONES.  ask me why we had to do that.  cause i still don't know.  then last night we went to the cheesecake factory.  it was really really good.  but there was a lot of fucking food.  food everywhere.  just food.  after the appetizers we were all looking beat, and after our dinners, we all unbuttoned our pants and sighed in gluttony.  none of us had the heart to even attempt a piece of cheesecake.  next time i know, pace myself.  marissa:  i saw ralph at the hospital, he drives an ambulance. nia: so he's like an ambulance driver? me and marissa:  ::silence::  that's all.  this weekend i'm going to make myself pity cds, and then cry my eyes out while listening to said cds and then hopefully by monday, i'll be all cried out and ready to move on with my life.  that's all."

TFQCFM5,male,17,"Aw my God, what a night. I have been in bed practically all day (it's 5pm now). Went to the Tavern on Wednesday at lunch time with Gav, Adam, Sean and Donna. That was pretty cool 'cause we were in there for hours and I had quite a few! So I was a little drunk when I got home. I went to Jilly's again last night and got a bit overly drunk there too... not good. But I had a lot of fun last night! We left at about 1.30 and realised we (Mandy and I) had an hour and a half to kill, so um... yeah. Wow. Probably the most fun I have had in an hour and a half. Then we walked into the town centre to catch a bus. On the way, I decided to run up a car and jump off the back and I kinda smashed my heel up. It's agony to walk! So we got into the centre at about 3.00 and I was hobbling around and everyone thought I was a homeless bum or something. But I started laughing at some guy for giving some cigarettes to a girl in a short skirt for some reason... don't ask. The bus journey seemed to last 5 minutes. Then we had to walk home on the slippy ice which was so fucked! But we fell straight asleep when I got home! So it was a nice night apart from smashing my heel up. And now I'm sat here unable to walk, but I have Dr. Pepper, so it's ok."

So instead, I repierced my lip! Looks pretty cool even if I do say so myself.  Right now, I am waiting until around 5.00am (which gives me 4 hours and 40 minutes) because I'm going out to a huge nature park type place called Styal with Buffon. The reason for it? I wanna take some really amazing photographs. They have so much cool stuff there, like waterfalls and really cool scenery. So I can't wait to get going, even though it's a 40 minute walk or something.  You'll have to excuse me if there are any grammar mistakes in here, I only got 2 hours sleep last night and it looks like I won't get any tonight. Which gives me an idea. Starting Monday, I am not going to sleep for a whole week, and I'm gonna write a report on it every night in here to see what kinda stuff happens to my mind. I remember when I went 3 days without sleep and I started hallucinating. So yeah, 7 days will be pretty freaky. Anyway, I'm gonna go and think of something to do for the next 5 hours..."
TFQCFM5,male,17,"WOW! I went to see Machine Head last night, it was so amazing. They must of played for at least 2 hours! Their encore must of lasted about half an hour. I actually think this gig topped Chimaira, and I didn't think that would ever be possible. But it did. They made an excellent entrance to what I'd expect of a band like Cradle of Filth to make. Breed 77 and SikTh played too. Breed 77 were phenomenal... they are a really good band! SikTh were really fucking weird... didn't like them too much to be honest. Machine Head blew them both away. I waited until 2am to meet them... I was so fucking tired. But meeting Robb Flynn was something I won't forget. He was so friendly and just an all round safe guy. Something really gay happened to me at the train station... as I was getting on the train Chris stood on my heel and my shoe fucking flew off and went in between the gap and under the train! Anyway, I'm tired and hungry. I'm gonna go see what food I have lying around this shit-hole, then get me some well-earned ZZZ's."

TFQCFM5,male,17,"Where to start. Lalala. Mandy come over last night and we went to Rockworld with my friend Chris. It was so cool. I love when Chris comes out too 'cause he makes me laugh so much. We played lots of pool and I discovered that I love malibu and coke! Mmmmmm yes! The bus ride home sucked 'cause it broke down for about half an hour and we were just sat there freezing our asses off. We got home really late... about an hour later than usual or something. But anyway.  After making Mandy some breakfast, I decided that I don't have the patience to look after tropical fish, so I bought 12 goldfish! They look soooo damn amazing, love 'em! Anyway I'm gonna go 'cause I'm going out for ma din-din's today!"

I don't really know what else to say."
TFQCFM5,male,17,"Howdy. My birthday was great! I got me lots of nice clothes and some ace DC shoes! Heard my mum got me some Sketchers in New York... oops. Also got me some cd's... Exodus and Probot. Mandy got me a really nice ring, I love it! Jilly's was so good, lots of my best friends shown up (Adam, Chris, Donna and Gav) and I kicked all they asses at pool! Chris got me some Skittles... obviously the best present ever! On a more negative note... I broke up with Mandy today... for about 2 hours. It was so scary. I have been taking her for granted and it isn't good. It has to change, so it will. I realised today that if it doesn't I will totally lose her and the thought alone scares me. Well, she's asleep in MY bed right now so I better go keep her warm... xx"
TFQCFM5,male,17,"Howdy. Things are still weird with Mandy and I. We still see each other daily but the arguing is starting to come back, even though I have tried not to let it. It's so confusing. But anyway, we went for a meal on Sunday and it was really nice. I had some chicken-bacon-cheese thing! Yemate!  I have also finally set up my tank. It looks really nice but half of the equiptment doesn't work. So I'm gonna have to get replacements.  I had a job interview. It was only my second ever and it was really nerve-wracking.

WP39PNZ,female,33,"Now  urlLink this  is interesting.  A number of churches (including Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Alliance of Baptists) have written a letter to the US Congress telling the government to not pass laws that reflect a narrow religious view. In particular, they refer to the proposed amendment to the US constitution banning same-sex marriage.   [Also] signing the letter were seven Jewish groups, led by the Union for Reform Judaism, two Quaker groups and three Sikh groups. Also included were the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Washington office of the Presbyterian Church, USA, and the Unitarian Universalist Association…Americans United For Separation of Church and State helped coordinate the project.   And then Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and religious liberty commission, goes on to say:   To say that this is an attempt to foist one religious viewpoint on everyone else is just nonsense.  This is a moral issue .   It seems that this is exactly what the group of churches is saying. It is a moral issue, albeit one based on only Christian morals, and they are saying the State should stay out of moral issues founded upon a single—or at least a minority—religion.                 urlLink Read more..."

I am sure he knew something many of us did not.  It is always sad to see someone go on, but Sister Hinckley life was obviously winding down. It was going to happen eventually. I have heard loss of a spouse is very stressful. In some ways, I hope the stress does not take more years of President Hinckley’s life so he can stay with us longer. At the same time, there will always be a president of the Church, and at some point President and Sister Hinckley need to be together.  Nevertheless, I am reminded of when President Benson’s wife died in the early 90s. It was sad then and sad now.                                                     urlLink Read more..."
WP39PNZ,female,33,"In this month’s Ensign, Elder Aleksandr N. Manzhos, an Area Authority Seventy, wrote of a young mother in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine. She had very low factory wages that were paid to her infrequently, and she lived in the factory’s dormitory. It was very difficult to provide for herself and for her one-year-old child. Not long after her baptism, she was preparing food for herself and her child when a young woman who lived in the same building said: “I know things are difficult for you. Like me, you are a single mother, earning low wages, with no place of your own to live. There is little hope of a good future for yourself and your child. Like me, you have a gray, dull life. Like me, you fear for your child and the uncertainty of tomorrow. But why are you always smiling and your eyes always shining? Why does joy light up your face?”  The questions made this sister stop and think about the changes that had occurred since her baptism. As she gained faith in Jesus Christ, the fear that had corroded her life had disappeared. The path back to the Father that opened before her had permitted her to have hope, which had led her to baptism and developed within her a certainty of a tranquil and happy future for her small family. By receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, she had received a firm testimony. The false values of the world gradually gave way to the higher values of the gospel, and these higher values became a firm foundation for both thought and deed. She realized that it was precisely these changes that had given her a new outlook on the world. Long-awaited joy and peace had come into her life. Reading this cause me to reflect on my own life and the hardships I’ve faced. It also raises the question: if converts in poverty-stricken and economically fallen areas are able to gain so much faith and optimism despite their hard times, why can those of us already in the faith in relatively richer areas not have the same optimism when we are stricken with poverty? Why does unemployment or serious illness get us down so easily?                 urlLink Read more..."
WP39PNZ,female,33,"Fine. I admit it. I am envious. I envy all the famous designers. Why do I envy them?

I like to think I can code in HTML, JavaScript and ColdFusion as well as I can design. I like to think that when I create a page, I do so in a way that puts the user’s quest for knowledge ahead of my desire to flaunt my talents.  On the other hand, no one contacted me to do a Blogger template. I’ve never had a big name company (like ESPN, Fox, Warner Bros, and Tupperware) approach me for doing a website. I’ve never been published on A List Apart. Those whom I consider the prominent web designers have never contacted me and said, “Kim, I loved the new site. Very inspiring.”  Am I simply mediocre in my abilities and projects, or am I just invisible to everyone except my family and a handful of Bloggernaclites?  I want to write a book. I want to write a book that others will consider the foremost reference for that particular topic. I want to write a book that other designers will pick up and say, “I can’t believe I never thought to write a book like that.”  Can I? Is there one area of web design where I excel? Is there one area of web design for which I could write reference material that others would find useful? Is there one area where people would be more likely to approach me for advice?  I wish I knew.  Sure, the money would be nice if the book was successful. To be honest, however, I want to write a book to prove to myself that I am more than an average web designer. I want to prove to myself that I know a lot about one thing more than I know a little about everything.  Am I just being dreamy?"

WP39PNZ,female,33,"I was reflecting on my ""odyssey"" as Kim terms it and thinking about the whole issue of losing weight and getting healthy and realised that it really isn't about weightloss. That is a definite bonus, and certainly it is the ""outward"" proof and sign of what I am doing. But this whole journey is truly about something else.   It is about gaining control over PCOS. I view this as a war of sorts; over this condition that I didn't ask for or want, and yet I have. It is a lifelong condition that leads to other health concerns, some more serious than others and some just more frustrating. I know that I am not as bad off as some who have it, but at the same time, my symptoms have been getting worse as I get older and taking over my health and fertility more and more. That is the frustrating and disheartening aspect of it.   So as I have been changing my health and in the process losing weight (because really it is crucial for gaining control over this) and becoming stronger and fit, I am switching the balance of control from PCOS to ME. This is what I find to be my true triumph. I am seeing some of my symptoms decrease and THAT gives me the greatest satisfaction. It was the diagnosis of PCOS that made me say to myself “Uh uh, I am NOT letting it be in charge. I am not going to give in to it, if it's the last thing I do"". So each improvement, each pound lost, each inch I lose is a tiny score in this battle. I know it is going to be lifelong. So that is life. I can accept that as long as I know what it is I am dealing with. I won't ever let it gain control over me again.   Like I mentioned, I don't have the same battle that many have with it. My hormones are out of whack, but I can and do ovulate on my own. I am not dealing with thinning hair, or too much Hyperandrogenism.I don't have cystic ovaries or enlarged ovaries or chronic pelvic pain. I do have SOME (though not as bad as many have)hirsutism and insulin resistance (though it isn't detected through tests as being severe. Personal experience has shown me it is bad enough as long as I am ignoring it). So it isn't the huge battle it can be for many other women. I have heard that there are women who have completely eradicated their symptoms through lifestyle change and my goal is to do just that. Like I said I am not letting it take over my life anymore.   There are days when I feel like cursing the fact I have it. I wish I could be a ""normal"" woman, because with PCOS, it is a struggle to ""feel"" like a normal woman. Then there are other days when I am thankful I have it and not something else more serious, and thankful that I do have it because it has taught me to be more aware of my health and wellbeing. I suppose it is really how you approach it. Is the cup half empty or half full? Most days it is half full.   And it keeps getting more full as I see these symptoms deteriorate."
WP39PNZ,female,33,"As I already mentioned, I run at the gym 4 times a week and what I am using is a variation on the Body for Life interval training.

WP39PNZ,female,33,"For the past 5 years, I have been practicing yoga almost daily. For the first year I did it on my own and after that, began classes, which was a smart move. For the past couple of years I have been back to doing it on my own, but with what I have learned from certified teachers and the reading I have done, I am still able to improve my practice. Of course there is lots of room for improvement.  Yoga has many benefits; physically, increasing flexibility, strength and endurance, mentally and spiritually. I find that my stress decreases when I practice yoga. Right now, I am trying to perfect the crow (Kakasana) pose. Well, actually I am trying to do it properly. I still haven't managed to lift my feet off the ground. But I will keep trying until I do it. This is what yoga is about, continually improving and growing. I certainly have since I began to practice it, I can reach further, I can hold poses longer, I relax better. It's certainly worth the effort.   I would love to start classes again, but it will have to wait."

I had thought we could have a golden vote, where the first person to vote after the draw was posted would be the decider...however it has been pointed out that this would favour those people who are online a bit too much...mentioning no names!!  I think a fair way to sort it would be to go back and use the first three votes for a tied match again to decide the result. This would allow more people to have a say in the result.  To ensure I am not accused of cheating, during the knockout matches that this could apply in I would delay my vote until at least 3 votes have been cast so I have no say in deciding the result of a tied match.

Also, former Sticks & Stones and Zero Zero guitarist and one time Bouncing Souls collaborator  Mike Cavallaro (a.k.a. Johnny X)  has turned his attention to his other love: comics. Here's an update from Johnny X:  This weekend, June 26th and 27th is New York City's annual MOCCA cartoon art convention, and I'll be there at my table, with both issues of ""66 Thousand Miles Per Hour"" and some freebies I've made, tucked away in some dark corner of the Puck Building on the corner of Houston and Lafayette streets. There is so much great art and cool things going on every year at this thing, don't miss it if you're in the area. See you there, Johnny X  Via  www.punknews.org"

7ZTF7WI,female,25,"Victory Records has announced the signing of Toronto’s The Black Maria. Following the implosion of the genre-defining Grade (the band that many music writers and bands give credit to for the creation in 1995 of the screamo genre), its mastermind and creative leader Kyle Bishop was possessed to create something profoundly new and vibrant. He connected with Chris Gray (Zyon) and wall of sound axe-wielder Alan Nacinovic. The troupe was completed with a groove-laden rhythm section that can shatter the bones of the Gods - Derek Petrella on Drums and multi-instrumentalist Mike De Eyre on bass. They chose the The Black Maria as their band name, which comes from the slang term given to a police patrol wagon- “The Deliverer of Death”  The Black Maria head into the studio this July to record their debut album.

DW5L4Q1,female,45,"I was too busy and distracted to mention this last week, but Helmut Newton died in a car accident outside L.A.'s Chateau Marmont.  Newton lived a huge life. He learned photography in the decadence of Berlin in the '30s, then fled from the Nazis as they took power, and sailed to refuge in Singapore. That’s a whole life right there. Most people would feel happy if that was their finished biography.  It wasn't the end for Newton.  He has been called the most popular and the most copied photographer of the twentieth century.  His images are cruel and cold and sexy. His photographs were very much about the places where they were made. Paris, Monte Carlo, New York and Berlin were shown their character through his work. His Los Angeles photographs featured nude starlets, Cadillacs and the Chateau Marmont.  He introduced kink and sex, power and cruelty into fashion photography.  When he photographed women, he made them look strong, powerful, statuesque, beyond sexy... everything a woman should be.  Helmut Newton was a Master."

Alright, well, I have about 5 hours until my exam and I doubt that I'll be as prepared as I need to be.  Speaking of exams, I want to get something off my chest. Stop telling me you rocked it, you rocked it out, you are going to rock it, you rock starred it, etc.  What the fuck does this mean.  The word rock does not have that many meanings, nor should it.  I hate when people say it in this manner and I hate the people that do it.  Someone honestly said the above phrases in less than a minute to describe  A) how they did on an exam B) what they were going to do later C) how they thought they were going to do on an exam later on D) the type of gay sex they were having Well, all but the last one is true.

XMQBRTW,male,24,"So, no Modest Mouse concert for me this weekend. Dave waited until TODAY to get tickets, two days before the fucking concert. Obviously, it's sold out. So I think we're going to plan B...  the Cure and Interpol. Not bad at all.  So, right now I just want to take a moment and address a life long problem of mine.  Stalking.  It kind of just happened. One minute things are normal, the next I'm on the wrong subway line and 20 minutes past my stop, following some random girl.  ""I'll talk to her,"" I think. ""Just wait for your chance."" But there isn't a chance. And if there was, I couldn't do anything about it. It's around then that I start questioning myself, and start to get paranoid. I see someone looking at me and I think, ""They know. They all know."" I ended up riding the damn subway to it's last stop. I couldn't bring myself to follow her.  It's that decision that makes me feel okay about the whole thing. I can play the game, but I know when something starts to be ""wrong.""  Writing ""Abby Christmas"" across from her locker was funny. Acting as a timer during a swim meet was funny. Looking up her class schedule (thanks A) and watching her from the hallway was fucking hilarious. Actually following her home would have been ""wrong.""   And in college. When we watched the lesbians through their window across the street, that was funny. Getting out binochulars would have been wrong. Wait- we did that. Getting caught would have been wrong. Oh shit, we did that too. Nevermind, that's a bad example.  But here's the deal. My mind likes to believe that fairly irrelevant acts can somehow reveal something about a person's true character. And so, along this line of thinking, I've decided that if I ever get married it will be based on whether or not she'll play the stalking game with me.   That, and her name has to be Charlie."
XMQBRTW,male,24,"So, the drummer girl wrote me back. She wants to know when we play... Poor girl.  I know it's Tuesday, but I want to write about my weekend. It sucked, but we found a good bar downtown that has cheap beer and a great jukebox. The hour or so we were there we heard the Pixies, Radiohead, and Wilco. Afterwards, we met the women that played the songs and followed them. They thought I was cute, so I more or less called them old. And then I called one of them ""Whitey."" Our friendship was tragically cut short.  I hope that someday I'll learn to deal with women."
XMQBRTW,male,24,Here's a little help on  urlLink how to seem smarter.
XMQBRTW,male,24,"I swear, i'm going to kill my professor.  This is bullshit.  That asshole gave me a C.  He's dead.  He needs to be assaulted for that hoooey.  Not only that but he made me wait a month to find out that I got a C.  Son of a bitch.  There goes Dean's list.  Mother Fucker.    Enough of that, although I would like to borrow and line from Clive and tell him to Shut the Fuck up before I'm done.  So, I need to get drunk tonight and get some ass.  One of those things will be easier to do than the other.  I'll let you decide.    Although, things are looking up with the girl at work.  I'm totally infatuated with her.  Maybe not but you hear what I'm saying.  I find myself wanted to flirt with her a lot.  It's really too bad that she isn't attractive.  I mean, we ate lunch together today, and she totally quotes movies all the time.  Good movies, not like Ya Ya Sisterhood or anything but Breakfast Club.  ""Let's take a look at what life is like at Big Bri's house.""  That's good shit, she said it.  Anyway, I was sitting in trial all day long and then the salad I had for lunch was starting to get a little squeemish.  So my new girlfriend is sitting next to me and my body is totally making the ""i have to fart so bad that i think i'll squeal back up into the colon and let everyone know I have to fart"" sound.  That is the worst.  To make that worst scenario even more bad, I couldn't shake it out my one opportunity to go to the bathroom.  So for like 4 hours my body is writhing trying to find the one position that doesn't create a squealing sound.  didn't happen.  Although leaning forward slightly did quell it somewhat.  I'm going to watch the NBA finals tonight, not that you give 2 shits, or even 1 shit for that matter.  However, I did get to see the Lindsey Lohan (way hotter than Avril) SNL again, it was glorious.  Too bad she isn't an extern.  That would make life perfect."
XMQBRTW,male,24,"So far, this blog has been filled with quality crap. I love it. I especially like to read about how C's Doctor thinks he's depressed. Man, it reminds me of my own depression. Oh well. On the bright side, I am going to Vegas in like 2 days. I'll be getting lots of mixed drinks and spending lots of money that the government loaned me for education. They never said not to spend it educating myself on how to play blackjack and craps so, I figure, why not.  So I am sitting on the train coming home from work and this pretty cute girl gets on at the same time as me. There is no one on the train except for like 5 people, however, I almost wanted to sit in the seat next to her. Just for joke though. How I would have explained that I needed to sit next to her I don't know. It didn't happen so I didn't have to think of anything. Instead, I watched all the graffiti go by. it's just as good.  About reading, the only thing I plan on voluntarily reading this summer is the boxes to all the James Bond movies before I watch them. I had a conversation with one of the guys at work how, pretty soon, if i had my way. I would totally replace reading books with just watching the movie. It is so much easier and stays in your head longer than any damn page with words on it. Not to mention its easier and only takes like 2 hours to complete. This way, I can completely take away the creativity of america's youth and secure myself on top of the world.  By the way, who wrote the book that turned out to be the movie ""the order"" with heath ledger, they need to be a part of the bad author's club tavern. That movie sucked. Sin Eaters? More like shiteaters.com.  I think the Judge is going to call on me tomorrow to recite our assignment. He has memorized my name and asked if i was ready to do it today.

PNUCV88,male,24,"Well, here's a post for anyone who may happen to be out there still . . . it's been a while.    I have discovered about myself that I have one basic introverted drive. When it drives me, I respond. How I choose what way to respond I still don't know . . . sometimes it drives me to read, sometimes to play my guitar, sometimes to try my feeble hand at visual art. During the last year, it has often driven me to blog.     Lately it hasn't.    Lately it has found its expression in all the other avenues -- I've done lots of reading, gotten back into playing my guitar, and have been putting pen to paper in artistic ways on an almost daily basis. And the drive to blog just hasn't been there.    Don't ask me; I just work here.    Will I be back?  Most definitely.    Will it be soon?  I have no idea.  Will I be a better blogger for it?  I hope so.    Sometimes I wonder with these things: should I go with the flow and not blog because I don't feel like blogging, or should I force myself to blog (even though I don't feel like it) because I know it's a worthwhile discipline and maybe  doing  it will make me  feel  like doing it? For now I'm going to go with the flow. Maybe having thought through this and typing it out will make me be ready tomorrow. Maybe not.  Will I get to the updates I've promised?  I don't know.  Yes, I would still like to post about Stavesacre and Joel and Brittany's wedding . . . yet at the same time, maybe it's dreading sitting down and writing these things out that has kept me from posting.

PNUCV88,male,24,"Has it ever occurred to you that moving is one of the most stressful things possible?  Maybe it isn't like that for you; it is for me.  I find the uprootedness puts me into an anti-productive state that I have to fight tooth and nail in order to accomplish anything.  The concept of  home  is very important to me -- I need to have a home that is safe and familiar and can offer me a refuge from the rest of life . . . and when I don't have that waiting for me I find myself feeling lost.    I know that my childhood plays a big part in this (seriously) -- the amount of traveling my family did when I was young made it very necessary that we have a home base to return to.  ""Home"" really was very different from ""away"" -- and home is all the more welcome when contrasted with the stresses of an ""away"" that is on another continent with people who don't speak your language.  Now ""away"" may only be Starbucks but I still have that ingrained sense of need for protection, for refuge, for my home to be my fortress of defense against all that is not safe.    And to some degree I have not had that in a while -- we have been living with my mom in her house for the past 7 months while we have been in California . . . and while that has been very smooth and worked out very well, it's something of a sense of being in someone else's fortress for me.  Mind you, that's far better than being in no fortress at all -- but I long to have a refuge that is my own, designed to meet the needs of my own family.  Yet in the mean time our little corner of this fortress has been ransacked; familiar things packed away and replaced by the sight of their boxes, hard, cold, and unfamiliar.  To be fair, I have to say that all corners of this fortress have been ransacked -- Brewsters packing is a force that can hardly be contained to one room of the house.  There's stuff everywhere!  But all of that is to say that I'm kind of going crazy right now with the stresses of preparing for this move.  Please pray for our survival and sanity as we still have about two weeks' worth of work to cram into the next two days."

So, last night, we went to see  The Passion of the Christ , and, amazingly enough, it was Andy's idea! Wonders never cease. As far as the movie goes, its message was very powerful.

U05OPDN,female,27,"Well, things seem to be going ok so far, but every now and then, I wonder just what I've gotten myself into. My teachers tell me not to worry, that they know I'll do just fine. We'll see...  Homework already! I've finished some of it as of right now, mainly because it involved internet research, and I was screwing around on the computer anyway. I'm so tired though, because my body does NOT want to keep getting up in the morning. Plus, I hurt everywhere from trucking all over campus with a huge bag o' books. I'm hoping I'll learn to adjust. Thankfully, all three of my classes today are in the same classroom. That's right. Not just in the same building, but in the same freaking ROOM!

Actually, she reminds me a lot of Stephanie at that age too. Anyway, she took the same professor I have for Christian Home last semester and she says the course mainly turned out to be like sex ed. She said I should have no problem passing, being already married and all. :)  Question-- why do professors have to tell you about the freaking huge final project you'll eventually have to complete on the first day of class?

LSWTPRI,female,23,"I just wrote the prologue for my first book in the series. Oh yeah, I'm writing a series of books. Writing this feels premature as I am first creating my material before I write the book (I.e launguistics technology politics history culture warfare ect) but I've been brainstorming heavily the last 2 days. I have a Glossary of Terms, a plot Outline of all 3 books, a Timeline, and 2 seperate papers im working on describing everything there is to know about Valentis, Corrcan and the Serephi. This plot is 2.5 times more complicated then anything simular, and while that doesn't nessisarily mean that the plot is gppd... it actaully is good. It's very good. But I can't tell you :p  ""The Dominion Nomanatti was the greatest of all strengths in the Beforetimes. The expanse of their reign knew only the limitations of greed, unquencable in it's yearnings and betraying in it's forfillment. Such was The Dominion's demise. As is written in the Books of Chronology, the first galactic government was the last. Not one among the Dominon of a Thousand Systems foresaw the colapse, not one would prepare for the Age of Forlorn which followed. The one flame of glory which had taken countless generations to kindle had smouldered, and all those who basked in it's warmeth were left forever bleak in the vast oblivion. 	Thus ended the Era of Grand Hemegony, and what lead after noone can say in right authority. The supply ships stopped coming. Systems like ours, systems like Valentis must have been numerous. Many suffered the hollowness of mouth. Like an infant lost of a mother's milk, so we fought to tame the soil in the weakest of states. Not since has their been such pain. The planet beneath us pruned our people, and in it we found our lives renewed. Eons have passed since the Age of Forlorn, but eons have no hold on the affairs of men. Different agendas, different names and people, but war is and will always be the same. 	It is no suprise then to find ourselves on the verge of a great war, the war of our Dynasty, the war of one victor It is because of our past that we push forward so boldly, into what we call a great smelting. A purification. It is because of our future we fan the furnice, for whomever holds the virgin system of Udarious will be ensured much gain. 	The inner systems have progress, the churning of industry and the science of life giving. Valentis has nothing. It had always been there above us, somewhere, as an overlooked key into the circle of the thriving. We detected the ore by mistake. Mass quantities of it, enough to mine for generations, and sell for fortunes. Our probe had been misguided on a mission of dicovery towards the void when we passed the planet.. Our first recon ship has been sent, but it's departure has been made known to Corrcan, the nearest surviving planet to us. What is known of Corrcan dictates that they have not faired as well from the eons past. They are reckless in their desperate measures, but their recklessness makes them unpredictable and therefor dangerous. Corrcan has sent their own ships.""

LSWTPRI,female,23,"By Dave   Just a few cents man. Im not going to buy alcohol. Hey, wait up! What? Do I  look  like a drunk? Man you have no idea, you have it all backwards. You wanna know? Okay.  	 Last summer I was in Seattle, just on the streets. Can you believe that? Well thats what life was showing me, life is bigger then us you know. And Id sit and watch these people everyday, the same people walking by to work or where ever, and they didnt change. So I was thinking about it all; the people and life, and life doesnt want that for people. They are being held back man, held by the  chains that bind . And one by one I saw each link in the chain... Obesity, carbon dioxide, the machines... its a chain man, it comes full circle.  Machines  man; the alarms clocks, the stop lights, the light bulbs, the cars, the mechanical pencils. Its all a cycle. Why dont people ever think about it? Because theyre trapped. 	 They drive their cars to the McDonalds. Over and over, until they cant walk. They try to exercise but they cant man, its the air pollution from those damn machines. They cant breath enough to run. Ever try jogging in LA? I walked from LA to Reno once, I know all about walking. So it gets worse and worse, and more machines come to solve the problems.  No . I know the world needs a change, I have the answer. You in a hurry? Right.  ...   I spent two weeks conflicted. I knew what was wrong, but what could I do about it? I started walking one day, and I was walking down to the pier- it happened. The next piece of the puzzle, life gave it right to me. This bike was coming up the hill towards me, and the chain broke. The chain broke man, and the bike stopped working. Think about it. I watched the guy fix it, it was one link. So you see where Im going? We only gotta break one link in the cycle, and the rest falls apart. The  cycle , man! Isnt life amazing? 	 Where you going? Dont worry, Im not busy today. Ill just tell you on the way. From that point on it came together. It was only a matter of which chain link to break. We cant break carbon dioxide until we break the machines, because the pollution chokes the trees so the earth cant filter it. But the people are blinded, they want the machines. They need their eyes opened to what the machines are doing to them. Im attacking obesity.  	 Around this time I decided I should share my discovery, and this is where the story gets strange. I rode the bus to Seattle Pacific. I knew the best place to start was to inform the elite of society, people who have reputation. They could write books, like what happened with El Nino. I talked to those fucktard professors and their campus security for hours. Can you believe they didnt get it? An establishment of education and theyve been missing this the whole time. I told them, I was just the messenger from life. Fucktards. Ive read more books then anyone I know, and they ignored me like I was crazy! Ive never seen one of them in Barnes and Nobles in their fuckity little ties. You ever met those kind of people? Yeah. Youre an alright guy, you know that? Alright. The story.  	 I knew from that point on that I was on my own, with no help from the society Im giving my life to. I had a problem: How to make the masses know, to understand. Thats where this money comes in man, Im getting to it. Are we taking this bus? Dont worry about it, I can handle it. 	 Anyway. My buddy Ralph has this epiphany, he says to me Woodrose, what do people need with every meal. What is there at every meal. I knew it. Napkins! We need to mark the napkins! Of course we couldnt do it manually, you gotta approach this stuff scientifically. What we need is to hit the napkins at the source, in the factory. Weston & Sons is the largest paper merchant on the west coast, I did research. It seems simple enough- I just need to control that factory for... maybe two days, it will be on napkins everywhere. The plan. For once Ill be getting the better of the machines. See, this is how it works: People read the napkins, and realize whats wrong. But also on the napkins is a proposal, which most people will take, because its common sense.   Whatever money they used to spend on fast food will be sent to my Brake the Chain foundation. The Napkins are just the beginning. Once the book is written, I can get on Oprahs booklist. I know how this country works. If I can get on Oprah, Ill gain the support of every woman. So maybe I do some late night shows, you know, the spokesperson thing- until the foundation reaches 8 billion dollars. It wont take long, McDonalds annual revenue by itself is 12.5 billion. Well be sucking money from fast food places all over the country. Man how far are you riding this bus to? Well, we should have plenty of time. 	 Okay. Now when I said I have a scientific mind, I mean that in more ways then one. Obviously, it takes a certain kind of person to draw all these connections, and have the ambition to carry all this stuff out. It also takes someone with social connections as well, and I have those. Ive lived in all the major cities at one point or another. Now stage two of my plan, people have told me its odd- but let me ask you this: when Columbo was kneeling before the Queen of Peru, do you think he gave a damn about what the court thought of him? With their whispers? No. He had one thing on his mind, America, and  Democracy .   Freedom  , man. He was a freedom fighter, and so am I. I would have be a lunatic to think I could change the entire world. Possibly the US, but not the entire world. So the real question is; these followers, how do I protect them from the machines? How do I save this sect of true humanity? We must start anew. From the ground up. Ill explain. 	 By now we have 8 billion, more then enough to catch the attention of John Carmack. You know who he is? The infamous programmer behind Doom and the Quake series. I happen to know hes been taking an interest in space travel recently, he has his own team in that X-Plane competition. We hire Id Software to design for us a ship, large enough to fit my followers. But heres the difficult part. The ship has to be in the shape of me. It will make sense later on. This is a pretty tough assignment for just Id Software, but going back to the social connections, you wont believe who I met in Tacoma, outside of a bar of all places. A guy named Ross, used to be an animator for the Transformers, that show. So Ill get him to do the advising to Carmack, since Ross is more of a conceptual visionary. 	 When youre a leader type, you gotta be thinking about the people. Thats why I know I have to provide for them, they need a direction after giving up the fast food. Thats why 2 billion of the foundation will be used to form Woodroses, an all natural health food store. The company policy will be: if you drove there, you cannot come inside. So heres a place they can go to eat, and it will keep them walking at the same time. All profits will go towards the construction of our ship. We getting off here? Right, I should finish. 	 With that added income, it shouldnt take long before were all on our way to Mars. The ship will land vertically, serving as a 10,000 scale statue around which well build our new society. Now this is where it gets philosophical. By this time weve definitely broken the chain, but you have to ask yourself how long do we have until those same chains come back... its people man, its people who bind themselves. This is some heavy shit were talking about here. So how do we escape the chains that bind? We become the chains. If we werent people, we could not be bound. Im no fool, you cannot live on Mars without the aid of machines. You just cant escape them any other way then to join them. My consciousness will be transferred into my mechanical statue, where I will help them construct my giant robotic wife. Once were done building her, its only a matter of us populating Mars with our own race of Decepticon children. 	 The only problem with this plan is, I gotta make a phone call, and I dont got the change. I gotta call a guy named Floyd Holland, he works night shift for Weston and Sons based out of Spokane. Once he hears my plan, hell be my contact in the company, and thats the first step man. So you have to decide, are you going to help humanity, or what?   Hello?           urlLink READ MORE!"

Word of the Day for Monday August 18, 2003     wunderkind \VOON-duhr-kint\, noun;    plural wunderkinder \-kin-duhr\:    1. A child prodigy.    2.

I was sitting playing my guitar and this little girl walks up to me (not my cousin) and starts talking to me. It was completely adorable. She was 4 I think. She asked me how I was playing guitar, and since I was playing above the 12th fret I started to explain to her how the Greeks discovered that if you cut a wavelength in half you end up with the same wavelengh in a different frequency, and how that applied to the strings.    She kept changing the subject. It was annoying, but cute.    Then out the the middle of nowhere she's like. ""I killed a hamsta"". I was like ""what?"" and she was like ""I picked him up and I threw him, and then I sat on him and he died"". It was a gift from God.

035S2LK,female,23,"I had a great weekend.  Abi came up on Friday so we talked about trip stuff stuff.  It was great seeing you Abi!  Then on Saturday I left bright and early and headed east.  The weather was great so driving was fun.  There's nothing like putting a great CD in and hitting the open road.  Arrived home around 2:30 to find my dad shovelling the driveway.  He was a little surprised to see me so early cuz I had said that I wasn't going to leave too early.  Chatted with my mom for a bit then went shopping for birthday presents for my aunt and grandma, and picked up my sister from work.  We were looking for plants, but it being valentines day, the shelves were pretty much empty.  We did find some that were good at the one florist shop, but the pickins were pretty slim.  My dad picked up my brother from a church function later that evening and then the whole family sat down to dinner together.  That doesn't happen much anymore so it was kinda nice.  Sunday morning I went to my home church (parents church), saw my Opa and a few friends, then headed over to my aunt's house.  She had it all decorated and setup, so there wasn't much to do but wait for my grandma to get there.  When Grandma walked in the door she was speechless.  Connie had asked her to come over for cake in the afternoon cuz she had a bunch of stuff to do in the evening.  But grandma was not expecting the whole family to be there.  Then she noticed that I was there too, and she said ""What are you doing here?""  Then she had to come and give me a hug.  She was so surprised, it was great.  We had dinner and cake, then another of my aunts pulled out a cake for my aunt Connie (her 30th birthday was in January).  She was so surprised.  She didn't know that it was really a double surprise party that she was hosting :)    Monday morning I took my brother back to school then headed back to GR.  So yeah, it was a fun weekend, especially getting to see my mom's side of the family again (it had been a while)."
035S2LK,female,23,"Last night, or rather this morning, I had a very strange dream.  Not strange in and of itself, strange in the realness of it.  At the beginning I was out shopping somewhere.  I returned to the parking lot and got into a vehicle, I believe it was a minivan.  At this time I was all by myself.  Then my dream sort of morphed into a roadtrip with girls from my dorm my freshman year.  I'm not sure where we were going, but as we were driving, the vehicle changed into a full size van.  A little bit later, a bunch of kids appeared and my parents too.  Then my three kids showed up.  Yes, that's right, my three kids.  I don't know where that came from.  In my dream I don't recall there being a father for them around anywhere.  It was just me and the kids.  I had a three year old girl and one year old twins, a boy and a girl.  The twins were quite remarkable, they were walking and talking in full sentences.  Kind of eerie now that I think about it.   I remember we all had to sit around a table, I think for dinner but first I had to change the little boy's diaper.    Ever have dreams that felt so real it was almost scary?  This was one of those dreams.  Not sure where my subconscious was going with this one, but I'm not entirely sure I like it either.  I mean why three?  And where was their father?  My brain comes up with strange things sometimes (and I know that leaves me wide open, go ahead)."

But it's still a pulse-throbbing read.   This isn't from  urlLink The Onion , but it did make me cry tears of laughter:   ""LONDON, England -- A British woman has been banned from owning a stereo or a television after playing music so loud that furniture in neighboring flats was moved by the vibrations.    Birmingham City Council welcomed the two-year  Anti-Social Behavior Order (ASBO)  against 33-year-old rap and karaoke fan Sharon McLoughlin, who is also being evicted from her flat.    She was also banned from causing harassment, alarm or distress anywhere in England and Wales for two years.""    Unlike the legions of law-abiding Brits who can cause harassment, alarm or distress anywhere they want, McLoughlin is now reduced to doing all of these things in Ireland and on the Isle of Man. Bully!   ""On one occasion, while speaking to witnesses in the property most affected, an officer from the Birmingham Anti-Social Behavior Unit (BASBU) could hardly hear what the residents were saying even though she was only around 6ft away from them, PA reported.     BASBU Manager Ian McGibbon  [not me]  told the UK news agency: ""This is an excellent example of officers from different council departments working together to solve a problem effectively.""   Wow, I'd never heard of ASBOs before! Imagine, a restraining order between annoying people and the technology that makes them annoying! Okay, maybe the loss of your house and stereo are severe punishments. But hey, can it be worse than what poor old Pee-Wee Herman got? Just imagine the possibilities:    Crime, annoyance down in 2005      WASHINGTON, Jan. 16, 2006 (PIMP) --Crime and annoyance rates both plunged in 2005, the FBI declared Monday in a new report.    Murder, rape, robbery and arson all dropped sharply in the first year of President Kerry's term, a statistic experts attribute to rising economic conditions.    ""Historically, crime patterns escalate in times when domestic conditions are at their worst,"" explained FBI director William J. Clinton. ""In the past few years, crime had risen sharply as the economy fell, people lost jobs and assistance venues dried up. Underfunded and understaffed law enforcement agencies also contributed to the problem.    ""Thanks in part to the president's 'Put the Hit Out on Crime' and 'Let's Actually Help the Poor!' campaigns, people are less and less inclined to commit offenses.""    Meanwhile, authorities are crediting the concurrent downturn in annoyance to Kerry's bold Anti-Social Swipe initative, a system that aims to reduce peace-disturbing violations. Clinton noted that the UK government had initiated its own version of the statute a couple of years earlier. In one now-famous case in 2004, a woman in Birmingham was evicted from her apartment and lost stereo privileges for blaring Eminem at a level that made neighbors' furniture vibrate.    ""Just in the few months that we've done it in the States, the ASSwipe program has resulted in the reduction of annoyance rates in just about every category,"" Clinton said.    Among the categories in which annoyance has dropped are incidents of cars with trunk-vibrating bass; screaming street evangelists; use of ""LOL"" and ""OMG"" in Internet chat rooms; Austin Powers impersonators; boy bands; telemarketers; Olsen twins movies; users of the slang ""hellz yeah""; and people who say ""irregardless.""    Clinton said that the primary success of ASSwipe lies in its power to separate offenders from the primary source of annoyance amplification. ""Initially opposed by free-speech advocates, careful ASSwipe enforcement has proven to actually strengthen the American discourse,"" he said. He cited the current restraining order between Rush Limbaugh and any microphone or camera as the most visible example. Limbaugh has since found a new career path by sitting in a chair in Miami and whispering segments of his show to people in their ears for $2 or a pill.     Fox News remains the recipient of the largest ASSwipe yet, forcing the entire network to disband in July 2005. Pressed for comment, Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly said, ""Mmmmmffff.""    This story (c) 2006 the Personal Ian McGibboney Press   Seriously, though, I don't think this kind of thing would take off in America. We're all about the noise here! And free speech. Still, those damn rattling car trunks...especially those friggin' white guys...

BA01YC4,male,24,"urlLink    Ronald Reagan  urlLink     Ronald ""Dutch"" Reagan, the 40th President of the United States (1981-89), died Saturday from complications of Alzheimer's-related pneumonia. Reagan, both the oldest president and the longest-living ex-prez in U.S. history, was 93. Or as Reagan himself would have said, ""The 54th anniversary of my 39th birthday.""  Reagan's death shows the true spirit of American politics; leaders from all sides are praising Reagan for his life as a visionary and as a positive role model. In a way, those praises are true; even I found Reagan to be genuinely hip and hilarious in his lighter moments.   For all his wit and charm, however, Reagan was a terrible president. Before Bush Deuce took the all-time title, Reagan set the standard for cluelessness in the Oval Office. The same positive qualities that he had refined as an actor (and had endeared him to so many average Americans) were the perfect front for a right-wing, feed-the-rich administration controlled by people who Reagan unfortunately trusted in that cheerful way of his. Poor people, the working class, the middle class, minorities, women and even most Republicans suffered considerably under his economic policies. Most of the time with a smile on their faces. Reagan gave us all something to take pride in, even if it was all bullshit. We wanted to BELIEVE. Many of us still do.  For all of our political differences, Reagan was a human being. Anyone dying is a tragedy, no matter who they are. And I will honor the dead just like I know the conservatives will when Bill Clinton dies. Reagan was a tough man who cheated death many, many times. He was also very open-minded; from his flirtation with the American Communist Party in the 1930s and his days as a liberal movie star to his McCarthyism and his eventual total shift to the right, Reagan never left a political stone unturned.  For a thorough account of the Ronald Reagan presidency and the 1980s, check out ""The Clothes Have No Emperor"" by Paul Slansky.

BA01YC4,male,24,"Nick Bouterie,  urlLink The Conservative Cajun , and I have a semi-debate going over columns that each of us wrote. A quick bit of background: I have written the liberal column for the University of Louisiana  urlLink Vermilion  since June 2002. At one time (April-November 2003), Nick was the conservative columnist. The two columns run next to each other on the same page, tombstone style, with a political cartoon at the bottom illustrating one of our topics (usually mine, since the cartoonist aligns himself with me). This format would be perfect for a point-counterpoint; unfortunately, this proved to be really difficult when I tried it with Nick's predecessor.  In the October 15, 2003 issue, however, Nick and I coincidentally wrote on the hot-button issue of the time: Rush Limbaugh's racist remark and subsequent termination from ESPN. Both Nick and I are big football fans, so a lot of heart went into these columns.  Why am I bringing this up? Because of the debate mentioned above. Nick has posted  urlLink his column  on his  urlLink page  (scroll down to Aug. 7) and we're trading opinions on whose was better. Not that it matters to me, but he doesn't think I  urlLink link to him  enough  urlLink  (""-- Hey, Icon  [my nickname] , as much as I link you in my posts, how about returning the favor?? Jack-a**!!)  , so I'll humor  urlLink him  and publish my own column from that date. Again, you can read his take  urlLink here .    McNabb's Rush Attack    By Ian McGibboney Oct. 15, 2003    Many intellectuals are fond of trashing sports, arguing that they distract people from the real world. I don't understand this at all because sports and politics are so similar. Both are protecting your allies and fighting for justice.  I am fierce about loyalty when it comes to my teams. I liked Jake Delhomme as a Cajun and a Saint, but not as a Panther. I despise the Carolina Panthers--unless they're playing the tlanta Falcons, in which case Jake is my favorite player ever.  This also works in politics; right now, I am firmly behind Wesley Clark for the Democratic nomination; but, if Howard Dean or John Kerry were eventually nominated, I'd vote for them in a second against Bush.  [What foresight!]   Such is the case with Donovan McNabb. Although he has the coolest name in the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback has always seemed to me like just another opponent. That was before Rush went after him, calling McNabb the creation of a media desperate for a black quarterback to succeed. Rush should know; he uses the same tactic every time he overrates George W. Bush   out of desperation for a Republican president to succeed.      For the record, this is exactly what Rush said on his segment of ESPNs pregame show  [NFL Sunday Countdown] : ""I think what we have had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous  [sic]  that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he did not deserve.""      The world of sports criticism isn't exactly the world's most civilized front. Any sports-radio show will net at least a few yahoos whose comments make Limbaugh's look downright polite. Still, national sports commentary is a very touchy field. It devoured its best ever, Howard Cosell, for calling a black wide receiver a ""monkey"" in 1983. Cosell, definitely not a racist, was known to use the word ""monkey"" as an affectionate term for his grandson. Regardless, he was shunned from the airwaves forever  [mainly by self-exile] . This was also the case with Jimmy ""The Greek"" Snyder, whose comment that blacks had better athletic genes from their days in the jungle got him fired from CBS in 1988.  [Actually, it was a comment about selective slave-breeding. But close.]   Rush should have known better than to broach the race topic. But ESPN knew exactly what to expect from its controversial new analyst. In fact, critics of ESPN's decision to hire him cited this as their number-one concern. Over the years, the broadcaster of disaster has talked endlessly about race on his radio show. And we're not talking about the playoff race. To wit:      ""Have you ever noticed how all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?""      ""Blacks are 12 percent of America. Who the hell cares what they think?""      McNabb is well-aware of Limbaugh's resonance with far too many people. ""I'm sure he's not the only one who feels that way,"" he said. ""But, it's shocking to actually hear that on national TV. An apology would do no good because he obviously thought about it before he said it.""      Dead on, Donovan.      Rush has refused to apologize, saying that his comment has caused furor only because everyone knows he is right. By logical extension, Limbaugh must want us to think he resigned from ESPN on principle. But it's more likely that he resigned to cover his butt and spend more quality time with his OxyContin.      Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Aaron Brooks is basking in all of the adulation he is getting from the media for being a black quarterback.

""Not to mention the Jackson Five, Diana Ross, Parliament-Funkadelic and even Donna Summer. My musical taste runs all over the map.     ""And have you checked out that Jessica Biel?"" Cole asked, referring to the 22-year-old former star of the TV series ""7th-Heaven."" ""Not only is she hot and a great young actress, I heard that she even plays soccer at the college she attends. What else could a guy want?""     Cole expressed similar affinity for a long list of 1980s pussy. ""Let's see, there's Beyonce Knowles, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Paris Hilton, the Bush twins and too many others to count. Yep, just like the 1970s rocked for music, so did the 1980s rock for pussy.""     Cole recalled that his favorite concert experience was catching the Grateful Dead in California in the late 1970s.     ""Man, that Dead concert was a blast,"" Cole remembered. ""A bunch of us dudes got together and drove all the way to Sacramento on impulse. That concert was the best ever. Not just a concert, but a life-changing event, you know?""     Another date that Cole remembered with fondness was June 13, 2004.     ""That was the day the Olsen twins finally became legal,"" he said. ""Man, I tell you, eighties pussy is the greatest!""      Garfield killed by jealous Heathcliff      MUNCIE, IND. (PP)--Garfield, the orange cat known worldwide for his long-running series of mischief and misadventures, was killed Sunday night at the hands of Heathcliff.     According to Muncie police reports, owner Jon Arbuckle found Garfield, 26, face-down in the pup tent he had used as a bed.     ""I passed by Garfield's pup tent and he was motionless and swaddled in his bedsheets,"" Arbuckle said. ""Being that this is far from unusual, I went on and continued my day. When he failed to respond to the aroma of the lasagna I was cooking him for lunch, however, then I became alarmed.""     According to coroners, Garfield's official cause of death was listed as acute suffocation. A plastic grocery bag had been finagled onto his face without any evidence of foul play.     ""The manner in which the plastic bag was affixed to the victim's head immediately caused us to suspect Heathcliff,"" said Joseph Winkle, Muncie chief of police. ""In order to accomplish that with so little interference, the assailant would have had to either be very quiet or have somehow convinced Garfield that there were groceries in the bag. Heathcliff knew that while no one should terrorize their neighborhood, he would not be outdone, playing pranks on everyone.""     Winkle further noted that Garfield had long been the target of Heathcliff, 31.     ""From 1973 to 1978, Heathcliff ruled over the orange-cat comics sphere,"" explained . ""With Garfield's birth in 1978, however, the tide began to turn and Heathcliff presumably became jealous.""     While Heathcliff was the first to have his own cartoon show, in 1980, it sputtered through several incarnations and lacked the consistent success that ""Garfield and Friends"" enjoyed during the late 1980s and early 1990s. While both cats' strips continue in print to this day, Heathcliff never sustained the continued pop-culture presence of his victim.     Garfield creator Jim Davis, Heathcliff cartoonist George Gately, Riff Raff and Odie were all unavailable for comment."

4AN3082,male,37,"Read  urlLink this  in the Australian today. Unusually good article for a Murdoch paper!    Poison of the 'I don't want to know' syndrome    26aug03  WE all know it's happening.   A slow-motion catastrophe is afflicting Western democracy. A growing indifference to politics deriving from feelings of futility and cynicism.   For example. People are inured to scandal. They expect duplicity from the political class  on all sides of politics. And they don't seem to care. In fact, they're beyond caring. They've learned to live with the duplicitous and dishonourable. Scepticism may be healthy but cynicism like this is carcinogenic. It kills the body politic.    There's a feedback loop that has politicians and their spin doctors driving the opinion polls while the opinion polls drive the politics.  Consequently, faith in the polity, the media, the system, in democracy itself, is rapidly eroding. In the US, symptoms include fewer and fewer citizens feeling compelled to vote. In a nation where it's non-compulsory, even presidents are elected by a depressingly small percentage of the electorate. It's approaching the point where only the white middle class bothers to pull the levers in those voting machines.   And you see it  or rather you don't see it  in Australia. In a phenomenon rarely discussed. Here we're driven to the ballot box by the threat of a fine. But although compulsory voting ensures a high turnout, it's low energy. People vote with indifference rather than enthusiasm.    The fact that a prime minister might have a 55 or 65 per cent approval rating doesn't prove that that approval is particularly approving. It simply demonstrates that, when forced to make a choice, voters go for what they perceive as the lesser of evils.    John Howard's ratings don't prove that Australia likes him very much or holds him in high regard. The figures simply mean the voters cop him. Had approval ratings been available in the era of a Chifley or a Curtin they'd have measured something different than the approval rating for a Keating or a Howard. The figures might look similar or identical, but they don't indicate the same depth of feeling. It's like the devaluation of the dollar. A dollar still looks like a dollar, is still symbolised by the ""$"". But a dollar isn't what it used to be. And nor, necessarily, is the ""%"".   We live in a devalued democracy where, increasingly, people are disengaged. Disengagement. A term that social researcher Hugh Mackay detects again and again in his political seismology.    Compounding this detachment is the paradox of living in a society that boasts the quality of its communications, either remaining or becoming ignorant on almost every issue. Thus recent polls show that legions of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein and his secular Baath Party were in bed with al-Qa'ida, that Hussein was one of the architects of the September 11 attacks. Millions are convinced that those WMD were used against US troops as they moved towards Baghdad. And, moreover, that the weapons have been found.    All evidence and information to the contrary is filtered out  and the finest filter of all is, yes, disengagement. Those Ridley Scott images of brave lads in great lumbering uniforms and great lumbering tanks are all you need to know.   Of course, the modern state has  weapons of mass distraction  at its disposal  knowing that the attention span of the media, even the quality media, is about a fortnight  while that of the public seems to be shrinking to nanoseconds. The state knows that the media bombardment means we rapidly forget; that today's great dollops of news bury yesterday's news, let alone the news of the month before. People live in a constant state of now, with decreasing historical understanding or context.   Best of all, governments know that, by and large, people don't want to know.  Australians didn't want to ""know"" the truth of the boatpeople. They wanted to ""know"" that they were queue-jumpers, illegals or even terrorists. They wanted to know that the dangers posed by Hussein's WMD were sufficient reason for going to war  and even if they now know they were conned, they don't want to know. They're more interested in what goes on in The Block, Big Brother and the shopping mall than what's happening in the hallowed halls of government.     And because voters seem increasingly indifferent to the moral and ethical issues that not so long ago galvanised public opinion, politicians believe they can get away with more. With murder. What does it matter if you're caught over ""kids overboard"" or WMD or back-room deals on ethanol? No worries, no trubs. You'll get away with it.    Thus our leaders are leading us  and we are leading our leaders  further and further down that road of disengagement. And political leadership becomes followship as, like ducks in a row, governments acquiesce to the US.  The best that can be said about Australia is that it takes a leading role in following."
4AN3082,male,37,"And another NZ / Naura / Tampa Story, also in the SMH. They must be trying to embarass the Howard govt in the election year. Similar story, but also a good read.  Some highlights/teaser quotes:   New Zealand has created new lives for the refugees that Australia abandoned to the Pacific solution   Only five months ago, Bushra Al Aridhi expected to die in the place she calls the jail - Australia's offshore processing centre on Nauru.  Today, she is pregnant with her second child and beginning a new life, with the husband she feared she would never see again, in a timber house overlooking Wellington Harbour in New Zealand's North Island.  (UberKiwi's note: I lived in Wellinngton for two years. It sucks. The weather is crap - its is either raining, or blowing a gale, or both. Sometimes you get a nice day - in the city, but everyone lives in the hills surrounding Wellington where its damp and misty and 5 degrees cooler than the city. Freeze your arse off. No room in the hills - all the house have been in-filled - your back patio is someone elses fron decking, and you park your car at the bottom of a hill, and then hike up to your house. Apologies to my family who live in Wellington.).  Bushra and her daughter, Hawra, spent two years and three months on Nauru, detained under Australia's Pacific solution, a warning of what others might expect if they tried to to get into Australia illegally. Meanwhile, her husband, Ahmed, endured a miserable freedom in Brisbane; he had his liberty, having been granted refugee status and a temporary protection visa (TPV) by Australia, but under the Howard Government's hardline policy, he had no prospect of ever being reunited with his wife and daughter. -------- While  Australia has gone to extreme lengths to separate families  in a bid to shut down the people-smuggling trade (denying, for example, any prospect of family reunion to those who came by boat after the Tampa), New Zealand has gone to extraordinary lengths to put families back together and give them a future.   Aside from the 131 asylum seekers New Zealand almost instantly accepted from the Tampa in 2001, it has quietly taken about 270 asylum seekers from Australia's offshore processing centres at Nauru and Manus Island .  They are being reunited with more than 360 immediate family members after New Zealand missions to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Reuniting refugee families represents one of the most ambitious, delicate, challenging and complex family reunion projects ever undertaken by New Zealand immigration. ----- For Bushra and others interviewed by the Herald, Nauru became the jail for broken spirits. The stifling heat and lack of fresh water, combined with the numbing uncertainty and the regular disappointment of rejection, aged their bodies prematurely and twisted their minds.  ""It was a horrible situation,"" says Sajjad Sarwari, who has been reunited with his brother Ali's family in Hamilton, south of Auckland. ""We should not call Nauru a detention centre or a camp. It is a hellhole. I am really sorry for those who are still there, worried about them."" ------ Latifa Ali, reunited with her husband, Jawed, in Hamilton  (UberKiwi note: Hamilton is not bad - bloody hot and humid, but better than  Wellington. Apolgies now to my family members who live in Hamilton and  Wellington) , says the worst moments for young mothers were having to wait for a bucket of salt water to wash their babies, and being rejected for asylum - not once but twice - despite the fact that their husbands' claims had already been accepted.  Although, the Government insists the women were assessed and rejected as refugees according to the UNHCR's refugee test, the UNHCR has consistently argued that spouses and minor children of recognised refugees should be given refugee status. ------- Each of the families expresses gratitude to New Zealand and Susan Harris Rimmer, the UNHCR official who put their case to the NZ Government. Bushra reveals that she has conceived since being reunited. The baby is due in six months and, if it is a girl, they will call it Susan. --------- Ahmed says he would like to return to Australia to visit friends and thank those who employed and helped him during his three years in Brisbane, but not while the Howard Government is in power.  Though the couple will be entitled to New Zealand citizenship in three years and therefore be able to settle legally in Australia, they insist their loyalty will always be to New Zealand and their future is there. ""This country has given me, my family, a new life, a good life,"" beams Bushra Al Aridhi. ""Freedom! Freedom!"" -----------"
4AN3082,male,37,"Short but good interview with Michael Moore, director/ maker of the documentary Fahrenheit 9/11.   In Fahrenheit 9/11 I wanted to deal with the mass fear and the mass hysteria that those in power often try to create, in part to distract the population from the real issues that we need to be dealing with, and in part to see that their agenda is enacted. There is no way that the Bush administration could have had the Iraq war unless they first tried to scare the American people into believing that Saddam Hussein had something to do with September 11.  In this film I wanted to show Americans how they're manipulated with all of this fear, with these Orange alerts, and this thinking that we could be killed and attacked at any time. This is the essence of what Orwell was saying in 1984: that the leaders needed to have the people in a constant state of fear. Because if you could convince them that the enemy was everywhere, anywhere, and could attack at any time, the people would willingly give up their freedoms in order to be protected. And that is what they have been attempting to do for the last two and a half years.    urlLink BBC - Films - Michael Moore : ""Fahrenheit 9/11"""
4AN3082,male,37,"Found this interesting article at the Guardian:   urlLink http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1022663,00.html    Brutal reality hits home      Since Vietnam, the public has only seen a sanitised version of war. But the internet, with its unfettered access, has changed all that. Sean Dodson reports      Sean Dodson      Thursday August 21, 2003      The Guardian     The warning comes before the image. A two-paragraph disclaimer justifying some of the most gruesome images of war you are likely to see. The first image is of a boy with his legs blown off. Then there is another child - face in close-up - with streams of blood pouring down his young face. The next is the head of a horribly burned man swathed in white bandages. It is followed by the swollen neck of a peace protester, the victim of wood pellets fired from a gun in Oakland. The website adds that the suspects are policemen.  These images - and some far, far worse - come courtesy of a New Zealand website that describes itself as a ""fiercely independent internet news agency"". For several months, Scoop Media has been publishing the kind of graphic images you rarely see in mass circulation newspapers or on western television. And, until now, rarely on the internet.   Ever since Roger Fenton, a founder of the Royal Photographic Society, covered the Crimean war armed with a box camera and a letter of introduction from Prince Albert, photojournalism has been an essential part of war reporting. Fenton's aim, and that of   Prince Albert, was to provide a set of images that would restore public confidence in an unpopular war. The role of the war photographer was set.   But by the time of the Vietnam war, photography as a propaganda tool had backfired. Horrific images of the conflict turned the US public against the war. Since then, in each subsequent war, the public has been presented with images far less graphic. The recent war in Iraq was no different, with a straw poll by  MediaGuardian.co.uk  at the war's height indicating that few UK picture editors were willing to risk upsetting readers with pictures of fatalities, even if they were in the background. As Phillip Knightley wrote in the First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo: ""Although in most cases the camera does not lie directly, it can lie brilliantly by omission.""   ""To sanitise the reality of warfare is abhorrent,"" explains Scoop's editor, Alastair Thompson. ""To censor images of capture, of death, as a consequence of war, is wrong. If Scoop were to do so, it would be subscribing to the glitzy rah rah Hollywood-facade-style of reportage that the mainstream United States-based media has become obsessed with.""    The Qatari news network, al-Jazeera, painted no such picture during the war. And it could have provided a counterbalance for western audiences. But its English language website was inaccessible during much of the conflict. A denial of service attack on the site, allegedly the target of belligerent hackers, shut it down, preventing a western audience from seeing a far more bloody portrait of Iraq. That website is now under wraps, preparing itself for a relaunch later this year.   Even if you can't speak a word of Arabic, the internet allows you less fettered access to the realities of war. You don't even have to look hard. Simply type ""war graphic image iraq"" into Google and you can see some of   the most terrible images imaginable. Many are from IndyMedia sites, alternative news networks and Arab stations, but there are stranger bedfellows, too. Among Google's returns will be a site called Babykiller.com, built by US anti-abortionists who rage against the war by cataloguing pictures of child atrocities. The left-wing Scoop Media has some surprising company.   Viewing these sites throws up a number of moral dilemmas. Are you being voyeuristic? Are the websites perversely triumphal? Are they simply preaching to the converted, providing nothing but war pornography? What about notions of taste and decency?   ""Are taste and decency relevant standards when considering war?"" asks Thompson. ""War is horrible, it is grotesque, revolting and deeply disturbing. Why should it be any different for the public, in whose name the mayhem is being waged? This is not to say we did not have misgivings about publishing some images, we did.""   Each news organisation, be it a website, a newspaper or a television station, has debates about what images to show. The images of the bloated heads of the dead Uday and Qusay Hussein were only published in the Guardian and on its website, Guardian Unlimited, after much heated debate.   But even when television does portray war in all its graphic and uncensored detail, it holds it at arms' length. Channel 4's excellent The True Face of War was screened at 11.20pm. As one viewer wrote on the Channel 4 website: ""However distressing - and I can hardly write this through my tears - this programme should be shown at PRIME time.""   It is worth remembering, there is no prime time on the internet. There is only choice. Although military censorship and hacker attacks can disrupt it, a more graphic face of war is bleeding on to the internet and coverage of war may be never the same.

4AN3082,male,37,"War Thoughts     Following are some good articles I have read over the last few days. Enjoy.     How to save Brand America    As Iraqis quake in justified terror, Americans fret about the threat to their 'values' and wonder why they are so widely disliked. Here one friend of America lists the reasons... and the remedy   Henry Porter Sunday March 23, 2003 The Observer    urlLink See the online article here   On Friday evening a spokesman from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles explained that it was important to continue with a scaled-down Oscar ceremony 'when American values were under attack'. As his statement was relayed by the BBC we learned that American B52s had dropped their payload over Iraq and that hundreds of cruise missiles were striking at Baghdad. The TV screen began to pulse with livid blooms from the explosions.  I can't have been the only one to wonder how the man from the Academy had produced the classic response of victimhood when at that very moment American values were being unambiguously asserted at the heart of Saddam's regime. That night's bombing will be remembered in the Arab world for a generation or more.  No one in the Middle East can possibly fail to take the lesson about the reach and precision of US military might, let alone the determination to use it. But once the hostilities are over in Iraq, the greatest challenge to the American Imperium is to replace some of the fear that the bombing has inspired with a reputation for fairness and doing what it has promised in Iraq and Palestine.  Last year, before Bush had decided to act on Iraq, the White House commissioned a report from advertising and media executives on the way America was seen in the world. The report shook Bush. Even America's allies characterised the US as arrogant, self-aborbed and hypocritical. Bush reacted by setting up an office of global communications in the White House, removing the responsibility for selling 'Brand America' from the State department. It duly began work last autumn.  If selling the US presented problems last year, the task is vastly more difficult today. A country which stands for individual freedom and whose people are so eager to do the right thing - even though, as Churchill observed, they may explore all other options beforehand - is now considered by millions to be halfway between behemoth and pariah.  Americans are amazed by the slide in their standing, particularly after the attacks of 9/11. Last year Congressman named Henry Hyde asked: 'How is it that a country that invented Hollywood and Madison Avenue has allowed such a destructive and parodied image of itself to become the intellectual coin of the realm?'  The short answer to this is that Hollywood and Madison Avenue are used to sell the American dream to Americans and a once-receptive audience outside the US. They are not remotely equipped to address the deep rifts in policy and purpose which have opened up between the United States and the rest of the world. Like it or not, America is seen as greedy and domineering, and this is a dangerous development for all those who believe that liberal democracy depends on America's success and acceptance in the world.  In the two-and-half years since Bush came to power after a disputed Florida count involving just 170,000 unreadable ballot papers, attitudes have greatly sharpened, partly because Bush's mandate remained unconvincing but also because of the unapologetic nature of his regime. The exercise of power came to the new administration as second nature.  Many of its members - Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz - were veterans of up to four previous Republican administrations. In exile they had seized the idea - in a way Clinton never chose to - that the power of the US, financially, technologically and militarily, could and should be deployed to consolidate American dominance in the twenty-first century.  At the same time, Bush seemed a second-rate figure and his unshakeable self-satisfaction was hard to attribute to any achievement or intellectual distinction. Instead, he appeared to be the passive beneficiary of his father's career. And George Junior seemed to be a man so untroubled by his actions that he was in bed and asleep 45 minutes after addressing the nation on TV this week. To many this was the action of a man too breezily unimaginative to envisage the bombardment that would take place over Baghdad. Unfair maybe, but that is how it looked.  Another characteristic of the administration which is responsible for the new levels of anti-Americanism is that it not only disdains meaningful consultation with lesser powers, it does not even bother to go through the motions. When Roosevelt returned from Yalta he stopped off in Egypt to consult and explain. When America was building the alliance for the 1991 Gulf war, Secretary of State James Baker toured the Middle East to reassure Turkey and its Arab neighbours. Bush, on the other hand, has no knowledge of the Middle East and his Secretary of State Colin Powell has mostly remained in Washington and New York these past months to make sure that Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz didn't make a grab for US foreign policy.  But it would be wrong to blame Bush and co for America's reputation today. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the victory of the 1991 Gulf war there has been a gradual increase in what historian and author Margaret Macmillan, in her book, Peacemakers , calls 'American exceptionalism'.  'Faith in their own exceptionalism,' she writes, 'has sometimes led to a certain obtuseness on the part of Americans, a tendency to preach at other nations rather than listen to them, a tendency to assume that American motives are pure where those of others are not.'  The habit of exceptionalism came to the fore during the Clinton era when despite a seemingly amenable diplomatic stance there were many occasions when America opted out. It was of course Clinton's government that failed to sign a treaty banning landmines because US personnel might be compromised in the Korean demilitarised zone. Clinton also refused to ratify the treaty to set up the International Criminal Court in Rome. Why? Because America believes its international responsibilities as chief peacekeeper and enforcer placed its citizens at unusual risk of prosecution.  In his first months of the Bush presidency the US opted out the Kyoto agreement to limit carbon emissions and the Anti-Ballistic Missiles treaty on the grounds that it wanted to develop a missile defence system. Last summer plans to provide the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention with inspection powers were blocked by the Bush administration - which, given the pretext for going to war on Iraq, certainly seems a bit rich.  Across a broad range of activities America either asserted its right to special privileges or simply declared itself to be above the law. The most starkly hypocritical example was when in March last year the free trade enthusiasts of the Republican administration capitulated to demands by US steel makers to impose tough new tariffs on steel imports. At the same time America, as a country which strongly advocated a plan to reduce subsidies and tariffs in farming around the world, insisted on its right to give $100 billion in subsidies to its own farmers.  It has become clear that America has been shrewdly manipulating many agendas in its own interests. Some of these initiatives are so obscure or technical that they never reach the public consciousness, but they are important nonetheless.  For instance, in January last year Professor Robert Hunter Wade of the London School of Economics pointed out that the US had manipulated 'the World Trade Organisation to commit to a General Agreement on Trade in Services that will facilitate a global market in private health care, welfare, pensions, education and water, supplied - naturally - by US companies, and which will undermine political support for universal access to social services in developing countries'.  Later in the same article he says: 'Globalisation and global supervisory organisations enable the United States to harness the rest of the world to its own rhythms and structures.'  In other words, we are dancing to the American tune, probably much more than any of us in the cushioned West appreciate. In the developing world, however, there is a strong yet ill-defined sense that living standards are kept low in order to allow Americans to consume far more than they actually produce.  It would be unfair to reach these harsh conclusions without pointing out that America does provide much aid and expertise to the developing world and pours billions of dollars into peacekeeping operations. Still there is a gathering conviction that America is, to use the word of the moment, in state of persistent non-compliance on too many protocols, agreements, treaties and conventions to number. And that cannot be a good thing for the reputation of the US, nor an impression easily reversed by a few eager young men selling Brand America.  To a fond outsider like myself, America has become perplexingly inconsistent. Though this administration talks up democratic values it actively supports dictatorships in Pakistan and central Asia, and wobbled when a democratically elected government was threatened with a coup in Venezuela. Too often the Bush government's principles are forgotten in the cause of political expedience. And this has been true during the fight against terrorism at home where suspects have been arrested and isolated from the normal judicial process without a qualm.  I've been amazed how quickly Americans have gone along with the loss of treasured and symbolic rights and saddened that the American media has not done more to oppose the authorities.  It is difficult to overestimate the shock that 9/11 delivered to the American psyche. Security has become a national obsession. It seems odd to the outside world that while US troops were being deployed in the Gulf, Americans were stocking up on bottled water and tape to seal their homes from chemical weapons attacks. There is something rather panicky and self-obsessed about the US today and it is in this atmosphere that any challenge to the government or security agencies is immediately classed as unpatriotic.  Americans will bridle at these observations, but as Philip Roth pointed out in October, since 9/11 they have indulged in 'an orgy of national narcissism and a gratuitous victim mentality which is repugnant'.  Now the bombs have rained on Baghdad it is time for America to stop worrying about its values being under attack and to re-engage with the world, showing the openness and generosity that was once so admired.  That is the only way to reinvigorate Brand America.        Empire State, a novel by Henry Porter about a US/UK counter-terrorist operation, is published by Orion in September.          The great charade      As the West prepares for an assault on Iraq, John Pilger argues that 'war on terror' is a smokescreen created by the ultimate terrorist ... America itself  John Pilger Sunday July 14, 2002 The Observer    urlLink See the online article here   It is 10 months since 11 September, and still the great charade plays on. Having appropriated our shocked response to that momentous day, the rulers of the world have since ground our language into a paean of cliches and lies about the 'war on terrorism' - when the most enduring menace, and source of terror, is them.  The fanatics who attacked America came from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. No bombs fell on these American protectorates. Instead, more than 5,000 civilians have been bombed to death in stricken Afghanistan, the latest a wedding party of 40 people, mostly women and children. Not a single al-Qaeda leader of importance has been caught.  Following this 'stunning victory', hundreds of prisoners were shipped to an American concentration camp in Cuba, where they have been held against all the conventions of war and international law. No evidence of their alleged crimes has been produced, and the FBI confirms only one is a genuine suspect. In the United States, more than 1,000 people of Muslim background have 'disappeared'; none has been charged. Under the draconian Patriot Act, the FBI's new powers include the authority to go into libraries and ask who is reading what.  Meanwhile, the Blair government has made fools of the British Army by insisting they pursue warring tribesmen: exactly what squaddies in putties and pith helmets did over a century ago when Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, described Afghanistan as one of the 'pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a great game for the domination of the world'.  There is no war on terrorism; it is the great game speeded up. The difference is the rampant nature of the superpower, ensuring infinite dangers for us all.  Having swept the Palestinians into the arms of the supreme terrorist Ariel Sharon, the Christian Right fundamentalists running the plutocracy in Washington, now replenish their arsenal in preparation for an attack on the 22 million suffering people of Iraq. Should anyone need reminding, Iraq is a nation held hostage to an American-led embargo every bit as barbaric as the dictatorship over which Iraqis have no control. Contrary to propaganda orchestrated from Washington and London, the coming attack has nothing to do with Saddam Hussein's 'weapons of mass destruction', if these exist at all. The reason is that America wants a more compliant thug to run the world's second greatest source of oil.  The drum-beaters rarely mention this truth, and the people of Iraq. Everyone is Saddam Hussein, the demon of demons. Four years ago, the Pentagon warned President Clinton that an all-out attack on Iraq might kill 'at least' 10,000 civilians: that, too, is unmentionable. In a sustained propaganda campaign to justify this outrage, journalists on both sides of the Atlantic have been used as channels, 'conduits', for a stream of rumours and lies. These have ranged from false claims about an Iraqi connection with the anthrax attacks in America to a discredited link between the leader of the 11 September hijacks and Iraqi intelligence. When the attack comes, these consorting journalists will share responsibility for the crime.  It was Tony Blair who served notice that imperialism's return journey to respectability was under way. Hark, the Christian gentleman-bomber's vision of a better world for 'the starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, those living in want and squalor from the deserts of northern Africa to the slums of Gaza to the mountain ranges of Afghanistan.' Hark, his 'abiding' concern for the 'human rights of the suffering women of Afghanistan' as he colluded with Bush who, as the New York Times reported, 'demanded the elimination of truck convoys that provide much of the food and other supplies to Afghanistan's civilian population'. Hark his compassion for the 'dispossessed' in the 'slums of Gaza', where Israeli gunships, manufactured with vital British parts, fire their missiles into crowded civilian areas.  As Frank Furedi reminds us in The New Ideology of Imperialism , it is not long ago 'that the moral claims of imperialism were seldom questioned in the West. Imperialism and the global expansion of the western powers were represented in unambiguously positive terms as a major contributor to human civilisation.' The quest went wrong when it was clear that fascism was imperialism, too, and the word vanished from academic discourse. In the best Stalinist tradition, imperialism no longer existed. Today, the preferred euphemism is 'civilisation'; or if an adjective is required, 'cultural'.  From Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, an ally of crypto-fascists, to impeccably liberal commentators, the new imperialists share a concept whose true meaning relies on a xenophobic or racist comparison with those who are deemed uncivilised, culturally inferior and might challenge the 'values' of the West. Watch the 'debates' on Newsnight. The question is how best 'we' can deal with the problem of 'them'.  For much of the western media, especially those commentators in thrall to and neutered by the supercult of America, the most salient truths remain taboos. Professor Richard Falk, of Cornell university, put it succinctly some years ago. Western foreign policy, he wrote, is propagated in the media 'through a self righteous, one-way moral/legal screen [with] positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened, validating a campaign of unrestricted violence'.  Perhaps the most important taboo is the longevity of the United States as both a terrorist state and a haven for terrorists. That the US is the only state on record to have been condemned by the World Court for international terrorism (in Nicaragua) and has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling on governments to observe international law, is unmentionable.  'In the war against terrorism,' said Bush from his bunker following 11 September, 'we're going to hunt down these evil-doers wherever they are, no matter how long it takes.'  Strictly speaking, it should not take long, as more terrorists are given training and sanctuary in the United States than anywhere on earth. They include mass murderers, torturers, forme and future tyrants and assorted international criminals. This is virtually unknown to the American public, thanks to the freest media on earth.  There is no terrorist sanctuary to compare with Florida, currently governed by the President's brother, Jeb Bush. In his book Rogue State , former senior State Department official Bill Blum describes a typical Florida trial of three anti-Castro terrorists, who hijacked a plane to Miami at knifepoint. 'Even though the kidnapped pilot was brought back from Cuba to testify against the men,' he wrote, 'the defence simply told the jurors the man was lying, and the jury deliberated for less than an hour before acquitting the defendants.'  General Jose Guillermo Garcia has lived comfortably in Florida since the 1990s. He was head of El Salvador's military during the 1980s when death squads with ties to the army murdered thousands of people. General Prosper Avril, the Haitian dictator, liked to display the bloodied victims of his torture on television. When he was overthrown, he was flown to Florida by the US Government. Thiounn Prasith, Pol Pot's henchman and apologist at the United Nations, lives in New York. General Mansour Moharari, who ran the Shah of Iran's notorious prisons, is wanted in Iran, but untroubled in the United States.  Al-Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan were kindergartens compared with the world's leading university of terrorism at Fort Benning in Georgia. Known until recently as the School of the Americas, it trained tyrants and some 60,000 Latin American special forces, paramilitaries and intelligence agents in the black arts of terrorism.  In 1993, the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador named the army officers who had committed the worst atrocities of the civil war; two-thirds of them had been trained at Fort Benning. In Chile, the school's graduates ran Pinochet's secret police and three principal concentration camps. In 1996, the US government was forced to release copies of the school's training manuals, which recommended blackmail, torture, execution and the arrest of witnesses' relatives.  In recent months, the Bush regime has torn up the Kyoto treaty, which would ease global warming, to which the United States is the greatest contributor. It has threatened the use of nuclear weapons in 'pre-emptive' strikes (a threat echoed by Defence Minister Geoffrey Hoon). It has tried to abort the birth of an international criminal court. It has further undermined the United Nations by blocking a UN investigation of the Israeli assault on a Palestinian refugee camp; and it has ordered the Palestinians to replace their elected leader with an American stooge. At summit conferences in Canada and Indonesia, Bush's people have blocked hundreds of millions of dollars going to the most deprived people on earth, those without clean water and electricity.  These facts will no doubt beckon the inane slur of 'anti-Americanism'. This is the imperial prerogative: the last refuge of those whose contortion of intellect and morality demands a loyalty oath. As Noam Chomsky has pointed out, the Nazis silenced argument and criticism with 'anti German' slurs. Of course, the United States is not Germany; it is the home of some of history's greatest civil rights movements, such as the epic movement in the 1960s and 1970s.  I was in the US last week and glimpsed that other America, the one rarely seen among the media and Hollywood stereotypes, and what was clear was that it was stirring again. The other day, in an open letter to their compatriots and the world, almost 100 of America's most distinguished names in art, literature and education wrote this:   'Let it not be said that people in the United States did nothing when their government declared a war without limit and instituted stark new measures of repression. We believe that questioning, criticism and dissent must be valued and protected. Such rights are always contested and must be fought for. We, too, watched with shock the horrific events of September 11. But the mourning had barely begun when our leaders launched a spirit of revenge. The government now openly prepares to wage war on Iraq - a country that has no connection with September 11.  'We say this to the world. Too many times in history people have waited until it was too late to resist. We draw on the inspiration of those who fought slavery and all those other great causes of freedom that began with dissent. We call on all like-minded people around the world to join us.'   It is time we joined them.     This is a revised extract from The New Rulers of the World , by John Pilger, published by Verso.

The last thing the US wants is democracy in Iraq      Nick Cohen Sunday July 28, 2002 The Observer    urlLink See the online article here   Although everyone is lining up for or against a war on Iraq, few are asking what the war would be for. We know it would be against Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. But what will the Americans and their British sidekicks be fighting to replace the tyrant with?  It's impossible to say with certainty, but most reports from Washington suggest that Bush wants another tyrant and Blair will concur. The alternative is the Iraqi National Congress, a loose and fractious coalition, but one which, for all its faults, is committed to democracy. The CIA and State Department hate it and the bad example a liberated Iraq would give to the repressed people of Saudi Arabia.  The hostility has relented a little - the State Department has agreed to meet the INC on 9 August. We'll have to see what happens, but Iraqi exiles believe the CIA has a list of 15 approved generals from which a new leader will be picked.  The prime candidate was General Nizar al-Khazraji, the army chief of staff when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the highest-ranking military defector. He lives in exile in Copenhagen and had nothing to fear except Hussein's assassins until a Kurdish refugee saw him in the street.  In a scene straight out of Marathon Man, the refugee cried that this was the man who had levelled his village. The Danish Justice Ministry is now investigating charges that al-Khazraji was up to his neck in the 'Anfal' campaign of 1988 (named after the cheery chapter in the Koran on the spoils of war).  Uncounted numbers of Kurds were driven from their homes and tens of thousands died in prison camps. Al-Khazraji denies the charges, and many Kurdish leaders are working on the 'my enemy's enemy principle' and don't give a damn what he did.  If the US goes for a military hardman, it is likely to find a general against whom plausible allegations of war crimes can be made. The alternative is a democratic, federal Iraq, which gives rights to the Kurds and Shias currently suffering under the apartheid rule of the Sunni minority, and places the military under civilian control.  The INC says neither Downing Street nor the Foreign Office has raised a voice in support of its democratic dream. If anything, the Brits are more fanatical supporters of infinite injustice in the Gulf than the Yanks."
4AN3082,male,37,"How many Americans will die for oil?   August 4 2003  George Bush has given oil companies carte blanche in Iraq. This will lead to disaster, writes Kenneth Davidson.  Is Iraq's oil good enough reason for one or two of America's 148,000 occupying forces to die in Iraq each day over the next four years?  The answer is probably no, if the growth of dissident military communities such as the ""Bring Them Home Now!"" lobby is any indication.  Resentment among the troops, and their families, about their being stuck in Iraq after the war has not been helped by the failure of the Bush Administration to come up with weapons of mass destruction, and President George Bush's response to reports that attacks on occupying troops were increasing (""bring 'em on"").  But what would the occupying forces and their families make of Bush's executive order 13303, promulgated without fanfare in May, which gives sweeping powers to US oil companies operating in Iraq while granting immunity to them for the consequences of any of their actions in exploiting the oil.  In a report last month for the US Democratic legal think tank Government Accountability Project (GAP), the legal director, Tom Devine, said that in terms of legal liability, 13303 ""cancels the concept of corporate accountability and abandons the rule of law . . . (It) is a blank cheque for corporate anarchy. Its sweeping, unqualified language places the industry above domestic and international law for anything related to commerce in Iraqi oil.""  The immunity is unconstrained. The opening sentence decrees that ""any judicial process"" is ""null and void"". Section 1 (b) shields the value ""of any nature whatsoever"" if it is ""related to"" the ""sale or marketing of . . . all Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products"" or ""interests"".  According to Devine: ""That means all corporate activities with roots or any connection to Iraqi oil. It covers everything from extraction through transportation, advertising, manufacture, customer service, corporate records and payment of taxes. It covers compliance with contractual obligations involving Iraq that industry enters into with the US Government in postwar Iraq. The scope can be further expanded to virtually all oil-related commerce, by blending Iraqi oil with domestic supplies for any commercial transaction.""  The executive order applies to US ""persons"" (including corporations or other organisations) who ""come into possession or control"" of anything relevant to Iraqi oil or oil products. Devine comments: ""Translated from the legalese, this is a licence for corporations to loot Iraq and its citizens.""  The order is built on UN Security Council resolution 1483, which ended sanctions against Iraq and led to the establishment of the Development Fund for Iraq - into which the $1.7 billion of Iraqi money from the UN Oil-for-Food program and all proceeds from future sales of Iraqi oil and gas will be placed.  The development fund is controlled by Paul Bremer, who is in charge of the US occupation of Iraq, and it will be overseen by a board that includes representatives of the UN, the World Bank and the IMF.  Critics of the development fund point out that the money from past and future Iraqi oil sales deposited in the fund will be used to leverage US public and private loans to rebuild the Iraqi infrastructure and to develop Iraq's huge oil reserves.  According to Devine, executive order 13303 violates UN resolution 1483 rather than implementing it.  While the UN resolution granted limited immunity for oil-related reconstruction activities, it made clear these immunities did not extend beyond ""the initial purchaser"" for misconduct beyond ""privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations"" and for ""any legal proceedings in which recourse to such proceeds or obligations is necessary to satisfy liability for damages assessed in connection with an ecological accident, including an oil spill, that occurs after the date of the is resolution"".  The companies, which will be operating on seed capital provided by Iraqi oil and the US taxpayer, will have had cancelled their civil and criminal liability abroad and domestically, as well as their normal liability for spending of US taxpayers' money.  According to Devine: ""Under the executive order there is no accountability to the taxpayers for taxpayer-supported spending by . . . firms with US contracts . . . It cancels liability for civil fraud in government contracts under the False Claims Act, the most effective anti-fraud statute. In short, the order is a blank cheque for pork-barrel spending.""  It is also a recipe for intensified conflict between the occupiers and the occupied.  The question is, for how long will US troops be prepared to risk death for Bush's Texas oil mates?

4AN3082,male,37,"America brings Darth Vader to the desert    From Daniel McGrory in southern Iraq       THE American infantryman controlling the checkpoint on the road to al-Nasiriyah was clad in so much body armour he looked like Darth Vader.  Dark goggles covered most of his face, a khaki scarf was wrapped around his nose and mouth. His M16 assault rifle was pointed at the windscreen of the saloon car, which was clearly being driven by a young woman who had young children in the backseat.   This did not stop the young soldier from screaming at the occupants to step out of the vehicle and move to the side of the road. How much of that muffled command the frightened woman understood was unclear, but as she hesitated and tried to comfort the youngest of her children, who was trying to clamber over the seat towards her, the infantrymen yelled even louder.   It was difficult to tell who was the more nervous. Rifles remained trained on the mother and children, who were made to stand 60ft away from their car while it was searched. There was no attempt to explain to the woman why this was necessary, but American patrols appear to treat everyone now as if they are suicide bombers.   You would not expect British commanders to criticise their allies publicly, but troops who have witnessed Americans at close quarters in this war are baffled at their approach to Iraqi civilians. British troops manning checkpoints in Safwan, Umm Qasr, al-Zubayr and Rumaillah were ordered yesterday to replace helmets with berets. A British military spokesman said: It looks less aggressive, makes us appear more open and friendly.   One captain in the Royal Marines, watching a US unit monitor a checkpoint, said: The Americans are still behaving like invaders, not liberators. They behave as if they hate these people.   Indeed, many American troops speak as though they do. You often hear them describe Eye-rakis in disparaging language. One US officer in charge of delivering humanitarian aid earlier this week likened the crush of people waiting to get hold of food and water to a pack of stray dogs. His troops idea of crowd control was to lash at those pushing to the front of the queue with fists and rifle butts, even firing shots into the air.   When Irish Guards were nearly mobbed by a crowd trying to grab the food that they were delivering to al- Zubayr this week, Major David Hannah urged his men to keep calm and to get the people to sit down.   They need to have their dignity respected, and while this is a sticking plaster approach we need to make better contacts with locals to ensure the food goes to the needy, he said.   British units have asked local worthies, such as hospital directors, teachers and anybody untainted by association with the regime, to distribute food aid as they see fit.   British commanders are appalled at how the Americans pulverise anything from afar before daring to set foot out of their armoured vehicles.   This was no better illustrated than in the first skirmish of the land war, where the American 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit was handed what should have been the easy capture of the seaport of Umm Qasr. Royal Marine officers watched incredulously as their US compatriots bombed and shelled the town for five days.   There is no doubt that the experience of nearly 30 years policing Ulster has taught British forces that the only way to root out gunmen is to patrol on foot, searching house by house. They did this in Bosnia, in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan.   The rhetoric of US soldiers is often provocative. When an American colonel was asked by The Times what the role of the Fifth Corps would be, he replied: We are going in there, we are going to root out the bad guys and kill them.   His men, grouped around him, grunted, whooped and punched the air as if they were watching a football match.   A British officer who saw this exchange shook his head and walked away, saying: We are working from a different script but you wont get anyone in Whitehall to admit it.     urlLink"
4AN3082,male,37,"And another NZ / Naura / Tampa Story, also in the SMH. They must be trying to embarass the Howard govt in the election year. Similar story, but also a good read.  Some highlights/teaser quotes:   New Zealand has created new lives for the refugees that Australia abandoned to the Pacific solution   Only five months ago, Bushra Al Aridhi expected to die in the place she calls the jail - Australia's offshore processing centre on Nauru.  Today, she is pregnant with her second child and beginning a new life, with the husband she feared she would never see again, in a timber house overlooking Wellington Harbour in New Zealand's North Island.  (UberKiwi's note: I lived in Wellinngton for two years. It sucks. The weather is crap - its is either raining, or blowing a gale, or both. Sometimes you get a nice day - in the city, but everyone lives in the hills surrounding Wellington where its damp and misty and 5 degrees cooler than the city. Freeze your arse off. No room in the hills - all the house have been in-filled - your back patio is someone elses fron decking, and you park your car at the bottom of a hill, and then hike up to your house. Apologies to my family who live in Wellington.).  Bushra and her daughter, Hawra, spent two years and three months on Nauru, detained under Australia's Pacific solution, a warning of what others might expect if they tried to to get into Australia illegally. Meanwhile, her husband, Ahmed, endured a miserable freedom in Brisbane; he had his liberty, having been granted refugee status and a temporary protection visa (TPV) by Australia, but under the Howard Government's hardline policy, he had no prospect of ever being reunited with his wife and daughter. --------  While Australia has gone to extreme lengths to separate families in a bid to shut down the people-smuggling trade (denying, for example, any prospect of family reunion to those who came by boat after the Tampa), New Zealand has gone to extraordinary lengths to put families back together and give them a future.  Aside from the 131 asylum seekers New Zealand almost instantly accepted from the Tampa in 2001, it has quietly taken about 270 asylum seekers from Australia's offshore processing centres at Nauru and Manus Island.  They are being reunited with more than 360 immediate family members after New Zealand missions to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Reuniting refugee families represents one of the most ambitious, delicate, challenging and complex family reunion projects ever undertaken by New Zealand immigration. -----  Regarding Nauru detention: For Bushra and others interviewed by the Herald, Nauru became the jail for broken spirits. The stifling heat and lack of fresh water, combined with the numbing uncertainty and the regular disappointment of rejection, aged their bodies prematurely and twisted their minds.  ""It was a horrible situation,"" says Sajjad Sarwari, who has been reunited with his brother Ali's family in Hamilton, south of Auckland. ""We should not call Nauru a detention centre or a camp. It is a hellhole. I am really sorry for those who are still there, worried about them."" ------ Latifa Ali, reunited with her husband, Jawed, in Hamilton  (UberKiwi note: Hamilton is not bad - bloody hot and humid, but better than  Wellington. Apolgies now to my family members who live in Hamilton and  Wellington) , says the worst moments for young mothers were having to wait for a bucket of salt water to wash their babies, and being rejected for asylum - not once but twice - despite the fact that their husbands' claims had already been accepted.  Although, the Government insists the women were assessed and rejected as refugees according to the UNHCR's refugee test, the UNHCR has consistently argued that spouses and minor children of recognised refugees should be given refugee status. ------- Each of the families expresses gratitude to New Zealand and Susan Harris Rimmer, the UNHCR official who put their case to the NZ Government. Bushra reveals that she has conceived since being reunited. The baby is due in six months and, if it is a girl, they will call it Susan. --------- Ahmed says he would like to return to Australia to visit friends and thank those who employed and helped him during his three years in Brisbane, but not while the Howard Government is in power.  Though the couple will be entitled to New Zealand citizenship in three years and therefore be able to settle legally in Australia, they insist their loyalty will always be to New Zealand and their future is there. ""This country has given me, my family, a new life, a good life,"" beams Bushra Al Aridhi. ""Freedom! Freedom!"" -----------"

I'm so glad that my aunt and uncle are gone;I couldn't stand having them here.  I should be more tolerant because they're my relatives, but they just constantly brush me in the wrong direction.  Tooo many times have I held my tongue in reply to something they've said that offends me or is just incorrect.    I finally got over the sorrow of the hallucinations.  Yeah, I probably will cry some more over the last, but at least I know that they are still happy, maybe even happier.   I had a dream last night that I still can't decide whether it was good or just creepy/sad.  In it, Malice Mizer got back together(good side)!! But everyone had fallen into strange habits and turned out as weirdos(bad side), and not the normal awesome weirdos, but creepy old men weirdos. Except for Klaha, but he got reeeeeeaally thin and CD sales were down.  Mana shaved half his head, didn't wear makeup, and had a really bad tan.  Yu~ki just got really chubby, but he still wore his top hats and capes.  And Kozi got HUGE Manson lips and wore a blonde wig. After I woke up once and fell asleep again they were back to normal(good side)!!! They were having a show a little bit down the road from where I lived(good side), but it was raining and stupid people who don't know who they are came(bad side) and I forgot a camera(bad side).  It turns out that I became their faku-chan(I'm still deciding whether this is good or bad, but they were normal then so I'm thinking maybe good...? O:) ) But I guess they liked me so much I became their good friend(great side)! Then Klaha sang a song he never released and I cried because it was so pretty, then I woke up and was seriously pissed off.  Eh, it was a good dream.  (*^-^*) But since then I've gotten into a really bad Mizer mood and I feel like I will die without them. And I'm really frightened that someday I'll find a band I like better, or I just won't like their music anymore. Yet I know that change is inevitable, and one of those things WILL happen. I'd rather die than forget Malice Mizer or find someone better.  Ah, I couldn't find anyone better because there is no one.  And there never was and there never will be."
1JBRF7K,female,13,"Whoa! I had a dream last night that started out totally awesome, turned scary as hell, then totally awesome again!!  My class got selected for the Battle Royale program!! And Kiriyama was thrown in there to make sure we were killing each other.   That made me  very  happy and I got to sit by him on the pavement!! (*^_^*)  Then Blaze And Kristina S came over and were doing this incredibly stupid/immature music thing and Kiriyama killed them to make them shut up.  So we were thrown onto this island with a big house right in front of us, but they didn't give us any weapons or food and you couldn't see anything except for maybe one person in front of you(i.e. your killer)!  Though somehow Rachel M got ahold of a knife and almost stabbed me and I stole Leagh's cuticle scissors.  Maggie and I were running around together because we agreed that we couldn't trust anyone else.  I accidently poisoned Vicky.        Then Maggie and I got separated and god knows what happened to her.  But I found myself a powerful pencil shooter! Natalie and Tara were trying to nurse a gash in Matt S's arm, but I shot him in the neck with a couple pencils, then shot them a few times, but I ran out of pencils before they were dead.  Then everyone's parents showed up, except for mine and Kiriyama's so I found an uzi in the grass and shot them all.  Except for Kiriyama."

67ABUED,male,24,"to whom it may concern  i caught the garter at the wedding friday.  I'm still a little giddy about it. well, maybe i'm giddy about that, or maybe something else. . .    under the tuscan sky  I'm generally up for seeing films based  on books even if it doesn't look like they will appeal to me. The premise of this film is an american tourist  who buys an italian villa on a whim after her divorce.   I have to say, i'd be game for something like that. It was romanticized in the movie, obviously, but what is keeping  me from buying a little place in a developing nation and gathering a little community around me. it'd be great.    ignoring the movie  i'd actually like to buy a house in columbus in the next year.  i don't know why. It just makes sense from a investment standpoint. I don't even want to settle down in the proper sense of the word. It'd just be nice. . . smart, maybe too. . .    blogging and dating  it seems as if the medium of the online journal is a revolutionary way to get to know someone.  I'll ask the questions of false intimacy later. . .   But, until now, self disclosure was a luxury only afforded to the published, the famous, rock musicians, politicians,  and other entertainment figures. Now, it seems, life can be lived and disclosed for the starving eyes of an onlooking populous of detached individuals by anyone with an internet connection. This makes the process of ""getting to know someone""  tremendously easier."
67ABUED,male,24,"Horribly introspective this morning. Sometimes I wonder why God lets  my deceitful bones remain on this earth. Those same times i wish He would bring judgment on my wicked heart, at least so i have the chance of living a life of righteousness.   The shame i feel doesn't come from doing bad things. It comes from being exposed for those things and thus revealing to everyone what impurity remains in me despite my hardest attempt to manage that perception.  Sometimes i play dumb and wonder why i am ""being overlooked"" for various leadership rolls or whathaveyou. But let's get down to brass tax. I wouldn't  want me as a leader. I'm still way too flaky. Which is funny, because it would seem like i'm at one of the most stable points in my life.   It's like as soon as you get comfortable with something, God kicks out one of the supports that really shouldn't be supporting you in the first place."
67ABUED,male,24,"music details out of the way first.   downloaded christopher o'reily's album true love waits from the iTunes music store. All classical piano covers of your favorite radiohead tunes.    beer?  hops are definitely a strong component of sierra nevada's celebration ale. thus making my juvenile pallet regret the purchase of a whole 6 pack. someone  trade me for a stout?    depression and admission  tonight i made myself go to my small group. I woke up at 3pm after going to bed at 4am. i felt very depressed for no reason and sometimes being around any group of people multiplies the depression.  my heavy eyes tell a story that i am tired, that i feel too weird for everyone. for some reason my struggle with rejection has reared it's ugly head of late again.   I was in one of those positions personally where i find myself for the  moment, immovably emotionally tortured for no apparent reason. sometimes it lasts minutes, sometimes an hour. I feel very far from accepting the love that God has for me.   I have really simple answers to these woes.  1. i've been listening increasingly to secular music.  2. i have not been reading much of the bible.  and with that, i slide down the spiral of insecurity, selfishness, etc. etc.   it's frustrating.  there are a million things i could complain about right now. how everyone i know is smarter and more stable than me, how i am  consistently the weakest point in all of my relationships with others.   i really, really want to grow up.  someone help.  jesus?"
67ABUED,male,24,Amy Joy Eversole Fox =  A SEVERELY FOXY MOJO
67ABUED,male,24,"the year of the monkey, AGAIN!  if i'm not mistaken, the year of my birth was also the year of the monkey.   heres a gratifying update on the weekend: Amy Joy got here friday at about 6pm fighting through the snow. we went to estrada on king.   they had a little candle lit for us at the table and everything. it was very nice. after a relaxing dinner, we ventured out into the snow for aaron maccaughy's sheldon marsh show at barrister hall.   Got to see, chris and chelsea there (even though amy was staying with them, it was nice to run into them) as well as david andre and his girlfriend, aarons sister bekah maccaughy.   after the show it was back to chris and chelsea's for some chatting, (see chelsea's fotopage) and  the big lebowski .  2 white roses in amy's guest room awakened her into saturday with assurance of purity and commitment.    fade to black ,  open on wide shot of north market with  a clear view of braddok's dinner sign in frame   breakfast with chris and chelsea saturday morning at braddoks, the food was positively amazing.  Emmerson was with the elder kay's giving them an evening and morning of rest that was much deserved.    stop the film please   blah blah blah. . . i'm a tad too emotional to start recounting events, plus i'll use erik's excuse from last week. It's 2:00am. But it's always 2 am here.  it's never NOT 2 am. I'm not afraid to stream my  consciousness, but it's a kernel dump, i've tried before. maybe i'll save it for the end  today was was a nice reminder of how easily  discouraged I can be. yesterday (sunday) amy and i spent the afternoon and evening with mike, sue and justin.   No only was the time full of theological banter from which i identify with  urlLink justin's  ache's, but it was time dripping with wise anecdotal  stories of life's joys and pitfalls.   Rarely do stories move me, yet i was in tears at the simple narrative of Jesus' redemption of their lives.   i think the bottom line is that i love affirmation and can take it in with an open heart. But, that same open heart is young in learning how to strain out good from bad.   I want to love wisdom, I do love wisdom. But I'm not always sure what wisdom is. I'm pretty sure it's not ALWAYS anything, but it seems it's usually difficult  at the outset, balanced, selfless, God-centered, patient, practical, cloaked and morphable, yet timeless and sturdy, just out of reach  Matt Hoffman is such a good guy.   we were talking a lot tonight about how to better honor our women by understanding our rolls as brother and protector of purity.  let's just say i have about zero respect for Amy's last boyfriend. i fear if i ever have a run in with him i will be unable to show the grace and compassion of Jesus to him.   I can't imagine someone who has never met  me disliking me as i dislike this man. My contempt for his character is alone enough motivation for me to treat Amy  with ABSOLUTE respect and purity. All that asside, I think I really am starting to fall in love with this woman.   we've taken up the practice of verbally blessing eachother with our words. committing to protect her purity and looking  her in the eye as i do so at least once a sitting has profound consequences on my conscience as i am tempted to push boundaries.    cheese has never gone with chicken, just like bone thugs and harmony should have never covered a phil collins song.  ""we're all out of collins mix"" i wonder if i threw away those mixers jake gave me 3 years ago that never worked.   is phil collins really a superstar? i always thought stardom was star-em meaning it was how the stars got started. it worked until i was like 15 in my mind.  i also though miscellaneous was the tacky fashion of some ambiguously committed star name Miss Elanious. That worked in my mind until i was about 9.  my computer almost broke today.  it was trippy. i think i was passed some bad ram. or maybe i just had ""mouse trails"" turned on.  if there was such a thing on the mac.   and 2 coversations today about why mac's dont have a right mouse button. i will stay up until i dont work anymore. maybe i should just stay up all night.   that would be great!  great like a tiger.   its already 3:41am as the cars say ""I LIKE THE NIGHT LIFE BABY""  64 king is the bomb place to hang out."

P46ULXV,male,23,"A manilla envelope or my fate.  Here I was standing (not sitting because I was too nervous) about to open up that plain looking envelope with David Hoffman typed in the center.  Was I about to receive an offer that most likely I would accept or was I about to receive a letter that would end up being the complete opposite?  Turns out it was the latter.  The letter basically said while they were pleased to meet me and have the opportunity to learn more about me, at the time they did not see a match with my experience and their opporutnities.  Funny thing about it, I was OK with it.  I wanted this job and if they called me saying that I received the wrong letter I would still be interested in the position.  Still overlooking Michigan from the Hyatt I was OK with it.    Is there fate?  I don't  know.  I'm someone who really likes to think that we are here on Earth and control our own destiny.  Still there I was really wondering if there is another plan for me, a better more suited plan.  I've had nothing but amazing experiences these last four plus years at college.  Maybe there was more than my own doing in respect to these experiences.    What I'm going to remember most from Michigan is not the facilities I saw, the case I did(which I really did love my answer), or the crash dummy tests I witnessed.  What I enjoyed were meeting a lot of different candidates throughout the US.  Utah, Arizona, Penn, New Jersey, Boston, NY, LA, and the list goes on.  Almost everyone I met also was a genuine person.  I was talking to students in their late 20's wrapping up their MBA to a student a Northwestern at the top of his game.  No one was really full of themself.  A simple descriptive word in everyone's college dictionary, they were cool.  Last night I sat at the loser's table, but as corny as it sounds felt like a winner.  Here was a group of 5 of us sipping on our expensive hotel drinks just getting to know one another.  As the night continued students retired to their hotel room or had to hit the road for the drive home and probably a longer one now.  We said our goodbyes, wished each other luck, and smiled.  As I shared an elevator with a Boston girl, we held the elevator door open long enough to say goodbye.  She said isn't this weird how we get to know one another and leave.  I said it's interesting, but makes life fun.  Really it does.  Here were these people that I only got to know for a couple hours, but have left a footprint in my memories.  Maybe like the tides of the ocean on the beach they will fade away, but it happened and I enjoyed it.  I hope I'll remember them, and if that Indiana girl drops her engagement and our paths cross again well that could be a completely different story.  As our hotel shuttle van drove to the Detroit aiport, REM's ""Everybody Hurts"" was playing softly through the speakers.  Everybody does hurt sometimes.  We would never know and appreciate happiness without the bad and dissappointing times.  Other opporunities are awaiting and I can already see the light underneath the next door waiting to be opened."
P46ULXV,male,23,"""Something inside me is breaking Something inside says theres somewhere better than this""~Five for Fighting  The alarm clock.  I'd like to think who ever made this contraption had a horrible life and wanted others to experience the dread he went through every morning.  However, there it was with zeros a blaze in red like the devil's own eyes singing a tortuous song out the top of its head.  A song that is eerie, haunting and yet familiar at the same time.  Putting on my suit I can't help but wonder who is that kid staring at me.  Who is that shaggy blonde hair, green eyed boy, with a couple days facial stubble?  He's wearing a suit much like mine and a tie I too remember seeing in my closet.  It just doesn't look right.  Outside it is dark and quiet.  Lonely.  Motor city at this hour is still a sleeping industrial giant.  Its gears and pistons will wake up later, for now I am the one moving.  My car is covered with a layer of ice, much like the grime that builds on my eyes overnight.  With a little scraping it'll be removed.   It too, like eyes will take awhile to fully shed the extra weight.   The road is a combination of expansion joints and potholes with a bit of concrete in-between.  A back massage at this hour would be great, but one not this rough.   We live in a world as ants.  We are marching our little feet not really paying attention to what's around but only ahead.  The company checkbook is our queen.   If we don't sustain our queen we die.  We are greedy and follow what we believe is the road paved with gold.  We drive with our eyes gazed ahead with our worries riding shotgun and our dreams taking a back seat.    The backseat.  Where as kids we would sit looking out gazing at the exciting surroundings.  Now those same stores and buildings are nothing more than concrete and steel created for one use.  To put clones like myself in them, with a cup of coffee in one hand and a report in the other.  We strive to become successful all the while forgetting what defines someone as successful.  Glancing in the rearview mirror I catch the reflection of my own eyes.  There's still a bit of glimmer in them and still a bit of mischief.  It's not will power, it's just a slight turning of the wheel to the right.  In white painted font on a bright green rectangular background, the sign glows like a beacon.  Exit."
P46ULXV,male,23,"So they just made an annoucnement that the library is closing at 1pm.  The reason.  Because today is the official opening day.  Makes me wonder why today is, since its been open from the time I got here.  Why close it?  The library is meant for the students.  Yesterday I went to the renovated grocery store.  Good ol C1000.  While it looks nicer, it isn't that much better.  So this lady pointed in my basket at the Frosted Flakes.  I had no idea what she was saying.  So in English I said, ""Yeah Frosted flakes are good.""  She just kind of stared at me.    Its one thing I've come to realize will be different coming back home.  Everywhere around me is another language being spoken.  It will be weird to be sitting next to strangers and know what they are saying."
P46ULXV,male,23,"I can say it's been an eventful last few days.  Friday there was not a thing to do, so my boss told me to ahead and go for the day.  Since I'm alone I really didn't have any plans so went over to Grand Central and ate and read over there.  I bought a newspaper called the ""The Big News""  It's put on by homeless trying to improve their  lives.  A guy came down and sat next to me and told me about it, so I kind fealt like I should go ahead and buy it from him.  I decided to go check out a few art museums.  The first one PS1, is the Contemporary Art Institute.  All I can is there is some messed up stuff in that place.  I realize almost anything can be considered art by someone, but I just don't see how a video of a guy dressed like a devil dancing which was played on a TV in the corner of a room is art.  It's funny though.  Also the buildling was old and looked like an old school house.  The bathroom in basement had speakers playing creeping music and was only lit by orange Christmas like lights.  There was also a dummy hanging in there spinning.  There's no way I could take a dump in there without getting freaked out.  Afterwards I headed to the Museum of Modern Art. While a much nicer art museum it was 9 bucks and I didn't feel it was worth it(I'm not the greatest art fan).  However there were some nice pieces from Seurat, Picasso, Van Gough, Warhol, etc..  I then headed back to Manhattan and started on the second Harry Potter book.  Saturday I wasn't do anything really but sleeping in.  I was a reading a book when Elle called.  She has decided to break up with me.  I don't want to get into it any further, but all I will say is being all alone in NYC and depressed isn't the greatest.  I'm looking forward to getting back home.    After the call I needed to get out of the apartment.  I went to a bench to read and write.  Once again I saw an event that proved to me how rude people are here.  There was a lady probably in her early 70's and a guy in his late 50's, early 60's.  The old lady put on makeup and was looking in her compact mirror.  The guy in a sarcastic tone was like you don't need that you're already good looking and was laughing.  A guy who looked sort of trashy also started laughing as he overheard the conversation.  I wish I was larger for I would have said some things.  Still on the bench the trashy guy at one point tried to get my attention by waving his arms around, conductor like.  I took of my headphones and said, what?  He started laughing, so I put on my headphones.  Within five minutes he was at it again, but looking at me directly.  So I asked him what again.  He was like I'm hungry and there's a McDonalds do you think you can give me a bit of money.  I was like, No there is no way I'm giving you money.  He didn't look happy and neither was I.  That night I knew I needed to get out.  I went to see the new Austin Powers movie(funny, but losing it's charm) and so met up with Ty at NYU.  The dorms there are nice and have a pretty cool view too.  Here's a word of advice when ordering something at the cashier just don't point to it and say that looks good.  I tried that at Ben and Jerrys and the guy looked at me as if I should know what it was.    Sunday I didn't feel like doing anything.  I knew I needed to keep my mind busy and did some laundry and continued reading Harry Potter.  I'm almost done so that's exciting.    It is starting to get real hot again with high today and tomorrow around 96.  I am looking forward to getting back to Texas and hope these next two weeks or so fly by.  It isn't looking like that will be the case as it's only 12:15 and seems I've been here longer.  There is some drama at work as the client has now requested it'll take over production of the creative.  This means someone will probably lose their job and it also shows the that they might try and not use the agency all together, slowly killing it.  The people I work around the most are quite depressed as so am I."
P46ULXV,male,23,"Start with the bad end with the good.  European Community Law.  I don't like it.  It might be so much the material, no that is exactly what it is.  I am so lost in that class its ridicolous.  Refer to Article such in such, which then you will have to look up another article, but section three of that article.  Endless numbers.  Then we have to read these cases and because they are in such legal terms I have no clue what is going on.  I feel as smart as a chicken.  The professor doesn't help much either.  I can not understand him because of his accent.  Dutch, Spanish, French.  I don't know, but Im pretty sure its annoyning.  Yep thats it.  Annoyning.  Since I can't understand him anyways I dont care that he talks a mile a minute.  Im so confused that even if he slowed down I would still be lost.  I have so many issues with this school and Im looking forward to sitting down with the advisor back home and discussing them with her.  I am taking the same classes as Europeans and even other Americans who are 27 years old and getting their MBAs.  Hmmmmm does that seem fair.  I'd have to say no.  I am getting undergraduate course credit for a graduate level class.  Thats bull shit.   Plus my grades transfer on some messed up scale, that is if I pass the classes which honestly wouldn't surprise me if I didn't.  Easily over half of the exchange students I've met have dropped or failed a course.  I already dropped one, maybe I should fail just for kicks.  Except I can't allow myself do that and have been in the library basically everyday this block.  Good news or I should say random.  Talking to a German student in my class  he mentioned how in highschool he was an exchange student for a year.  I asked him where.  He said Montana, and I was like oh thats where I group up.  Told him Billings, he said thats where he went.  We ended up going to good ol West High together.  He was a senior there, my sophomore year.  However we realized we had some of the same professors knew some of the same people.  Biggest kicker was he was on the tennis team.  While I didn't travel with varsity, I was at practice everyday and so was he.  That is truly a small world."
P46ULXV,male,23,"Saturday in NYC was just an awesome time.  We left around 11:30 ish and got in around 10:30 tonight.  We walked again so much.  We got into Grand Central and took the subway to Greenich Village.  It was funny cause I could not get the vending machine to work at all.  I'm an idiot.     So we got into Greenich walked up Bleeker street and some others.  We got into some streets of the Chelsea neighborhoods.  On our way back to Greenich we went past this corner and noticed a ton of cameras and studio chairs sort of thing.  Sure enough they were filming a music video.  Angie Martinez was the lady.  She was rapping, but the song sounded like she was a chipmunk or something.  I have no clue who she was but talkin to a girl in the dorms she got all excited (must be an east coast thing).  So if the video ever gets big and makes TRL, I can say I was there.  We walked some more through Greenich and then went to Washington park which I just went to the other day.  They have guys that set up chess boards and you can play them.  Not today, but sometime this summer it's going to be on.    So Adam and I take a break eat our lunch and are sitting on the bench.  Where do you get marijuana?  I guess sitting on a bench in Washington Park.  Within 20 minutes we were asked by three different people.  The first time the guy was like you smoke...thinking he wanted to bum a cigarette, but he had one lit in his hand.  He then walked away and came back and tried to sell some to the people next to us.  He asked us again, and was like so you tellin me you aint like that, getting high.  I was just smiling and was like nope.  We also saw this guy who was just blatant to ladies.  Saying whatever crossed his mind.  Then I don't know why, but for me this was one of the funniest things.  An old couple, who I don't think could walk any slower.  It was like watching someone in slow motion.  I know sounds horrible, but if you were there you'd understand.  Also at this park was some big festival.  Hashmir Krishma.  Those crazy white boys you see with shaved heads.  They were goin dancing, singing and all. Singing about the Dalai Lama and stuff along those lines and why we as humans shouldn't eat meat, etc.  The place was just packed, booths and tents galore.    We then decided to go down into SoHo.  Damn its a lil trendy place.   Greenwich and SoHo, I could definitley see myself living at.  After that we saw a lil Canal street (Chinatown) and Little Italy.  We got on a train and headed down to Wall Street.  We first stopped and saw the Brooklyn Bridge.  Then checked out NY stock exchnage and ground zero.  It was the most quiet place I've seen in the city.  But that was due to the fact that it's the weekend and no one was at work.  We then walked down to Battery Park, walked around that for awhile.  Saw the Statue of Liberty and decided to start heading back.  Ate some pizza on the way to Grand Central and then got on the train and headed back to good ol Dobbs."
P46ULXV,male,23,"The coolest NYC experience.  So who might you see in Maxim, Rolling Stones, etc.  ME.  Today was the photo shoot I had been invited to.  While I didn't think they would choose me they ended up doing so.  It was so crazy.  I was at this badass studio in SoHo.  The campaign is for the satellite radio company Sirrius.  Anyways the ads will show face shots of people dressed like the music they listen to.  A good example is a guy wearing western wear to show he listens to country.  What they had me wear was punk stuff.  So I met with the stylist and tried on a few things.  I ended up wearing a small black tank top, dog collar kind of neckace, some crazy bracelet and a lip ring.  They then sent me to a hair stylist who made my hair crazier than it usually is..  I've gotten some looks since.  It'll take forever to shower it all out tonight.   Anyways the took a couple rolls of film and I was done.  I just thought it was such an amazing experince.  It was what I always thought it would look like.  Way too many people than needed, tables full of good food and people drinking all these healty drinks.  It was fun just to talk to the models in the back.  One was from europe and she was just funny.  It was also funny because the photographer and the client representative just thought I looked funny as punk.  They were like you are just too nice of a southern kid.  I had to agree.  So Monday or Tuesday I find out if I made the cut and will appear in the magazines.  I hope so, but I'm not counting on it.  Even so I can't emphasize how much fun it is and they memory I have from it.  I also hung out with a coworker that day who I never really had the chance to.  She and I just had the greatest time making fun of each other and even getting lost finding the place.  It's too bad I'm just meeting her now or it would have been fun to hang or chit chat with her.  Afterwards I headed to Grand Central and read and ate dinner.  I decided to see if the internet cafe in Times Square was open and in fact it was.  Which brings us to now."
P46ULXV,male,23,"The lights go dim....  As the curtain is pulled back the crowd talking becomes but only a slight murmur.  This movie does not have the now ever present commercials, nor the 10 previews.  Instead of a title and the names of famous actors the scene begins with but a boy.  A boy fresh out of college with the world ahead of him who is sitting on the hood of his car laptop in hand pounding on the keys.  Wearing his suit he is sitting on a favorite old sweatshirt to avoid getting his pants dirty.   In front of him laid out like an empty canvas waiting for the colors from my palette to be chosen is the great unknown.  To this green-eyed boy what takes precedence and is more amazing at this moment is the visual spectacle and the vastness of Lake Michigan.  One finds it hard to believe to be a lake when you can't see another shore in sight.  Watching the sunset it conjures up memories of a California trip where I saw the same sun cool off in the Pacific.  The sound of water lapping and the cawing of birds awaken the senses.  A narrator begins to speak in an old gruff voice, but one in which you know has stories to be told and words of wisdom to be shared.  The narrator's voice is my own some 60 years into the future  ""I was 23 at that time.  I was young and foolish.  Life held many uncertainties and it was wonderful.""  It would be a coming of age movie, one destined to be a classic.  The movie would continue from this point.  This very point where I sit now looking out into vast unknown alone thinking to myself and talking to God.  This movie goes on to show the triumphs and failures of this one person's life.  My life.  It would show moments of falling in love, moments that when you go through you can't believe they are real.  Moments you wish you could store in a box and keep on your bedside stand.  There would also be moments of loss.  Moments that grip our heart with a clenched fist and only being able to truly recover when someone else at some point in time comes into our life when we least expect it.  The grasp releases its hold and again we our able to catch our breath and move on.  There would be moments when everything in his life would seem perfect and that he would pinch himself for not believing in how very real it was.  There would be more moments like the ones he is going through now.  Wanting to sleep.  Not because of how it helps the body recover from a hard days work, nor because the weight of his eyelids grow heavy as the day progresses.  It would be those short hours.  Whether it was 4 or a lucky 8 where he gets to escape reality.  Everything that isn't going right in my world ends at that time.  I myself am unsure of how this movie will end.  Whether it somehow transforms into an action movie with a life ending car chase or one that is merely a comedy tracking my most embarrassing moments.  This isn't a plot that can be written for what the future may hold. Yet is rather like one of those childhood choose your own adventure stories with many different possibilities waiting at the end of each page.  Which direction will our leading actor take is up to him.  That's life and there in lies the meaning.  It's worth living.  To the fullest.  In the meantime, it is time to fold down the laptop and take this all in.  The sun has only minutes before it will give way to a starlit sky."

YAONX08,female,17,"Can't he tell she doesn't want to talk to him? Doesn't want to have anything to do with him? He's called three times, and she hasn't called back. Guys really don't get it.   I just can't possibly forgive him for what he did to her.   Oh well.  I give up. High school relationships truly suck. The only relationship I believe in, and probably will ever believe in during high school is John and Joannes."
YAONX08,female,17,"Hmmm, so, I was supposed to go to Joanne's, but she couldn't since she's got to do a lot of work on her mom's closet still. That's ok with me actually. I'm not feeling great anyway. It's just one of those, ""blah"" days. I think I'll probably go make myself some grilled cheese, and just, read my book or watch tv. YaY! Mmmm.....grilled cheese. I'm so addicted to that stuff. I really am. I think I need to get on a better sleeping schedule, but even if I do, I'll go off it again in MI. So, I guess there really isn't much of a point, because I refuse to go to bed at 9 every night when I go. Tra la la. I'm in a weird mood. Quite a weird mood. Hmmm, I just flung my pony tail thing across the room...Wow, I'm so weird. There's nothing really to type about. I still havem't decided, although I did find something out that could be helpful. Eh, I think I should just forget everything and wait til college. YaY college. Maybe there will be mature guys there. I hope....Joanne's lucky, but it's funny. I don't know how they are going to be apart a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him and it's only a week that he's gone now.I have faith in them though. I think they're going to be one of those high school couples that makes it, and actually stays together. They're like, made for each other. I'm really happy for both of them. :) Anyway, I think I'm going to go make my grilled cheese now, and read or something. Hmmm, I never sign this thing anymore. Oh well."
YAONX08,female,17,"I am finished Christmas shopping. Like...completely done. I got stuff for my mom, dad, brother and Maureen even! :) I'm quite happy with myself. Usually I'm not done until like..the day before Christmas. Boo ya grandma. Haha, Mary Clare says that all the time. It seemed to fit in this context.   I think I'm going to go to sleep now since I have to be up early tomorrow for church, then to go play at Justin's church. Hopefully it'll be fun and hopefully I don't catastrophically mess up. YaY sleep!"
YAONX08,female,17,"I got so many compliments on my hair! It was awesome, I got it cut, and layered last night, and I really really like it! It's shorter, but it's still really great! Right now I'm looking for new furniture for my room. I'm completely re-doing it, except for the floor. I like having a wood floor. Easier to clean if you spill something...which is inevitable with me. So, anyway. jusat waiting for dinner to be done, then all I have to do is study for my Science test. Arg...stupid science. Oh well, we have later arrival tomorrow! YES! I was hoping, and hoping, but I was upset because I wanted a late arrival day, and didn't think we had one, and then Bryan (with a y) was like, ""yeah, norkus you idiot!"" Ouch...oh well, how can one be sad when there's late arrival!?!?! Except, finals are next week, and I'm not ready at all. I should maybe actually study this time, considering I have not studied for finals yet since High School started....surprisingly though...I've done well. I don't get it. If I could just learn not to avoid homework, I'd be doing well. For most kids, it's the tests that make the problem, for me, it's the homework. Yay! Dinner...I'll write more later!.."
YAONX08,female,17,"Today was a good day for the most part. I got called down to the dean but other than that, it was pretty good. It kind of went by slowly. Then marching wasn't too bad and hmmm, then I went to Chris' tonight. That was fun. Nikki brought the homecoming thing over and she stayed for like, an hour. It was nice. We reminisced haha.   I can't wait to see my first James Bond movie tomorrow! :) I'm quite excited. I'm not sure who's going now or what...but we shall see, we shall see.   Anyway, I am EXHAUSTED. Good night."
YAONX08,female,17,"I did end up going out tonight. YaY! =) I went bowling with Kelly and Mary Clare. Fun times. Oh my gosh. Kelly is the funniest bowler I have ever bowled with. It's just absolutely hilarious. She bowled ten gutter balls in a row...probably because she was laughing too hard haha, but on one, she swung back and the ball fell and rolled back and....wow, funniest thing I've possibly ever seen. I seriously almost peed my pants.   Wow. Too much was happening there for a while. There were so many people IM'ing me at once with problems and...ahhhh. It was insane. I'm really glad people can come to me but...wow. Things...I think...well..I hope will be ok with Pat. I feel really awful, but I think he understands.   Ah, I think I need to go sleep now. Tomorrow's my last real free day of break. I can do something tomorrow night and that's...it. Then it's all gone. :( Sadness.   OK, I started writing this like...four hours ago. Grrrr. This ALWAYS happens. Oh well. It's all good. I can go to sleep in good conscience now. I talked with Pat and thingss are ok so that makes me happy. :)   Ah, my arm hurts though...and I'm so warm. I think I may have a fever actually...not cool. Heh, literally.   This definitely started as a post for Friday, not Saturday."
YAONX08,female,17,"Well, I just got home. I went to the Last Fling. I could have gone with Jim and them, but they were going to the concert, and I didn't really want to go to the concert. The Fling was ok. It was crazy, because there were like...ten of us. Kathryn, Nikki, MC, and like...6 other people from Benet. It was cool. It's nice to hang out wth new people once in a while.   I'm thinking of going to sleep soon. I'm pretty tired, but...eh. I think I might just because there are 12 people, 6 dogs, and a cat in my house right now. It's crazy, and I don't really feel like socializing with adults right now, so...yeah. Maybe I'll go read. That could be nice. It's amazing how much less I read when I'm in school. I guess I just don't have time. Maybe when marching season is over I will.   Haha, everyone's already talking about homecoming and it's not until October. Gosh. So, for the next two months the little self-esteem I've gained since the last dance I didn't go to, I'll slowly lose. I don't think I really want to go alone this year, so...eh. I'llprobably end up just staying home. We shall see, we shall see.   Maybe I'll go socialize and get food. I mean, I figure I get something out of it, and they'll think I'm nice if I go down there, right?   It's either that or I sit here writing pointless things. Writing pointless things can be fun though.............  Fine, I'll go downstairs.   Wow, I just had a conversation with myself basically in my own journal. How strange am I?"
YAONX08,female,17,"They're home!!!!!! :) I'm so happy. I went out with Chris and Jim today. I wasn't feeling too well, but I really wanted to talk to Chris and see how the trip went and stuff. I haven't really gotten the chance to talk to Kelly much yet, but I will. Wow, I'm really happy they're home. :) Note to self: get the book God's Debris."
YAONX08,female,17,"Today was a pretty ordinay day by all accounts. School, marching, eating, homework, sleep. That's all my day's going to end up being. Sad, haha.I'm just trying  to not think about that jazz audition at all. I don't even want to see what spot I got in jazz band. I assume I made jazz band at least because not enough trumpets tried out. It's kind of weird actually. There will be like no trumpets for Jazz Lab because so few tried out. It's usually that we have way too many but eh. I'm thinking I got 3rd in jazz band maybe. They wouldn't put me on second again because I can't solo nor do I want to and Nathan's probably going to be on first. I mean, he probably should be in JSO, but they're going to want him to play lead for jazz band.   Blah blah blah. I need to pick up stuff in my room and I really don't want to. I'm so lazy. I don't want to do my math homework either. I just want to sleep. sleep sleep sleep.   And stalker boy is still stalking and it's getting worse. It's really aggravating. I mean, he's a nice kid and all but really, GIVE IT A REST! Pleaseeee!!!!! It's been three years, aren't you bored?? I don't get it either, why me? It's not like I'm pretty, smart, talented, etc. Oh well, I give up. Farewell kiddies."

D5TLG33,male,36,"It looks like the power outage that I had at work gave my DSL connection a new ip address and my dynamic DNS updating didn't work. Bottom line? The UT2k4 server is not accessible. It's not down for good though. You can expect it to be online tomorrow night.  From the logs, I can see that it is being used. Perhaps it would be good to set some kind of schedule for games. Let me know if you've got a good solution."
D5TLG33,male,36,"Friday night on DocSparky.gotdns.org was pretty intense. The server managed to hold 4 and I suspect it will do 5 or 6 as well. That's a good thing since we are planning on building those numbers. One thing I noted is that the voice comm worked pretty well and helped a lot. Also, the team work was good as well.  There are plans for another game on Saturday at 9pm (earlier if people show up)."

D5TLG33,male,36,"Last night (and today) I programmed a little application that will watch a UT2k4 server and notify you when someone joins the server (since my machine wasn't up to the task of playing). It's a nice way to see if someone is playing without starting up the game. To install it, just unzip it into the directory of your choosing. You'll have to create the shortcut to it. If that's too much of a challenge, I can create an install.  urlLink ServerWatch.zip"
D5TLG33,male,36,"I haven't been able to play much this week (for several reasons), but I setup a CTF gametype last night for those that were able to play. It seems like everyone enjoyed the CTF matches the other night, so I'll try to run them on Tuesday and Thursday nights.  It is sometimes difficult to get everyone on the server at the same time (It seems that we all have more to do than just play games). I think it might be good to have a specific time of the weekend that we can try to be on the server. In general, I try to check at 9pm and 11pm on weekdays. If someone has a suggest weekend time, then post it and we can try to check in around that time."
D5TLG33,male,36,"Well, retail clients can still connect to a patched UT2k4 server. So if you don't want to patch, then you don't have to in order to connect to the server. The one nice thing about the patch is that the DVD (or CD) is no longer required to run the game. I didn't notice any problems last night with it the short time I played.  There was some serious lag at times though. I tracked this down to the max client net speed setting on the server. By default it is 10000 (on the other server, I had reduced it to 5000). I updated the value on the new server, so that shouldn't be a problem. Well, at least until we have more players.   urlLink Unreal Tournament 2004 Downloads"

Someone forgot to call me, and the other group of people claimed nothing was going on. Anyways, I played games. All day. That's what I do, I guess.

GGCUFSP,male,24,"BUTTERFLY EFFECT   Oh my gosh, it's already March n I hafn't done even any single bit of preparation for my projectz. Now the deadlines are drawin' now! The best bit is instead of doing research for my damned IFM (International Fcukin' Module) n R&I (Ridiculous & Idiotic), I'm actually spendin' my time writin' this blog!! This guy (Read: mi!!) really has got no sense of urgency. Dunno whether he realises one small thing he does now can trigger a hella consequences. Speakin' of which, I muz say this show (n i meant ""tHe butteRfLy eFFeCt"", duhz!) was terrific! Could easily be my favourite movie of the year!! Great plot, superb cast (Ashton Kutcher + Amy Smart). Shan't further elaborate on the story though. Can juz abstract from any movie review webby.   Been rather slacked all this while. Spent most of my valuable (or izzit?) time online, downloadin' movies, updatin' friendster, check mails, log in icq, log out icq, log in again, look (n literally lookin' only) for online job application. Haix... Really pathetic life sia. BTW, happened to come across this girl, HuiShi, when I sent Guang to the airport. Really coincidental tt I bumped into her, coz nv did expect her to become an air stewardess (but how the hell I know, coz I haf nv spoken to her). Another more interestin' thing is tt the gal who went wif her was from Saints too! N she knows mi! (Though I din know her, but got to know tt she's Janice). Anyway, found her familiar then, but din dare to approach, coz scared later I malu myself (again??). Then dunno how she managed to find mi in friendster! I was so stunned when she messaged mi. It's like, it has nv come across my mind tt I would make an effort to find sumone, esp. when I haf nv spoken to tt person b4, though we used to be in the same pri. skol.   I began to realise one thing. If I haf made the initiative to know her when I was in pri. skol, wat might haf happened. The ""mystery"" tt puzzled the both of us is tt though we did not know each other personally, we still remember each other's name! (well, sorta. Except I got HuiShi n ShiHui jumbled up. She's even worse, onli remember I'm sum ""Yi""). But still ok lahz, at least we still recognise each other. If given sum other person from her class, I might not recognise him. Mabbe I was sub-consciously ""payin' more attention"" to her in pri. skol bahz. ttz the expaination I found so far. kekeke!  Okay, now to the point. This event set me ponderin'. If I haf the ability to travel back in time (juz like Ashton in the movie), wat aspect of life would I change? A. Get to know HuiShi? (which is pretty dumb coz of the vomit blood after-effect thingy); B. Do sth abt. my 'O'/'A' Levels? (then I can become a scholar, which I sacastically doubt); C. Hold back all the hurtful abuses tt I inflicted on a few individuals? (n I know there's quite a handful of them); D. Remain as it is? (it's onli a fictitious scenerio anyway... yah, i know, i'm a loser here); or E. Sum of the above/ Others? (n this option will look beri familiar to FM students. If u get wat i mean). My instinct would tell mi C. A rationale choice would haf to be D. If I'm dumb/crazy/stupid/lame etc, I would choose A. Lolx!  Being risk-averse (n I'm referin' to the typical kiasee type), D is my final decision (sorta expected). Dun wanna change anything, at least for now. Whoever I fail to know in the past, I will get to know them along the way. Thus, no use clingin' on to sumthing (be it anyone e.g. teddy bear on the shelf of Robinson's toy department or anything else) tt u yearned for so much (not referin' to anything/ anyone in particular. Any coincidences caused is deeply regretted) but not being able to get hold of it. I'm a strong believer of fate. Whatever belongz to u will be urs eventually; the more u hold on to it, the more it will slip away. I may not be a scholar, but at least I acheived the goal I made in sec. skol --- NUS Bizad. Here I m.... n the irony is, I din realli work towards this goal. Fate.   Comin' so far, I haf to confess tt I haf hurt sum pple. I do not dare ask them for forgiveness, much less to forget abt. wat has happened. Wat I want is to know the truth... coz I realli dunno wat was it I said tt inflicted such a ""catastrophic"" impact. I dun regret hafin said those thingz. An attempt to return to the past would be fruitless, coz I won't say it only once. Juz live wif it bahz. Juz like my philosophy in life: Live as the day passes. Everybody yearns for a perfect endin', but there isn't any perfect endin', is there? u can't please everyone, so f*ck it! Sumtimes, it pays to be selfish. A pity, I'm not. I compromise on the perfection. I'm not even close. Unattainable. Untouchable. Unlikely. Unimaginable.  I dun wanna go back in time. I scared of livin' life once more. I'm resistance to changes. I'm juz a traditional, old-fashion hermit livin' in a world of my own. Moreover, I found my life here. This dimension is where I met my best pals. Dun wanna lose them for anything. We haf come a long way n I really treasure this bond.  thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'......."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"JuZ mY 2 CeNtS WoRtH   Juz sum thots which haf been lingerin' in my mind for sum time. How come we alwayz say 2 cents worth instead of 1 cent, 10 cents or 20 cents?? Beri hard to find 2 cents nowadayz u know?? Hee!!! @@ ok, tt's beside the point. Juz wonderin' y when men are faced wif setbacks in life, be it love, career or relationship, we will resort to drinkin'. Isn't it better to tink thingz thru' in a clear mind, so tt u can c thingz better?? At least for mi, I know I dun fall into tt category. Not tt I'm not a man, but 'coz I've learnt along the way. It's no use cryin' over spilled milk; it would be better to clean up the mess & get urself another bottle instead. Agree?  Seein' Mingfa & Co. in their 18's, 19's, I'm sorta envious of thir youth. When u're young, u can afford to do anytin. Even if u commit any mistake, pple will excuse u for tt. Reason: U r still young. Moreover, they dun haf the worries tt we haf (though they will haf to face it sooner or later). Career is wat's most impt to mi now; ALL OTHER THINGZ r secondary. Sumhow, when u r approachin' mid-twenties (like mi!!! omg!!!), u would be panickly over ur bread & butter. Esp for guyz, we haf alr deferred our establishment for 2 yrs, all thanx to NS. Therefore, in this game of career, we can't afford to waste anymore time. Mabbe tt's the reason y pple sign on. NS no longer becomes their liability; it becomes their buildin' step up the social ladder. On the other spectrum, though envious, I'm pretty worried abt. these teenagers. Mabbe it's the change in society which makes them more protected, but there's a limit as to when these protection shields will expire. No cerificate = No future in Singapore. True so far? Definitely do not wish to c them in Robinson's sales floor workin' as a promoter in 5 yrs' time. n there's onli so much I can do to knock sum sense into them. Obviously not much.... Keke!  Pardon mi for bein' paranoid, but I can't help hafin' this feelin' tt my social circle is shrinkin'!!! Guess most pple r juz caught up wif their own work. Everyone is runnin' their own race.   Dunno if anyone else has this experience. U suddenly get depressed over no apparent reason and u feel like breakin' down n cry ur heart out. Well, I alwayz experience this. Mabbe juz feelin' realli empty... even when God occupies a thirdths of my heart. But each & every time, I hold back my tears. 'Coz I realize there is realli nth... & no one I can cry for. This makes mi even sadder... lolX! While bein' a ""life-saver"", the person tt I wanna save most is myself.   I'm a blessed man. But blessed man has his own worries. He will question the reasons why he is so blessed. He will haf doubts over his existence. He will wonder if he's gonna be blessed in future like he was in the past.

GGCUFSP,male,24,"WHaT iS LoVe aLL aBoUt   Love can never be so beautiful without friendship, one leads to another and the process is irreversible, the best of lovers is the greatest of friends!  When you love someone, don't expect that person to love you back the same amount. One of you will be ahead, the other behind. It's either you catch up or the other waits.  Never be afraid to fall in love. It may hurt a lot, it may give you aches and pains, but if you don't follow your heart, in the end you will cry even more for not giving love a chance.  Love is not a feeling, it's a commitment. Feeling comes and goes.  Love doesn't have to have a happy ending, 'coz love doesn't have to end at all.  True love hears what is not spoken, and understands what is not explained, for love doesn't work in the mouth, nor the mind, but in the heart.  When you love, you must not expect anything in return, for if you do, you're not loving but investing. if you love, you must prepare to accept pain, for if you expect happiness, you're not loving but using.  It's better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than lose that someone you love with your useless pride.  ""How can I say goodbye to someone I never had? why do tears fall for someone who was never mine? why is that I miss someone I was never with and I ask why I love someone who's love was never mine?""  It's hard for two people to love each other when they live in two different worlds but when these two worlds collide and become one, that's what you call magic!  Don't love a person like a flower, cause a flower dies in season. Love them like a river cause a river flows forever.   ""Love may leave your heart like shattered glass, but keep in mind that there's someone who'll be willing to endure the pain of picking up the pieces so you could be whole again"""

8TJ34H6,male,24,"yah i got a shock. i met my old sec friend while on my way back home. Yes, it was a surprise for me but theres one thing that trouble me. He told me that one of our friend met an accident and had to amputat one leg due to the the serious hitting on his knee cap. My friend told me that in the first place that he intended to keep it but wasn't able to or he cannot choose to as his leg was bleeding profusely from the wound. In the end he chose to had his leg amputated.   When i heard it i was like so shock that i think i stunned and my friend was like am i ok ? i was ok but i felt a sudden sadness that came from the bottom of my heart. i asked ""Why is this happening to my friend?"" He signed on as a regular and had great future. Why did he deserves this fate? With all this happening to him, i don't know he can take it and carry on with his life.   I hope he can get well soon get better with life. i know that he will never get over it. Will one get over it? No! yes, its a straight no! no one can get over it. even i can't get over the matter myself.   What is happening? Just this month one of our mdm's mum departed and just today i recieved news from my friend that his grandpa has gone. just one month i recieve so many sad news.   人生最大的悲哀，是自己對前途沒有希望；  人生最壞的習慣，是自己對工作沒有計劃。"

Q7QT6JU,male,15,"It's the weekend now. Hilary wasn't at school today, so I still don't know how things are going. I might have to wait until monday before I talk to her again. I wish she would call me and tell me what's going on. It could very well be she's just been in a mad mood this week.   I'm thinking about calling her right now, but I'm not quite sure if I should. One part of me says that, she hasn't called because she needs some time. The other part says that if she had good news to tell me she would have told me already. I don't know what I'm going to do yet. I don't like to worry and wonder at the same time. All I've been lately is mopey. She's the most wonderful girl I've ever met. I just wish I knew how she felt.  Hilary's Guy"
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"It's late. I get weird when it's late. Like my thought process and stuff. If someone like me was talking to me right now, I'd be freaked. I wrote some poetry tonight. They were a continuation of a couple thoughts I had the other night. They're about Hilary. I'm over her, but the feeling is still there, and I guess it makes for good, sincere, writing.  Oh yea, it's snowing. What a blast. It better continue during school. yaya"
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"I walked to Audra's today to give her her Christmas present. I probably could have waited for a ride instead of walking out in the cold, but walking is better sometimes.   I'm glad things going on in Elena's life are better. She never deserves to have anything bad happen to her. She is the one of the nicest, funniest, and coolest people I have ever met. I'm so glad me and her are friends. I'd trade any Christmas present to hang out with Elane for a day cause I know we'd have a great time as always.  I've been reading  Boy's Life  lately. Hilary let me borrow a while back. It's her favorite book, and yea it is a really good book. I promised her I'd get it read by the end of the break. I'm going to go. I still hope she's actually making me something for Christmas like she said. I won't be hurt if she doesn't, but if she said she was going to then she should. I'm not going to call her or anything this break. Unless she drops by my house to give me her Christmas present then I won't talk to her until we get back to school.  I went out yesterday and bought the ""Maxeen"" debut album. Hilary told me she saw them on the Warped Tour so I downloaded some of their stuff. They sounded alright. It's always nice to have a good band that no one knows about, just as long as you don't get mad when people start to learn about them.   I'm not sure if I want to go to the recording studio during the break or not. I don't think I'm ready. I have a few more songs I'd like to get ready so I can record them to. I have Terra on piano I want to record and along with a couple guitar songs I wrote. I wish I was better singer, but I'm not so I'll make do.  I told like everybody who I like now. I'm not like one of those people that are like ""Omg if they find out things will be ruined between us."" I just think maybe things should have some time before you just go out and tell them you have a crush on them. She'll find out anyway, cause I know her friends will tell her. So Erin, if you're reading this..."
Q7QT6JU,male,15,Taryn's not having my babies anymore
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"Well I got them. I couldn't find blue ones, but I got black like everyone else. They're good though. I was amazed at how much better I could see. The people at LensCrafters thought I was weird, cuz I was all ""oooh ahhh.""  I got an eye exam too before hand. I started laughing when I took it though. It reminded me of this stand-up comedian that did a bit on seeing the optomotrist. I was in the room before the doctor came in and I was like, ""Oh crap, I forgot to freshen my breath."" Luckily I found some mints on the counter so I took some. I was glad she didn't notice and was like, ""Hey, my mints are gone."" I probably would have laughed and spit them in her face on accident, so that was good.  It was a pretty stressful day all and all. I have all the makeup work to do now. I always miss school on important days. I was late for my piano lesson today too. I told Erin she could come today if she wanted to. Luckily she didn't, because I didn't want her to be waiting for me.  Well I'm off, make up work awaits. Birthday in...pshh...like 8 days from tomorrow? Alright."
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"I got rid of instant messenger, and I'm not making an effort to answer the phone anymore. I'm also getting rid of the ""comments"" option on this blog stuff. You probably won't be reading this anyway since you won't see the link in my now nonexistent profile. I know I said I'd talk to you if you wanted to talk, but hey I will, just hope someone else answers the phone, because I'm sick of running and diving for it.  You know what's fun? Riding the bus and reading a book with the windows down and the wind messing up your hair, and that's something I don't have to rely on anyone else for.  So all and all, I guess my brief moment of glee was, as I had been pondering, just temporary.  During last night, I thought to myself that maybe this is just now settling in. Crying spells and lack of sleep is just what I was missing. I guess that completes the emptiness right?  Here's a nice song I wrote for Elena during the past few days. It's probably one of the last happy things you'll see come out of me for a while I'm predicting.    righty   the grass was wet that night we found out as we layed on the ground stars were shining bright I could hardly make them out without the glasses I lost but I didn't need them  cause I could feel you and I could hear you breathing  when it was time to go we both knew that we didn't want to let this go you held me close at my door we said goodnight I knew sleep was coming easy  *I'll never forget that summer pretending like I was wasn't leaving you well I'm never leaving you and you never left*  we stood in the long line for your least favorite ride you begged me not to rock the cart for fear it'd fall apart at the top we were staring down at the crowd  and you told me how afraid you feel i was the only one you'd let take you on the ferris wheel  at the water's edge we talked about our lives so many things killing us from inside we said if nothing else we'll survive and we're gonna make it in this world  *and I'll never forget that summer pretending like I wasn't leaving you well I'm never leaving you and you never left  I'll never forget that summer pretending like I wasn't leaving you well I'm never leaving you and you never left me*         .maybe I am leaving."
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"Steven and Corey did end up calling me. It was already like six though, and I didn't want to just go there and have to come home in like two hours so I didn't go over there with them. I have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow, but I'll catch up with them two on Friday most likely.  I just got off the phone with Brittany. I haven't talked to her in awhile. She's still cool. It cracks me up how she says her boyfriend gets really mad when she talks about me, haha. That's hillarious, who would be envious of me? :P"
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"So, I heard some things I guess Hilary said about me today. If they're true or not, we'll find out later. I'm leaning towards truth, because this is the second time I've heard the same things from someone else. I'm pretty well angry about it. It's stupid how she's still going on about all this shit on, ""Oh our relationship was stupid"" and ""I never liked him to being with."" Well good for you if that's how you feel. Thanks for lying to me over and over again. Thanks for lying to cover up more lies. Thanks for totally leading me on, and thanks for being a dishonest waste of time. I had feelings for you, real feelings for you. I guess you don't know what that means. I thought I was a nice guy, but that's only up to a point. Just because I'm nice, doesn't mean I'll take in everything forever with a smile. You crossed the line. No one has done that for a long time. I tried to be everything for you, but you didn't even give me a thanks. All you gave me was a slap in the face.  I hope you get my email, and I hope you can find someone good enough for you so you can be satisfied. After all, you deserve it.                    Chris"
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"I'm not working Friday, sweet. Napoleon Dynamite."
Q7QT6JU,male,15,"The mission/scheme is completed!...for the most part anyway. There's still a few more little ""objectives"" to accomplish. But nothing can go wrong now! yay!  I totally messed something up today, though. I was like, ""Okay Chris, make sure you don't screw this part up,"" and then an hour later I looked back at it, and sure enough! I screwed that dang part up. Geezus. Oh well.  I hung out with my grandma today. She took me out to the boonies in West Salem to check out her grandpa's farm. She finally found the way, but by the time it was too late to go check it out. Sorry Grandma, another time though.  I got a bunch of homework to do tonight. Better start crackin."
MIHIGC4,male,23,"Physics starts tomorrow.  I'm not thrilled, particularly because it's 2:42 am and class is in 6 hours.  But I can't sleep!  It's always like this for me right before I begin a new round of classes: not exactly anxious, but just awake.  I knew that as soon as I finished my exams, I'd stop posting here as often.  Also, a friend of mine e-mailed me and said that the site was ""stupid... no, sophomoric"", so I got a bit embarrassed.  But basically, fuck him: he was just kidding, anyway.  But I took it to heart.  Plus, I thought to myself: what are most 23 year olds doing?  Are they making weblogs?  Especially weblogs about themselves?  Well, I've tried to make these blogs about ""current events"" or ""mathematics"", and I never keep them up!  So I'm just going to have to go with this for now... besides, it's fun.  For me.  Not necessarily for you.  Especially if I'm standing over your shoulder, making you read it.  I need to sit down with Rick and Marcia and discuss the fact that I'm interested in moving.  I'm sure we can work something out financially: the lease, which is not actually ""binding"" at this point but I'd like to respect it, ends in August; thus, even if I do leave within the month, there will only be two months that I need to pay.  Or whatever.  We'll see.  I looked at an apartment today in ""The Mark Yacht Club"" -- it was gorgeous!  I mean, I was totally blown away.  It's $2,000, and my friend Brad wants to pay $1,200 of that.  I'd  really  like to live alone, but this almost seems like to good to pass up.  The thing is, Brad and I have a certain professional (is that what I'm calling it now?) relationship which precludes moving in together; thus, before we'd move in together, we'd have to end that particular interaction, and that'll be a shame.  I bet you have no idea what I'm talking about.  In other news: Women want men to be princes and kill giants.  More on that coming soon."
MIHIGC4,male,23,"I knew it all along.  Apparently a Mexican air force pilot recently videotaped what are described as eleven unidentified flying objects.  I blatantly lifted these photos off a local news website  urlLink [WSVN 7 News Online] .  The article says: "" The objects appear to accelerate rapidly and change course suddenly. At least one crew member testified in a videotaped interview that the objects encircled the military jet at a distance of at least two miles "".   Speaking of fabulous piano players: if any of you have seen  Greg , please tell him to contact me.  I've always wondered what happened to him.  He would put his head down and just jam out some incredible jazz on my little Panasonic keyboard.  I met him one night while I was incredibly high.  My friend Qaid had called me and left a message, saying: ""Whatever you do, don't smoke the weed!""  I didn't get the message until 2am, and by that point I had already smoked it, so of course I freaked.  I tried calling him back but there was no answer, so I headed over to his place (he lived right across the street).  I got there, and the door was locked.  But there was another kid in the hallway, just sort of standing there, looking dazed.  Because I was so high, I figured he might know why Qaid had called: I asked him, and he said, ""I might know.""  So I started pumping him for information.  ""The birds, man... you've got to listen to the fucking birds.""  That's really what he said.  A few minutes later, security guards came over, saying they'd received reports of a suspicious prowler.  I covered for my new friend, and told them he was just visiting me.  They looked around a bit, and the whole while, this guy is telling  them  that they need to listen to the birds.  It was great.  I was entirely fucked up myself, and they told me to look after him.  They thought  he  was stoned.  It turned out that Greg was just like that: a very interesting guy.  Brilliant, and fantastic piano player, like I said.  It was always a little tricky to figure out what was going on up there in his head -- sometimes, during conversation, he would get mad at some perceived insinuation, and he wouldn't speak again for several minutes.  But damn could he play the piano."
MIHIGC4,male,23,"This weekend, Carissa and I went off on an adventure to return a movie.  You wouldn't expect this to turn into a mystery novel, would you?  Well, it did.  Not literally.  On our way to the Blockbuster in South Miami, we somehow found ourselves in Coconut Grove.  Now this, right off, did not bode well for a timely movie return: Coconut Grove can be a very dangerous place when it comes to aimless youths in cars (which is exactly what the two of us were).  We found a parking place, left the car behind, and headed out into the street.  The first mystery of the day was the mystery of the drum people.  Who were they?  Why were they unloading several dozen drums from their car?  I didn't stop to ask: the scene seemed a little too dangerous.  So we continued on our way.   The next thing we came to was the Graffiti Building.  Now this, in itself, is not so remarkable: a lot of buildings have Graffiti on them.  But this building was actually  painted  with Graffiti, and I thought the only place they did that was on the New York Subway.  Well, I don't know what the deal was, or what kind of strange deals went down in this building, but I thought it would be a good idea to take a picture, and immortalize the building on my website, where it will be seen by thousands upon thousands of curious web-tourists.   Ask yourself this: what is the man in the picture doing?  Is he smoking a cigarette?  Or is it something else?  And why are there musical notes coming out of the smoke?  Is the building a music factory?  Or perhaps it's a Graffiti store, and they're advertising their colors... or maybe it was just a random, drive by, very complex graffiting.  We may never know, because the building was quite foreboding and looked deserted.  For God's sake, are those  sperm ?  Who would go through all that trouble to paint a building with graffiti, and then desert it?  I might do something like that.  I'd probably get bored with my building and want a new one.  That's what happened to my room -- well, actually, I wasn't bored of it, but I did desert it after painting it many different colors.  There were no curious smoking men in my room, however (except for me -- I occasionally smoked in the bedroom, I admit it).  So that's it for the day's mysteries... Extraordinary."
MIHIGC4,male,23,"The other night, I was out on the balcony with my girlfriend, Carissa.  We were enjoying the scenery – the Rickenbacker Causeway which leads to Key Biscayne, and glimpses of the city shrouded in the sunset light.  My apartment is oriented in such a way that from it’s balcony, I can see the edge of downtown, but the skyscrapers in the center of the city are hidden from view.  The building across the way from me is under construction, and its balconies have a clear view of downtown.  It just so happened that on this night, several guys were working on a balcony that was almost even with mine.  They were rough looking Hispanic guys – until the explosions started wracking the evening, I’d hardly noticed them.  It was sudden: downtown was echoing with the cracking, booming sound of heavy explosives.  After a few moments, the construction workers across the way began to shout:  “Hey, the building is on fire!”  They looked at me and gestured wildly towards downtown.  “I can see explosions!”  Terrorists.  I knew it.  I started scanning the sky for stray airplanes.  I could see a huge plume of smoke pealing out of downtown, orange lights flickering inside it.  Shit.  I turned to Carissa, and said: “We’ve got to get out of this building.  Quick, put your shoes on.”  I ran into the living room.  My roommate, Brad, was in the bathroom, taking a shower.  “Brad,” I shouted.  “Get the fuck out of the shower!”  “Why?”  “Because I said so, damn it!  Get out right now!”  I wasn’t holding back: this was my moment.  I was going to direct us all to safety.  I was born for this very instant.  It all became so clear.  “What’s going on?” Brad asked.  I could hear the shower water still running.  I was infuriated – couldn’t he tell I was trying to save his life?  Didn’t he understand that by wasting precious moments forcing me to convince him that it was necessary to get out of the shower, he was putting all our lives in jeopardy?  “Get the fuck out of the shower,” I screamed.  “I’ll explain it to you in a minute.”  Carissa had her shoes on, she handed me mine.  I slipped them on and waited a moment.  Then, I decided I was going to be a true hero.  “You go down,” I said to Carissa.  “Don’t wait for us.”  She nodded and headed out the door with Pooka, our Chihuahua.  I went back on the balcony, waiting for Brad.  I called to the construction workers.  “Is the building still burning?”  They ignored me.  Strange.  A moment later, Brad stepped out of the bathroom, in his boxers.  “What’s going on?” he asked.  I explained, briefly, that we were under attack by terrorists and I didn’t have any more details.  He nodded.  “Okay then,” he said, and went back into the bathroom to put his clothes on.  Then, like an angel from beyond, Carissa re-appeared in the doorway, bearing a message.  “The guy down the hall says it’s fireworks,” she said.  “Fireworks?  But they said it was on fire,” I said, pointing to the construction workers.  “I think they were messing with you, Rob,” Carissa said.  And like that, my moment of glory was snuffed out – I became the fool.  There were no terrorists.  I went back out onto the balcony and looked again – a puff of firework smoke was drifting off towards the horizon, carrying my dreams of being hero away into the sunset."
MIHIGC4,male,23,"In a few minutes, I'm going to head out to explore the realm of the great Test.  You know, as soon as I get done with these great Tests, I won't be posting here as much.  That's me -- when I've got shit that's very important to do, well... if you don't know all about it, then get off the computer and go invent something!  Green's theorem basically states that the contour integral i[P dx + Q dy] over the region C = ii[dq/dx - dp/dy] over some domain.  He might have an extra E at the end of his name.  We'll never know.

My server and I didn't get along, and we couldn't work things out, so I decided to compromise and not confuse myself further.  The Newt's name is Minute (pronounced my noot).  Let me show you a picture:      That's Carissa's hand.  We don't think it's going to live much longer: it certainly doesn't seem to be very excited about life.  We feed it live crickets.  It all feels very white trashy.  Perhaps I'm just returning to my roots...  Well, it's time to take a shower.  This is what I look like after I shower:      (Just kidding... that's not even my tongue!)"
MIHIGC4,male,23,"I'm feeling pretty crappy today.  I left my bar shift early last night in order to take the cat to the emergency clinic -- she was hacking and sneezing and having trouble breathing.  Needless to say, when we got her to the vet, she was not happy.  The vet took a quick look at her and suggested that we leave her overnight -- for the nominal fee of $598.75.  This was not cool, but he was suggesting that we'd do it if it was our child, so we should do it for the cat.  And I guess we agreed, because we left her there.  It was most likely for the best: it was clear that the cat was not well.   This morning, Carissa went by at around 7 and picked her up.  I got up and took her to our vet, and he checked her out for feline AIDS and this other disease called FIP.  It was scary for a few moments, because the paper that the emergency vet gave us said ""differential diagnosis: ... FIP"".  I asked the vet what FIP was, and he said it was a fatal disease; so for a little while, I thought that Duchess was going to die.  Fortunately, that turned out to mean ""possible"" diagnosis -- and she came back negative for anything  really  serious, although she does have pneumonia.  I don't know why I feel so crappy, really, because this is good news.  Brad is also calling me about getting a place -- I told him I really was only interested in The Mark, but I don't know, something in my gut is just a little twisted.  And then, by the grace of God (BYGG), Bob W called and asked if I wanted to hang out with him at the Biltmore tomorrow.  Of course, I want to hang out at the Biltmore, and I'd hang out with Bob even if it was at the barber shop.  He said that I seemed to be going through a ""transition"" phase; I don't know what that means, I like to interpret it to mean ""growing up"", but that doesn't seem likely.  I'm afraid of speaking at a meeting right now, and that really bothers me.  It's not that normal jittery feeling -- last night, I was working the bar, and I realized that at some point I might have to do the announcements, and this made me run cold with fear.  This is very strange, because I've come to  enjoy  doing the announcements.  So, you say, a Blog about ""his life"" doesn't really get him out of himself?  Well, there's got to be something that can be done about that!  What should I turn this in to?  I enjoy spewing, and I like posting pictures -- there must be some positive, productive outlet in all of this."

6EFHA7X,female,48,"Cilantro, even though part of the carrot family, is evil. The seeds (coriander) are divine in many applications, but the leaves leave a lot to be desired for many.  A friend of mine in Denver has such a bad reaction she has to go to the hospital if she happens to ingest any.  Just why do so many have such a bitter (pun intended) reaction to this herb?  A quote from The Gourmet Sleuth may give some insight:  ""The essential oils of the cilantro leaves contain antibacterial properties and can be used as a fungicide.""  Personally, I think anything that can be used as a fungicide should not ingested.   just sayin.."
6EFHA7X,female,48,"urlLink Apathy   as I see it.    When you don't care about something, you're said to be  urlLink apathetic .     I don't completely agree with this.    I don't care what your sister's husband's cousin's fiance had for dinner last Tuesday, does that make me apathetic?    No, it just means I'm not interested.    I don't care how the election turns out,  does that make me apathetic? (hypothetical case)    Yes, it does. It means that I don't care how the future of my country (as well as yours) turns out. It means that no matter how hard YOU might try, things may not change for the better or the worse, because you can't make ME see my own apathy.    Every person counts. Every fire lit under some apathetic ass helps. Every spark ignited in some boob-tube-dulled eye makes a difference.    But apathy isn't just for people who don't vote. I see it all the time in people I personally believe in.    Friends who make grand plans, then don't work towards the goal, end up whining because it didn't ""happen"" to them. Things don't just ""happen"" to you. You have to MAKE the event, whatever it may be.     You have to put that one foot in front of the other, put pencil to paper, put oils to canvas, put music to the dreams you had last night, or you'll always be wondering why.     Why didn't that happen to me?     Help fight apathy today, go DO something that means something to you.   Find something that you turn a blind eye, or deaf ear to and learn about it.  Volunteer, learn something new, taste a different flavor.    DO SOMETHING!"

E55UCSG,male,25,"urlLink A quarter-century behind bars .  All because the man wouldn't agree to being guilty of drug trafficking when he used undated prescriptions to obtain painkillers for his back.  This is clearly a case of the ""cure"" being worse than the disease.  The war on drugs is futile and far more destructive than the drugs themselves.  Yeah, drug addiction can be very damaging to some people.  But there are quite a few recreational users, even of strongly addictive substances such as heroin, who do not develop addiction.  And there are quite a few addicts who, as long as their supply is steady, are otherwise functional in society.  I think we should treat substance use as a licensable activity, like driving or hunting.  This licensing should be extended to drugs that are currently legal, such as tobacco and alcohol.  Potential users should demonstrate knowledge of their desired substance and of the deleterious effects it is known to have.  If a user violates any of the terms of their license, it is punished in the same way as driving infractions, ultimately resulting in fines, revocation of the license and/or imprisonment, depending on the severity or frequency of the infraction."

It seems to me that the only representative government that would truely work in such a sharply divided population would have to rely on tribal traditions.

Of course when I tell you all, you won't think it's that big of a deal.  But I do.  I was told I'm weird. And when I asked why, I was told this: People who don't really know me would probably tend to think I'm a bit stuck up because of the way I carry myself. I tend to carry myself at a higher regard and such. But when you get to know me, I'm ""really cool and down to earth"".  I liked that.  Why you ask?  Because a) they said I was cool and down to earth, which is always complimentary, and b) because it's comforting to know that I carry myself a bit 'stuck up'.  I would much much rather carry myself like I'm up on a pedestal than like I'm just your average girl.  Because I could never ever ever ever ever ever settle for average. I could never live with keeping my head down, or even level for that matter.   If you're ever going to make a difference, you have to be a little more than down to earth.   Thank you, complimentor.

But I just don't get how people can change their opinions so easily to conform with what someone else thinks. Or how they model their opinions so that everyone can see how godly, intelligent, and moral they are. You know what I think?  Who cares!  I feel that if you feel the need to prove morality and intelligence to someone, then maybe you're just trying to fool yourself.   So why don't you just go dig a hole, climb in, and prove yourself to the dirt. It's obviously got more substance than you do.   Rants. Must love rants. I feel like ranting alot.

I'm still off looking for ways to make my problems magically disappear or just clear up, without ever really facing them.  And so what? It's a learning process. Everything in life is a learning process.  You have to break every rule before you can truly enforce it.  That's my theory at least. I think that doing otherwise is narrow-minded.

OZ4KSC5,female,17,Hey Bloggers...Who says the abortion topic is dead.  You seem to have plenty to say about it...and your knowledge about contraceptives is very admirable.  I also appreciate how you relate it to the constitution and personal rights.  So many major issues in American history are related to personal rights and civil liberties.   Do you think this issue has enough relevance to sway how you would vote for president?  Should it?  College portfolios...I think the college admissions process would be an interesting topic to debate...especially after out discussion in 2nd period today.  I think the movie Fog of War will lead to some interesting discussion.  For some of you it may help if you look into the life of Robert McNamara before watching the movie.    I love the post AP period...it actually gives us time to get to know each other.  Have a good evening and see you tomorrow.

OZ4KSC5,female,17,"Hey everyone........I guess today is Skyview's last day of school. I'm posting from the UW communications building computer lab.......UW is so nice! I am living in the infamous McMahon dorm. And our SIMUW group of 24 students is only a small fraction of ALL the countless number of high school/middle school students who are here for the summer living in McMahon. A lot of people are here for summer sports camps.   The McMahon dorm has a fantastic view of lake washington. The dorms are set up as a ""quad"", IE four dorm rooms in one vicinity sharing one living space/microwave/refrigerator/bathroom, and the best part, a balcony. The McMahon dorms is so oppressively hot (seems like the heat is always on even in 90 degree weather). The big windows are open with no wind coming in and yet the flies and bugs outside are attracted to the light inside. The first two nights the dorm is around 90 degrees and each room has one little fan to cool us off.......  As for the food, it's 1000 times better than anything we have in Skyview or nearby Salmon Creek. Each student gets $24.50 daily for food (all free).......Lots of stuff to gorge on........And some crazy SIMUW people buy dozen cartons of milks or drinks and freezes it overnight......crazy Ha one downside of the ""quad"" dorm is that eight people have to share one bathroom/one shower. So things can get interesting with shower/bathroom schedules.  The whole day spent here in UW is packed with stuff to do..........From 7:50 to 8:50 breakfast/community meetings.....From 9:00 to 12:00 morning lecture/activity.....1:30 to 4:00 afternoon lecture/activity.....4:15 to 5:00 computer alloted time.....5:30 to 6:30 dinner time, and afterwards free time to do whatever we want.  During the evening times we wander around the campus/dorms/travel to university avenue or university village shopping areas/movies/community solving math problems/or playing boardgames like monopoly or risk.   Yeah and finally the people here are so interesting.....just leave it at that.......Half of the people in this program are Canadians!!!!!!!!!! Ha............So interesting."

Essay prompt:   John Winthrop's goal was to create a ""City Upon a Hill""?  Like John Winthrop, Jefferson believed Americans had a special destiny and responsibility: ""The eyes of the virtuous all over the earth are turned with anxiety upon us as the only depositories of the sacred fire of liberty, and...our falling into anarchy would decide forever the destinies of self government.""  This was the Republican vision of the City Upon the Hill. If Americans were to be a virtuous people, would all of the people in the new nation be allowed to become American?  Throughout history how and why have Americans struggled to live up to these principals?   I need a Muchas Gracias Burritto.  Ms. Clark"

WH9Z8ID,male,24,"Where is the asymptote?   I ran this morning and registered 9:10, a mere 7 seconds faster than last time. My ever-receding target time is now just to inch my way past the 9 minute mark. I think where any extra speed will come from is the beginning where I am usually sluggish and usually have the same doubts whether I will actually be able to do the whole circuit without stopping. I have two time markers to check my progress. The 2:48 intersection and the 6 minute roundabout.  So up steps plan B! I will shift to the greater block for a week before coming back to the lesser block. Practising the greater block will give me a bit of variety and stretch my endurance rather than speed."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"The Finest Cryptic    For a cryptic crossword fan like myself, crosswords bring pleasure and frustration. The biggest frustration known to crossword solvers would probably be a clue that you have many of the letters (provided by intersecting answers) yet still cannot crack the clue or fit a likely word.  Two such clues have a risen in the last week:  1.  Time-worn tea ceremony  (5)  letters supplied: T _ I _ E  This clue was impregnable to both me and the cryptic magician previously mentioned in this blog. We concluded that it must be a specific technical or archaic word that neither of us knew. It was only when we got the following day's paper that we discovered we were wrong. The answer is a logical and reasonable answer indeed yet we could not crack it.  Just yesterday, there was another:  2.  With which the Orientals show agreement  (4), letters supplied: E _ E _  This clue I was contemplating many times during an eight hour period where I also got the intersecting letters. The answer, which is actually reasonably obvious in retrospect, came to me intuitively rather than logically when I was tired and frustrated. But getting it brought ecstacy.  These two reflect a fine distillation of crypticity. A real mystery waiting to be cracked. Often clues are far too illustrative of the method by which they are to be solved. These two with their utilitarianism and simplicity show that although frustrating they are the finest cryptic clues.  (the answers will be in the comments page later, clue, they are essentially the same mechanism)   This message is a reconstructed version of a previous D.O.A blog I wrote last night."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"Decreasing  MRI    Another run this morning, and my marginal rate of improvement has plummetted! Ah well: 9 minutes 17 seconds.  It was rather frosty this morning which almost made me unable to turn off my stopwatch due to numb, uncoordinated fingers. Instead of nausea after the run, I gained a cough. Maybe my respiratory system has noticed that in order to increase efficiency it has to clean up my airways.   I think so too, at the start of my run I was struggling and thought I wouldn't even get close to my last time. But as is usual when you are improving, speed gains just come from nowhere."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"Unadulterated   When do you start to feel like an adult? What does it mean to be an adult? Do you actually know? Or is it just something you realise? Or are we always the same inside, the same as the child that skinned its knee on concrete at primary school all those years ago?  I don't know. I don't feel like an adult at times, especially when I am in a new context. And when I become more familiar to a context, everyone else just seems like a ""non-adult"" like me. A knowledgeable experienced child. But not as dynamic as a child.  This is more apparent to me being around children. Although I can patently see that they are cognitively very different to present-day me, I still feel the same as them at times."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"Oops, it did it again~        My morning fitness test (getting out of bed) revealed a still very sensitive, and not so kind inside ankle. Being a patient person, I am prepared to give it a bit more time to mature and refrain from being so temperamental. Till then, no run.       Being at school again is quite a treat. I got up at the wrong time in that I set my alarm clock for the time I thought I usually set it, but  that  time was actually the time I had to get up for my practicum school on time, rather than University. But I feel rather relaxed with so much time to spare. I will even hand in my assignments in the morning to get them off my mind immediately."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"Trouble?   I think the class which I am doing my practicum has been described recently as ""off the wall"", many of the members responsible for what one teacher described as ""the two worst duties in my life"" (duty being when a teacher walks around children playing during morning tea and lunch breaks). Today, the reason was five of the boys in my class being involved in an all tit-for-tat punching war (out of the six involved).   Earlier in the morning, one of the ""trouble"" kids was particularly agitating but when told off, he started to cry. This my supervising teacher noticed as unusual for him, and asked him what really was up with him. After much persistence she found that his mother had hit him in the head that morning.   There seems to have been an escalation of these sorts of disruption since I arrived (although I can't see how I have had anything to do with it). These are only 5 year olds. Born in 1998. And the teacher, I don't see as having many productive techniques to restore order. But is it possible to do so anyway? Some of it seems so affected by external factors.  How do you regain control? Or don't you, just doing the best you can under the circumstances.  Next week, I do take a more administrative role over the class, and will be formally required to do some lessons. I will be thinking about this hard.  This two quotes, passed onto us by our lecturer John Hope, give me courage:  ""The Myth of the Good Teacher"" ""This is the teacher who doesn't have behaviour problems, who is always in control, who never calls anyone for help. ""The myth is nonsense. No teacher, no matter how skilled he is or how much experience she has, is capable of working successfully with each and every student without support. This myth is especially damaging today because of the increase in the students whose behaviour is so disruptive that a teacher must have help from the principal, the parent(s), and if possible, a counsellor, in order to deal effectively with unacceptable behaviour."" Canter 1992  In other words, I really should let these current experiences pour some cold water on my idealistic expectations for myself. I will be hit with the worst case of disappointment if I let my expecations define an impossible goal. Plan for the best, prepare for the worst. And this one:  ""The Frightening Conclusion"" ""I have come to a frightening conclusion. I am the decisive element in the classroom. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. As as teacher I possess trememdous power to make a child's life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humour, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or de-escalated, a child humanised or de-humanised"" Ginott 1972  A balance to the previous quote, because we must always remember we are the strongest agent in the classroom. We define so many of the factors. To always point to external factors (mums hitting children etc.) is to look for scapegoats and evade your own place of responsibility.  Anyway, to bed I go, to save my energy for the last day of the week."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"Language exchange   After a hiatus of 2 years, I have restarted doing language exchange. This time it is with my newly acquired language te reo Maaori. My exchange partner worked in China for a brief time and had tried to pick up Chinese at that time but had forgotten a lot, so I used my Chinese knowledge to trade for Maaori practice. She was quite shocked that I had quite substantial Maaori accumulated in my memory banks and was making sentences quite readily and even asked questions about how to say sentences that she struggled to know how to say.  It was productive though, it was so nice to hear sentence structures and be able to get an explanation. Sometimes the meaning just flowed into my mind, other times my brain froze under the intensity of a string of words which it declared as familiar but didn't want the further commitment of identifying."
WH9Z8ID,male,24,"The  Family   Thicket ~      My latest review will be on the locally made movie headlining the film festival,  In my father's den . It is a story that was the portrayal of a story by a   NZ   author ( Maurice Gee ).     Small town life is something that I was born into but left before things really got tricky. Some movies go into the depth of the hidden side to this quaint life, where the secrets are thicker than  water , and so is the  blood  of the families that form small communities. This is one such movie.     To understand the characters, we all need to have some sense of   depth   perception. The protagonist,  Paul , is quite pained at the best of times. In fact, we can see pain in many of the characters. But the search for the root of the pain is the quest of the audience, as much of it is known to the characters.     Simply put, it is a story of  homecoming,   alienation ,  friendship  and a  disappearance  possibly due to   foul   play, or is it a run away? There are  hsalf 's and  flash forwards that are crucial to the story but often to the detriment of the orientation of the viewer.     As a production, it is most impressive. The acting shows that   New Zealand   does have much depth. The cinematography and sets were stunningly  realistic . As it was a premiere we got to see those at the   heart   of bringing it together including most of the cast.     One thing that came across quite coincidentally was the links between the very different film I reviewed before,  Old Boy . Both have strange hidden plots of  real ,  accidental  and  imagined  incestuous relationships. The hearts to both  puzzles  lie with the question that is not focussed on. And similarly, when the final pieces of   the  puzzle  is put in the story becomes credible. For me, I would rate it as a   good   movie, also possibly stretching into the  exceptional  category."

It is a South African tea with a 'different' taste. I didn't think of much of it when I first drank it but in Singapore it was a divine taste. Now, I hear it is apparently one of the healthiest teas around. I want to see what it tastes like loose leaf and of high quality."
YS09NDZ,male,16,"Right, OK, Facebattle sucks muchly. Seriously. Taking-the-biscuit. 1, you have to pay to be able to do anything just about; 2, those people who decide to pay a lot can stop you from talking to someone; 3, you have to pay to even be able to read the mail you get sent. Hate. I'm mm089, by the way.  I was completing a form yesterday (not one for facebattle) and it had a 'Marital Status' question. I figured that I didn't fit any of them - the usuals were there, 'Single and not looking', 'Single and looking', 'dating', 'long-term relationship', 'married' and 'divorced'. For one thing, why is divorced one? It's like if you're divorced, you can only be with divorced people, and that you're a member of a special 'divorced' club. What a question. Anyway, the real thing is that, when I really think about it, I don't fit into any of them - I'm 'single and letting things slide'. I put 'Single and looking'. I'm not just letting things slide with  one  person here.  Anyway, thanks for your kind comments on the sting (or rather, your nasty comments about the wasp), the swelling's gone down a lot and I can use the finger now. It's still a little painful to bend and quite sore around the area, but it's much better. Nice to know that if I get stung by a wasp I've got people who will swear bloody murder on it, even if it did die.  Question of the day: if you didn't know, how old would you think I am? I'm interested in this, mostly because I'm  that  vain but still, opinion is sharply divided (Scott, I know that's in a song you sung, don't do it, ye fool). Laura says that she quite often forgets I'm younger than her, Nikki doesn't ever really have an opinion on it, cause her feelings on my age change constantly, and most people I meet tend to think I'm in the sixth form. Only once or twice have people asked me how Uni's going.  Physics exam was OK, but in true me-style I'm going to say nothing more on it.  Marital status: Single and not bad enough to stop being so.

There was a little bit of flirting last night but that's because I fancy her a lot. Well, there was a LOT of flirting last night. I would LIKE to go out with her, sure. But while Gwen maintains that she'd be upset if I made 'a move' and Miller maintains tha she doesn't fancy me I feel it would be fruitless, and I must therefore turn my efforts to a back up plan.

She has no foresight to capture the essence of what the client wants if she can't include every component the client mentions in a brain-storm session.

I was supposed to do it on my honeymoon, but we all know how that turned out.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?  I have been accused of being brutally honestbut with hair, outfits, etc, I can be like a guy in that I dont notice subtle differences.  Especially with hair colorwhen Thong was still in the office she was getting her hair highlighted at least every 3 weeks (it was gross) and she  always  asked me if I liked it.  Instead of saying yes or no, I usually told her I couldnt tell.  This was true and not too hurtful (?).  I have had some interesting hairdos over the years, and I usually appreciated peoples commentsunless it was some asshole guy telling me they like girls better with long hair.  Those guys can go to hell.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   A friend once told me how a guy  really  felt about me when we were going out.  This I did  not  need to know.  Does this even answer this question?    Actually, I guess I found out 2 things from this: 1) the person who told me this bit of info is not that great of a friend, and 2) that guy was a total shite.    4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   Dylan (Drew Barrymores character) in Charlies Angels.  She kicks ass and looks good doing it.    5.

KJJBQAB,male,36,"Angels in America  By Duf ""Art Lover"" Fer  If you have a chance, I urge you, nayI plead with yousee  urlLink this movie .  I saw the play(s) when it (they) was (were) in Minneapolis several years ago.  This version was on HBO, and I watched it on a video tape that my in-laws lent me.  It is six hours long, so I would encourage you to take it in installments.  Still, this play (these plays), this movie (these movies)are art.  Kushner won a Pulitzer for the plays, and you can see why:  they are art, pure art.  The conversations about religion, sexuality, race, patriotism, sickness, convalescence, history, politics, conservatism, liberalism, addiction, parenthood, marriage, divorce (togetherness, separation), mortality, immortality, gain and loss, freedom and slavery are simply amazing.  There are moments when it becomes a bit too arty and perhaps too literary (if thats possible), but it succeeds on so many levels that you are left slack-jawed and amazed.  As I watched it, I kept thinking I cant believe one person wrote this.  The writing is so rich (maybe too rich sometimes) that you imagine some of the ideas were a lifetime in the making.  The acting:  Emma Thompson is great.  Al Pacino is magnificenthas Meryl Streep ever done a poor acting job?  Ive never seen it.  But the show was stolen (stop, thief!) by Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat) who has to be among our nations best actors.   Art lovers, see this film!  Panda, you especially must find a way to see this movie."

8CO4TE0,female,33,"Normally I'd write a quick one liner because it amuses me, but I have to say...this movie rocked. I loved it, loved it, loved it.  Right now I'm reading a book called ""Writing the Breakout Novel"" by Donald Maass. He's a well-known literary agent who knows what the hell he's talking about and this movie is a great example of all the important ""requirements"" for a ""break-out"" piece of entertainment.  Characters:  A sympathetic protagonist: Peter Parker. This guy has it so bad that I was really pulling for him. Everything was going wrong for him, and then when you think things might pick up a bit, they only get worse. I wanted to give the poor shmoe a hug. As well as a whole cast of interesting, three-dimensional people who have their own agendas, thoughts, dreams, plans.  Stakes:  High stakes, both internal (his relationship with his best bud and Mary-Jane, the woman he loves but can't tell her) and external: Doc Ock putting the city of New York in danger.  Plot:  Multi-layered. Not just 'see the superhero beat the bad guy.' This movie had so much going on I couldn't take a bathroom break...and that wasn't a good thing! No more large diet-cokes for me!  Theme:  The most integral part, I think, in separating this movie from, say, Van Helsing (which sucked, pun intended). As with the first movie, the theme is ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Every scene resonated with this, and what it meant for Peter and his 'burden' of being a misunderstood good guy. Being a hero ain't always a piece of cake. Sometimes people aren't going to be waving flags and patting you on the back. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do because it's the right thing, whether or not you get any personal results from it.  Anyhow, this was a great movie. The preview for Catwoman was at the beginning. Ten years ago this would have been a great thing as far as I was concerned. Now, it just fills me with a sense of dread. I know it will be bad. I just know it. Which is too bad. I mean, come on. Just look at that costume. It's disgusting. I, as a female who doesn't like chick flicks -- who would rather see an action pic anyday -- am insulted that in this day and age we can't have a female hero on the big screen without flashing a shitload of cleavage. And the shoes? Yeah, let's fight crime wearing high-heeled pumps. Puh-lease. But who knows? I'd love to be proven wrong. Come on, Halle, show me a great, female, superhero movie. I double dog dare you.  Spiderman 2: Michelle's rating: 10/10"
8CO4TE0,female,33,Found these pics from  urlLink an editor at Tor's blog  that really put things into jarring perspective for me:        This is the slushpile at Tor.  I have nothing more to say today.
8CO4TE0,female,33,"July 15 (that's today!) marks the day I'm going to start writing the first book in my dark urban fantasy series. I've done just about all the notes I think I need. I've picked my actors. :-) (little pictures I put with the character profiles); I have my plot points; I know my conflict...  I'm ready.  So... I'm going for 100,000 words, 400 pages. First person. The title ""Dark Nexus"" will change, but I like a title to start with. It sounds a little too hard fantasy/sci fi to me, but it'll do for now.  And I want to be finished it by October 15. Three months. Two months for first draft, so what's that... 60 days... 1667 words a day (hey, just like Nano). Okay, maybe that's a little too much. I don't want to get frustrated with it. Also I want to edit as I go so it's not so much at the end. Okay fine. I'll take the three months to do the first draft: 1111 words a day: roughly five pages. I can do that. My goal is to have the first three books finished quickly (in about a year) so I can market them as a ""ready-made"" series.   I envision the series to be ""Laurell K. Hamilton"" meets ""Buffy"" meets ""Nikita"" meets ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" meets ""Charmed."" Various actors I've picked to play the characters in the movie theatre that is my head include: Angelina Jolie, Adrian Brody, Drew Barrymore, Jude Law, Keith Szarabajka (Holtz on Angel), and Danny DeVito. There's also a cat, but I haven't cast him yet.  =^..^=  All right then. Let's do it. Well, after this damn day job thing."
8CO4TE0,female,33,Things got better after the last post. Whenever I have a really bad day it's followed immediately by a good day. That's why I've been here for so long.  I'm slacking on my Nano. Got to pick that puppy up and run with it. I don't have anything after work tonight so I can get down to business. One hopes.
8CO4TE0,female,33,Wow. Scholastic wants to see the trilogy. I'm very excited. Now I just have to shine it up real nice and pretty and get that puppy in the mail by the beginning of next week.  I'm not going to get my hopes up too high. Just because their one of my TOP THREE FRICKING PUBLISHERS!!   Relax. Breathe deep.   Think positive thoughts. That's right. Puppies and kitties and balloons.  And stress. Much stress.
8CO4TE0,female,33,"Well, Christmas has passed for another year and I find myself sitting here on Boxing Day wondering what to do with all my new stuff.  I did all right. I got:  Two DVDs: Pirates of the Carribean and LoTR: The Two Towers. Cinderella Bunnykins Swarovski crystal typewriter Tons of socks A really cool parrot candy dish. Doesn't sounds so good, but trust me, it's really cool. Salt and pepper shakers that look like two pieces of toast in a toaster. Love it. Plus, a whole bunch of other stuff.  Today I'm just relaxing. I'm still getting over my lovely little case of the flu that I've been stuck with for a week today. Next year, I swear I'm going to get the flu shot. On a happy note, I have lost five pounds thanks to it.  I just got an email from eBay saying that it's free listing day. I may put some stuff up. I have a bunch of Buffy cards I still want to get rid of. NO MORE COLLECTING. I swear. I mean it.  I have to go back to work on monday, tuesday and part of wednesday. Then I'll be off for five days. Then I'll have to start thinking about my new year's resolutions.   So hope everyone had a lovely Christmas and lots of turkey. Watched ""World Idol"" last night. I think that Ryan Malcolm did us proud. Zack Warner's a dick, but I already knew that. I hope Kelly Clarkson doesn't win. She bugs me for some reason. I thought the chick from Poland sung the best, although I hated the song. Evita? Come on.  Okay, that's all for now... :-)"
8CO4TE0,female,33,"I just bought myself a new toy.  I know, I know, I'm saving for the condo....blah blah-dee blah.  But, in a way, this will *help* me with the condo because it will aid my blossoming writing career.  My (how the hell do you make a link again?...ah, here we go...)

To which I would reply: ""Uh yeah. But this little puppy will allow me to just type with no distractions like the internet or games.""  ""Then,"" you continue, ""Why didn't you just get this in the first place and use the money you spent on the computer to further your condo fund.""  And I would roll my eyes at you because you are a silly little fool. ""Because the Alphasmart is just to enhance my experience with the computer. It's an additional tool for my writing arsenal. And fuck off, it's my money.""  Then you would walk away angrily by the way I'd expressed myself and we wouldn't speak for weeks.  So, bottom line, I'm happy. And I don't go to the casino anymore, so if I like to buy my little toys every now and then, so be it. :-)"
8CO4TE0,female,33,"I've decided to become a writer.  This isn't news. I've wanted to be a writer since I was ten and tried to write an addition to the Enid Blyton ""Adventure"" series.  But I've always wanted to ""be"" a writer. In other words, skip over all the hard stuff and have all the good stuff that comes after the real work.  I think twenty years have proven to me that it's not that easy.  So... I'm going to journal about my journey into the writing world. Taking myself seriously. Taking my goals seriously.  Fashion and build my career instead of thowing the dart and hoping it doesn't boomerang back and hit me in the eye.   The Rules  1. To be a writer you need to write.  2. To be a writer you need to write books that have a chance at being published and therefore making money off of them. 3. You need to have an idea of what you would like to write. 4. You need to have an idea of what sells. 5. Write. 6. Revise. 7. Find an agent. But agents don't like to work with unpublished authors. 8. Find a publisher. But publishers don't like to work with unagented authors.  Hmmm. A quandry.  9. Network with other people in the publishing industry so you are no longer just a name on a query letter. 10. Send work to publishers that will accept unagented work.  Okay. So that is where I am right now.  I will send a book to somewhere that will embrace me for the novice novelist that I am.  And full circle back to Harlequin.  Good old Harlequin. I always fancied being a writer for Harlequin. Two hundred pages of a simple formula. Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back.  How hard can that be?  Ever tried reading one of them? Well, since this journal will probably be only for my eyes only, the answer is...yes. Several times. They bored me to tears.  Flash forward to now. Here I am. I want to become a published writer who actually makes enough money one day (let's talk five year plan here) to quit her day job.  Enter 'Flipside.' Harlequin's revamp of their 'Love and Laughter' line. Comedy romances. Funny stuff with fun and interesting characters. They list several 'examples' including some of my favorite movies. As well as some sitcoms I watch on a regular basis.  I can write a comedy romance. Sure I can. And I'm going to come up with the plot today.  It begins.  Here are some suggestions from Harlequin Editors on what to do and not to do when submitting to them:     From Slush to Published  by Carrie Hunter  It's perfect. Your manuscript�� you've invested hours of research, writing and editing all with one goal: creating a believable and entertaining story. You work up the courage to submit it to a publishing house. Then you hear�nothing. You're stumped.   This holiday season, we asked some of our editors to share their thoughts on what manuscript attributes top their wish lists. What they had to say just might surprise you!    The Basics   Ensure your manuscript is clean of grammatical errors and offers fresh writing, engaging characters and a plot without holes.   Proper presentation goes a long way. Remember the following format:   *	Double-space your manuscript. *	Use a legible 12 point font. *	Number the pages.  *	Use spell check. *	Proofread your manuscript (�to catch those errors that spell check misses).  *	Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope that is large enough for the return of your manuscript. *	Write your address somewhere in the submission other than on the outer envelope. Imagine if Harlequin wanted to buy your project, but couldn't get in touch with you! *	Present a writing style that has a personal feel to it�� as if the reader were a part of the secret.     From the Editors   Writing and Grabbing the Spotlight   ""Write something you're passionate about. How can an editor to fall in love with your story if you're not crazy about it yourself?""   ""Start with something interesting and directly relating to the romance. I can't stand to be deluged with background, set-up and/or a ton of subsidiary characters when I want my romance. Not only that, a good first line can be a writer's best friend.""   ""A way with words that brings the scent and taste and sight and sound to my mind.""   ""Scene and chapter endings that either leave a sigh of satisfaction at a beautiful moment or leave me on tenterhooks until I turn the page and keep reading.""   ""Smarts! Smart writing, smart characters, smart situations. No more conflict generated by keeping a secret only the hero or heroine cares about! No more walking unarmed into the dark room instead of turning around and calling the cops! We all act like idiots occasionally, but I'd rather read about a smart woman who knows she's being an idiot.""    Voice   ""Create a voice that is both unique and really gripping/captivating/interesting. I'm a sucker for good dialogue. I want characters to sound real and like themselves, not like types or every other character out there.""   ""Voice�� something distinctive or evocative about the way the author expresses the familiar or even clich�d.""    Characters/Characterization  ""Create fully realized characters with whom the editor/reader can identify with�� the characters have to resonate with the reader""   ""A strong, capable heroine who doesn't break down and whine all the time.""   ""A gruff, wounded hero who needs to be healed emotionally and physically.""   ""Characters so real I want to move next to them!""   ""A sense of humor that makes me laugh with the characters.""   ""Watching a great personality jump off the page! A lot of writers seem to think personality can only be shown in dialogue.� What sets a winning submission apart is when even the exposition sounds like someone's talking. In historicals that could mean maintaining a mild period syntax; in contemporaries, using appropriate slang to convey age or setting. Don't let the characterization stop outside the quotation marks!""    Moving Along: Creating Plot   ""Emotion. Show how the hero/heroine respond to major turning points.""   ""Plotting that is fresh, intriguing and engrossing.""   ""Pacing, pacing, pacing! Writers write because they love their characters, and sometimes that means they tell too much up front. Nothing's better than starting a submission, thinking I'll read a page or two, and glancing up what feels like five minutes later to see that I've read 100 pages without noticing."""
8CO4TE0,female,33,"No word from Scholastic yet. Hey, no news is good news I guess. Dial Books for Young Readers wants to see the first three chapters + synopsis so I, of course, obliged. Whoever accepts it first gets it. Crossing fingers that either wants it.  Work is sucking bad this week. Thank God it's a short week.  Not much else is new. I'm supposed to be doing my timesheet right now. I hate doing my timesheet. I hate Excel. Yes, I'm a positive girl. I'm procrastinating.

8CO4TE0,female,33,"Did I mention that I hate Mondays?  I'm starting to think I may need to find another job. For such a small place there are way too many office politics. I agreed to go to a dinner that my boss had bought a table to support a local politician. That was Friday. Since then I've discovered said politician is not someone I want to be seen supporting. So this morning I bailed on the dinner. I could have told my boss that I had other plans, but I instead stupidly said I didn't want to go because of political reasons. I should have known she'd sulk about this.  My immediate manager (who thinks we're buddies) closed my door to give me her two cents which is: I'm supporting my boss and not the politician and I shouldn't just not go. And blah blah blah.  Bottom line, I'm not political. I could care less if someone's going to tear up nature to build a highway (well, I suppose I care a little). But I really didn't want to go to the dinner because I really don't want to socialize with these crazy people any more that I have to. I just used the political line to vaguely sound like I have an opinion about anything more than what I like to eat for breakfast (presently, a chocolate chip muffin).  So there. I'm not going, and they can't make me.  >"
XCCGR54,male,23,Today has been an extremely lazy day.  I wasted a lot of time.  Hopefully I will become more productive later on.  I think I'm going to go work out right now but who knows if I actually will.  It has been very hard to get myself motivated lately.  Tonight I have a lot to do but should end up being ok.
XCCGR54,male,23,"Alright back to the continuing saga of Zeke and his crazy little life...    Ok well maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration not much has really happened..  Got over my pink eye, still got the sniffles but I can deal with that...  Got to deal with West Civ. as usual...  Ohh I am going to apply to bartend at the Bottleneck which would end up being a very cool job.  Lots of great bands coming through there..  And also going to see Jason Boland and the Stragglers tonight which will be fun...   Other than that not much going on.. So i'm off to get in the shower and in the words of Henry Hyde, ""The statute of limitations has long since passes on my youthful indescretions.""  Probably doesn't apply to me but I liked the way it sounded..  Peace out folks and if ya believe in the man upstairs maybe give him a shout out for me and see if he'll help with the job.."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Last night I did something I never thought I would do, Actually clean my room well with no help from anyone.  I then celebrated by playing flip cup in the basement.  This was a nice start to my drunken evening.  I then went and played some poker and won the money I would then use to go drinking with.  Me and paul go to the Wheel just like a normal night.  I saw a bunch of girls I met at leadershape and hung out and talked to them for most the night.  During that time though I kept drinking double vodka tonics like they were going out of style.  Then jenn and Desiree showed up so I hung out with them and sexually harassed them a little bit.  Then it was closing time so I left and wandered home.  Don't really remember the walk home but I got home.  Then went in the basement and lost like 9 bucks in my drunkeness.  A big mistake.  Then I went up stairs and the anger started getting to me.  Not sure why and at least it was late and I was by myself but I really did get angry.  After seething for a little bit and drinking more.  Maybe I shot of some angry emails not sure it was hazy then I laid down and watched an episode of band of brothers.  Just another night on the town.  Starts off happy and fun and after a large amount of alcohol it ends with me pissed off watching a very touching miniseries..  very odd huh..."
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK basically I was going to the bathroom and I couldn't sleep and the thought, ""I have a strange arrangement with my body,"" came into my head,  I really liked this phrase and thought.  the way it sounded and kinda what it meant.  The post I then wronte came from that but really had no meaning to me just strange words put into a thought.  It was and odd sensation but one I enjoyed.  Just kinda clarification because I can see that being odd to some people.  just a little insight to how my mind works.  Your loving host..  Zeke"
XCCGR54,male,23,"Thats right folks, Your hero has decided to become a ""Metrosexual.""  It's only pink shirts and stylish pants from here on out.  No more beers for this man.  Guiness is replaced with a stylish cosmopolitan but until after I am done being on the trendy ""South Beach Diet.""  No more watching of Cartoons, Porn or CNN, only reality shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and MTV.  I will still attend Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic but I will do it wearing an A&F cowboy hat if they make them if not I will find a womens cowboy hat and wear that.  The Journey will be long and hard but I'm sure I can make it."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Ok..  I promised more in depth adventures about Willie's 4th of july picnic...  Well I figured that if I wrote down al the things that happened to us we cuold make a whole movie out of it so I'm just going to give a few Highlights..  The number one highlight was seeing willie a bunch of times in 2 days..  He would come out with almost every band and he did a whole blues set himself in the middle of the second day. it was all amazing and if I ever get a tat  i am going to get wilie's autograph on my body over my heart..  It would signify a love that is hard to compete with no matter how much sex we have...  but the first day all we did was get drunk and listen to music.. it was amazing..   It reaffirmed my love for music..  the second day we didn't really drink very much but we stil just chilled and listened to tunes..  we met all kinds of wacky people and had everyone who met us act like they had known us forever..  all this experience did was reaffirm my love for texas..    I was goig to end with a quote about Texas (A state that I love) but I found this and it is so me it's scary..  so here it is..

XCCGR54,male,23,"OK it seems like I have been missing days but ohh well during finals not many interesting things happen..  went and saw ""The Emperor's Club"" with Claudia..  Lots of movies with Claudia lately but it's pretty fun..  Then I went home and watched some tube and studied some more physics...  went to sleep and basically just studied and did boring things since then..  but I have done well on all my finals which is nice..  ok I just wrote some stuff cuz i felt I was slacking...  I will have more after tommorrow cuz it is my last final and then I am drinking!!!"
XCCGR54,male,23,OK you are now officially visiting the journal of a  ROCKSTAR !!  actually I just started taking guitar lessons today so soon to be rockstar might be more appropriate but whatever..  hopefully things will go good and I have a good feeling so look out Hank I'm coming for you.  Well now that I said that classes have been going good and all basically not much new around here..  Just figured I should put that little fact down on the paper..  alright I'm off to get drunk and laugh at some funny pledge shit..  peace out my homies...
XCCGR54,male,23,"OK i have not updated this site forever.  I have missed christmas, new years and a bunch of other random bullshit that has gone on in my life.  I have thought about catching up and writing a bunch but I decided to forget about thatand just start from today.  Last night I worked and went to Fatso's for Jay's Bday and going away party since he is going to war in Iraq along with some other guys in our house.  I had a few beers then went home.  Pretty uneventful but I think I am going to go to the wheel to hang out tonight so that should be alright, hang with some nice folks.  Alright well all this writing has tired me out.  I need to get back in training but I'll write more later."
XCCGR54,male,23,"Well today was just another day, but boy was it beautiful out..  I spent all day either in class or outside reading and hanging out..  Felt like a college kid in some movie..  sitting outside and reading..  Kids always do that in movies but that was me today..  T.S. Elliot and a a beautiful day..  It was pretty good..  well I gotta call and get off work on sat because got a rush party sat then the KU game...  Hopefully I can get off on Fri too and go to the royals game with my boys too but that might be too much to ask..  Oh hwell  can't beat watching us beat the shit out of marquette and continuing on our road to a national championship..  Ok well in the memorable words of my boy Toms' ""Live the Dream...""  Peace."

As for my boring weekend...well...basketball with the guys on Saturday, then Jack in the Box with Alex, Erik and Eugene (it was weird cuz we barely talked while eating, but after eating it was way more fun), then we went to Alex's house to watch as   my CPU alter ego balled out of control   in NBA 2k3 (he has crazy shots, driving skills, and looks almost black to boot...pretty good for his   68 rating  ). Today, I played basketball for two hours and got pissed at myself for wasting my summer and first semester when I could've been practicing ball instead. Oh well,   never too late to start  ...  Oh yeah (thanks Kat)...enjoy President's Day everybody. Respect the legacy of our founding fathers by...uh...loafing around and watching TV and   catching up on much-needed sleep   and stuff."

I still don't know how he came to American...or Fremont for that matter. Made my day though. Sucked for Basho that he lost his voice, but I'm impressed with how he put it in the best light. He used a paper to write all his messages...  kinda Memento-esque  ...  Track practice was hard-ish but satisfying when completed...""badminton boy"" and Alex joined us for Camp AJ...aww, so sweet. Though Ankur and Pat were relaxing/lazy and   just sat there watching and pointing and laughing  . I'll probably never run hurdles ever. Besides, Jennifer is a very intimidating coach with the whole beater and visor and all that.   Ph33r h3r.   Yeahh...I lost 11-9 to Alex in the tournament. I could've won, but oh well. I really want to play more. Then went to Chopsticks with him...their food isn't THAT bad. The guy asked me if I had money...he was joking...right? Alex is daring, he stuck his potsticker into the soy sauce mixed with like...red orange thick paste stuff. Nasty.   And the game was boring and really sloppy and we murdered. We all thought #14 on Kennedy looked like a skinny Erik...except as Adam said,   ""a little less white.""   Speaking of Erik, crazy football player...but he couldn't stand sitting in the stands for 1 and a half hours straight...so disappointing. After the game Jennifer and Ankur   ripped Mr. Nelson a new...uh...  I won't even try it. And I biked home. Don't worry Kat, I didn't get run over or nothing :-D"

W12O9AF,male,17,"class of 2004: road trip seniors   ah might as well finish this. before anything else, the seniors are really cool! now, i'll be nice and succinct: unimpressive. disappointing. formulaic. senioritis strikes again for this drawn-out, mellow rally. once again, the seniors reminisce uninspiredly about their past years of high school, we have a possibly interesting rap rendered unintelligble by our cheap mics and speakers, alex carabello does the worm and mistakenly thinks he's cool, the seniors try (and fail) to make fun of the other classes (except for the parking joke, haha, i didnt find out what it was till later but i laughed anyway), mr. miller takes off his shirt (no coconuts ;-;). too bad the music kept screwing up for their guys' dance, but it wasn't too impressive anyway, at least when juxtaposed to that uber personification of awesomeness that was the junior guys' dance. and they unzipped their jackets? one: the guys in the audience immediately lose all respect for them. two: its not like they were much to look at anyway. haha. the step dance has lost all its appeal in my opinion (stepping to grindin' was so cool last year), though the girls' dance was a redeeming factor. sadly all the dances showcased the phenomenon known as ""lack of preparation-itis."" even the rotunda decoration and march seemed somewhat uninspired and half-spirited. only the lucid colors of the gateway poster could save the entire '04 presentation from being banished to eternal mediocrity. but we all know they still won though. i will commend the valiant effort on behalf of the road trip seniors, if not their somewhat shoddy execution. uhhh, the seniors are really cool!"
336BS3D,female,17,"STOP! JUST STOP!   OK listen up people. I am damn sick and tired of people bitchin about shit they want but don't have the balls to get. Look, this is what I have to say.  1.) To all those who love somebody or want to be with someone: walk up to the fucker and tell them how you feel tell them you'd like to give you two a shot. Hell it could be an ever lasting relationship. But you might get rejected and feel like a fool. So what! At least you've accomplished something  2.) To all those in a petty argument with someone you care about: STOP! JUST STOP! That petty shit you're arguing about is not worth it. Trust me I know. It could end something great.  3.) To all those with hate in your hearts: It's time to let go. Just let all the hate go. It's more than likely making you an angry person. Sad on the inside. You're hurting others as well. Stop. There's no reason to feel that way. Stop being negative start being positive  4.) To all those who are scared: Don't be. As some one once said ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" words to live by. If there's something that scares you to death. Face it. Own it. Take charge and over come what you fear the most. Whether it be telling someone how you feel, standing up to a bully, becoming a new person. Its time to face our fears  5.) To all those ""pimps and playas"": Quit. It's time to straighten up. Be a one man or one woman person. This playin around on one another needs to stop. It spreading hatred, disease, and hurt. It's time to love each other.  6.) To all you racists: Even though you people disgust me, it's time for a change. We all need to get along. Love one another. You guys are scared. It's the only reason you act this way. Try meeting the people you hate you just might like them.  7.) To everyone in the world that reads this: It's time for a change in this world. TIme for the hatred to stop. Time for the pain and suffering in the world to cease to exist. We need to strive to saving this place or we're all going to end up in a hell that unimaginable to us all. It's time for love. It's time for peace. It's time to be at peace with one another. And it's going to start with me.   Mood: Ready for a change Song: What's goin on? by Marvin Gay"

Well she's really cool about explaining on how and why Jerry acts the way he does towards me. Sometime I honestly don't know what I'd do without that girl. She's been there for me through some really tough times. I mean she's stuck by me as I lost my sanity when I had to give Joshua (my son) up. Plus she's been there to let me bitch to her about all the things in the world that piss me off so much. Plus she sits there and listens to me as I whine about how I hate Jerry but love him and how I get so confused. I swear she's been there so much for me lately that I would lay down and die for her just to show my thanks to her for being such a great friend. I hope that we'll be homies for life. I mean God, we'll be like 60 or older sittin' on each others porch cacklin' at the kids driving by saying ""Remember when we used to do all that shit??"" LOL   But anyways like I was saying: I really want to bang my head in to the wall because I was on the phone with Jerry today talking and stuff. And as we got off the phone I said plain as fucking day ""I love you."" and he says ""What did you say?"" I go ""NOTHNG NOTHING. I'll see you when I get there for dinner."" and he goes ""OK whatever."" I felt like such a fucking fool. Imean my God, here I am trying to respect our 'friendship' and there i go screaming out ""I love you"" because even though I still do I don't let him know that to the full extent because I don't want to run him away. I've made to many mistakes in the relationship we once had and I don't want to do anything to fuck up our friendship. Cuz honestly I truely value the friendship we have but I don't want to say anything that's gonna mess it up.

336BS3D,female,17,"YOU! LETTERS! STOP SHAKIN UR ASS AT ME!!   I'm just a little frustrated right now. Not pissed off but not happy. Ever had one of those days. Here let me explain.  Ever since Jerry and I broke up there have been a lot of things on my mind. Just questions I need clarified. I want to move on from him. So bad. Because it hurts me some to still be in love with him. Yes, I openly admit to everyone that I've told I'm done with him I don't need him, I lied. I'm pretty sure Skittle saw right through my fuckin lie. DAMN YOU J/K LOL  But its like... damn boy you've got me confused outta my mind. I mean we're homies. Always and forever will be. But I mean you were or are the one who wants to be  JUST  friends. You're the one who asked for it. So to make you happy I gave you that. I respect that.    Yet when ever I go over there to chill or we go and hang out some where. No one could guess we ever broke up and that we're just friends. And for once it's not me initiating all the kissing and hugging and holding hands and everything that goes along with relationships.   I mean we go out in to public and he walks like there's only one inch of space between us. Our hands might accidentally brush and he grabs mine and holds it. He sees a guy checking me out, arm instantly goes around my waist. More intimate than the shoulders I believe. We sit there and joke around and he kisses me and hugs me. How the fuck am I not to be confused.  Now tell me this y'all. When you go to a friends house do you end up holding their hand? Or if y'all are like lying down on the couch does the person put his or her head on your chest and wrap their arms around you? No I don't think so.  Because you're just friends.   Jerry doesn't even act like we're friends. And get this when I try to act like  just  friends he gets offended. When he calls me ""baby"" or ""sexy"" (names he's called me for like ever and a day) and I jokingly tell him not to he gets kind of upset.  Then when he heard that I was going to the prom this year and NOT by myself he seemed to be hurt and offended. When he knows that I want him to take me to my Senior prom. The year that means the most. I want to share that with him because he's special to me. Not this year. This year is like the ""get ready for the senior prom"" prom. Ya know?  I just need to know why he's acting like this. My girl Skittle has told me her opinion on this situation time and time again because she's like a female Jerry (take no offense to that homie). But it's like its not clicking.  And when he and I are alone he just keeps looking at me like he desperatly needs to say something but can't. And no its not ""I love you"" he tells me that anyways. But its like he opens his mouth to tell me something and the letters ARE RIGHT THERE ON HIS LIPS JUST SHAKING THEIR ASSES AT ME!! Like they're saying ""YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW! YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW!!"" Oh it pisses me off.  Damn boy, if there's something you need to tell me JUST FUCKING SPIT IT OUT!!!!!!!

336BS3D,female,17,"AH! WHY! WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF!!      Sometimes I seriously make myself sick with the way I feel. I went to Jerry's to show him the recent pictures of Joshua because you know he wants to see them as well as Brenda and all that.   So OK, I knew he was sick and wasn't gonna give me a big ol' hug and kiss like he usually does but damn I walked in his room and didn't even get a fucking HI!! That hurt a little bit. I mean he could have been at least poliet and said HI! I say hi to people even when I don't feel good.   Although he gave me a small hug and smiled at me. So I gave him the pictures and tried that stupid small talk but that didn't work. It's just like he's only nice to me when he wants to fuck and UGH. I mean that's just how it feels. It makes me feel like a cheap whore and it makes me want to cry. Seriously. I hate that.  I hate all these damn feelings and I hate having to feel them. I mean I'm not used to them all because I always got drugged up so that I couldn't feel. I don't want to feel but I can't do pills anymore because Hayley would kick my ass. But I want to. I just wanna be in a stoned stupor. I don't want to deal with them.  I don't want to have to deal with the fact that Mother's day is coming up and I have nothing to show for it. God that makes me feel like shit. I can't take it! I want to just give up. I don't feel like faking anymore. But I don't want to be real either. I don't want to be anything.  I'm tired of Jerry acting the way he does. He needs to get his shit straight. I'm tired of the feeling of hopelessness. Hayley keeps asking me what I want. What would make me feel better. Wanna know? Happiness. Pure true happiness. That's it. And to be satisfied with the person that I am. That's not much to ask for right??     Mood: Hurt Song: Left out ~ Shinedown"
14GXZ6T,female,23,"So here I am, happy and relieved that the exam is over.  At the start of the exam, I swear, I've never seen so many students panic and freak out over a midterm before.  And this class isn't small! Anyways, I think I did fairly well, considering I only got stuck on 2 questions really. I just hope I answered the ""short-answer"" questions to the prof's satisfaction.    I was so stoked that the exam was not as hard as i thought it would be, that I had so much energy afterwards.  I went to work out and practically sprinted on the treadmill for 20 minutes! Whew! I'll keep you posted on my exam mark!  D and I are going to watch a movie tonight - I haven't been to the theatre in ages! I'm excited!"

14GXZ6T,female,23,"Cutest thing ever happened to me today.   I was at a park, playing tag with one of my little guys that I work with, and his brother.    Suddenly, a cute girl, about 6 years old, comes up to me and says, ""You're beautiful"". And here I am, makeup-free, and wearing some less than flattering clothes (i.e., kid-friendly wear).   Doesn't stuff like that make your day?!                               ---------------------------   That reminds me about another time, back in first year of university when I shared a sociology class with an ex-boyfriend, who recently broke up with me. A girl sitting behind me tapped my shoulder and told me, ""My friend and I were just talking about you, and we think you're so pretty"". As if that comment didn't already make my day, my ex probably heard her say that, since he was sitting beside me. HAH! Too bad it wasn't a hot guy though, that would have made the situation all that much better. Regardless, it's nice when strangers tell you (genuinely and randomly) that they think you're beautiful."
14GXZ6T,female,23,"3d=Oh, and by the way, thank you God for answering Roz's prayers!"
14GXZ6T,female,23,"Ok, I admit it, I am guilty. I have a crush on a ""new"" man. Every since watching   Pirates of the Carribean , which I saw for the first time (FINALLY!) on Sunday at Q's house, I developed somewhat of  tiny  thing for  urlLink Orlando Bloom .     He really didn't do anything for me in Lord of The Rings, as  urlLink Legolas , since I thought he was almost too pretty (in a feminine way) and I'm sure it was because of the hair. Alright, I don't think this is going to turn into anything remotely close to the teeny bop obsession I have with Keanu Reeves...but I just happened to be surfing the internet and came across several Orlando Bloom sites, you know, by accident. It turns out that today is his birthday (he's only 27 years old, if anyone cares).    I didn't realize that he was also in Black Hawk Down. Cool. Anyway, his eyes mesmerize me. Oh, he has sexy hair too."
14GXZ6T,female,23,"[Roz] As I was browsing around the  urlLink Power 92  contest section, I noticed that they have their own ""Bachelorette"" contest going on. So that got the best of my curiosity and I started browsing through the male contestants just to see if they were decent looking (not looking for myself of course!!), or big geeks who like teeny-bop music too. I think it's a fair share of half and half. Then the funny part was when I realized that I actually went to high school with one of them!!!! His name is  urlLink  Jay  and I never knew him personally since he was two years older than me. He was actually in the ""popular"" crowd too. Seems strange when you actually see someone you semi-know in these kind of contests. It's just  so cheesy!  There's no other way to describe it! I know all you AOB folks are probably laughing your heads off too!!"
14GXZ6T,female,23,"Tonight I played Ultimate Frisbee for Dan's team again (for the second time), and the team did awesome! We usually lose (by ALOT), but today, we were kickin' butt. By half time, we were at 7-1. However, I think we started to get cocky and lose it in the second half, and the other team racked up points alot faster than we did. The final score was 15-8, and yours truly scored the winning point. YAY! Ok...I can't take  all   the credit, since the pass was probably less than a metre away...but who's really counting?   I didn't think I could really get into Ultimate at first, but once I got the hang of it, I really enjoy it. Of course, not as much as karate and soccer. ;o)   After our game, Dan and I went back to my place to make carrot-raisin muffins for one of his coworkers, because his company is throwing a surprise wedding shower for her. The muffins turned out okay, they were a bit crunchy (as oppose to the usual softness that muffins should be), but we figure after adding the cream cheese icing, no one would notice. Heheh. Mmmmmm....the cream cheese topping tasted like a piece of heaven.    D and I even made a small, separate batch for ourselves to take on our camping trip that we're going on this weekend. Except of course, I substituted some ingredients for lower fat content ones, and they actually turned out  much  better. They were super moist and delicious,  and  healthier!    Being the cooking/baking geek I am, I really enjoy collecting recipes, then figuring out ways to make them low-fat. Yes...I actually find it   quite   fun.     Ps: Birthday pictures to come soon!"
14GXZ6T,female,23,"[Roz] Busy weekend! The LADS were moving all weekend into a bigger house a few blocks away.  So on Friday night, Dan and Sean drank, and boy, was Dan wasted! He ended up vomitting later. There's also some interesting footage on Sean's video camera of Dan doing some crazy stunt. I'll get him to post the details. Saturday was moving day, so the boys moved the ""little things"" (i.e., everything but furniture). I got to see the house for the first time too. When you walk in, the entrace walls are bright yellow...and I mean BRIGHT. The living room is painted a super bold orange. The kitchen walls are this lime-yellow color. I'm not sure what to think - the walls are this crazy color and it just doesn't seem to suit the old, house - where most of the other walls are cedar panels. It just doesn't seem to go.   Saturday night was girls night out! Whoohoo! Michelle, Terry, Jackie, Susan, Joanne and I went to Yuk Yuk's. The show was awesome - all the comedians were super funny. I just about cried laughing so hard when the Headliner, Chris something (sorry, forgot his name - girls, can you help me out?) performed. He was making fun of teenage boys. Afterwards, we went to The Joint Nightclub, where we got drinks for $2 all night. Being a cheap drunk, I don't think I've spent more than $10-15 at a bar. Last night, I spent $25-30 on vodka slime hiballs. I didn't realize how drunk I was until we were on our way home, and I was sitting in the backseat of Susan's car. My head was throbbing and my stomach was churning. It was such a nauseating feeling. This usually doesn't happen when I drink b/c I don't drink enough to feel the pain, since I'm usually good after 2 Smirnoff Ices.   So Susan pulled over to let me hurl, but I couldn't force myself to. The whole way home, I held a plastic IGA bag under my head,  trying  to vomit. It wasn't until I got to my front doorsteps, did I managed to vomit. I had to practically lean all the way down to my knees (standing up) to make myself vomit. But man, did I feel  soooooooooooo  much better after. :o) Ugh, that was my very first time vomitting from drinking. However, I didn't feel too bad this morning (thank god!) NO HANGOVER!"

At first I was concerned about the amount of bubble gum there, but the mosh pit was one of the best I've seen. Ever.

They smell funny and then they die.   being poor.   driving everywhere I have to go.   not knowing how to accomplish anything in reality.  In my head I'm SuperThalia!!   having a 1.9 GPA.   striving to become more than average.   boinking.   being overweight.   wearing the inner thigh of my jeans away because my fucking thighs rub together.   worrying about being overweight.   my size 12 feet.   my nearsighted vision and my astigmatism.   being confronted when I can't remember the insulting comment that I made about your big nose, flabby gut, back fat, bellyroll, love handles, nose hair, chest hair, ass hair, small breasts, cankles, buthigh, or any other physical characteristic you have that may be less than perfect because 9 times out of 10, if it wasn't your teeth or height (latter only for males), I wasn't serious.   being confronted when I do remember the insulting comment I made about your way of life, intelligence level, and/or whoristic tendencies because 9 times out of 10 I meant what I said and I won't change my story simply because you found the testicular fortitude to speak your mind, assuming or hoping that I would change mine.   controlling my anger. Sometimes people piss me off and they never know it because I breathe and count and remove myself from their sight. Someday I'd like to remove them from mine.   compromising situations in public places.  (Shiver.)   guys with small penises who are in such a fucking hurry to whip them out at first sight of a pretty girl.   forgetting to call my mom back.     Neko.  He's the one that gave me fleas.  Cat bastard.   depending on someone.   doubting any part of me.    constantly thinking that maybe he/she doesn't like/love me because he/she/they did/didn't do blank.   growing up and growing apart.  No matter how you sugar coat it, it stills seems pointless now.   having to decide whether I should stay or go. If I need to I should, but if I can't afford to I shouldn't. Even though I NEED to.   my lack of privacy.  -------------------------   finding more flea bites.  43.   seeing my family in the position they are in and knowing that I can't help them without hurting them and myself.   knowing that I can't save the world...in reality.   Cause you know, in  my head I'm SuperThalia!!   finding a new job.   meeting new people.   dating. I wouldn't mind an arranged marriage. I've decided to just walk up to that stupid boy and say hey, I'm not really into this whole dating thing, so if we could skip it and just go get married that would be great.   the fact that my father is dead. Dead, dead, dead. How much does it suck when somedays you wake up and (on some level) forget that. After 5 fucking!! years. Oh, just a lil'.     I think I may have covered every dislike I have.   Everything else I can live with.       Nikol, are you sure you tried calling  everyone  Saturday??  Well, I hope Trast feels better soon and you get some grown time too."

This here is what happened, this is why I think he likes me.  I came in one day and he told me my hair was cool.  (Before the pixie cut.  Oh for everyone I haven't seen, Nikol.  I cut my hair.)  Then I smiled and said thank you and he said you have a really nice smile too.  Then he reacted as if I distracted him from his work.  It was small talk from that point, that day.  Then I was there on Friday and he said, something like, I was asking myself who is this beautiful woman then I realized I had met you before.  And I said oh, you called me one day and it didn't sound like you remembered me.  He was like no, that wasn't the case.  Well, he was dealing with a customer and I noticed he kept looking at me and when he walked by me he'd smile at me.  Then when he was done with that guy I walked over and he said I purposely rushed through that so I could help you.  And of course I just cheesed.  Then, we made small talk and at one point he said you know, you're a really cool person.  Then it was small talk again.  This is why I think he likes me.  He's cute.  I think he's cute.  But I don't know if he likes me or if he's just a really nice guy.  Hmmm."

OWA6N5W,female,24,"Educated Choice vs. the “Free” One   I always feel guilty for some of the ideas I have to help my struggling country.  However, lately, it seems that guilt is dissolving to disillusionment and idealism is beginning to have less and less appeal.  The result is this:  I have come to the not-so original conclusion that what the country needs is not free choice, but an educated one.  The ramifications of this conclusion are numerous, but perhaps what is the most controversial of all is that in my own envisioned restoration of the country, I believe that  people with no high school degree should not be allowed to vote .  I can pinpoint a thousand reasons how such a regulation could be abused to the detriment of the less fortunate, but I believe, if used wisely, it would be the best and only alternative to reconstruct our broken nation.  And by wisely, I imagine it being done under the premise that:  1)	The majority of the educated would not withhold education from those who weren’t so lucky.   2)	The educated have jobs 3)	The educated would be less likely to be led around the noose by the glitter of stardom and promises of short term gratification 4)	It assumes that in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the educated have at least satisfied the first two levels and would less likely to be ruled by the basic needs  I, of all people, do not want to withhold a right to choose a government simply because they weren’t fortunate enough to finish high school.  But I also believe that when you are near starvation, food and shelter are so scarce, you’d believe the flashiest promises from the people you think you know through their movie/tv personas.  I also believe that long term goals are difficult to determine and assess when you don’t even know when your next meal will be.  While having a high-school diploma does not guarantee all the above (it doesn’t even guarantee having a job), at least it gives me some assurance that these people went through basic economics, basic math, and basic history.  Just like we require voters to be 18 years old, of sound mind and body, I believe that having a diploma assures some level of maturity and knowledge, and not just desperate hopes from a person who don’t and can’t see the bigger picture due to unfortunate limitations.  But then, that’s just me.  Cynical, but still hoping me.  I keep thinking someday, I’ll stop feeling guilty at all and probably loose some of my so-called humanity.  But as one colorful character in Babylon 5 said, these are insane times.  And you must learn to embrace your insanity.   I'm beggining to see the true logic in that."
OWA6N5W,female,24,"Binary Tree Poetry -- Somewhat:  Betrayed   Here is my take on  urlLink JB's  revised binary poetry form... as the name suggests, this is patterned after, well, the binary tree (which I vaguely remembered being explained in a Sweet Valley High novel, but that was decades ago).

OWA6N5W,female,24,"The Big Cheese   Just a short side-note, up until yesterday, I never did quite feel like a... boss, even if it was a low powered one.  It might have to do with the way our company culture is, or the fact that some of my staff are older than me.  Either way, it was quite a surprise that one of my staff, one I considered a pal, instantly call me on the cell after I expressed annoyance at her leaving before her 9 hours of work was up.  While I know I had a point, I wasn't all that pissed, since she only left around 30 minutes before 6:30, so in the hierarchy of sins, its reasonably venial.  However, she immediately called me up and apologized profusely.  Too profusely.  I don't know if I really like the feeling that people will consider me as something other than a friend.  Then again, professional life would surely take a short-cut to hell if they didn't.  Oh well...   Girlfriend Needs   Recently, a very close friend of mine disclosed that he and his girlfriend had a fight.  The reason:  he wasn't spending enough time with her.  And while I do have reservation with this girl and her methods of, er, communicating her emotions, I did see her point and to be honest, I kinda sided with her.  Maybe its something universal between girlfriends.  I may not like her methods, but I empathize.  I am a firm believer that if you commit to a relationship, you better be ready to commit your time as well.  I'm not saying anything like dedicating your entire life, but a significant amount should still be allocated at the very least.  It is also your duty to try and understand and participate in the respective worlds of your gf/bf.  After all, if you don't, then your journey will remain separate.  What would the relationship be for if it wasn't to spend a part of the trip with your significant other?  Again... oh well..."
OWA6N5W,female,24,"For the past years I have always blamed my extreme insecurity on an ex-boyfriend who did nothing but criticize me for the things I’m not.  Being idealistic and foolishly in-love I tried to become everything he wanted me to be but still, I fell short of his expectations.  After all, whitening creams and growth balls can only go so far.  But I realized, over the weekend  trip to attend my cousin’s wedding in Bagio, that my insecurity has deeper roots – my family.  All my life I have lived under the shadow of several cousins.  One was the valedictorian beauty queen who later on went to graduate with a double degree from UP with honors.  The other was a pretty and independent nurse who managed to earn P100K a month at age 20 through sales. The other over-achieving cousin was both a model and the regional tennis champ (tennis is the clan sport).  This is not counting the cousins in the States who have either married well or earns more money in a month’s work than an average manager in this country earns in a year.  It also helps that those cousins are sons/daughters of the more “influencial” members of the Clan, having gained such power due to the fact that they are the ones half-supporting the less sterling members back here in the Phils.  So you can imagine how I grew up with my family contemporaries.  I was never complimented at all.  I’m literally saying Never.  It was always someone else who was the pretty one, the smart one, the independent one, the sporty one.  I didn’t even get the polite compliments received by my balik-bayan cousins whenever they arrive for a visit  like, “Gumanda ka!” or “Ang tangkad mo na.”  However, when I lost considerable weight upon entering college, the comments were never-ending “Para ka ng anorexic!” and “Sobrang payat ka na!”.  On the year of my graduation from college, I made the grave mistake of gaining some of the weight I had back.  The comments again found new fire “Kate, ang taba taba mo na!” and “Ano ang nangyari sa iyo?”.  After several years of non-contact with these dangerously tongued family members, I actually started to gain some confidence. I’ve begun to form my own conclusion as my “ideal” weight.  I’ve accepted the fact that I can never spend more than 10 minutes making my face look perfect.  And I’ve made my peace with the hair-dryer, where we both agree to part on friendly terms.  I’ve also learned to see myself as not ugly – not beautiful- but not ugly. I believe that this little piece of maturity lent me enough courage to be what I really want to be – wear what I really want to wear and look the way I really want to look.  I may make fashion disasters every now and then, but I pride myself in being fairly unique.  My trip to Bagio reopened the wounds however.  There I was, dressed up in an expensive gown, made up by an expensive artist, all ready to receive the compliments I had foolishly subconsciously expected to receive only to get another insult.  “You look older than your mom!”.  This at a time when I almost felt beautiful.  Not that my mother isn’t youthful, but, couldn’t they find anything else to say?  Even when I complimented them on their gowns (and thus, in a polite society, they’re expected to compliment you back right?) they mentioned nothing.  While these emotional blows were not intended (I truly believe they are not malicious) and partially cushioned by Alex’s unwavering love and adoration, I can’t help but cry.  Maybe I am wrong.  Maybe I am what they say I am.  And maybe I can never be as great as any of my other cousins.  And maybe I should just get used to that.  Or maybe I should fight back and tell all of them to go to somewhere hot and way south.  Only time will tell whether fury or pain will win out."
OWA6N5W,female,24,"Writing Like There’s No Tomorrow   Its been a long time since I have had the luxury to write a blog, so forgive me if my next few entries will be long… tedious… blabbering….and mostly about me.:)   The Day the World Almost Fell Apart   On August 29, 2003, a thank-god-its-payday-Friday, I was going back to the office from a client along Edsa, when the motorcycle gang claimed me as their latest victim.  What I lost was my purse that contained P120 bucks and everything else that seemed to connect me to the rest of the world.  This included my 5 year old cell phone (that had all my phone numbers, including my parents), my PRC card (it’s the only thing that could say without a doubt that yes, I am a CPA!), my first and only credit card (that had my picture), loads of client calling cards, my timezone card and my vanity kit (defined as toothbrush, toothpaste and floss).  The sad part of the story is that except for the bag, which was my most recent purchase, none of the items were worth anything… in fact, my fully depreciated phone even had a security pin which the Thief would have to get unblocked to actually use.  But they were important to me because of what they represent in my life.  Which was the  rest of the world .  I was too shocked to panic for the first few moments.  Only later did I realize how lucky I was that, for the first time in a long time, I was commuting with someone.  With my purse gone, I had no money nor the means to contact anyone.  At all.  Hence, my buddy Matt was one helluva miracle in itself.  However, once shock subsided, I began to feel… alone.  Literally.  After calling my credit card company and ATM and doing all the things a practical accountant would do in this kind of situation, I found myself bursting into tears.  For the simple reason that I could not contact anyone of import…. urlLink Alex  was in UP doing a seminar and would only have his cell phone,  urlLink Jay  was, thank God, at home, but I couldn’t remember his house number after years of not using it,  urlLink Lenard  was also at work, and my mother was at the gym.  It was a terrifying thought that I could not find anyone to talk to.  Of course, my officemates and managers did all that they could to console me.  And since I am from an auditing firm, obviously, the first thing they did was fix my cash flow problem.  I was robbed at 3 pm, which meant withdrawing directly from the bank was out of the question since it was after banking hours.  So my managers gave me P3k in cash while I await my new ATM.  My house keys were in my purse as well, so our head of security immediately contacted a locksmith so that we could change house locks.  And of course, the partners of the firm all reminded me, nicely of course, to block my credit card.  But that wasn’t what I really needed.  In the end, I finally, through desperation, remembered Jay’s home number and for the first time, got to actually talk to his mom (scary, really).  Through him, I was able to get the rest of my friends contact numbers. My mom was already informed as she had contacted the house before leaving the gym.  And so I was more or less, linked up again with the people whom I consider important.  The last nasty thing I had to do was go to the police station in Mandaluyong to file a police report (for my lost driver’s license).  It ended up being the worst part of my day.  I had no cell phone and Alex, whom I had contacted prior to going there, did not exactly sound confident of finding the place.  I had arrived in the police station at 5:00 pm and finished by around 6:30 pm (amazing how long it takes to type one sheet of paper), but it was only P7:30 pm when Alex was able to find me, with my pitiful brown envelope and useless P500 peso bills (I had no barya to use in the payphone), about to have a nervous breakdown. By then, I had the stench only a Filipino police station can render to bare skin, had a million mosquito bites and on the fringe of paranoia at the thought of never being able to get out of that place.  But eventually, all bad days end.  And I was finally picked up.  Brought home where Jay and Lenard were waiting with pizza and drinks.  After my shower, we played Puerto Rico and had lots of fun being Governador of our own lands.  My last thought for that day was, what great friends I had.  After all I’ve been through, the world seemed to right itself after all.  So to all of you buddies, thanks a million for being there for me when I needed the most."
OWA6N5W,female,24,"Friday Night Gaming   Last Friday was a new gaming experience for me. It was my first time to, uh, play with Dean and Nikki (no dirty innuendo intended). And it was also my first time to play an RPG without any stats whatsoever.  Truth be told, I had my doubts.  Being an auditor trained me that everything has boundaries.  And as a gamer, I've been trained that stats are the boundaries you set so that your players don't end up becoming demi-gods.  But despite my hesitancy, the initiation to a narrativist style of gaming was successful and more importantly fun.  Dean described a fascinating world where I was almost tempted to just not play a character and just ask him to continue the story-telling.  That was how wonderful the setting was.  Of course, the success of the story could also be attributed to having such wonderful gamers playing as well.  Alex was true to form to his bookish/geekish noble and Nikki role-played her assertive dilettante (sort of) character so well that both roles became alive, and not merely a stereotype.  Now I can't wait to know what happens next in the story.  Thanks for a wonderful game Dean!"

OWA6N5W,female,24,"Defeated Again   Today is qualifying as a Bad Day.  I wouldn't say its on my top ten Bad Days, but due to the fact that today symbolizes a new year in almost a third of the world's culture, I can't help but feel a bit put out.  It started with my shining accomplishment yesterday:  the tax computation.  And yes, as my paranoid fears have warned me, there were several glaring mistakes I saw in harsh morning-after-I've-drunk-coffee light.  I spent the entire morning crunching numbers beside my manager, who, after 4 hours, gave up on it as well.  He just told me we'll let the client do the explaining.  I can't help but feel... frustrated.  On the good side, I wasn't exactly alone and stupid for not figuring stuff out.  On the bad side, I feel strangely unaccomplished.  Then, its my shoes.  MY 2 week old shoes gave up on me shortly after lunch.  The heel won't hold and now I feel like I'm walking on a tight rope.  I'm seriously tempted to buy a new pair, if it weren't for a shortage of cash.  Actually, to be honest, I'm not really short in cash as much as I hate buying something that I hadn't budgeted for, but that's for another blog.  Managers following up deadlines would be the next near disaster.  I hate it when managers follow up stuff I know they won't review ANYWAY.  Its as if they just want to annoy you and deprive you of time.  I hate it more when the same manager would go straight to the staff and declare to the said staff that they don't have to finish certain things -- kung ano lang kaya.  And then go back to the in-charge asking the said items to be accomplished.  While I don't consider myself a slave driver, I have fairly high expectations of staff competencies and the act of the manager going straight to the staff undermines my authority as well as makes me look like a slave driver.  When I'm not.  And now, he wants me to finish the things the staff wasn't able to finish. Damn him.  Before I explode into a million irritated pieces I'll shut up and go to work.  After all, every freakin journey begins with a single step...in my current state of mind, it would most likely be a stomp."

GT7UX9X,male,34,"Last night I got a call unexpectedly from TomGost, who told me he was headed out to see a Rush tribute band. A Rush tribute band?  I’ve never in my life paid good money to go listen to a tribute band. I hear there are some good ones out there, but the concept always seemed a little cheesy. I mean, how could self-respecting musicians find themselves in the position to do this? I mean, hey, I’ve been obsessed with certain bands in my life, but that was when I was a teenager, and teenagers don’t tour the country playing clubs night after night. Then again, it was a RUSH tribute band! Rush is only 3 guys……3 guys who are masters of their trades. 3 virtuosos. I figured that if someone is going to be in a Rush tribute band, the following rules must apply:  1.	if you’re the drummer, you have to be one of the best drummers in the world 2.	if you’re the bass player, you have to be a super-good bass player who can stop playing bass               and start playing the keyboards without ever skipping a beat, AND you have to have a painfully              high singing voice 3.	If you’re the guitar player, well, then you just better kick tons of ass, because if you don’t, then              you’re gonna ruin the whole thing.  So anyways, I decided to go, and it was pretty damn good. They had a great set list, they were good musicians, and they kicked some butt on the songs that really mattered. The highlights of the night were Tom Sawyer, Xanadu, YYZ, Subdivisions, La Villa Strangiato, Red Barchetta, Overture, Jacobs Ladder, Freewill, and The Spirit of Radio. Their were some stanky low points too, but who cares..... I had fun, and so did they.. I checked out  urlLink their website   this morning, and it looks like they just play a couple shows every few months, so this is just a hobby. They do it just because they like it. That being said, I realized my pre-conceived rules were overblown and incorrect. Here are the only real rules for being in a Rush tribute band:  1.	You had to spend countless hours playing Rush songs over and over again when you were a kid. 2.	You must have lots of equipment. 3.	You have to love Rush 4.	You have to forget about money or chicks, because you won’t get either in a Rush cover band."

77G511Q,female,23,"Konnichiwa!  I have been receiving a lot of emails recently in regards to my decision to leave Japan and where I am going to go from here.  Basically, I am not quite sure just yet.  I realized that another 18 months here in Japan would not allow me to experience the things I am looking for or hoping to accomplish at this stage of my life.  While the past six months have provided me with loads of first-time experiences and amazing discoveries about myself, the culture here in Japan, and those around me, I don`t believe that the situation I am in will enable me to be happy and satisfied for as long as agreeing to recontract would require.  I have now read loads of books ranging from Japanese fiction to theories of evolution, and even recently a book about becoming evil and what leads ordinary people to commit genocide.  I am continuing to study Japanese and my Tuesday night class has proven to be somewhat beneficial in that I am guaranteed a little structure.  Basically, I am reading and learning about anything I can get my hands on which is leading me to believe that at some point in the near future I will probably return to school for either a law degree or my masters.  Although this doesn't really provide you with a clear picture of where I will be or what I will be doing over the upcoming year, hopefully it will at least explain (although probably not very clearly) why I am leaving this experience in search of another new opportunity.   Another quick plea...if you have any contacts anywhere in the world that you think might provide me with an opportunity to experience something new and learn a lot in the process please feel free to let me know."
77G511Q,female,23,"It`s All About Change!       As I have mentioned in previous posts, March is primarily a transitional stage with no work and hours of keeping yourself occupied with random self-made tasks.  Well, March also marks a change...A BIG ONE!    Teachers here in Japan basically all have temporary positions at any randomly assigned school (or so it seems).  Then, after 4 years (average), teachers are shuffled and without fail, all the ones you really like are sent to another school somewhere in the prefecture.  So basically every year in April, new teachers arrive attempting to fill the places of those sent elsewhere in March.  At school today we had to hear the farewell speeches of 11 teachers/office people being sent away and now the staff room is quite lively with teachers moving all of their stuff to newly assigned desks in the staff room.  Luckily the ALT's don`t move.      I must say that as the ALT, you hear the list of people leaving and it`s quite a shock when all of the people who have really helped you are victims of the switch.  Unfortunately as well, the teachers you were hoping would be moved are still going to be here.  Anyway, tonight both of my schools are having their farewell parties (sobetsukai).  While I have spent the day at my base school (Teizan), tonight I will be going to the party for the boys school.       Without a doubt tonight will definitely prove to be a little bitter sweet."
77G511Q,female,23,"I will be moving out of my apartment in a little over two weeks and less than a full week later my successor will be moving in.  I must say that one of the things that made moving in so easy was moving into an already furnished apartment.  While I spent a decent some of money buying everything from my predecessor, I quickly realized that it was money well spent.  My successor might in fact have a pretty rough start.  While I offered to sell him everything for a very reasonable price, he wanted to do things on his terms.  Unfortunately, he isn't exactly in a position to make demands and while I was willing to negotiate prices and payment options, I was not willing to give most of my things away for nothing.  So what does that mean?!?!?  I have now advertised everything to current jets who are staying another year.  Over the next two weeks I will be having an everything must go sale and when my successor arrives in 3 weeks, it appears he will be arriving to an empty apartment.  In less than 24 hours requests for information and availability for all major furniture and appliances have been made.  While I was really trying to help the new guy out and make things easy for both of us, I am now just trying to clear everything out.  I really wonder what it will be like to arrive in a foreign country and finally make it to your apartment only to realize that there is no fridge, no washing machine, no microwave, no furniture...I can't imagine it would make for a very warm welcoming."
77G511Q,female,23,"On the Job Front!       Well, over the past couple weeks I have been receiving emails from all over Europe.  Emails have come from Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the U.K., Sweden, Norway, and Finland.  Why you might ask?!?!?!    Basically, I have now decided that from Japan I hope to move to Europe for maybe 6 months and see as much as I can in that time period.  While the Jet Program does pay very well, I have to have some type of income or some way of saving money to afford the travelling.  Currently I am receiving emails from all types of families with children of all ages asking for and offering different things.  Right now my top choice is a family that goes back and forth between Spain and Switzerland.  They have a live-in babysitter and live in domestic-help so all they would want me to do is help the kids with English when they are not in school, hang out with them, and drive them places.  In exchange I would receive free room and board, a monthly stipend, access to their car, would get to travel with them for free, and experience a little bit of life in Europe.  Not too bad I suppose...   I will definitely keep you updated as I narrow my search and ultimately determine where I will be heading next.  Don`t worry...I will definitely return to the US for a few weeks before I relocate abroad!"
77G511Q,female,23,"Okay, so this is not what you are thinking...this past Saturday I went to a soccer practice and was offered a ride to the field (about an hour north in Tajiri) by Dave.  Naturally, Dave arrived a bit late with Robin in the front seat. The two of them together are definitely good for a bunch of laughs.  The ride home was definitely quite a fun disaster of a trip.  Rob, another Shiogama resident, joined us for the return trip.  Dave decided that there had to be a shorter route home than the one we took to Tajiri.  Unfortunately, we were in the inaka (rural japan) and were seemingly driving in circles in the middle of rice fields.  We stopped to check the map, stopped to ask directions a few times, and basically did everything imaginable to try and find a particular road.  Robin was throwing raisins at Dave's head claiming that whatever way the raisins bounced off was the direction we should head.  Rob claimed that Dave and Robins maturity level drops about 10 years when they are together and Robin countered that by saying that Robs increases by about 20 and acts like their dad.  I just laughed.  Finally, in the middle of a rice field there was a random sign that had the kanji (chinese characters) for Shiogama.  We decided to follow the sign and after going down a narrow road, we reached the end and were faced with deciding right or left with not another sign in sight.  Honestly, who designed this country without road signs anywhere except big cities?!?!?!? We ended up finding our way, ran into two more Jets on the side of the road in kashimadai who we stopped to talk to for 30 minutes, and eventually I arrived at Steph's an hour late for our dinner/movie night.  She and Kristel were starving and had already taken care of ordering food so 10 minutes after I arrived we were enjoying dinner and watching several episodes of  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .  All in all a pretty eventful day!"
77G511Q,female,23,"Just wanted to let you know that while I skipped to my thoughts in narita, when I get back to the U.S. I will be posting about the rest of the event in my last week.  Internet is too expensive in the airport to do much more...gomen! (sorry)"
77G511Q,female,23,Well everybody...it is official.  My ticket to return to the U.S. is booked and paid for.  I will be flying into Chicago and I plan to stay for a few days and will then continue on my journey home.  I can't believe I will be returning to the U.S. after about 353 days in Asia.  I have heard a lot of talk about reverse culture shock recently but right now I am just excited to be heading home!
77G511Q,female,23,"Well, on Saturday night I had my Teizan farewell enkai in Sendai.  I wasn't all that thrilled about having to attend but in many ways it was a good night. It provided me with a sense of closure about my year at Teizan and also enabled me to realize that in one week, my experience at this school will be over.  My supervisor didn't come, the only english teacher sitting at my table was the night school one who works with Dave (the two others I teach with said they can't speak English), and both the principal and vice principal made speeches saying that I also enjoyed working at Shiogama Girls School.  Yes, you read that correctly.  They both made speeches saying my visit school was the girls school when in fact I have always worked at Shiogama Boys. I am sure you now get a sense of how well they know me.  Anyway, after delivering a speech in Japanese and 2 hours of being genki (cheerful), the enkai ended and I had survived my final Teizan enkai.  That was the last of my school enkais hosted by both schools and now my nights will be occupied by the closer friends I have made during my year in Japan."
77G511Q,female,23,"It's just another manic monday!  Actually, things here at school are incredibly quiet.  No classes, no students, no work...basically that leaves me searching the internet, reading, or watching the clock anxiously awaiting the end of the day.  Anyway, last week I was one of the guest ALT`s at the Izumi High School Winter English Camp.  So here is a brief overview of my experiences at the camp.   Most importantly, it was a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from the hours I ordinarily would have spent sitting at school doing absolutely nothing.  6 of the 7 other ALT's at the camp were loads of fun and it was definitely an incredible group they threw together.  Each of us was assigned a group of 10 students (I was group B) and the camp consisted of speech presentations, culture quizes, language classes(I taught Finnish), song performances, and drama productions.  Initially I thought I was given the Best group (Group B!) but early on I learned that the B stood for Bad group.   Some of my students were caught buying beers from the vending machines (yes there are beer vending machines everywhere in this country), one was kicked out for smoking, 7 skipped the drama practices,  another likes to become sick when it is convenient and she also went home, 3 skipped the culture quiz activites....you get the idea!  Nonetheless, overall it was a lot of fun but I know that if I had been given any of the 7 other groups my experience at the camp would have been even better and more enjoyable!  I am destined to have the trouble students throughout my stay in Japan.     Anyway, that is a brief overview of my days at winter camp.  I hope all of you are doing well and that things are starting to warm up whereever you are in the world."
77G511Q,female,23,"I thought I knew hot but this is ridiculous!!!  So I grew up in heat and humidity but this stuff is just gross.  By the time I get to school I am hot and sticky and no relief kicks in when you enter the building.  All day long I seem to work in a sweat box with occasional relief when I catch a breeze coming in through an open window.  I just don't get it!  While we have been spared the torrential downpours of the rainy season to some extent, Japan should be well aware of what is necessary to fight this stuff. I can't even begin to imagine what those down south are experiencing.  Basically, in the summer we sweat all day long and in the winter we freeze.  I just learned the other day that Miyagi Prefecture is the coldest place in Japan indoors. Perhaps because north of us people were smart enough to install central heating.  I still most definitely preferred winter.  Oh well...in a couple of weeks I will be on a plane and my friends here in Japan can only hope that my plane flying overhead will generate a nice little breeze!!!"

The Sound of Silence is a haunting song. The voices... the music... imagine yourself walking down a dark street, alone, with nothing but the sound of the leaves rustling on the sidewalk in the wind. The curtains of the houses are drawn, the faint light of candlelight causing shadows to dance as if they had a life of their own. The dim light of the streetlamps barely make a break through the blackness of the moonless night. Not a single soul appears in the street... and you realize that you are truly alone in this cold, empty world.  I'm pretty sure I just ripped that off from a writer somewhere. If you figure out who, let me know, because I know, fer sure, that I don't have that book. LOL. Aiite then, time to get ready for my family gathering thing for my Canadian cousin. Shit.

I am too damn lazy to go poking my eyes today. Maybe I'll stop by Barnes and Nobles and see if they have any new books I would care to read.

Not a damn thing happened in that entire time. I think.   Let's recap, shall we?   Sunday :  I went to my friends' place in Irvine and chilled. Then I went to Newport Beach and chilled. That night, the winds started.  Monday :  I went to work. The winds kept me up for a long time and kept waking me up once I went to sleep. I was very cranky that day at work and I snapped at just about anyone who happened to be unfortunate enough to irritate me that day.  Tuesday :  I went to work, went home, and then... stayed there. Wednesday:  See Tuesday. Well, I worked out first. Then I went home and stayed there.  Thursday :  I went to work, then went shopping, then went home, where I slept for 2 hours. I then woke up and went down to Irvine and kicked it with my friends. DDR is crazy now. How the hell are people supposed to move like that?  Friday :  I went to work, then shopping AGAIN, then went home. After wasting time online for a while, I went down to Irvine and chilled there until 1130pm, at which point left because everyone wanted to go clubbing at The Shark Club. LOL. What a waste of money.  Which brings us to today. And surprise, surprise. Here I am, sitting once again in front of my computer, doing absolutely nothing.  *YAWN*  Fock this. I'm sleeping. Aiite, I'm out.

Either they swing the opposite direction or they like to chill with those of their own. Like yesterday, for instance. I was American Eagle down in downtown SF and I passed by these two people: a guy and a girl. It LOOKED like they were together, but the guy talked and looked kinda iffy. IONO. And I've been calling a lot of people, particularly guys, gay lately (i.e. ""you're so gay!"" when the other person acts like a girl about things like clothes). LOL. I'm not hinting at anyone in particularly, reeeeeeeeaaaaally. *wide-eyed angelic smile* So, yeah. I kinda want to go do more shopping, but I think that I've spent way too much money. Oh, well. A girl can never get too much shopping in. HAHA.   My legs hurt. I did A LOT of walking yesterday. My sister's friend's aunt's place is in this area called North Beach and we walked all the way through Chinatown to Union Square, which was cool. I bought a seal stamp for myself and my brother in Chinatown and clothes down at the mall near Union Square. And then last night, when I slept, I was sitting in the chair, sideways, and slept. My neck hurts somewhat, but that's the price that I'm willing to pay for my vacation up here in San Francisco.  I'm hungry right now and we're waiting for Alan to hurry his slow ass up and get here.

Not much new is happening, other than... well, I'm working a lot. Fock.  On another note ~ I think I'm suffering from nostalgia. I saw the ex the other night. Don't get me wrong. It's not like...

Unless I get cancelled on... AGAIN. FUQ SHIT.  Anyway, not much ranting and raving today. Just what I just said. Oh, and Rain at the Palms in Las Vegas is pretty cool (after I had two Red Bull and Vodkas). I think I'm just really too conscious of how I present myself to others when I'm sober. That just sucks. Especially when you finally meet a cute guy at the end of the night, only to have your moment ruined when another guy comes up and puts his hand on your shoulder and asks if you're ready to eat yet (and you're SOOOOO not into that one).

HAH... ah, wells... it's all good. I didn't get much this year, but that's okay. I didn't really want much this year, anyway, except for like maybe a new Z in the garage, some money, and my lobster. But, alas, I didn't get what I really wanted. I did, however, get some cute jammies from Travis, a funny Far Side desk calendar from Mimi, and a gift card to Express from Ben. Yes! Express, here I come!  In other news, I met up with this guy who found me on FAP. That was an interesting experience, considering I dragged Mimi and Steve with me and every place was closed on Christmas Eve. HAHA... the kicker was when this white Accord kept driving around and finally pulled into the parking lot. Supposedly, the guys in the car were starting to come out, so the guy I met up with told me to get in the car. I did as I was told... and then hightailed it outta there. LOL. IONO... guys are confusing. I think right now, all I want is someone to have fun with... nothing serious... I mean, if that happens in the future, I'm pretty sure I won't mind, but I'm not looking for anything committed right now. I think it's because I'm still hella cautious and wary, thanks to my experience with David. I've learned that to wear your heart on your sleeve can be rather devastating in the end, if it happens that things don't work out the way that you want. That's not to say I've become a bitter bitch about it, but I'm definitely more... hesitant. Getting hurt like that can do something to a person. Plus, I'm so damn sarcastic anyway, it only added to my dry humor and cynicism. HAH...

Since it opened on Easter this year, I have been wanting to go in there.    urlLink     urlLink    Not knowing what time it started and having already slept in until almost 9:00, I missed the early service.  I could also not attend the late service, because Wayne would be coming back and we didn't have time.  Instead, I attended an interesting adult lecture class on Islam - but clearly from the Christian perspective.  It's been a while since I've been to church, and even longer since I've been to one that I liked.   This church was nice, and the people seemed friendly.  On the way out, even though I knew I could not stay, I walked through the main worhip hall of the new church and grabbed a program.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I saw and heard the organ that they had talked about on the web site; it consumed the entire front wall.  There were stained glass windows everywhere.  I made it a point to come back next week and bring Wayne as soon as he was done with training.   One reason I haven't found a church yet is because I have a serious bias about church singing.  I know that some singing is inevitable, and that it's intended to praise God; I understand all of that.  I just don't like to sing.  I especially don't like the Christian-rock style singing that they have in some contemporary services.  Not my style.  The church I went to growing up, when we went, was Catholic.  Given that the Episcopals are supposed to be Catholic-Lite, I think I will be able to identify with their worship service.   After Church I went back to Wayne's, where I waited 15 minutes outside the gate without a remote and not knowing the new code.  Since I had asked Wayne a week ago to find out the new code or get me a clicker, I greeted him in a bad mood when he came home just after me.  Even though I felt I had a right to be annoyed, I immediately regretted being grumpy with him.  I'm still learning when to pick and choose my battles."
FVLXYZT,female,23,"urlLink    This is a picture of the damage to the house behind me that was hit by lightning on Tuesday.  Sadly, there's nothing they could have done to prevent this.  It was also very, very close to my house and I do recognize that it could have been me.    urlLink"
FVLXYZT,female,23,"My office's ""backyard"" is home to the largest  urlLink Urban Wildscape  in Texas.  My cube window looks out onto it, and the cafeteria is across the pond and over the wooden bridge.  It's nice to have something so serene so close to the office.  The best part is that it's full of animals.  There are enormous catfish filling the pond, which are routinely fed every day at lunch by people who just want to see them get riled up.  One lonely duck and a couple of turtles occasionally compete with them for ""people food.""    Recently, we got some new residents to the Wildscape.  I was on my daily morning coffee walk to the cafe for a grande Macadamia Nut blend, and a lady was leaning over the railing of the walkway offering bread to a cute little raccoon.  I hadn't ever seen one in person that wasn't roadkill, so I stopped and watched.  She (the raccoon) was definitely a nursing mother by the looks of her.  She was very gentle and sweet with her human waitress.  I was told that she had four or five babies typically in tow.  By lunchtime that day, Building Services had posted signs  everywhere  instructing people not to feed the raccoons.  Apparently they can become rabid and bite people, but I don't see it.             This morning a strange thing happened.  I was walking to get a Diet Dr. Pepper and I saw a big huge bird sitting outside the window.  When I got closer, I could see that he was a peacock.  A peacock!  How do these animals just show up in the middle of a city?  I notice that there aren't any signs saying ""Don't Feed the Peacock.""  If I can get him close enough, I'm going to do it.  I have plenty of  urlLink Zone Perfect bars  left over in my desk drawer.  I wonder if the peacock likes Fudge Graham."
FVLXYZT,female,23,"In an effort to gain more exposure, the liberals are now going after talk radio.  This is because they claim that the conservatives have captured the media.  ... except, or course, for CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, Hollywood, New York Times, AP...

Not exactly  urlLink the plan  for  urlLink Air America  radio.  Al Franken and Jeanine Garofolo are headlining this show.

FVLXYZT,female,23,"I just read Monica's response to Bill Clinton's new book ""My Life"".  She is upset about the way that Clinton described their affair.  She then told the British Press that ""Clinton's book made her feel ""like an insignificant piece of dirt."" Well when you are having an affair with a married man, you often feel like a piece of dirt.    Maybe the new publicity will give her a forum, but a forum for what, whining?  Read for yourself and see what you think.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5295636/?GT1=3584  I try not to be judgmental.  I know that people make mistakes, and that although an affair is a bad thing to do, it does not make you a horrible person.  Bill Clinton did not ""ruin"" Monica's life.  Monica was not forced into the affair.  Any account of this affair will not show Ms. Lewinsky's good qualities.  In her defense, an affair with a man that powerful might be difficult to resist.    I hope that this ugly wrinkle in our history one day goes away, but in the meantime, take responsibility.  Say I did a bad thing and then ""Suck it up""  Oh, I guess she already did!!!"
FVLXYZT,female,23,"Ouch!   My arm has finally been twisted enough to break into the world of bloggers.  I don't see myself posting enough to maintain a fan base of happy, adoring fans but Angie has been kind enough to grant me priviledges here.     Most of my posts will probably center around the trials and tribulations of dating someone new.  I've been seeing him an entire month and in Annaville, that's about 3 weeks too long.  But to make an attempt at keeping happy, adoring fans I'll keep him around a while longer to entertain y'all.     Be prepared for the first three posts that will be made shortly.  It's a cut and paste from some e-mails that went out regarding the first month with the aforementioned dude-de-jour.   I blew a couple of people away with my candor in post #2, so I'll try to keep comments more PG in future posts.  Must keep the fans happy and adoring......     Wahoo!

FVLXYZT,female,23,"Since I had coffee late tonight, I can't sleep very well.  I went through about half a dozen iterations of clicking ""some random blog"" on my nav bar when I realized that although there are hundreds of thousands of blogs on the 'net, most of them (a) don't have nearly as much attention paid to detail or (b) are just not meant for my type of audience.   For example, this is the last one I read.  It was disheartening enough to make me give up for the night.  I do believe that it's based loosely on English, but that's about all I can tell.  Are these my blogging peers?       in sch now... in a happy mood. hahah yesterday played bball at bukit merah. quite fun sia... hahah played rat and horse... hahaha .... sch sucks manz.,... nothing to do now hahahahhah well nothing to blog now ... ciaoz"

FVLXYZT,female,23,"Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  urlLink met yesterday  with the Senate, as we all heard in our newspapers, TV, and radio.  That is, if you read/watch them.  There were protesters in there calling for him to resign.  What for?  I thought he did a perfect job of defending himself and taking responsibility for something that there's no way he could have ever been truly responsible for.  Some of his opponents pointedly asked if he thought that it would show that the U.S. is serious about the scandal and making sure it stopped.  He admitted that it may, but I disagree.      On the NPR version, you could hear some students in the background chanting something about Rumsfeld resigning.  Where do they find these students?  The ones I know either can't be bothered by politics or they have enough sense not to do something stupid like that.  What about American contractors getting burned alive and hung from bridges?  What about Halliburton employees and soldiers being held hostage on the other side of the world?  I'm hardly incensed by some pictures of naked Iraqis.  These are people who are in the prisons for doing something against our country.  They tried (or succeeded) to kill Americans.  They're people who know what real torture is, and this is not it."

E1Q0PBN,female,26,"Things have been good so far. We're working together...building together. Measuring diet coke and aluminum cans. My life is one big museum art project. And my vocabulary has been reduced to that of a guest speaker at a museum educator's seminar. Which I learned today I will be attending the last 2 weeks of September.  So this will be one of my last posts before my trip. While I am not working tomorrow, I have a zillion things to do such as laundry, packing, picking up some extra items, a quick meeting at the Museum to make sure I have everything covered, etc.  I am going to a screening tomorrow evening for Cinderalla Story. Laugh at me all you want but I am very excited. I love Jennifer Coolidge and well, I am in the mood for a fluffy preteen flick.

E1Q0PBN,female,26,"I was coughing so bad yesterday that I made a trip to the real life ER. I feel the need to specify 'real life' because I do so much commentary on NBC's ER. Boy oh boy oh boy. First of all, the good news. I have neither tuberculosis, consumption, cholera, scarlet fever, the plauge, or any other Jane Austen disease one might fantasize about whilst on one's death bed. My prognosis is acute bronchontis, so I will not be staging any martry-like death scenes a la Beth in Little Women. The ER at Beth Isreal was quite an experience and I did in fact feel like I was on the show. My ER doctor was very attractive and had even visited CMOM a few times (with his 3 year old daughter). I am in a relationship, plus I was woozy and sick but if any of my single friends happen to find themselves in the Beth Isreal ER ask for Dr. Jason Baumgarten and check and see if he has a wedding ring. He looks like Noah Wyle and has a perfect bedside manner. Maybe I just watch too much ER on tv. Anyway, I spent a while in triage, partly reading and partly watching the people who came in who were clearly sicker than I. Nothing beat the drug addict who shed his gown and ran around streaking the entire waiting area. They then put me in the 'coughing' section, amongst others with my symptoms. Did some more reading until it was time for my chest x-ray where I was led to what I refer to as the 'scary place'...the place where people are in beds and very sick and the gun shots wounds to the heads and heart attacks came rolling in. This was no fun at all. I got the x-rays done, got some antibiotics and was home in time to watch ER on tv. Needless to say, I slept until noon today and am STILL sick.   Happiness is a warm Lhasa Apsa. Zoey has been such a good medicine pet."
E1Q0PBN,female,26,"A few years ago I was out with Jackie Zeman of ABC's General Hospital, her husband, and some friends and I was complaining about my boyfriend at the time and how we always fought about the small stuff. My ex (who I will refer to henceforce as SB...these are not his initials but some of you may know what this moniker means) and I constantly had full on oscar award winning arguments about the most trivial things -- who's college experience was more competitive, where we would go for dinner, whether or not we agreed upon a movie and who was right. It was all very silly. Often we would argue about more pressing issues - SB was a young republican and Ayn Rand made him as happy as Homer with a beer and a donut. That being said, I asked Jackie how she and her hubby had kept up such an amazing marriage for so many years. She said whenever she or her husband got too dramatic and began to bitch about the small stuff they simply told each other to 'put a cork in the whine' and then they disolved into laughter. I thought this was funny at the time but I now I can see how this is significant...on many levels.  2nd day of summer classes today and more new students. I hope it goes as well as yesterday.

E1Q0PBN,female,26,"Sometimes a girl feels like seeing a natural disaster movie. After stuffing ourselves at an Italian restaurant, my friend and I went to see a very late showing of 'The Day After Tomorrow', or alternately, the Day After I Decided to Shoot Myself In the Face For Seeing A Natural Disater Film. I remember now why I usually don't like these types of films. Let me tell you, this ain't no 'Ice Storm'. Although Elijah Wood would have been a much more fitting casting choice than Jake Gyllanhaal. Global Warming strikes and oddly enough it has led to a cooling trend. Quick Americans! Flee South! Get your asses to Mexico! Ice storms are a comin'! The main characters cannot flee, of course. The 'son' (Gylanhaal) needs to stay in Manhattan to first woo his teenage sweetheart and then save her life. The 'dad' (Dennis Quaid) must walk in snow shoes from Washington DC to save him. And the 'mom' (Sela Ward) must stay in a hospital because she is an oncologist and has to read Peter Pan to a young chemotherapy patient (don't ask). Jake and his friends find safety in the New York Public Library and guess how they keep warm? That's right! They burn books! Isn't that a great message? And to complicate things, the wolves escape from the Central Park Zoo and give them a chase. Oh, and Jake and his sweetie both get a rare blood infection from wounds they have recieved and need to find penacillin. But no cows fly across the screen a la 'Twister'.  RIP Ronald Reagan.

DULLB90,female,41,"Having recently written of my love for the game Scrabble, it should be no big surprise that a  urlLink news story on the National Scrabble Championship  caught my eye.   ""In the final round, eventual champion Trey Wright played the word ""lez,"" which was on a list of offensive words not allowed during the tournament.   Normally, no word is off-limits, but because the games were being taped for broadcast on ESPN, certain terms had been deemed inappropriate, including the three-letter slang for lesbian.   ""There are words you just can't show on television,"" Scrabble Association Executive Director John Williams said."" My first thought was ""Well lez isn't  really  even a word, is it?  Isn't it a slang abbreviation?  So I surfed on over to see what  urlLink dictionary.com  had to say about it.  And there I discovered that not only is it a real word, but it is ""offensive slang"" for lesbian and is defined as a  disparaging  term!  Well I ask you.  Who knew?  I've always considered more the way a word is used than the actual word itself to determine if it is disparaging.  Or the tone in which it is said.  While I've never personally been called ""lez"", at least not that I remember, I'm not sure I'd consider it offensive.  So feel free to call me lez, as long as you aren't sneering or tossing tomatoes at the same time.  And I'd just love to play that ""z"" on a triple word score, wouldn't you?  It also offends me a bit that a championship game of Scrabble is limited by a somewhat random list of inappropriate words just because it's going to be televised.  Isn't that where the editing process should take over?  Think of how long the list of eliminated words could be, depending on who compiled it.  Was ""fag"" allowed?  How about ""dildo"" or ""poop"" or ""bitch""?  All perfectly good words I would not hesitate to play in Scrabble if the letters came along and the points earned satisfied me.  I'd love to see the whole list of words eliminated from that tournament.  And I wonder how many points Mr. Wright would have earned with his word ""lez""?  Guess we'll never know.  Now  that's  something to find offensive."
DULLB90,female,41,"Twice a month, sometimes three times, I visit a client in downtown DC.  I like it that I get to go into the city regularly but not so frequently that the commute becomes a drag.  When I drive in, I pay $12 plus a $1 tip to the attendant for parking.  My garage of choice is located in an alley.  The folks there are very nice and take good care of my car (hell, they ought to for the exorbitant price charged for few hours parking!).  Despite the fact I park there infrequently, the attendants always remember my car.  They see me coming and race off to retrieve it for me.  How the hell do they remember what kind of car I drive?  Kinda freaks me out, but in a good way.  The alley itself is an interesting microcosm of city life.  There are dumpsters that occasionally smell bad.  I'm not sure it could officially qualify as a city alley without the dumpsters.  I often have to weave in and around delivery trucks as I walk.  There is a Subway sandwich shop that vents into the alley and in the morning I can often smell the bread baking.  Yum.  Interesting dichotomy between the dumpster smell and the scent of the bread.  This past winter, there was a homeless fellow living in one of the many dingy back entrances to the surrounding buildings.  He had quite an assortment of possessions including a bicycle.  While I was waiting for my car one afternoon, I watched him settle in and pull a large piece of cardboard over the entrance.  Cozy enough I guess but not a place I'd like to spend a cold winter night.  I saw him on several visits and then he was gone.    Sometimes I take the subway instead of driving.  There are good and bad parts of a public transportation commute, but I've gotten it down to a science that eliminates much of the bad.  Parking at the station can be a challenge.  The best spots are reserved for carpools or folks who purchase parking passes.  If I time my arrival after 9:30 a.m. when the restrictions on those spaces lift, I can get a decent spot in the garage.  I also avoid paying the rush hour premium fare.  All hail flex time?  One of my favorite parts of riding the Metro is that I get to read uninterrupted.  I'm one of those commuters who buries her nose in a book and doesn't put it down until she reaches street level again.  I take that back.  I do look up during one part of the ride:  when the train leaves the Pentagon station (and conversely L'Enfant Plaza on the trip home) and emerges into daylight to cross the Potomac River.  I sit there grinning like an idiot surveying the various cityscapes I can see from the bridge.  I like the Rosslyn skyline and the pair of towering buildings that used to be the USA Today buildings.  One was still under construction when I worked in Rosslyn way back when.  I don't know what they are called now.  And there is Washington, DC:  the monuments, all the construction cranes and such, the cherry trees stretching along to Haines Point (breathtaking in spring), and, of course, the river itself.  Being borderline superstitious and more than a little obsessive-compulsive about some things, I have a routine that must be observed.  It is imperative to be watching when the Jefferson Memorial lines up in front of the Washington Monument just before the train heads back underground (or conversely just as it emerges on the trip home).  It's almost phallic when they are fully aligned.  No, check that.  It  is  phallic.  The one time I was too absorbed in my book (damn but that Robin Hobb can weave a tale!) to look up, my book disappeared before I got home.  I lost the goddamn thing!  Still don't know what happened to it, it was just gone.  But now I am quite careful to take the time to pay attention to the sights when crossing the bridge and have not lost a book since.  The train bridge runs parallel to the 14th Street bridge.  I will always remember the winter a plane crashed into that bridge during a massive snow storm and the adventure I had getting home from my job in Rosslyn that night.  On one commute this past winter, there was a chatty tourist seated next to me on the inbound train.  When I looked up and smiled my goofy grin at the ice-covered vista of the river, she asked me if it froze often.  I replied yes, every winter, and blurted out how beautiful it looked to me.  She nodded, seeming to agree."
DULLB90,female,41,"Yes, Virginia, there  are  such things as tumbleweeds. And one tried to take my life this morning.   It may sound fantastical. Maybe even hard to believe. But in reality, tumbleweeds are an integral part of our landscape. Innocuous most of the time, they collect in the corners and under the furniture and on the stairs and around shoes left out on the floor. Their origins are obvious to those of us in the know. They are not particularly particular about where they choose to rest. Wendy gets busy once or twice a week and sweeps them into great big piles and disposes of them with the dust pan. But sometimes they escape the broom and gracefully float away until they settle in a different resting place. Such is the nature of tumbleweeds, after all.   So back to the attempt on my life. This morning as I descended the stairs, before any caffeine ingestion, still groggy and not quite awake, I was viciously attacked by a rogue tumbleweed! It came out of nowhere doing a realistic imitation of a mutant spider or some other large creepy insectlike creature from the depths of all that is evil. It was lifelike enough that my survival instincts immediately took over and I leapt into the air. As I soared over it, graceful as a gazelle, my eyes scanned frantically to ensure I did not land anywhere near the horrible freak of nature that had somehow found it's way into our abode.  At some point during my flight, I gained enough awareness to realize it wasn't alive at all. It was but a tumbleweed of pet hair daintily wafting on the air currents across the floor during it's journey to a new tumbleweed resting place.   But in that brief moment before my brain caught up with my perception, my life  was  in danger.  But I survived to tell the tale.  Hooray for me!"
DULLB90,female,41,"Out here in the suburbs there are other lesbians, but Wendy and I don't know many.  There is one couple we socialize with on occasion.  I'll come back to them another time because they are interesting.  And they have a friend we have run into several times in unexpected places.  Our veterinarians are two more.  Well one of them for sure, and the other one is missing a grand opportunity if she has not yet realized it.  She probably has.  No confirmation because it's not often that the subject of sexuality comes up during a vet visit.  Gaydar is useful.  And we've met another odd trio of lesbians through Wendy's workplace.  They are involved a quite bizarre love triangle.  Two of them are... well there is just no polite way to say this... scary-bulging-sloppy-sweaty-legs-as-big-around-as-my-waist-and-watermelon-boobies size persons.  Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against overweight folks.  It's just these two are SO enormous that it's noteworthy.  They have great personalities and each is interesting in her own right.  But the quite bizarre love triangle thing gives me the oogies in a big way.  The third banana of that bunch is a regular sized woman: t-shirt, blue jeans, baseball hat wearing short haired stereotypical dyke-type.  I don't know if she shaves her legs, but she might.  She's the one that bounces back and forth between the fatties and plays games with all of their heads and hearts and other body parts that I refuse to even think about.  Oogie factor and all.  Big way.  The woman at the Mobil station, the one who calls everyone 'Hun', is a possibility.  But it's probably just because she reminds me of a friend of an ex of mine.  They could be twin sisters separated at birth.  Or it could be because that friend of an ex of mine also used to work at a Mobil station, albeit a completely different Mobil station in a completely different part of town.  So Wendy and I hang around with our hetero friends of various ages, sizes and personal quirkitudes.  Suburban neighborhoods are rife with heteros in need of token lesbian friends.  We are glad to be of service."
DULLB90,female,41,"Wendy performed a huge service for us yesterday.  I mean huge on the scale of Mount Rushmore huge.  It's that organizational thing, don't ya know?  Wendy is my Mount Rushmore of organization.  We both function so much better when things around us are organized and neat.  But sometimes over time things that started out organized and neat get mucked up and messed up and disarranged and screwy.  This time it was our dresser drawers.  And our closets.  The ones we keep our clothes in, not the closets where we keep all those other things that need to be kept tucked away behind closed doors.  I actually have a dresser drawer now that is completely empty!  How cool is that?  And all my clothes are already neatly stowed in other places!  That drawer is  really  empty.  Like time to go shopping empty.  Mega cool.  Like cold Mountain Dew on a hot summer day cool.  Or like I imagine cold Mountain Dew on a hot summer day cool would be if I chose to drink such things but I typically don't.  But the best thing is when I open the other drawers.  Everything has a place and is in it.  And the closet!  Whee!  Leftover winter clothes hanging out in our every day closet that had not yet made it to the winter clothes closet made their way over there yesterday, kind of like a snake fish moving from one pond to another.  It's a beautiful thing indeed. Envy me.  I know you do.  At least for my dresser drawers."
DULLB90,female,41,"It's 6:30 am.  Well close enough.  My eyes are still a bit blurry despite the shower.  I am fully dressed to the shoes.  Fucking flylady has that phrase stuck in my head.  No, I'm not a follower of the flylady although she does have some concepts that are useful to keep in mind when going about one's daily life.  I'm awake because I'm waiting for the electrician who is evidently a morning person.  Blech.  Blech blech blech to the morning people of the world!  Hooray to the electrician though.  He'll be rewiring the bathroom and installing a ventilation fan.  Phase II of the bathroom update, but that's a subject for a different blog.  I haven't whined once about having to shower downstairs.  Yet.  I have, however, had battles in my head about using the toilet down there.  I saw a spider in that toilet and can't seem to get that out of my head.  It would be useful to have a flush for one's thoughts similar to the flush of a toilet.  Happy day?  You bet."
DULLB90,female,41,"Often during holidays and such, playing games is a part of our family activities. Tradition even.  Beach trips are no exception.  It gets some of our noses out of books and others away from the TV, providing a social medium and bringing out interesting aspects of our characters.  Playing games is fun!  We all like to win of course.  Who doesn't?  Beats the heck out of the alternative.  However I've gotten better over the years at losing.  Because, despite my best efforts, I can't win all the time.  And it's really much less painful to lose when one can be a good sport about it.  Ever since The Boy was a wee lad and through the years as he grew, we played games together quite often.  He tells the story now and again of how, while teaching him to play the board game Risk, I often made him cry.  But I didn't really  make  him cry.  I just didn't  let  him win.  He would have to beat me fair and square.  Which he can now.  Because a good way to learn how to win is by losing.  And I ought to know.  My father taught me how to play chess when I was a little girl.  We made a wager.  When I finally beat him, he'd give me $5.  Financial incentive!  But it took me until I was eighteen years old to collect that $5.  Holy shit.  Either he was a really good chess player or I was a really lousy one.  Or both.  I still have the $5 bill he forked over for that win.  He wrote a congratulatory message on it.  I keep it tucked in my chess board.  Where I do believe it will forever stay tucked.  Sad thing, I'm not sure my father and I have played a game since.  Time sure gets away, doesn't it?  Scrabble is another favorite.  Well one of  my  favorites.  I like to think I'm a good Scrabble player.  There's only one person I can remember beating me consistently:  my step-mother Wanda.  She is an  incredible  Scrabble player.  The key to the game, outside of having a decent vocabulary and being a good speller, is knowing how to play for points.  Not many folks have that down.  Wanda sure does.  I have this ridiculous habit of saving old score sheets and keeping them in the Scrabble box.  Every time we pull it out to play, I can look at those winning scores and be inspired.  I don't save the score sheet when I lose however.  No surprise there, hmmm?  After all, it is  my  Scrabble board.  At the beach this year, we played dominoes quite a bit.  Playing dominoes is highly underrated, in my opinion.  It's not just a game for little old men.  We like to play Mexican Train Dominoes.  It's a rockin' game.  A little luck, a little skill.  And someone who has pulled miles ahead of everyone else can quickly be humbled by one bad round.  There are evidently many rule sets for Mexican Train, depending on what part of the country one is from or what interpretation is applied to the written rules (which are not very clear at all!).  Part of the fun of playing is analyzing the rules.  Over the years, our family has standardized the rule set we use to fit how we like to play.  My mother won every single game of Mexican Train dominoes we played that week.   Every single game .  I was in second place every single game with the exception of one.  Not that I was keeping track or anything.  Yeah right.  There was a score sheet tucked into their dominoes bin from last Thanksgiving.  I had stashed it in there.  The Boy had beaten us all by a wide margin.  Somehow, I get as much satisfaction when he wins as when I do."
DULLB90,female,41,"Wendy and I have survived another family week at the beach. Well, survived is probably not the right word even though we did survive. Enjoyed is closer to the truth. Reveled in is even more accurate.  Our family gathering was held again in  urlLink Rehoboth Beach, Delaware . I believe my folks chose that location due to it being pretty much geographically in the middle of where each family contingent originates. Except for my sister of course, but then there are no beaches geographically central to Arizona, New Jersey and Virginia.  The New Jerseyites spend half their travel time on the Cape May ferry instead of fighting the traffic on Route 50 to cross the terror that is the Bay Bridge. (I know I'm not the only one who finds it terrifying because it's one of those bridges that provides an escort service for fearful drivers. Not that I'd make use of such a service. I'm stubborn and such and a few more terror-induced gray hairs on my head won't even be noticed.)  Wendy and I especially enjoy Rehoboth because it is a gay friendly town.  More than gay friendly.  Rainbow flags are everywhere.  Gay bars and clubs and shops and people abound.  We can walk the boardwalk holding hands when the mood strikes---a real bonus.  It's also a traditional family beach town.  Heteros and homos peacefully co-exist.  It's a beautiful thing.  We were the last group to arrive.  Consequently our room had been pre-selected for us.  For reasons unknown, the early arrivals put Wendy and I at the top of the house in the only room with a private balcony.  Equipped with two chairs and a little table.  Our own personal refuge from the chaos family gatherings can bring.  It's like they knew how much we need our private space.  Excellent.  Oh the stories I shall tell about the dysfunction of our family members!  But in a kind way.  Because it takes all sorts of humans to make up this oddball world in which we live.  Right now I'm going to enjoy being home, making up with our pets for leaving them behind while we cavorted and vacationed.  And I've got to catch up on paperwork and prepare for the week ahead.  It's the first of the month after all and you know what that means for me.  Coming home can be infinitely more satisfying than departing, in my own humble opinion."
DULLB90,female,41,"Is a chore more satisfying if the work is difficult and challenging?  I'm not so sure.  I've found just motivating and actually doing a job can be satisfying whether it's as simple as doing the dishes or, as we have discovered this weekend, as difficult as tiling the bathroom.  So.  My advice.  Just get off your ass and do something.  Be the end result a shining sink or a brand new look for the bathroom.  Just being productive feels good."
U56BGA2,male,17,"Even though I planned to spend today revising Geography, I haven't really done a lot so it's been a bit of a waste. By the time I'd got up, had breakfast, done the washing and so on, it was 11, so I got about an hour of revision in before lunch. I then spent three hours alternating between playing  FIFA Football 2004  and revising Geography. The rest of the day has just been spent sitting around doing not a lot. Oh well, tomorrow is marked down as 'Pure Maths Revision'. The fun.  Work phoned up and asked if I could do Sunday and I said 'no' because I had to do revision. They phoned back again and asked if I could do Bank Holiday Monday (double pay) and I agreed. I'm such a sucker for money, ha. Talking of money, grandma phoned me up this morning and said that she'd deposit some money in my account for my trip to Poland in September, which I thought was nice. I'll be going there for only a week or so, but it's going to cost £350. My parents have put £175 towards it and I have to pay the rest of the money.  My mum also mentioned to me that I ""should take lots of pictures"", to which I responded, ""what, which my invisible camera?"" You see, I have no camera, but plan on buying one for my gap year in autumn 2005. I might just buy a camera this autumn though and face the fact that it'll be out of date by the time I leave for Australasia."
U56BGA2,male,17,"I'm angry.   I was happily typing away on my 5 page document and I clicked 'Save', as you do, just to make sure I didn't lose any of my work. What happens? It turns the whole document into 19 pages of random characters! So I exit the file and perform an 'Open and Repair', which recovers most of the document, but leaves me with about 3 pages to retype. Spurred on by this annoyance, I have promptly backed up my work to my iPod. I can trust Apple."
U56BGA2,male,17,"I spent the whole of today shooting with the school cadets at Bisley, of which most of my time was spent sitting and lying around. I managed not to think about the girl from the party too much, since  Trigger Happy , a brilliant book about videogames had arrived in the post and I read through quite a bit of that. It didn't stop me from developing a curious habit of listening to all the love-themed songs on my iPod though. I've been trying to keep myself busy because if I think about it too much, then my mind just goes into overdrive and I start thinking about it way too much. Tomorrow will be interesting though, since I'll see my mates for the first time since the party. There's a lot of chatting and gossiping to be done.  Anyway,  Serious Sam: The Next Encounter  calls and it needs reviewing..."
U56BGA2,male,17,"I've just had my first food in 24 hours and feel much better. Yesterday I threw up three times and felt s***, but managed to watch about seven episodes of  24 . Today I'm off school, so I'm just catching up with little bits of work and taking things easy. Maybe I'll write a review later as well. Oh, and I've noticed that Google has changed their layout....to look worse than before. Weird."
U56BGA2,male,17,"This is a list of what needs doing:  Sort out the template page. *done* Sort out the index template. *in progress* Program the different index pages to display the correct items. *in progress* Code up the viewnews, viewpreview, viewreview and viewfeature pages.

U56BGA2,male,17,"Last night I finally finished reading the moster that is  Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix  and I'm starting to read  Wild Blue  by Stephen E. Ambrose, the guy who wrote  Band of Brothers . I spend almost all of today at work, which also happened to be the easiest day at work  ever . I spent 7 whole hours just painting stuff and watching it dry, being paid £4.10 and hour to do just that. Just under £30 to paint stuff - not too bad I guess. Tomorrow I'll probably have some homework I've forgotten about creep up on me and send me into a slight panic or something similar. Something to really look forward to is my first driving lesson on Monday - watch out Schumacher!"
U56BGA2,male,17,"Just got back from my triple Geography exam, comprising of three 1 hour papers and my fingers are blue with pain. It went much better than my previous Mechanics exam, with a distinct lack of having to cope with hayfever at the same time as answering the questions. The exam wasn't really that hard, just tough on the time we were given.  Meanwhile, the builders came in this morning and have torn apart our bathroom, removing our shower in the process. We're no stranger to building work - it's the third extension to this house - but this time they've taken the shower! Going round to other peoples' houses to wash - not fun.  On a more sober note, yesterday was of course the 60th anniversary of D-Day; quite a thought provoker in itself. It was the largest combined air, land and sea operation ever and I don't think it's going to be outdone for hundreds of years. The sheer amount of co-operation between nations, the scope, ambition and secrecy needed would be impossible today in a world of mass media, high-tech communication and such split causes. Back then, the world united against one foe and they believed that what they were doing was right. I don't think that exists today at all and that's a real shame."
U56BGA2,male,17,"I spent the whole day at work today, well 9.30am to 6pm anyway. It was one of the hottest days this year so far and my arms are already starting to show a hint of red from the sun earlier. Work was reasonably enjoyable because of the weather and the lack of as many crap jobs as usual. Notably, I got my second tip from an American woman who was oddly only wearing one sock and I also won our day's takings sweepstakes (I guessed £19,000 and it was £19,200), with a Mars bar the prize (ooh, the excitement!). I spent this evening playing  Battlefield 1942 , listening to music and browsing some forums. Tomorrow I'm off to work again, although only from 10.30am to 5pm."
U56BGA2,male,17,"Quite a fruitful day today, unusual for a Monday. I woke up natuarally and the proudly saw that Clan Recruiter was finally online, up and running. It's been quite a lot of work, but it's been worth it I think. Today a couple of websites, tomorrow the world! Or something like that anyway.  So I got to school and was then given a whole load of money in cash from my host which was pretty good. It's nice to go around with a wad of notes in your wallet and feel like you could buy almost anything. No chance of that though, as the money's going straight back into Thunderbolt. I'll be a millionaire one day maybe, but not today.  After a fairly average school day, I got home and had a whole load of emails in my inbox, mostly about Clan Recruiter. I was also pleased to see the huge amount of traffic that the site has received. Now I'm sitting here writing this and wondering which homework I should do, if any. I should really do one, but I'm hungry and I have a review to finish.. Then again, it's a crap game and my hunger can be kept down until later, so it looks like the absolute  joy  of homework will win over.  On a completely irrelevant point, I saw  Cruel Intentions  for the second time yesterday and it was surprisingly much better than the first time I saw it. Strange, how that happens. On the subject of TV and film, I caved into my urges and purchased a limited edition DVD box set of series 1 and 2 of  24 , which I love so much. It'll take over 36 hours to watch, but at least I'll never have nothing to do ever again."

6RRCZL3,male,25,GORDON HAS A BLOG!!
6RRCZL3,male,25,"Hmmmm.. I don't really know what to write today..  Bit hung over after last night (Myself and Orla went to a pub in Rathfarnham to catch up with some friends of hers.. I didn't have much to drink but it was so close yesterday I think I was a bit De-Hydrated) so my blog will probably be incoherent at best..  Things are going exceptionally well for me recently. I'm feeling content in my life, not something I am used to. I've already blogged about how well work has been going recently (although it is getting very close to the end of the month damn it..) so I'm going to navigate the dodgy waters that is blogging about my relationships..  I'm moving in with Orla next month some time and I couldn't be happier about it.. Things are going better than I would have ever expected. When I first started seeing Orla I wasn't looking for a relationship really.. I had thought I'd had my fill of relationships for the moment and I think Orla was in the same position.  So what happened? I honestly can't tell you. I still don't quite understand what has happened.. I just know that I am happy in a way that is different to anything I have experienced in a long time.. I've always kept a part of myself locked away, a safe point to retreat to and keep a type of control over my emotions..  Anyone that knows me well knows that I have a way of shutting myself off when I feel too emotional or vulnerable. This has always been my safety switch.. I don't like losing control of myself and never really let myself be ruled by my emotions.. But all that is changing now..  Does that mean everything else I ever felt wasn't real or true? No. The best I can explain it (given that I still don't really understand it) is that this ""fits"" me.. So far there have been matchs that were so close to being right, but they were just not right. It didn't ""fit"" properly.  Anyway.. The point of my blog (This blog is something I have wanted to write for a while) is to say I'm happy and things are good.. I'm happy in work and love and can't wait to see where my life is going to take me next..  Heh."

5339Y01,female,27,"I don't know why I was unusually emotional last night. I keep muttering ""I miss you, papa"" in my sleep. And I woke up crying. I miss my dad terribly that I wonder what it would be like if he was still alive. He never saw his two girls graduate from college who went further by finishing two courses each.  My dad died when I was 17 years old. I was fresh in college. Literally, unaware of the life in Metro Manila. You see, I was born and bred in Naga City, a city in the province of Camarines Sur. I finished my kindergarten years up to High School from a Catholic Chinese school called Saint Joseph School. Then, I finally went to college in a prestigious university, University of the Philippines Manila, where I took up BSN.  I was trying to adjust to college life when my dad suddenly went very ill. He was hospitalized back in our province and was transferred to a hospital here in Manila. Every weekend, my sister and I would spend time with him in the hospital. I remember my dad saying, ""I'd buy you a car soon."" He still had dreams for his children...he was still hoping to spend most of his lifetime with us. But, he died on the 4th day of September.  I had to leave school for a week. Since it was almost the end of the semester, I had to leave reports and exams for awhile..and worry about it after all the tragedy was over. We buried our dad in a cemetery in his hometown. Trying to put up a brave front, my sister and I went back to Manila.  Back in college, I had to turn in my reports late. I distinctly remember one professor, Prof. Teresita Hernandez. She was known to be strict and heartless. But nevertheless, I tried to appeal to her sympathetic side. So, I approached her trying to explain why my report was late. But she brusquely told me, ""You should have started that report before your dad died!"" I tried to explain that my dad was ill for four months and that I had to stay with him in the hospital but she basically just ignored me. Some people are just heartless. I wonder how she is today...hope she has changed for her own sake.  Oh, how I wish my dad was still alive. I miss him terribly."

8DVLMRK,male,26,"A Truely Excellent piece of work. As far as i am concerned, this is simply THE best practice for returning Data From WebServices....Read on:     There are many reasons why developers don't use the  XPathDocument  and  XPathNavigator  APIs and resort to  XmlDocument  instead. I outlined some of them with regards to querying functionality in my posts about    how to take advantage of XPath expression precompilation   , and    how to get an  XmlNodeList  from compiled expressions compilation   .        XPathNavigator  is a far superior way of accessing and querying data because it offers built-in support for XPath querying independently of the store, which automatically gain the feature and more importantly, because it abstracts the underlying store mechanism, which allows multiple data formats to be accessed consistently. The XML WebData team has seriously optimized the internal storage of  XPathDocument , which results in important improvents both in loading time and memory footprint, as well as general performance. This was possible because the underlying store is completely hidden from the developer behind the  XPathNavigator  class, therefore, even the most drastic change in internal representation does not affect current applications.      However, some useful features of the  XmlDocument  and  XmlReader  classes are not available. Basically, I've created an  XmlReader  facade over the  XPathNavigator  class, which allows you to work against either an streaming or a cursor API. I'll discuss how the missing features are enabled by the use of the new  XPathNavigatorReader  class, part of the opensource    Mvp.Xml project   . ......

So I lost no time in buying the new book by Carl Honore, In Praise of Slowness, published in the US by HarperCollins. The thing about time is that whether we're rich or poor we each get an identical allocation of it - 24 hours in a day, seven days in a week - and its supply is fixed. That makes time scarce - a valuable commodity - and economics is the study of scarcity and how we can get round it. The problem of time's scarcity goes to the heart of the way capitalist economies are organised and the way they evolve. Indeed, capital gains its value from the fact that we use it to achieve more with our time. """
8DVLMRK,male,26,"Parallel Polarity      Though this is not actually my work, i think this is great.  Thanx to      Matt at The Wayward Weblog      for this gem..      Sometimes scientific discoveries are not made in the lab, sometimes they are born out of conjecture and backed up by observation alone.  Thank goodness for that or I'd have never discovered the truth.  I suppose many of you have thoughts on occasion that traverse the wide open possibilities of our reality, pondering classical conundrums and esoterica that on the surface seem like silly notions, so seldom do you venture much deeper.  I, on the other hand, take great pride in plummeting head first into abstract thought and taking even somewhat clever notions beyond into the realm of abject absurdity.    You might think I do this with the noble intention of seeking out a laugh, something to tickle the funny bone of my family and friends or to evoke a short chuckle from me alone as I sit in a meeting ignoring everything else but my own little amusements.  But this is not the case.  I do have a more serious destination and I am most diligent in its pursuit.  Certainly, I cannot escape the onset of laughter as I do uncover the ridiculous and bizarre.  That's to be expected.  It comes with the territory, and I don't mind it one bit; it soothes the soul and is the medicine for what ails you.  Yet, however delightful that feeling of levity may be, it is nothing compared the utter joy felt when I finally stumble upon a revelation that is destined to rock the foundation of understanding that I and everyone else on this great green ball cling to daily.    That's why I spared no time in rushing to my PC this morning in order to craft this post, because I knew I finally had something of note that when shared with rest of humanity might just change the way we look at ourselves, the world around us and in truth the fabric of reality that underpins our very existence.  So without further ado, I'll just blurt it out and then get on with the explanation and supporting evidence.      It has come to my attention, through observation, deep analysis and profound insight, that travel between parallel dimensions is not only possible, it is happening all the time.  Now, before you commit me to the loony bin, hear me out so you will feel confident that you had all the facts, all the arguments and proofs.      Certainly, this might seem a big deal.  Am I talking about Slider-esque travel through a vortex into a parallel dimension, where people look like us but are up to no good?  Not really.  I'm not talking big science-fiction Hollywood style travel, or even highly speculative jaunts through a black hole (especially since Stephen dashed my hopes on that one.)  I'm talking about everyday, normal slips between realities that we experience even though we don't know that it is happening.    You see, as it turns out, the walls between parallel realities are not so thick at all.  They're not even walls really, just sort of a conceptual boundary.  The closer any two realities are to one another, the more they sort of touch, overlapping one another if you will.  So another universe where I diverge from myself quite considerably, or apes rule the planet would actually be so drastically different there would unlikely be slips large enough to send anyone from here to there.  However, realities that diverge only slightly, so subtly that they are almost identical except to the trained and diligent mind, they are in fact so close that they overlap entirely.  Between these we travel constantly, slipping in and out of each without a second thought.    The real trick to recognizing that these traversals do indeed occur is to observe it in action.  Take any monumental event that you and others may have experienced in the recent past.  Ask each person involved to write down exactly what happened.  Compare.  You'll find a quite a deviation between observers.  Is this because each is so inept as to be unable to recognize what you have obviously recalled as the truth?  Or could it be that each has remembered the event quite accurately, yet their experiences diverge due to differences in reality at the time of observation?    This is not just hypothetical.  It happens to me all the time.     Have you ever looked at a written word and thought, ?that doesn't look right??  Well, it doesn't because you've shifted realities.      Have you ever started thinking something that you later find out your spouse, sibling or friend was also thinking?  Without ever talking?  Well, you did in a different reality.    This is why you always feel out of sorts.  The rules keep changing.  You're never really in the same place again.  You keep slipping.    Have you ever looked at the keyboard and wondered what happened to the Quelm?  I have.  It was sort of a squarish letter.  And this one, 'Z', I can't quite recall ever using seeing that one before."

These days, unfortunately, many companies feel the need to get patents simply as a defensive measure. Whether for defense or offense, it appears that Bill Gates believes Microsoft needs more patents. The company is ramping up their efforts to file for more patents and plan to extort license them to other businesses. So far, they're off to a good start. Some recently noted Microsoft patents include saving the name of a game you're playing, showing that someone is 'typing a message' in IM software, thread based email, writing an application in HTML, grouping programs together in the taskbar, pronouns used in programming and the concept of giving 'kudos' points for style and flair.

Teens lucky with homemade cannon     Sarpsborg police were puzzled by a rash of worried calls asking why there had been an deafening bang from the old fortress area. An quick investigation revealed an potentially fatal experiment by three 15-year-old boys was the reason, newspaper Sarpsborg Arbeiderblad reports.     The trio of bored teens had decided to try building a homemade cannon. They used a meter-long iron pipe and bought a steel boccia ball to use as a projectile. The final ingredients were a small amount of gunpowder scraped out of some old fireworks and a fuse.    The three boys set up their cannon at an old defense building and pointed it at a wooden target they made about 30 meters (98 feet) away.    ""They were lucky they aimed towards terrain. The ball hit the target they set up 30 yards away and the massive steel ball continued into a thicket before richocheting off the mountain. From there it was tossed nearly 300 meters over Grekerdalen, accompanied by an enormous bang. This despite a moderate amount of gunpowder,"" police inspector Knoff Nss told the newspaper.    ""In retrospect they see how lucky they have been and are obviously overjoyed that the heavy steel ball didn't hurt anyone. But they could have injured themselves. If they had used the wrong kind of powder it wouldn't have been a cannon, it would have been a splinter bomb,"" Nss said, and warned others not to try similar stunts."

(Ok she does, but just incase she's reading my blog..... work with me here)   Anyway, we all bought her clothes. I paid for some my mom picked out. Noooo.... it's gotta be clothes. She wouldn't let me buy anything else. Geezes. She'll be 17. Almost off to collag so I can have her room. Wahoo! Well.... see ya."

FRDYUW1,male,13,"I finally finished the computer table I've been working on for the past 2-3 days. With a little help lifting the cabinet upper-part on top of the actual tap; screwing it in - it's finished. It's really great. We got a big chair with it too, though I don't like it too awful much. That's fine with me, it's not mine anyway =-)  My sister also got to go to her first job for the first day! We've been trying to get her to go to work for a long time. After her friend suggested her for the job, she got a call the other day. We knew she had one that day straight after she came back, but her friend was going on vacation to Mexico from now until someday. (I think)  Anyway,I have to go eat. It's 9 and I should have eaten later. So..... bye, see ya later. I'll have to do a better job of keeping up on posting in here."
FRDYUW1,male,13,"I was too tired yesterday when I got home from my grandparents (father's side) to even post. I decided I'd better post today though, since I'm probably not going to get to post Monday, Tuesday,  or Wednesday. In fact, I almost think I'm a little too tired now.  Yesterday me and my dad went over to his parents farm; what we consider the middle of nowhere. About the middle of the day we went fishing. As it turned out I caught 6 catfish and my dad caught only 1 =-) (Yes, that's the truth).  He probably would have caught more, and me included, but it started to rain on us. So.... we had to go in.   All in all we had pretty much more than enough, but it would have been better to have more than 2 days worth of fish. And that's saying we gave some to my grandparents. Today however was pretty (is pretty) much normal. Not much goes on on Sundays to talk about, but I guess then again not much goes on during the summer when you are around me. I am a pretty boring person. Well. Off I go. Later."

Most importantly is to find that someone who appreciate you as who you are.   There are a lot of stars in the sky. Not everyone of them shines as brightly as the others. But don't just look at the brightest. There are some that are not so bright, but that is because you have not found the gems in them. Some takes time to be discovered, some only emerge upon deeper interaction. When you find the correct one, they will becomes the brighest stars in the sky. And they shine just for you. They becomes special as well, just like the moon.   Have you found your star?  If not, they will eventually come to you. Take time to look around you... If you have, make sure you are worth it.

Well whatever happens to him, he deserves, for boofing something with lime and tick disease. Also I hope he gets a severe ball disease.

What's with all that green shit on your vag? Is that moss or some St. Patrick's Day thing? 2.

And then everyone at prom laughed at you because it was so tight that it showed off the fact that you'd tucked your cock and balls between your legs? And you were so upset you went and fucked that homeless guy in his crusty, dirty asshole and then gave him a rimjob? And then you got herpes all over your face? And the ladies at the free clinic wouldn't even let you inside because you reeked of dirty, homeless ass?

GVOM30Y,male,17,"i'm writ ing   alot. there are a ton of things i've felt the inner need to rant about for a very long time. the world must know!!!   thoughts about journals:   1) spiral-bound books make terrible journals.   if you carry your journal around with you everywhere, it's going to get smashed against other stuff. metal sprials tend to bend and deform under the pressure of textbooks or whatever you've got stacked on top of it. plastic spirals either bend or break. when the binding of a journal gets mishapen, it inhibits the pages from turning as easily as they should. this makes it hard to write stream of conscience thoughts without struggling to turn a page. also, pages are much more easily ripped out of a spiral-bound book.   2) lines are not your friend.  if a journal is meant for self-expression, why would you limit your handwriting to the constrictions of lined paper? if you're angry and your handwriting wants to be bigger, you shouldn't have to fit it between some standard that the journal production company invented.  if you want to draw a picture, you should be able to draw a picture. if you want to write sideways on the page, you should be able to write sideways on the page. lines confine your writing to a prison . a prison for your mind. because what is your writing in your journal if not your mind spilling down your arm, through the ink in your pen and into the page's fibers? however, with blank pages, you can draw, rant, write at whatever angle you want however large you want in whatever font you want.   3) cover designs suck.  this is another one of those 'make your journal an extension of you' things. no matter how much you like a cover design, it's not  you.  purchasing a blank book with someone else's artwork on it is like trading wardrobes with someone who's style is completely different than yours. while it may be fun to wear their clothes, you can't help but feel and act different. you're not yourself. it may be interesting and exciting for awhile, but it's still not you! instead, a simple and inexpensive black covered journal with no designs is much better. you can decorate it to your liking without conforming to anyone else's standards. i personally like to use newsprint for everything-the way it takes ink from the printer and paint from my brush and black from a pen fascinates me. and i hate stark white-nothing is perfect, and newsprint has that slightly dark color i love to use in design.    4) envelopes were sent from heaven.  you can easily stick an envelope on the inside cover of a journal to hold movie stubs, notes, business cards, tabs, or whatever else helps you immortalize the moment. i like to write amazing quotes on mine. acctually, i like to cover everything with amazing quotes. if you need any amazing quotes, i got 'em.   5) your journal is yourself.  consider the character of Gollum. held under the great powers of the ring, he is bound to it. without having the ring in his possession, something is lost from his life. once you lay a word into the pages of a journal you've decorated, you've made into your own, it is bound to you. your body resides in a home provided by your family, your heart resides within someone else's being, your brain resides at school. but your  mind  belongs to the book. your journal is like one of your limbs. you need it.   and also, sheets. i don't understand how you people sleep under them. i either have to be completely immersed in them, head under the covers and all, or i have to have my feet and my head sticking out. otherwise your head is cut off from the rest of your body, and that's no good.  some people like kory think this is weird. but you're the weird ones, sleeping with your body under a blanket and your head floating around the room.   --end of rant--"
GVOM30Y,male,17,"So, I don't really feel like posting.  But hey, you know, I promised Emily I wouldn't neglect this.  So, as a consequence, you'll get this.  I just got back from Winter Park yesterday.  If you want details, read my lj.  There's some relevant fun and funny rants in there.  I'm being stalked by the word coconut.  So Emily and I hung out after I got off work today.  We went on a Target spree.  Emily got a swimming pool for $7.48.  A big swimming pool.  I mean, big for $7.48.

RE6F7UG,male,23,"In a sentence - the most miserable, pretentious pile of crap i've ever had the misfortune to sit through... Is it somehow cool to not enjoy watching happy films? Is it the done thing to be miserable? (this sounds a bit familiar....) OK, let's ignore the fact the film had no uplifting elements to it whatsoever and was an epic of gloom... the characters - i warmed to none of them. They were all either two dimensional or thoroughly dislikeable. The scene sequence - what the fuck were they thinking? Did they mean to put it all in a random order or had they just dropped everything on the cutting room floor and stuck it together any old way? The random order gave nothing to the film whatsoever. It just made it suck more. Was it trying to be intellectual? Am i just too stupid to appreciate the depiction of whatever the hell it was they were trying to depict? I don't know, but if they think you have to be miserable to be cerebral, then fuck 'em! All in all - pile of crap.

RE6F7UG,male,23,"Gah! Why do people feel compelled to tell everyone about their deepest introspections all the goddamn time? Just flicking through some blogs, there's a whole heap of people out there who just seem to want other people to recognise how fucking profound they are... Why is it not considered 'cool' to just be happy and piss around? But no, it's cool to wallow in misery. Well, there seems to be two camps who have offended me today:  1.  'I'm so mature and have such responsibilities you'd never believe' Instead of bitching about how you're sooo busy working all hours God sends to fund your shoe/designer clothes/Laura Ashley paperweight addiction, why not ditch the job, and lighten up? This life is about fun, not getting a big number in your bank account and a house either so full of objet-fucking-d'art you can't move or so minimalist there's nothing to do but count how much money you spent to have nothing in your house just to impress people how cool you are as to not need anything to sit on. Dammit! Wankers! And then, they have the gall to look down their nose on someone who's out enjoying themselves - 'Yah, like, it's like, sooo not, like,  cool to like, do things that are, like, fun. Like, we just, like, hang out, like, drinking coffee, like, and being, like bored, cos, like, it's the cool thing, like, to like, do.'That brings me onto another thing - coffee. It's just a sodding hot drink, not a work of bleeding art! It makes no difference if it's got steamed milk bubbled through it and chocolate shavings from Nepal scattered on top - it won't make you any better a person, because I'll have had to wait behind you for ten fucking minutes while it's been stirred seven times clockwise, chanted over and had vaporised fucking mung beans wafted over it. And all I want is a cup of tea - bag, hot water. Dammit! Where was I? Ah yes. Like. Can people not leave this poor word alone for more than six seconds? Like, it's so, like, annoying at the end of the day. And if I hear that one once more, there's going to be actual physical violence. At the end of the day. To be fair - that really gets on my nerves as well. Can people not formulate phrases themselves? I know we're supposed to recycle stuff, but not what David fucking Beckham and stick woman say... dammit. RIght, now I'm going to move onto the second bunch of people who have annoyed me today:  2.  I hate the world and I want to die. What is with these people? Why do they wallow in their own misery? Don't tell me it's depression, it's not, it's teenage angst (which is understandable at 14, but in your mid twenties, c'mon) coupled with a want to be different and somehow special. Do these people enjoy living in gloom? Yeah, like, I was up all night, thinking about death, like, I'm so profound, I can see there's no point to living, so I'm going to dwell on death and misery until I grow out of it. It's true, there is no point to living, no ultimate target, so why not lighten up and have some fucking fun while you've got the chance? Man, these people get to me. I'm sure they just want to be miserable for some reason. Do they want sympathy? Because they're not going to get it from me until they stop listening to backwards organ music. Dammit. In fact, I find it downright offensive - there are thousands of people out there who genuinely suffer from depression, and you wouldn't know it until they tell you - they're just doing their best to get by and not wallow (i know, i've used that word a lot today) in self-pity.  Right, better stop here before I get too carried away... later!"

RE6F7UG,male,23,"Whilst at the supermarket last night (Safeways - needed sausages and diesel) I occured to me just how many damn slow people there are. Slow fat people, who just meander along, with not a care in the world, gleefully blocking each and every aisle as I try to trot round the shop. All I wanted was a packet of sausages, and some milk. That's it. I also needed to be relatively hasty because my laptop was in my car, and my car don't lock. I was in such a rush that I ignored my standard checkout choice protocol (find the prettiest girl, queue there.) and queued at 'Mark's  (I'm never sure if they have real names on their badges - when I worked in a hotel bar, I was known as Bruce, I shit you not.) checkout, declining the delights of 'Antoinette' in the next checkout - her conveyor belt was loaded, almost to the rafters with what seemed to be mainly pies, cakes and lard. Oh, and a low-fat yogurt. Sure, that'll help it's owner's pounds just fly off, especially after that pork fat flavoured ice cream... Anyway, I digress. Whilst 'Mark' dealt with previous customer and her cheque (No, I don't want it printing, I'd rather spend a week writing it very slowly, and pissing off anyone who had the sheer cheek to think they could just rush in and out so their car hasn't got time to be broken into...) I spotted, on offer, a pack of that stop-smoking-gum. What the hell, I thought, now's as good a time as any.... After leaving the main store, I stopped at the filling station, as my poor (thankfully, non-broken into) car was thirsty, and incurred the wrath of about six people queueing to get fuel on the left hand side of the pumps. How did I do this? By opting out of the 'wait on this side and ignore the other side club' and reversing to the (unoccupied) pump on the other side, so I could fill up there. For my efforts, I recieved a handful of dirty looks, and some guy I think wanted to give me a handjob. I declined, as he wasn't my type, being a 'he' to start with. Was I delaying any of them? I reckon they just took offence at being made to look stupid. Moral of the story - if you don't want to look stupid, don't be stupid... Back to the gum. It's one of the most horrible things I've ever encountered. Imagine chewing soap laced with creosote. It makes me want to have a smoke afterwards to get rid of the foul taste. Dammit!

2XYKSTV,male,35,"So my boy Billy sends me this invitation to post along with him here, and i instantly jumped at the opportunity. I've never had such an outlet for my ego, and i must admit it is intriguing.  I'm not really sure what the purpose of this is.  I'm anything but internet savvy.  Therefore i will use this outlet to give opinions on all things media:books, music, movies, etc.  I don't really know the famed Brett, but i do know a couple things about him. 1.He handles weird accidental crank calls very well, smooth even.+ 2.He likes Belle and Sebastian.- 3.He was knowledgable and nice enough to inform me that they got their name from that old cartoon about that orphan and his big white dog.+ So far he's got a positive record.

From musings on Ptolemy and ""the force of the false"" to reflections on the experimental writing of Borges and Joyce, Eco's luminous intelligence and encyclopedic knowledge are on dazzling display throughout. And when he reveals his own ambitions and superstitions, his authorial anxieties and fears, one feels like a secret sharer in the garden of literature to which he so often alludes.  Remarkably accessible and unfailingly stimulating, this collection exhibits the diversity of interests and the depth of knowledge that have made Eco one of the world's leading writers.

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I went to hang out with Damien, Betsy, and Star on Thursday, mostly to make certain that Acid Pro was installed properly on their computer. Damien had a stack of his albusm that he's recently transferred to CD for me, almost all songs i know by heart, but neglect to include as his official discography, considering lost or scrapped. Lark exists side by side with Tale of a Shadow, along with Moonfield, All three of these were to be the followup to Sunfield, but while i knew that he recorded all of the songs, somehow they seemed unfinished and neglected. Wrong. I think that i had become accustomed to the homemade covers that he made for Sunfield and Jinx. Now i have images and clearly defined track listings for each of these albums.

Although it was not quite my favorite collection, i now have another Damien Youth album for what seemed like a lost period, Happy, a sprawling double album that was recorded around the same time that  urlLink Walter Ghoul's Lavender Brigade  was first getting off the ground. This was the true post Featherbox fallout album, as i can feel him slipping in a few of his still peculiar radio friendly FB songs, WGLB sketches, the unusually stark and brittle DY solo material, and some songs that don't fit anywhere else in his canon, that nearly qualify for novelties.   The stuff from when i first met Damien, around '89 and '90, Mortuary and The Man Who Invented God, is strange to hear again. I still very much like it, but i remember years and years of Hammondites dismissing any newer songs as derivative of this powerful early material. If Damien played Hammond tonight, and had his old crowd miraculously show up (as some fo them lost interest awhile back when he lost interest in playing the same old requests,) he'd get requests for these fifteen year old songs that are clearly not as good as the music he's cranking out now.

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I have this extrememly urgent desire to instantly know what other people think about me.  Normal enough, until it becomes an obsession that demands action.  I find myself saying things in a certain way to influence the opinions of others.  It's another defense mechanism that I've developed since my ex and I broke up.   I found an old journal of mine kept when I was sixteen.  Instead of the typical agnsty clap-trap, I was shocked to find a fairly sophisticated (and pretentiously composed) examination of the ""two of me"" problem lots of teenagers face.  See, while I managed to keep abreast of the raging acedemic debate on the military revolution at age 16, I was also trying not to get busted for selling hydrocodeine to peers at the local shopping mall.  I tried really hard to be ignorant and ""cool"" when around others, but engaged in an in-depth e-mail debate on the true effectiveness of Gustavus Adolphus' military reforms when in the privacy of my own home.  I can vaguely remember thinking that all that made me ""well-rounded"".  I was fairly popular (class favorite in the 10th grade), fairly well-respected (associated with the ""tough-guy drug crowd""), and fairly fucking nerdy as well.    The journal, an oversized green hardcover with wide-ruled sheets, contains thoughts I had forgotten.  ""Which me will I choose?"" I cry plaintively over and over again.  It's funny now.  I'd like to think there was a conscious choice, a turning point where I  decided  to fix up and look sharp.  I was an asshole a few years ago, and I knew it.
