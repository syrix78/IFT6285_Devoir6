YZZNOMN,male,15,Ok so today i woke up around 9:15 and then took a shower and went over to collect and sort cans for the can and bottle drive for boy scouts. Next I went home and sat around for a little while. Then I went for a bike ride to hit tag sales because I was bored and no one was home. So we ended up runing 8 miles..My sister was all tired but I wasn't... I RUN TRACK haha... No but it was sorta fun. I got home and layed around some more washed up and got ready for the pasta dinner. The pasta dinner was pretty fun with erika and steph. Although poor erika wasnt feeling good. She'll feel better shoon though. We ate pasta then did the raffle then did bingo. It was so much fun playing bingo because at first I played with erika and steph at our table but then I started reading the numbers off. And it was so much fun. I was really good at it. Then erika ran out of cards and came up to help me spin. It was so great. We then finished that and cleaned up. That was pretty cool (haha yea sure) I jumped rope really good. (Some girl won a jump rope) Then i begged my dad to go to stephs for a lil bit. I hopped in the DEMORINOES car and drove off. We got their and steph had just won a hole BOX full of makeup. It was burning a hole in her pocket. And so she decided to use me as a specimen. She did EVERYTHING to me... liner...gloss...blush.....mascara... (it was scary and really uncomfortable) Then we decided to have FUN! We went all out and i put fake boobs on and a dress we took a couple pictures and then I took the make up off and we were watching a movie. Then the phone rings and my dad says that I should come home now and he is coming to pick me  up. Then i am sitting watching to movie and steph goes so i gues you wanna show your dad your RED NAILS.. I FREAKED.. i ran into the other room and told mrs demo i needed nail polish remover. Then We ran into her room and started srubbing. We got the bulk off but I have the bottle to take home for the little stuff. Yea that was about it I came home and decided to go online. So yea that was my day. I will NEVER wear make-up again ... and I will have a respect to all girls now for everything they go through... ( it really suxs to be a gay guy ... or a cross dresser) So yea. Not much else I guess.... excpt guys.. never go near girls with makeup when your outnumbered.. ( it was kinda a different experience though)
YZZNOMN,male,15,"UGH! ...  ok.. so today I woke up at 6 and was supposed to go running, but I was SOOO tired even though I went to bed relativly early last night because I had went running right before bed. So I decided that I would go running tonight. So I slept and that extra hour and a half sleep before chandler got here was awesome. Then we went up and got his boat ready. We cleaned and fixed the fridge and stuff. Then we came home went to walmart and picked up taylor and maura then after that we went back to the boat and went to some islands. It was really run and by the time we got back it was like 9 and then we chilled at Taylors... I called my mom at about 9:45 and asked if she wanted me to go home  or if I could have some pizza since I hadn't eaten dinner. She was in a really good mood. I said chandlers dad could bring me home and she was like thank you so much for calling. At about 10:40ish chandler said how he had a 11 oclock curfew. Then I felt bad about him bringing my home so i called my house and asked if they were awake and could bring me home. My mom is like sure. Then i tried to give her directions and she handed the phone to dad. Then my dad goes why you gotta make it so complicated and then I told him where and asked to come around 11. Then about 10:50 i see a car pass so i go out. THere is noone there and I wait out there then it comes back and it is my dad. He SCREAMS AT ME... I've gone back and fourth 4 times. Where were you. I am not gonna just pull in someones driveway at 11 oclock. Then we have this long awkward silence and he goes. So you didn't run today, there goes that disipline. That cut me really deep, and we didn't talk the rest of the time. I am gonna like like 18 miles tomarrow. Ugh I talked about running all day and even said at taylors i should leave so i can go run but they talked me out of it. O well what can you do. anyhow yea so now i am in my room and gonna go to sleep soon cuz i am in a bad mood and I want energy for all the running i am gonna make myself do tomarrow."
YZZNOMN,male,15,We went kayaking again today down on the CT River in Middletown. We paddled 1 hour upstream and it only took us 20 min to get back to the same place. I guess current helps a little bit.  This is My baby  urlLink SEXY KAYAK       Although mine is yellow faded to orange. I also have a skirt so I don't get wet. A Paddle and a bilge Pump.

YZZNOMN,male,15,"Aww, I'm sorry you had such a bad day, Josh! :( Cheer up, because I'm sure a good day is right around the corner (Wow, I sound like a Hallmark greeting card or something). Surprisingly, I had a rather good day today. I don't know what made it good, it was just a good day. During my stupid orchestra quiz, I didn't care whether or not I sounded good playing in front of Mr. Shaw anymore. Of course, I played like crap, but it was still better than I usually play. We had Coach Bob for Spanish, woohoo! Gym was just hilarious. Jamie, Kait, Alex, and I got so into what we were doing. The whole class must think we're crazy by now, but that's okay... they're going to think we're even crazier after they hear Jamie, Kait, Steph, and I rap in Health class (for a project). Someone wanted us to sing a Beatles song instead ::cough cough:: but no thanks. As much as I hate rap, it'll be more fun rapping in front of the class than singing a ballad in front of the class. Practice was cancelled today, so I went down to PLTW to work on the train. Well, at least I (sort of) caught up now. I left a note for Lauren over by her bright pink bag when I headed into the cafe. I noticed Taylor was doing her biology homework, so I went over to talk to her. It's always fun talking to her... I think we disturbed the entire cafe because we were being so loud though. I talked to Mrs. Consic, and she wants to reschedule our game to Friday instead. I forgot her reason, but I want her to reschedule the game... that is, until I remembered that Kait isn't going to be here on Friday, and she's starting as Right Attack Wing. So I half want the game to be tomorrow, and I half want it to be Friday. I'm still a tad nervous about playing Center... I have a feeling I'm going to make a fool out of myself when I don't do face off right. Blegh, why can't I just play Left Attack Wing?!?! I really don't have anything else to blog about, so I'll stop here... wooo."
YZZNOMN,male,15,I ran sun valley then to kevins and back for a night run with pt fun stuff
YZZNOMN,male,15,YAY! got the new look.. pretty damn sexy if you ask me.. Now to get the counter and chatterbox to work.. hmm...
YZZNOMN,male,15,RIGHT NOW I am in earth science.. very boring. We are desalinizing water FUN FUN FUN .. I guess... Anyhow this is becoming quite a boring blog.. Maybe I should have more people write in it to get more interesting
YZZNOMN,male,15,So dudes...mon... hmm i slept in really late. Then I ran around town with brit. We like ran to the library and blockbuster then we got to my house. She walked to family pizza and her mom picked her up. Then after that I came home and ran with the ppl for xc. After that I hooked up with kevin and we rode to brits house. It took kevin like 1000000+ house of talking while i   wandered off to leave them alone to ask her out then they didn't even hug or kiss.. So anyhow we came back and I stayed home and that was my entire monday I think or at least what i can remember. This morning I woke up and hooked up with kevin. We rode bikes for a little while then my mom took us to walmart to buy my bike tire finally. We also went to Wendy's! I put the tire on my BMX bike and we hit a couple jumps behind his dad's house. Then we rode to chandlers house and were shooting bb guns int he fields behind his house. We  shot turkeys but   they were to quick for us. THen we found this abandoned truck and started throwing rocks at it and shooting it.. All of a sudden this lady starts yelling you FUCKING KIDS GET OUT OF HEAR. I have to say i don't know if i have ever run that fast before. It was so bamfer. So after that we chilled and layed low in chandlers house then we rode home... but it started raining so we rode MAD fast.  When i got to my house ppl were waiting to go on a run so i ran 7 miles and then ate dinner. I got ready for boy scouts and am headed there next. That is about all I have done.. Kevin might be getting a new computer he is excited..

1C8OHGZ,female,24,"I haven't blogged in a long time fuckers!   So, what's new in the life of Meg Casablancas?   I still drink coffee at my desk, but I have stopped eating bagels at my desk.  Now, I know that this blog came about because of my office angst towards the bagel v. latte race.  Bagel always won.  But bagels are not good for you everyday.  First of all, the Everything bagel, my bagel of choice, was so appropriately named because it leaves a mess on everything on my desk.  I try to clean my keyboard out weekly with that spray air stuff and without fail, I point that little guy in between the keys and out flies poppy seeds, sesame and onion, salt, what have you.  Second, I usually get cream cheese on my finger, which in turn ends up on the keyboard.  (Maybe I should call IT for a new keyboard.)  Third, I am in the middle of having some extensive dental work done, and god only knows how those itty bitty mini seeds get caught in my teeth.  Seeds are not good for teeth.  And finally, carbs are the new enemy and since I am not Jennifer Aniston and have never ordered a scooped-out bagel in my life.  Its easier to not order the bagel at all.    This morning I ate fruit, paid for by my starbucks gift card that I got for Adminstrative Professionals day.  That was yummy, except freezing cold when it hit my tooth that I had filled last week.  I called the dentist's office immediately following this pain to see if I could get some painkillers and they said that I could come in for another appointment tomorrow.  I said, I will just see how it feels on Monday.  I mean, crimeny, can't you just give me something over the phone?  I already have to go get a root canal in the next few weeks and then you are going to put a post in my tooth and then crown it.  That sounds so fancy, like my tooth is getting knighted or something, (Sir Meg's tooth) but in reality, for me, it is a fate worse than death.  I hate going to the dentist.  I hate the light that they shine in my face.  I hate looking up people's noses and I hate that they are starring my mouth and putting shit in it.  My biggest fear is that they are going to cut my tongue off.  I hate when they talk to you and you can't talk back you just have to shake your head and that makes me even scared more because what if that little shake causes them to cut off my tongue, then what am I going to do.  I like talking, I can't just not have a tongue.  I also hate novocaine.  I don't like not feeling my face.  I chew my cheek off and that is so scary.  I used to have the coolest dentist, he would listen to classic rock when he would work on my teeth.  There is nothing better than walking up from wisdom teeth removal all drugged up to hear the Doors, break on through to the other side, literally.  I might have thought I was Jim Morrison at that point I was so out of it.  I kept laughing and they put me in a closet that they called the ""recovery room.""  What the hell was that all about?  My dad kept saying, so this is what it's like when you are drunk.  I think I was just about to turn 21.  In other news, Liz is in Iowa, the land of Ashton Kutcher.

1C8OHGZ,female,24,"Don't know about the future, that's anybody's guess.   I have been watching I love the 90's all week.  My favorite thing about these shows that VH-1 produces is MO ROCCA, media gadfly.  I want to marry this man and have little baby gadflies.  Sarah is planning to marry Michael Ian Black.  And we all can live happily ever after in medialand.   urlLink Sara  has brought to my attention that they have left out the suicide of Kurt Cobain in 1994.  This was huge!!!  It defined the generation.  Another thing that was my life in the early 90's was Blossom.     I was the biggest Blossom fan ever.  I have about 4 video tapes of Blossom episodes including the Blossom movie, which takes place in Paris.  I was obsessed with Joey Lawrence.  I belonged to his fan club and one wall of my room in 6th and 7th grade was plasted with pictures of Joey.  WHOA!  In 6th grade, I dressed like Blossom.  I wore the hats, the weird clothes, everything.  I was always voted Best Dressed in ever Slam Book.  I memorized almost every single episode.  My best friend, Diana, and I could recite the episodes line for line.       So, VH-1, where the hell is Blossom?  ""Whoa"" was a huge piece of pop culture in the 90s, how can you just ignore this fact?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, let's talk about Slam Books, while we are on the topic.  Do you remember these things?  They were huge in 6th grade (1991-1992). You would get a spiral notebook and number each page and then put a topic at the top of each page.  The first page was always your name.  The following pages would be things like your favorite song, actor, actress, where you want to live, Best dressed, Best Hair, Best Whatever.  Then you would fill out your self as number one and then pass it around your class.  It was fun to get the book back at the end of the day and read what people wrote.  Some page were ""draw me a picture"" or ""write me a note.""  I miss Slam Books, I might try and bring these back."

T5FYUTS,female,26,"I was at Target not that long ago, and while I was shopping I observed quite a number of people buying American flags. And I don't mean the small ones you hold, but the big huge ones that you put on your house. It surprised me to see so many people making this purchase. And then I wondered why it surprised me.   The truth of the matter is, but just thinking about celebrating the 4th of July, makes me feel a little embarrassed.   I HATE that I feel this way!    I can't help but wonder what the overall sentiments of this years 4th of July will be. To me, it is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, we are celebrating our country's independence, which essentially has no direct connection with the events that are currently taking place. On the other hand, our current events and the overall disgust that many Americans have toward our government, have to in some regard make you want to question, just what it is we are celebrating. That we're assholes and arrogant bastards? Well, we've always been that, but now there is true and ""real"" hatred towards us. And many of us think, rightly so.   I'm damn proud to be an American. Unfortunately, I'm not proud of many things that our government has, and is, doing. Celebrate? Yes, of course I will. (I never pass up an opportunity to drink beer!) However, I anticipate that many 4th of July parties will, and should, have something like a black cloud hovering over them. It would be utterly snotty of us to pretend, for even just one day, that everything in the country is perfect.   And unfortunately, by the looks of the people who were buying flags today, my gut is telling me that snotty ignorance will prevail this holiday. The ""ignore all"" attitude will only be exceeded by obnoxious patriotism. ""WE'RE THE BEST FUCKING COUNTRY, DUDE. EVERYBODY ELSE CAN FUCK OFF!""  This mentality, I think, is not right.  It's on a day, such as the 4th of July, when we should all take a good hard look at our country. At our accomplishments, as well as our mistakes. We need to look at where we've been, and most of all, where we want to go. Be PROUD, but don't be ignorant."
T5FYUTS,female,26,"""I feel so empty right now Nothing to inspire me, but somehow  I keep on dreaming a way - hoping I will wake up soon some day""    I think it is safe to say that almost everyone is looking for one ""true"" thing in life, and that thing is ""happiness."" I know it is something I have touched with the tips of my fingers, but for some reason or another have not managed to hold on to ... I desperately long for it.   Even though it is not explicitly acknowledged, different 'theories' of happiness---or of what makes for 'the good life'---are firmly rooted in decades-old philosophical assumptions.   Plato , espoused a very rationalistic view of happiness. He felt that happiness means being a ""just' person. Such a person is one in whom the three parts of the psyche---reason, the will, and the appetites---are in balance, such that each is able to perform its duty fully and without interference from the other.   It should be noted, of course, that Plato felt this type of happiness is achieved by only a select few people, namely the ""philosopher kings"" of his time.  For  Marcus Aurelius  true happiness (or at least some modicum of peace or neutrality) arises under three major conditions: when we fully accept Nature, society, and ourselves; when we engage in complete self-absorption; and when we exercise our daily duty to others and to society.   My own understanding of Aurelius leads me to consider his a ""happiness by default""---one becomes happy when one is not subject to the pain that occurs in the absence of these conditions.    Sigmund Freud  conspired to render happiness a dubious, even suspect notion. Freud could only offer his patients ""ordinary unhappiness"" as relief from their neurotic suffering.  The  Hedonism Theory,  in all its variants, holds that happiness is a matter of raw subjective feeling. A happy life maximizes feelings of pleasure and minimizes pain. A happy person smiles a lot, is ebullient, bright eyed and bushy tailed; her pleasures are intense and many, her pains are few and far between. This theory has its modern conceptual roots in Bentham's utilitarianism, its contagion in Hollywood entertainment, its grossest manifestation in American consumerism.  The  Desire Theory  can do better than Hedonism. It holds that happiness is a matter of  getting what you want , with the content of the ""want"" left up to the person who does the wanting. Desire theory subsumes hedonism when what we want is lots of pleasure and little pain.   My principle objection to desire theory is that one might desire only to collect china tea cups or orgasms or only to listen to Country and Western music or to count fallen leaves all day long. The world's largest collection of tea cups, no matter how ""satisfying,"" does not seem to add up to much of a happy life. One move to deflect this objection is to limit the scope of desire theory to the fulfillment of only those desires that one would have if one aimed at an objective list of what is truly worthwhile in life.  The  Objective List Theory  lodges happiness outside of feeling and onto a list of ""truly valuable"" things in the real world. Such a list might include career accomplishments, friendship, freedom from disease and pain, material comforts, civic spirit, beauty, education, love, knowledge, and good conscience.   Then there are those, from Saint-Juste to the situationists, with detours through Stendhal and Baudelaire, who take happiness seriously as a political claim. For these writers, happiness was an idea that needed to be liberated from the aristocracy and made available to all of humanity.   Perhaps the question is completely moot when we ask ourselves whether ""happiness"" even exists in the first place.  Both Plato and Marcus Aurelius---as well as Western society in general---use the word ""happiness"", leading one to believe that there is such a thing as happiness that can be understood and apprehended. There is some universal feeling so common to all of us that it deserves its own label.  But what if this feeling does not exist?  What if we have created the word ""happiness"" to describe a plethora of  different  feelings? Are any of us talking about the same  thing ? Worse, are we trying to create definitions that reify a purely linguistic term? If so, what are our personal, cultural, and political motivations for doing so? Any consideration of the ""best"" perspective on happiness must include extensive---and intensive---reflection on these critical questions.  Mark Kingwell wrote that happiness means to feel that one is living a life worth living. Many people find this definition profoundly empty or anxiety-provoking because it doesn't give them anything they can work with. In fact, some say that it makes them feel even unhappier. But the alternative---prescribing happiness formulas---is ultimately doomed to failure. The minute we try to dictate what happiness is, or should be, we place individuals in a passive, powerless position. We succeed in telling them that they do not know enough about themselves or the world to apprehend and/or appreciate the true meaning of happiness. If placed in such a position, will not some individuals feel that they are actually  unworthy  of happiness? If I thought myself too stupid to apprehend happiness on my own, would I feel I deserved to be happy in the first place?   Kingwell's special bugaboo is Prozac. He doesn't blame people for turning to happy pills --confronted as they are by what he calls ""consumerism, psychopharmacology and therapeutic fetishism."" But he does criticize psychiatrists for pathologizing unhappiness, thereby subtly ratcheting up the social pressure to be happy. In the end, he comes down firmly on the side of Aristotle's notion of happiness -- an austere idea that you're only as happy as you are virtuous.  I think Todd Solondz's film ""Happiness"" more or less summed up the prevailing sense that happiness has become at best a kind of pathology: a smiley face plastered over the dark nightmare of American suburbia.   =)"

3UA7COA,male,36,urlLink Need i say more.
3UA7COA,male,36,"Morning all! Nothing on the TV last night, so I had a chance to do some preparation for today's award-winning post for the award-winning  NewLinks . I thought I'd bring you a round up of this week's science news, and a selection of interesting stuff from elsewhere around the ol' interweb. The science news is all skanked from the excellent  urlLink New Scientist  website. After all, they do say that it's where the  real  news exists these days. We'll have none of your vacuous weekly celebrity worshipping, or political tittle-tattle round here.   Anyway, on with the linkage...       getHTMLForIcon('jeebus'); -->    Let's kick off with this story about an  urlLink expedition  that will set off to Turkey in the summer with the aim of finding Noah's Ark. Fair enough, you might think, but they're going to investigate ""what they believe to be a mammoth structure some 45 feet high, 75 feet wide and up to 450 feet long that was exposed in part by last summer's heat wave in Europe"". Chuck in the obligatory conspiracy theory, in 1957 Turkish air force pilots spotted a boat-shaped formation in the Agri province. The government did not pursue the sighting, as the entire area, including Mount Ararat, was off limits to foreigners because of Soviet complaints that explorers were U.S. spies - and you've got the makings of the next Indiana Jones film. Mr. Spielberg, you know where to find me.  And if running around on a mountain is not quite  your  bag, why not try running around chasing after UFOs in Iran. It seems flying saucer fever has gripped Iran after dozens of sightings in the last few days. Read more about it  urlLink here .       getHTMLForIcon('mars'); -->      getHTMLForIcon('robot'); -->    We also haven't had much news from mars lately, so here's a quick check on the progress of the rovers.  urlLink Spirit sets a personal best and Opportunity nears next target .  Staying on Mars for a moment, the funniest page title of the day must go to  urlLink this one  which tells you all about NASA's plans for the next mars expedition.        getHTMLForIcon('wotw'); -->    Movie News : This looks like it will either be really good, or really, really weak. It's  urlLink 'The Day After Tomorrow' , and it's got Jake Gyllenhall in it. He's the kid in Donny Darko. Any way, the movie's about what would happen if there was some kind of mega storm that obliterates the world and sends us all back into the Ice age. Kind of like what would happen if there was a nuclear winter I suppose.   And that's exactly what you might get when you discover        that we (Europe) could be in  urlLink nuclear disarray  as our borders push east and we have the inclusion of the ten new countries that are joining us tomorrow. I, for one, welcome our new Lithuanian overlords.       getHTMLForIcon('robot'); -->    Anyway, I digress. If the Lithuanian strippers don't get us all (fingers crossed), maybe the  urlLink robot traffic cones  will. That's right, herds of robotic traffic cones could soon be swarming onto the A1, closing down lanes and slowing the traffic. Check this out though - each fleet of robots is made up of a lead robot or ""shepherd"", which is equipped with a GPS satellite receiver, plus a number of less expensive ""dumb"" units. The shepherd takes up its position, and tells the other road cones where to go. I, for one, welcome our new conical overlords.        getHTMLForIcon('robot'); -->    Robot news story number #3 features a robot, who this time, is armed with a  urlLink superglue gun . But instead of fixing things around the house this one ""could finger bomb suspects"". Not what you want first thing in the morning.  It seems that when a bomb disposal robot destroys a suspicious package, crucial evidence that could trap the would-be bombers can be lost forever. Again, more interesting stuff from the ol'  urlLink New Scientist .  And if super glue won't fix it, how about a nice bit of soldering action? That's right kids; scientists have added the trusty  urlLink soldering iron  to their nano-toolkits. They've created an atomic-scale conveyor belt that may also be the smallest soldering iron ever created. The new device, which ferries molten metal, is made from carbon nanotubes just 20 millionths of a millimetre in diameter. I think that's even smaller than a grain of sand! Woo-yay! That  is  small!  That should keep y'all going for the next five minutes..."

HMDMT6M,male,17,"This log shall have to be make more esoteric as nobody really cares to post on general matters, or at all. Shame on the other President and the other thirty or so members.  In the news, the three of us Exun appointees have to go for the March Past just like the rest of them appointees. I wouldn't really mind doing it, because it's not really something that involves a lot of physical exertion or anything, however, it does require me to miss classes, something that I'm vehemently against. Fortunately, the Investiture Ceremony is now in August (assumably on the day of the Independence Day assembly). We did get our badges. I'll probably scan them or take a photo of them and post it on either this log or my blog. They had the option of choosing from a Rs. 20 and a Rs. 25 badge, they however, went for the Rs. 5 badge or so I like to call it. It's plain bad, and looks CHEAP - made of cloth, golden border, sickly green background and Orange text.  The school has been getting new PCs recently, and I'm glad to say that Mr. Mukesh has finally got a beautiful black HP PC (though crap config, 2.8 GHz and a paltry 248 MB RAM, 8 MB shared with Video). As expected, I knew he'd be sad because he has to run Windows XP now, and like, Windows 98 is the second love of his life. He never fails to tell me (whenever I touch this topic) that Windows 98 gives you full control while Windows XP and all seem to control you.

HMDMT6M,male,17,"Technologists (""computer people"") like to use this word 'powerful' in peculiar ways. Compared to BASIC, C++ is more powerful and compared to a 266 MHz computer, a 2.66 GHz computer is more powerful. Today, I say: PHP is not simply powerful, PHP is Power (with a capital P that is).  Mukul used to talk about PHP a lot, how he loved programming in PHP and how it was so generally fantastic. I never really understood. After all, I said to myself, it's a programming language... what can be so great about a programming language? Today I found out. PHP is the most flexible language I have ever seen (I have not seen much, but still). 'Flexible' is just the right word, because you will find the same power in C++ as well. Of course then C++ is not used as a Server Side Scripting language, so you can't make a fair comparison. I won't explain here how it's flexible because that's what the Session@Exun was about.  Mukul was disappointed that he did not get much done, and didn't really go into the 'good stuff', but we all (me and some friends) expected this, especially because not everyone there knew C++ (which would have meant easily skipping about half the topics we went through). The small gathering was an enthusiastic one, many doubts were asked and all were answered. It could be easily seen that everyone thoroughly enjoyed the Session as a) no one wanted to leave and b) those who had to leave 20 minutes early begged to stop the class and continue it some other time.  If Mukul finds free time next week, we can arrange a second Session in which perhaps we can apply some of the power of PHP. However, if there is to be a next Session, Mukul has advised that everyone should know about PHP syntax, so that that does not have to be explained [again]. If there is another Session, information will be posted on this blog.  --Karan"
HMDMT6M,male,17,"It's no secret that a lot of people have been trying to get into Exun these past few days because of an unexplained surge in publicity. We've decided that we will state in a lucid manner what we are looking for and what we are not looking for. This log entry shall get a permanent link on the sidebar so that we can easily point people to it. Let me get to the point now.  We want members in the following categories:      Senior Quizzing (Class X to XII)     Debating, Declamation & Group Discussion (Public Speaking - Class IX to XII)     Software Display (Programmers in VC++, VB  who have made some kind of software )     Junior Programming (Class VI to VIII, knowledge of QBASIC)     Senior Programming (Class X to XII) applicants   please read:  We have many good senior programmers in Exun already and quite frankly we're saturated at the moment. Our priority right now is to send the existing programmers for events and competitions. Taking new programmers at this stage will do nobody any good. You may still apply for Senior Programming but be assured that unless you're really brilliant, your chances of getting in are low.   Junior Programming  Since QBASIC is no longer taught at Class VIII level (instead Visual Basic is taught), the Programming Department of Exun is planning to conduct a Logic Test for Class VIII very soon, from which promising students will be trained in QBASIC.   Software Display  Students who have made software in Visual Basic or Visual C++ (any software with a GUI) are invited to come and show their software to us (see below). We're looking for good software that can be sent for Software Display competitions.   Senior Quizzing  The toughest amongst them all. Hop along if you think you know about computers and we'll test you (see below).    Other categories  are:      Digital Imaging     Flash Animation     Web Designing    For these three, students are expected to bring a piece (or pieces) of original work and show it to us. We can judge you then. Again, see below.   See belows  Wherever See Below has been mentioned: Exun members are present in the eGurucool Lab (F-Block) during Break time everyday. Look for the Presidents (Maanick Nangia or Karan Misra) and if you can't find them, try to locate Mr. Mukesh Kumar.

IE2QDNZ,female,34,"The cocktail party is on for tomorrow night.  Technically ""tonight"" since the date clock has advanced, but there is still a ""night's"" sleep between me and it, so I continue to think of what tomorrow brings.  If tonight's sleep is anything like last night's sleep, I will be greeting the sun before insomnia finally stops kicking my ass and I get a little shut eye.  Ah well, all the better to party the night away, I suppose. Kate is safely ensconced in Canada for the weekend with her dad, so at least once I fall asleep I can stay asleep for a while.  Several people waited to the last minute to RSVP, so my attendee list doubled today, but I've come to expect that from our group of friends.  My weekend agenda includes going to the store to pick up last minute items (like fresh bread) and to fill out our stock of alcohol and mixers.  I spent an hour putting together a dozen or so wine charms while watching Law and Order tonight.  I was inspired to do that after seeing  urlLink  ljc's Shrinky Dink wine charms .  They came out pretty well.  I used a bunch of wacky charms and buttons from the bead-craft aisle at Michaels, because I'm no artist.  Just taking on this small project reminded me of how much I really love little crafty projects.    For part of high school I lived in rural Minnesota, in a small old farmhouse that my dad rented.  It was surrounded on all sides by corn fields and held a great old barn that was now completely unused but not yet falling into total ruin.  My dad fits well in rural Minnesota, taking pleasure in duck and pheasant hunting, fishing and ice fishing, maybe playing golf or softball in the summer.  Long, cold, dark winter nights never bothered him much, but I took up crafting to pass the time.  If we'd had the internet back then, I suppose I would have spent time online and the world might not have seemed so close and quiet; I don't recall even having cable TV at the farmhouse, though I did go into ""town"" often to watch TV or listen to records with my boyfriend who lived within the four square blocks that make up the city of Dundas.  I passed the time in Canada when I was living up there with no authorization to work or go to school, by cross-stitching a huge, ambitious jungle scene, 12"" x 12"".  As a relative novice, I should have been much more daunted by the undertaking.  Instead, I threw myself into the effort and came away with a really lovely finished piece.  I gave it to my then in-laws for their young son.  I haven't seen that boy since he was in pre-school, and since they're no longer my in-laws, I doubt I'll ever see them (or the cross-stitch) again.  I was raised in the I'm Ok, You're Ok era and it was made clear to me from a very early age that I could ""be"" anything I wanted to be.  Not that I could ""do"" anything I wanted to do, but *BE* anything.  I could *be* a fire fighter or an astronaut or a doctor or the President of the United States.  The message I took from that teaching was that what you do is who you are, and that if you weren't *doing* something Very Important then YOU weren't very important.  Being a homemaker was something the adult women of my youth were struggling to leave behind, it was a punishment, a waste of a woman's potential.  Those close to me have heard me lament more than once that I don't have a calling, that there's nothing I'm better at than anything else, that I don't know what to ""do"" with myself.  A large part of that is definitely because of my childhood belief that what you do is who you are, and you'd better not waste that potential, girl!  The question of what I want to do is intimately wrapped up in who I want to be.  The honest truth is that I enjoy homemaker pursuits more than any other profession I've tried (or considered).  Not saying that I want to sit home watching soap operas and playing bridge, but I do so love to cook and decorate and organize.  I'm not crazy about cleaning, but I'm a lot more enthused about it at 33 than I have ever been before.  That ""you can do anything"" upbringing means I'm not merely hosting cocktail parties, but I'm there and involved in every aspect of the care of my home.  I installed our garage door opener.  I've assembled and installed every shelving unit, rack, or utility device in the house.  I've purchased the computer stations, the desks, the tools.  I fix the blown fuses, replace the light bulbs, keep the dust buster charged, defrost the fridge, fix the leaky pipes, hang curtains and put up wall paper.  I know the recycling and garbage pick-up schedules, I mow the lawn, trim the trees, put up and take down the Christmas lights.  It would be quite a reward to be able to do that work as my only work, to be in charge of running the house.    Each time I plan one of these little soirees, I can't help reflecting on how much I enjoy those typical homemaker, house-wife pursuits, right down to selecting plushy hand towels and matching decorative soaps, or making wine charms, or cross-stitching some elaborate pillow cover. God, am I really saying that I want to be Martha Stewart?  There's a horrifying thought to send me off to dream-land!"
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"Party time!  Unable to decide what to fix the Katester for dinner, given her limited palate (hmm, macaroni and cheese or grilled cheese sandwiches?) I teased her ""Maybe I should make *both*!""  She started jumping around, cheering, ""Yeah!  It's a  cheese  party!    Yeah, we sure know how to party around here... yee haw."
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"The Game Industry Raises Nice Kids  Kate spent the better part of the day at Cody Pondsmith's Chuck E. Cheese birthday extravaganza, mingling with Cody's excellent, interesting, well-mannered friends.  We shared a ride back to the city with  urlLink Brannon's  son, Stone, who had also attended the party and who lives on our side of the water.  We've also wrangled an invitation to a potluck next weekend that both boys are scheduled to attend, much to Kate's delight.   In the car, Kate told Stone that she was at the party even though she's grounded (for smuggling her hamster to school last week) and Stone exclaimed that it would be worth it to be ""grounded for eternity"" for something as cool as smuggling a hamster to school. They exchanged phone numbers in the car, and Kate is at this very moment in the living room, chatting away to Stone about her hamster and Knights of the Old Republic.  What sweet kids we have.  Chris is seeing the Subhumans downtown tonight, but after a day of 10-year-olds, Chuck E. Cheese, silly string, and utter birthday chaos, I'm ok with missing the show in favor of crawling into bed with a book after Kate goes to bed herself."
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"I have a good friend who, like me, can be somewhat explosive when provoked.  When I knew him only through his online persona, I commented to friend and foe alike that I was going to punch him in the mouth if I ever met him in person.  He's such a sweet person  in person  though, that ol' punch in the mouth never happened.  That's not to say we haven't had our differences.  We had a royal blow-out spat last summer, in fact.  It resulted almost entirely from feeling passionately about our beliefs and holding our work so close to our hearts.  It's like two pretty girls who both really want to be Prom Queen.  I've always wished that I was demure and centered enough to just roll with my 'losses,' smile sweetly, and not take it personally when things don't work out as I plan but I've never been that way.    It's a terrible tightrope to walk, especially when people who love you also love (most of the time) that whole-hearted, passionate, no-holds-barred approach to life that you exhibit.  (As moms around the world have said, ""It's all fun until someone loses an eye, and then the crying starts."")  All the more so when two or more of us get all passionate, ""shooting from the hip,"" suffering no fools, emotionally invested and find ourselves at odds.  In those times when I'm being all calm and rational and someone else is in full-on freak out mode, the compassionate caring part of me wants to soothe it and make it better.  Luckily, I know better than to play with that fire, I've learned that lesson from both sides of the argument.  Let it go, let it go, let them vent and calm down and after the raging buzzsaw of raw emotion has subsided, maybe we can all work it out.  Makes me think of  urlLink  The Reverend Horton Heat .   Fire in the hole!"
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"GenCon SoCal  So, aside from my unpleasant experience on the flight, GenCon SoCal was definitely a success for Green Ronin. I feel badly for the people who worked booths that didn't get as much traffic, and for those who brought gigantic booths and too much stock, and so suffered with massive union fees.  We knew about the union and the drayage but didn't expect the raping to be so bad; that was the one real downside to the convention. $600 to move one pallet of product to our booth, plus our display.  OUCH.  Thursday was very sparsely attended, but not entirely dead.  People attended the events that we sponsored, there was some modest traffic by the booth, but the aisles were also empty enough that Kate was able to turn cartwheels to amuse herself without bashing into anyone.  Combined with the harshness of the set-up charges, many exhibitors seemed to be in a panic about what the convention held for them.  Thursday night my mom flew in to spend the weekend with Kate.  YAY mom!  I gave her a tour of the hall on Friday and then she and Kate spent the day at Disneyland. When Chris and I went back to the hotel for the hour between his last seminar and our dinner meeting, they still weren't back!  Good stamina, mom!  Friday the hall was noticeably more crowded (it would have been hard not to be) and sales were much improved for us.  This gave me hope for the weekend, so I didn't fret too much about where we were in terms of sales by the end of Friday.  Friday night we joined a group of game industry folks for a fine, fine meal in Downtown Disney (the shopping strip between Disney's theme parks).  Saturday when we arrived at the convention center there were people in line at event registration, and a crowd waiting for the dealer's area to open.  Saturday sales were much more brisk and much more in line with what I'd expect for a strong regional convention.  Not quite as good as Origins, but better than DunDraCon (which has always been a decent show the times I've attended).  We didn't have too many people attend our seminar, but then it wasn't listed in the summary of seminars, so I'm not surprised.  We had many people come by to tell us they were excited about the Red Star announcement, and many people who came by to tell us that one or another game they'd played had been great fun.  TS Luikart and John Polack did a great job of running their events and getting people excited.    Sunday was a typical Sunday, with bursts of sales as people made last minute purchases and then lots of down time.  The GenCon LLC folks announced that there was going to be a collection for Toys for Tots of LA, which had only received a fraction of its usual donations this year.  We ended up donating most of the rest of our remaining stock from the booth, three large boxes worth.  (Chris says he hopes the ""Tots"" are old enough to be roleplayers!)  I didn't get out to examine any of the gaming or seminars that were offered.  There was a special session of the Live Dungeon that was being held for exhibitors after hours, and I heard from people who had a fantastic time and from those who didn't enjoy themselves at all, so I guess reviews are mixed but it sounded like a neat idea to me.  I did have a chance to see some old friends (thanks, Mystery Reader, for the CD of baby pictures!) including having coffee for an hour with fellow-former-Minnesotan Jeff Tidball, who has been sucked back into the game industry via Decipher and The Lord of the Rings RPG.  Mike Pondsmith and I made our annual vow to get together in Seattle instead of seeing each other only at conventions, I saw a very relaxed-and-happy-looking Mark Simmons who seems to be enjoying his retirement from his GAMA Executive Director job.  Honestly, GenCon exceeded my expectations for a first-time convention in that location, at that time of year.  I think the convention has a chance to really grow into something, but it will take a few years to really take hold.  I worry that next year they may suffer a backlash from exhibitors who didn't do as well as Green Ronin did, or those who suffered particularly at the hands of the union, but if those hurdles can be overcome I think there is every reason to support GenCon SoCal.  I think it will do better if people in the region really accept the idea of a four-day convention event as a destination and a thing to do rather than just something you drop by to see for a day.  It was far, far from a ""failure"" just by virtue of having even 3000 people attend, in my opinion.  I've certainly been to dead, dead, dead conventions where there were less than a dozen people in the dealer's room at any given time, for example.  It's not GenCon, it's not Origins, but SoCal is off to a good start and it's certainly got my support."

IE2QDNZ,female,34,"Sick  Damn it all, I'm sick.  Don't think I have a fever, though I can't tell by feel due to the heat in the house tonight. Despite taking cold medicine all day, I've been just miserable.  Nose constantly running, chapped from blowing, lips chapped from mouth-breathing for the last 24 hours, violent sneezing.  I made it through five convention trips in four months (three of those packed into five weeks) but the filthy hoards in Atlanta and the constant, abrupt transitioning from the icy climate control of the indoors to the hot and humid outdoors finally did me in.  I feel like the ""before"" shot in a  urlLink Nyquil commercial .  So, what did I do today?  Rest, relax, sleep in?  Drink lots of fluids and eat chicken soup?  Well, not really.  Caught up with orders that came in during DragonCon, stood in line at the post office, took some packages to Federal Express, did assorted chores in preparation of getting up at 5:00am for my trip to Minnesota.  I feel terrible, but I just  can't miss  this memorial service.  Everyone in my family is going to be there, even my brother and my cousins from far and yon. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't go because of the common cold...and yet my bout with pneumonia after GenCon 2001 taught me that these ""con colds"" can turn into something worse for me almost without warning.    Kate and I did curl up together in my bed to watch  urlLink Shrek  and sip microwaved  urlLink Campbell's Soup at Hand  (so as not to dirty any dishes before leaving home again).  She kept saying, ""We're the sick girls, having a girls' night in.""  Still have to finish packing, so I'd better get to it."
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"Airport  Those who know me have heard me ranting and raging in the past about airline security over the last few years. Ironically, I've been much less irate about airline security since the feds took over the screenings (and since airports installed enough employees and equipment to handle the job). In my most recent travels, I've been screened politely and efficiently by people who speak and understand clear English.  These are appreciated and much needed improvements, necessary for passenger compliance and security.   urlLink This  episode (originating in sweet home Seattle), on the other hand, is really over the line.  People crushing their  urlLink Dixie Chicks  CDs is evidence enough of human hypocrisy and pettiness.  This Seattle baggage incident, though, is EXACTLY why the TSA's  urlLink next step in security screening  is a terrible idea.  Your personal information, credit reports, traffic tickets, goodness knows what else, passing through the hands of anonymous self-righteous ""security screeners"" in order to make a ""security assessment"" before you're allowed to board a plane?  Yikes.  (Yes, I've linked to a lefty news source about CAPPS II.  It's my blog, and I've had enough conservative, war-mongering media for today, so screw it!)  Leaving for Las Vegas in a mere 6 hours.  Suppose I should get to packing... wouldn't want to be late to the airport."
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"Why am I awake?  Since going to England in November, I've been all screwed up.  First, I did something unkind to my back (I think it was hauling the several obscenely heavy suitcases full of books for the Green Ronin convention exhibit all across London on the Underground).  While I was limping around and falling asleep stupidly early, my beloved was suffering the opposite jet lag and was unable to come to bed until I was on the rise.  I joked that we were like those sheep dogs in the cartoon that greet each other ""Hello George,"" as they're crossing paths to punch in/out for work.  No sooner had we righted our schedules than I fell ill and was ill for much of the month of December. I spent much of my so-called holiday feverish and coughing and tossing in sweaty, hallucinatory sleep.  I finally started feeling recovered, well into the month of January, and somewhere along the line I ended up on a bizarro-world schedule that still plagues me.  I wake at 7:45 in order to get my girl dressed, fed, combed, and off to school on the bus.  Some mornings we cut it too close and she doesn't make it to the bus stop in time, so I bundle up, pull a hat down over my head and drive her.  By the time all this ruckus is over, I'm awake again for 3 or 4 hours, and then fatigue sets in and I'm falling asleep on my keyboard, so I have a snooze and try to recover my energy.  After my nap time, I'm ready to ""get started"" on my day, finally eating a meal when most people are considering what they're going to have for supper.  By the time Kate is getting ready for bed, I'm worn out again and often fall asleep in the middle of reading her bedtime story.  Unfortunately, I'm never down for the night, and inevitably I'm awake again an hour or two before midnight.  Wide awake.  This simply can't go on, but I've been too weak to force myself to struggle through the day in order to collapse *once* at a reasonable hour of the night.  Because I'm the only driver in the household, I need to be fresh and clear-headed at the right times in order to make the obligatory treks to the post offices, the bank, the grocery store, and any other errands or chauffeuring of the child/husband that need doing.  There are several potential solutions to this situation, I suppose we'll see how it all resolves itself eventually."
IE2QDNZ,female,34,"How Not to Watch a Movie   A few days ago, my friend JD went to a screening of  urlLink Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World . His experiences there have garnered dozens of entertaining comments.  I'm especially entertained by his companions' utterly goodnatured reactions to the events of the day.  Click on that link. It's more interesting than a report about installing software to fix my Palm Pilot, that's for sure."
9URBXS9,female,27,"This is what we did this weekend:   On Friday I had my Twins Club meeting, afterwards, Gretchen, Barb, Terri, Erin, and this other lady who used to be in the club but isnt now and I forget her name, went to Gretchen's Uncle's coffee shop (downtown Milwaukee, next to Hannon's) to chat.  Remind me never to bring up religion in mixed company that I don't know well.    The lady whos name i dont know (here after referred as ""lady"") has 5 kids (in 5 years) and her husband was going to be ordained but wasnt and so is now just a deacon or whatever at the lutheran church they go to.  We got around to discussing baptism and how we just got our kids done to please our parents etc... The lady apparantly is very devout about her faith and went into this whole ""why did you baptise your kids if you dont believe etc.."" riff.  I also got the ""well do you believe in god"" riff.    I didnt bring it up because I could tell she was getting really pissed but my main problem with organized religion is that YOU (meaning the not me) have to be ""right"" about your (insert religion name here) faith.  YOU then need to browbeat, argue, pamphlet ME showing me how right YOU are.    Arg.   I got home around 11 and crashed.     Saturday we took the girls to the zoo for a twins outting and didnt run into anyone but it was fun for 2 hours or so, the girls liked the monkeys as they came right up to the window to watch the girls.   Sunday my parents took the girls all afternoon to graduation parties.  We went to the Home Depot for supplies and managed to sand and paint the new wall, take the stickers off the new door, scrape more wallpaper off the bathroom, go to the store and get home to kids who hadnt eaten since 11am (it was now like 4:30) except for fruit at the parties..we gave the girls a bath (Malinda has a bad diaper rash) and they were out for the night by 6pmish.   Mya kept waking up and wanting to be cuddled, get a bottle etc...Malinda slept straight through till her new wake up time (thanks kid) 4:15am.  I am a zombie today.  urlLink Mail me!"

4Z06CQK,female,24,"Market value    From MSN Careers  And the next question is, since it's so important, how do you determine your market value?  You start with your compensation and try to ascertain what it should be, the career expert says.  ""Research comparable salaries and find out what the market pays for someone with your skills and background,"" said Lee, whose Web site includes that information. ""Next, determine what your contribution will be or what it is to the company's bottom line--especially anything you have done or can do to generate revenue and cut costs. And finally, show what you bring to the party, your new ideas, how you've figured out a way to work more efficiently and to work harder, and how you are a team player.  ""When you do that, you know your worth to yourself and to the company. You know your market value.""  Lee adds that knowing your market value gives you the confidence to ace a job interview and to get the promotion you want. I asked him if he ever uses ""market value"" himself. ""All the time,"" the executive responded. ""Every day. I'm happy and challenged.""  If you want to be happy like Lee in this tight and competitive labor market, it's very important to ascertain and list all your attributes. Here are some you might have forgotten that really can make a difference in whether or not you get the job or the promotion. So don't forget to state:  - I pay for and bring a box of delicious doughnuts for the entire staff at least once a week.  - I know all the best restaurants within a six-block area.  - I always hang my coat or jacket in the closet instead of draping it over my chair or desk.  - I am the world's best employee.  - I never brag."

4Z06CQK,female,24,"From Reuters today    LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pop star Michael Jackson, facing a trial on child molestation charges, is about to become a father to four more children -- quadruplets -- by way of a surrogate mother, Us Weekly magazine reported on Tuesday.  Citing unnamed sources close to the self-proclaimed ""King of Pop,"" the magazine said Jackson recently spent time with the pregnant mother-to-be in Florida, where he stayed in a $4,000-a-night luxury hotel suite in Miami Beach.  The magazine said Jackson's spokeswoman Raymone Bain declined to confirm or deny the story, saying, ""We do not respond to these kinds of stories.""  Bain could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.   Jackson, 45, already has three children -- Prince Michael I and daughter Paris Michael by his former wife, Debbie Rowe, and Prince Michael II, the child he notoriously dangled from the balcony of a Berlin hotel in November 2002.   Jackson later revealed in a television documentary that Prince Michael II had been born to a woman who was essentially a stranger to him. ""I used a surrogate mother and my own sperm cells,"" he told British interviewer Martin Bashir. ""She doesn't know me."""

Right now I am really just starting.  First I have to buy some land, which I will do by buying 2 acres from my uncle.  I will be closing this deal with the bank on Monday!   In the mean time, I have been looking at designs for building homes.  I was looking into both log cabins and stick built (wood) homes.  I've been meeting several places and people about log cabins these past few weeks.  I decided not to go with a log cabin because the insurance is very high for them, being both a fire hazard and acceptable to termites.  So, it's come down to deciding on a stick built house.  I found a lot of designs for them.  I found a website,  urlLink Homeplans.com , and found several that I liked.  I think the one that I most like is this,  urlLink Plan # VL-947 , a Victorian style 2 Bed, 1 Bath home.  I'm sure I'll tweak it here and there but the plan should stay the same.  There were other plans that I like too so it is hard to decide right now on which one I like.  I keep changing my mind with this. So those that are reading this, go check out both the website and take a look at the plans.  I'm mainly looking for something less than a 1000 sq. ft, with 2 bed and 1 bath.  I would like to hear all of you all's opinons?"

I wore yellow makeup, made the big bulging eyes, and a mask for the mouth.  We had a contest at work, and everybody voted for either Funniest, Scariest, and Most Original costume.  I happen to lose by one vote for the Most Original.  I could have tied but I seem to have voted for someone else for Most Original and voted for myself for Funniest.  I could kick myself for that. As for that night, all I did was go over to a co-workers place for  a couple of hours.  I then planned on going to Buffalo Wild Wings, where a couple of coworkers were planning on going, but at the last second, I wasn't feeling very well because I needed to get the bald cap off my head and the make up off, since I had it on all day.  Well, yesterday I learned that they had the craziest time there so I'm kicking myself for not going.  Saturday was the usually working on something.  While my cousin Danny was still excavating my property, I worked on my uncle Willie's place.  Did some sanding and put oil on a bench that they found in the woods.  Was expecting to go to another Halloween party that my cousins were going too but was feeling sore after all sanding.  Again, I just keep finding excuses or reasons to not go!  Sunday, I went to church.  Afterwards, I went out on a Sunday drive with Loreley.  Spent most of the day just driving around Orange, Greene, and Louisa counties.  I actually got to see the town of Louisa for the first time in my life, and I have lived only 20 minutes away."

My Uncle keeps telling me every time he used to ask me what my name was, I would always say Fishy when I was 4 24.  My family loves telling stories about how I love chocolate and Dr. Pepper 25.  I asked my aunt once if I could have some Dr. Pepper, she told me I could, and I drank a whole 2 litter bottle by myself 26.  Im a picky eater 27.  The only vegetables I like are green beans and mash potatoes 28.  I went through kindergarten twice, because I was too young the first time. 29.  I meet Brook Steere in kindergarten 30.

I named him after seeing him climbing up curtains 35.  He died a few months later....not my fault! 36.  I moved into my current house in 1985....still there! 37.  Right after we moved in, my grandfather died. 38.  It was the only time I saw my father cry. 39.  Im still miffed that I didnt go his funeral but I was only 7 years old! 40.

Oddly, I had meet her at a wedding years before and didnt remember 79.  We dated for a couple of months 80.  I had my first taste of alcohol after my 21st birthday 81.  My friend Ryan made a movie of all our friends called Hijinx 82.  It showed us throwing TVs and computer monitors off buildings, blowing up things, and breaking into the cafeteria 83.  He also gave me my nickname, Crispy, because he just wanted too 84.  I thought it was either because my last name is Rice, first name Chris or because every time my mother came to visit, she would bring Rice Crispy Treats 85.  In January of 1999, I went on a class trip to Andros Island in the Bahamas for two weeks 86.  It was arguably the best time I went to anywhere even though the place I stayed at was shitty 87.  There were large brown spiders, ants, lizards, and roaches in the rooms 88.  Before we came, a dog had puppies and I could hear them whining everynight 89.  They had a wedding reception for three nights under us 90.  After I graduated, I worked at the Monticello ticket office for several months 91.  Until I got a job at the local SPCA (kennel) 92.

He actually owned several hundred movies and books and I get to have all of them.  So once I finish my house, I will have an entire library of movie memorabilla!  Hehe....quite impressive I must say! So after church today, we all went to the home show at UVa.  I was able to go through a lot of showcases for several products in lookiong into what I can use for my house.  I was quite impressed with the selection they had.  However, I have to say that my mom put it out best about our skills in knowing about home construction when she told my father that she and I were dummies at this and that my father was the one to really know what to ask and look for!  I had to agree with her since I know nothing of what to ask or look for in home construction, though there were a few things I liked! Actually, at one point, my mom embarrased me!  I was going through some of the showcases, where one had a young redhead assisting a vendor.  I told my mom about this young woman with her gorgeous blue eyes, and my she said that she would go over to her and tell her that.  I thought she was kidding and told her not too.  However, in our second time around the place, she actually went over to the girl and told her what I said.  HOLY SHIT!!!  I couldn't believe that she actually told the girl that I thought she was beautiful!  When my mom came back over, she told me that she wasn't married but was in a committed relationship!  I was just so embarassed about it!!!  God, I'm not telling anything anymore! So I'm going to have to rummage through some of the stuff within the next few months and decide what I like.  I know I'm going to get a couple headaches in the coming months!  I hope it will be worth it! After coming home, I got an email from my friend Kristina asking if anybody wanted to come with her to a Dave Matthew's Concert in September.  I really want to go!  I'm sure no one knows this but I have never been to a concert before!  Also, no one has ever asked me to come to a concert with them before!  I would love to go but I'm worried about my financial situation, such as putting a new transmission on my car or with the house!  Hopefully, I can find someway to go!"
7LDQB34,male,26,"Loans and Cleaning   My bank called yesterday to tell me that I can get the loan on buying my uncle's trailer and land.  However, to my disappointment it was a bit less than I hope for.  The bank offered to give me the loan for 80 percent of the appriased value of my uncles land and then I would have to pay the 20 percent as a down payment.  Let's just say that the amount that it is needed for my down payment is six thousand more than I have!   However, when I got home last evening, my parents had a talk with me.  They told me that if I could get another 1000 with what I have in the next month, which I'm sure I could since I just got a raise, they would lend me the five thousand with that.  Let's just I was overjoyed with this news!  But now the real fun begins with getting everything in order!  My folks are warning me that I'm going to get many headaches!  But in a year hopefully, I'll have my own house.  Anyway, last night, after that, I just relaxed on the couch watching the season premiere of  Farscape  and  Stargate: SG1 .  While I was watching the shows, my cat Tink comes down to lay down on me and sleeps on my chest the whole time.  Actually watching these shows, I noticed Tink was just flat out passed out!  When I picked up her head, it was limp and at first I though she was dead!  However, when I went to pick up, she woke up crying!  Whew...I was glad to know she didn't die on me!  She must have been dead tired.....excuse the pun!  This morning I helped clean up the house.  I spent the morning cleaning the bathrooms (not the best job in the world), mopping the kitchen and bathroom floors, and the task of cleaning between the tiles near the front door foyer with a toothbrush!  We found later that we have a new house coming up beside us and they were clearing the land.  We sudden found out that while they were clearing the land, they cut the cable that was in the ground and we could not watch cable!!!  We sufficite to say we survived but my father wasn't able to watch the basketball game this morning!  HOwever, it has now been fixed and we can now watch tv!!!"

7LDQB34,male,26,"I just had a little insight for a quote!  ""Fight fire with fire and fire keeps burning.  Fight fire with water, the fire becomes extinguished""    I know...it sounds a bit sappy but I thought about it when I was reading another journal.  The person in this journal was angry over an opinion that was written in a paper.  This person was going to write back to the paper with her opinion by arguing why it's wrong and using very explicit language.  It just occurs to me that we never solve anything if we do what the old saying does when we ""fight fire with fire"" right?  What is that we solved by doing that.    I guess at moment, I can help but think about the song ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel."

It's been said before, it will be said again, but high school sure did suck.  Particularly, this show makes me realize that at the time I had no idea that it sucked as bad as it did.  There was nothing to compare it to, I guess, and no concrete reason to expect that life would get better.  It was almost like I knew I would either acclimate to suffering for have my proverbial  urlLink liver eaten daily by a hawk .  (The Teenager as stoic?  That's fucked.  I can't possibly mean that, not really.  But  something  is keeping these kids from suicide.)  But even if half the equation is getting better at life, the other half is not being terrorized, daily, by sundry assholes.  There are assholes in adult life too, of course.  But something about them seems easier to deal with.  Their behavior is more predictable, for one.  And they tend not to punch.     Yeah.

N6J7KCU,male,25,"Pete and I have taken a break from writing, mostly because all we do now is correspond to each other with new and improved band names, some better than our previous ones. Perhaps we should set up a web site selling cool, highly literate band names to hapless musicians. We could charge 1 USD for mawkish yet still reliable names, like The Cutters, Bristol City, or Quick Kick; then up the ante to as much as 20 USD for supercharged and brand-ready names, like The Drop Shadows, Screwtape, and The Away Jerseys. We'd keep the middle-of-the-road-names, still guaranteed to pique the curiousity of hipsters but not promise them anything, hovering around 10 USD, names like Stately Plump and Shipwreck. Pete and I would make a killing. It's a buyer's market.   I should give a link. Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings (his fan moniker ""KenJen"") has only two more days to go before Jeopardy shuts down for the season, and the show's producers have to decide to bring him back as a returning champ next season, since he hasn't been beaten yet. He's won like 34 days in a row, and has been basically untouchable. I caught one episode where he closed out three straight categories. Plus, he's Mormon. There have been many responses to KenJen's wrath, but i like  urlLink the drinking games ."
N6J7KCU,male,25,"Frank and (a Hill of ) Beans   Brian Daubach, my favorite '01 Dirt dog, has been given the pink slip to make room for no one's favorite '01 Dirt dog, Frank Castillo.  I went to four or five games at Fenway that season and by some creul twist of fate, Frankie pitched every  one, losing all.  (In games, I have attended, the Sox are something like 1-15.  I know.  I'll avoid the world series in Chicago.  My karma is generally bad.  I lose all my money within fifteen minutes of entering a casino.  I am cosmically fucked in everyway that doesn't really matter.)  I trust that Theo knows something I don't, but even if we do have a glut of bench bats and a dearth of long relief, I can think of at least three guys to get rid of before Dauber(McCarty, Crespo, Jones).  I suppose this is temporary until Kim is back and Arroyo can return to the pen, but let's look at a career  comparison between Daubach and McCarty, the two most comparable bench players as DH/1B, OF in a pinch, type of guys:                                                     BA/OBP/SLG/OPS  Daubach      .262  .342  .480   .822    McCarty       .240  .301  .366   .668   And, Daubach is two years younger.  Granted, McCarty can technically pitch, but I'd rather have a hitter with consistently decent numbers and a pitcher than a mediocre hitter who can technically throw a strike and a pitcher.  After all, this move is all about avoiding situations in which we have to take a position player off the bench and onto the mound, right?  The day we come to rely on McCarty for his pitching is the day I throw a shoe at my television.  Hard."

It is incredibly unlikely that anyone reading this would simultaneously care, not know already, and be able to attend, but I am giving a reading tonight at The Mill in Iowa City at 9 pm along with Poet Steve Kramp.  If you are one of the few, please come.  The estimable Jane Roper and Jared Stanley will provide introductions.  If anyone is wondering why Scott is so uncharacteristically quiet lately, it's because he just got a job, inexplicably, at  urlLink Poetry Magazine .  Yes, that  urlLink Poetry Magazine , and no, I can't explain how this happened.  So he's busy and all, but he also needs our help.    When asked what poets he likes, the best Scott was able to tell his shaggy and bespectacled co-workers was that he digs Denis Johnson and Jim Morrison.  Okay- he didn't say the last one, but he might as well have, they were so unimpressed.  So:  what poets should Scooter read and/or claim to have read?  There's employment on the line here, people.  I listed the poetry faculty for him here at the workshop,but that is a short supply of names and it will probably run out by the end of the week.    In comments, please complete the following sentence:  ""Hi.  My name is Scott.  No, it's okay, you don't remember my name.  Really.  I was reading the poetry of _______ this weekend and I was really impressed by the manner in which he/she used _________ to convey_________.  It's ___________, really.""  I'll put all your answers on notecards and mail them to Scott so he can practice in front of the mirror.  But seriously, folks.  Scott's Impeccable congratulations is a little overdue:  good work, bro.  And yes, I am razzing him a bit.  I know few people who would be more at home working for a lit mag."

P1L9N2X,male,37,"REVISIONIST HISTORY INDEED  Dana Milbank, one of the few Washington beat reporters with a clue,  urlLink documents  Bush's changing tone on Iraq: President Bush, revising his earlier characterization of the fighting in Iraq, said in an interview released yesterday that combat operations are still underway in that country.   In an interview with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service given on Thursday and released by the White House yesterday, Bush interrupted the questioner when asked about his announcement on May 1 of, as the journalist put it, ""the end of combat operations.""  ""Actually, major military operations,"" Bush replied. ""Because we still have combat operations going on."" Bush added: ""It's a different kind of combat mission, but, nevertheless, it's combat, just ask the kids that are over there killing and being shot at.""  In his May 1 speech on the USS Abraham Lincoln, Bush declared: ""Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country."" The headline on the White House site above Bush's May 1 speech is ""President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended."" Since then, a search of Bush speeches on the White House Web site indicates, the president had not spoken of the guerrilla fighting in Iraq as combat until this interview; he had earlier spoken of the ""cessation of combat"" in Iraq. It turns out that the White House has gone back and changed the title of the president's famous speech on th U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, changing the 'Combat Operations' to 'Major Combat Operations.'

P1L9N2X,male,37,"THE OTHER MARRIAGE AMENDMENT  A letter writer to the Washington Post (via Sully) reminds us of another amendment proposed to the constitution.  This one was proposed by Rep. Seaborn Roddenberry (D-Ga.) in 1912.  It reads: Intermarriage between negros or persons of color and Caucasians ... within the United States ... is forever prohibited. In defense of his amendment he is  urlLink quoted as saying : ""Intermarriage between whites and blacks is repulsive and averse to every sentiment of pure American spirit. It is abhorrent and repugnant. It is subversive to social peace. It is destructive of moral supremacy, and ultimately this slavery to black beasts will bring this nation to a fatal conflict"" (Gilmore, 1975, p.108). That quote is so shocking that I debated whether or not to post it, but it is important to remember such sentiments as we face the anti-gay bigotry so prevalent today.

P1L9N2X,male,37,"THOSE TREASONOUS LIBERALS   Andrew Sullivan continues on the theme espoused by many conservatives that are not as extreme and dishonest as Ann Coulter, that all the criticism of the war from the left is coming from ""Anti-Western"" liberals who just think that anything having to do with American power is bad.  He dismisses all criticism as "" urlLink petty politics from people who are still pissed they lost the war over the war .""  He has  urlLink noted : These people, it's worth remembering, believe that the exercise of American military power is almost always more morally problematic than any foreign tyranny or even a serious security threat to the homeland. They can only justify American military power if it is wielded under imminent, grave danger that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. He continues that theme today with a  urlLink post  from blogger  urlLink Norman Geras  about how the Anti-Western left is rooting for setbacks (and presumably more American deaths) in Iraq.  While it may make Mr. Sullivan feel better to dismiss all criticism as knee-jerk anti-western lefty peacenik bitterness, it is not the case and to do so may hinder progress of the reconstruction of Iraq.  It is untrue that it is only Democrats that are expressing concern about Iraq policy, Republican  urlLink Senator Richard Lugar  complained that the administration is not being honest about the true costs of the reconstruction: Because of some combination of bureaucratic inertia, political caution and unrealistic expectations left over from the war, we do not appear to be confident about our course in Iraq. Fred Kaplan  urlLink notes  today in  urlLink Slate  that there are signs that the administration is acutely aware that things in Iraq are not going well, he notes two things:   The 3rd Infantry Division, apparently in response to disparaging remarks made to reporters about the political leadership by some soldiers, will no longer accept embedded reporters.   The bizarre series of leaks over the weekend speculating that the administration was going to try to get James Baker III, or a Baker-like figure, to become involved in the recontruction of Iraq at a high level (it now appears that  urlLink this will not happen  despite the hopes of some in the administration). Does Mr. Sullivan may prefer to stick his head in the sand and assume that   urlLink everything is going just fine  if only the mainstream media would report it?  Apparently so, and any if anyone thinks that the Bush administration planning and policy on post-war Iraq is anything but perfect, it's just sour grapes.  The probelm here is that many of the assumptions from the neocon circles in the administration about post-war Iraq have turned out to be wrong, and it is quite clear that the administration continues to downplay the length and depth of commitment that will be required for a successful reconstruction of Iraq.  I agree that, at this point, nothing is more important than the successful rebuilding and the creation of a free society with a representative government in Iraq.  For this to work, Bush may have to do some things, such as go to the U.N. to gain more international credibility and more international troops and start preparing the American public for a long and costly occupation, which many in his administration will resist.  Bush will only consider such action if he feels pressure to do so, and that pressure is unlikely to come from within the administration anytime soon.  Let me be clear, I want this to work, I hope they find Saddam soon, this is more important than whether or not Bush is re-elected.  However, covering your ears and repeating to yourself over and over ""everything is just fine"" is not a strategy likely to succeed."

P1L9N2X,male,37,"MORE EVIDENCE  If you needed it about the mendacity of this administration.  Below I have posted a customer review of John Dean's book about Bush,  Worse Than Watergate  that was posted on the Amazon.com site.  The review can be found  urlLink here , I was directed to it by a commenter from Kevin Drum's Washington Monthly blog.  It speaks for itself. Bush is mendacious, vengeful, and unpatriotic, April 12, 2004   Reviewer: Matthew Maly from New Haven, CT  I salute John Dean for having written this book and find everything it it very believable and most important for all of us to know.  Four years ago, I did what my contract with the US government expressly called for: reported my suspicions that a felony may have been committed in the course of administering a strategically important US grant. The Department of Defense (very reluctantly) conducted an audit that proved my main allegation: disappearance of $20M that caused the entire program to lose its functionality and eventually to close.  After my letter was received, I was immediately blacklisted for US assistance positions, my bank accounts were frozen for seven months without any reason whatsoever, and my family was driven to penury, having to pawn all our possessions. The program died quietly, most of its money stolen or mismanaged, but there is one thing left to do: take credit for this program's ""success"". In his recent speech at the National Defense University, Bush said, ""We're helping former Soviet states find productive employment for former weapons scientists."" Bush is referring to Defense Enterprise Fund (DEF), a venture capital fund financed by the US Congress. DEF was supposed to convert Russian WMD establishments while simultaneously realizing profit from high-technology joint ventures. Please use the words ""Defense Enterprise Fund"" if you wish to find the relevant website.  According to the Audit that I forced the Department of Defense to conduct, having sacrifices my professional career, if not my life, for it, DEF spent half of its grant on itself, which is twenty five times the industry average. As far as DEF's investment portfolio of $30M, $20M disappeared from it under very suspicious circumstances, exactly as I alleged.  Defense Threat Reduction Agency (""DTRA"") maintains a DEF-related webpage. This page used to state that the number of former Soviet WMD scientists converted by DEF to peaceful pursuits was 3370. I questioned this figure and DTRA reduced it to 1250, which is a 66% reduction. But the real figure could not be more than 200 Russian scientists. This is how Bush tells you ""the truth""! And these are precisely the scientists we wanted to keep away from Al Queda!  DEF was closed as of December 31, 2003, its entire $67M grant lost, and nobody was punished, except the whistleblower.  Remember the anthrax scare? Well, the world's biggest producer of militarized anthrax and small pox (even scarier), the Vector Plant of Novossibirsk, Russia, came to DEF asking for just one million to convert itself. But the money was already gone! Read the audit! $100K for a golf club, $150K housing allowance swindle, Concorde flights, and on, and on, and on - until all the money is gone! Does that look to you as conversion of the Russian weapons of mass destruction? As DEF employee I did everything I could, in house, to prevent DEF's demise, and wrote my letter only when there was no other option. I wanted to save this program, save American lives, and because of it I am being destroyed, assassinated by this Administration.  I am a Republican, and I like the idea of small government and individual liberties. But Bush is no Republican as he stands for Big Surveillance and an even Bigger Lie. If you care about America being secure from weapons of mass destruction, please remember my story when you vote in November."
P1L9N2X,male,37,"REPUBLICAN ECONOMICS  The New York Times has a quote from Tom DeLay  urlLink discussing  why the GOP rejected a Democratic amendment that would have required any more tax cuts be offset by spending increases (to see how close it was and how they had to break the rules to do it, go  urlLink here .) ""We, as a matter of philosophy, understand that when you cut taxes the economy grows, and revenues to the government grow,"" Mr. DeLay said. ""The whole notion that you have to cut spending in order to cut taxes negates that philosophy, and so I'm not interested in something that would negate our philosophy."" So there you have it.  GOP economic policy is based simply on their philosophy.  It doesn't matter if cutting taxes increases government revenue in  reality , as long as they hold true to their philosophy, nothing matters.  So I guess that, philosophically speaking, the deficit doesn't really exist.  This truly is faith-based economics. We really need some adults in charge."

I mean c'mon now... we dont get a long, we argue, [ but wat couple d0esnt?] but he's only happy when hes getting what he wants... and like if i say something about how he acts, he'll be like what are you talking about, like he'll ignore me or be like ' get away from me ' and hella act like he doesnt wanna be around me, that shit hella makes me mad, and hes just hella shut-offish toward me all the time and wont talk about anything, and then if i get mad he finds a way to put it all on me, and i gotta all ask for hugs and all and we were on the phone and i was asking him hella questions about how he felt about us and alla this and he was like ' oh whatever i dont wanna break up with u na na na , then i asked him if he liked being single, and he was like yeah , when we dont get along, and i was like how long has it been since you can say we've gotten along, how many days in a row have we argued? he was like , we argue everyday and i was like what'd be so bad about us being apart, and he was like i'm used to the routine, what the fuck is that!!? you feel i'm not happpy in our relationship, but i know that i woulndt be happy if we break up. I mean we sit on the phone , from like 4 - 10 and talk maybe about 45 minutes out of the whole time. Hes sweet when HE WANTS TO BE. when he feels like it, and really , i'm tired of it.   Well anyways.. that shit just pisses me off so i dont know what to say/do about it.  So i'm wearin my glasses right, and it makes my computer look hella clearer.. its great , well i'm out... bbyez"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well I have LOTS to write, so prepare yourself for mixed emotions... wait I have to tell you what I mean when I say that...  It's like seeing your mother-in-law driving off a cliff... in your new beamer...  Well first off, I need to write how funny it was yesterday. Me and Iand left to see Tabby, I can now officially say that the Metro has not died!!! No, it was mended by nothing other than... BLACK TAPE!!!Oh the joys of having a pathetic but yet cute car... We went to Letty's and then she came out with us for a while, so we called on Tabby then just ended up walking to Safeways... twas brilliant fun, we were gonna go choir singing and jump through the carwash... that is so my dream... We walked back and Ian was trying to hijack, but no one took notice of him! When we got back to Letty's estate she had to go in because she had this big family meal kind of thing. We just stayed outside, we rang Leon, I panicked, we saw Kev, he was going to shoot someone because they smoked two of his fags. Then we went to the park and Dave and his crew came, when I saw crew I mean Benett (cough cough, TWAT! We never get on...) Dave and Shaun Cholwill (my friends cousin). They went off looking for gnomes and stuff and never came back...  After that Ian and Tabby started smashing the beer bottles... I started panicking because it was in a park so I said : ""Think of the children!""... then Tabby had a blonde moment and said ""Yeah, it might wake them up"", LMAO! She's so cute! Then we heard the ice cream van. so Ian bought 5 drumstick lollies, in which he shared. We then stayed in the phone box, then Ian discovered the bush...  He kept bouncing into it, me and Tabby started to join in, then we ended up having a Charlie's Angel bounce and everything... Tabby seemed to find it hilarious that I said... Lets find some more bush to bounce!!!...  Letty came out then we went Knock-A-Door-Running round the estate... I found it extremely scary! I only did one...  Tabby had to go in then Ian went then me and Letty went in. We watched this hilarious thing, Tom Green in Japan. Dude! I was in stitches, he's my idol!!! After watching that Muse - Time Is Running Out kept coming on! So the good day ended in a good way... hehe that rhymes!!! We went ti bed about 1-2.  As we all laid down, Alana said how she missed Rich, he has to go to a college in Nottingham and he left yesterday. So me and Letty joined in. She said how much she missed Steve-O ( a pick of an ex boyfriend who she loves) and I said how much I missed Sammy. I know we never had a relationship, but I sure did love him, I think I still do. Well I need to write some really important stuff now.   Tabby   I know that life may upset you, but because your such a good friend it hurts me to see you upset, I know it's hard but please cheer up, and stop arguing with your parents!   Leon   I hardly know you, but yet I feel I've known you for years, your that kind of guy. Remember you only live once, just go for that girl, because you sure as hell have got that potential! If she doesn't go with you, she must be crazy! Cheer up aswell, you guys make me worry!   Sammy   Oh, where do I start!  I miss the way we wrote little notes to eachother in maths I miss the way no matter what mood I was in previously, you always had a way that made me smile I miss the way I used to glare at you out of jealousy because of the girls that surrounded you I miss the way that when it was a p.e lesson, we always met up and went down Letty's, and ate her food whether she was their or not Concluding from the previous point, I miss the sandwiches you made! I miss the way that when we walked back to school you would continuously trip me up and find it funny I miss the way we do absolutely nothing in Mr Ryan's lesson, just laugh all the way through it, and copy Daniel in the process I miss you telling me to touch Daniel's crotch I miss the way you would always back chat Mr Bradbury, and sometimes we'd break up into laughter because we actually thought he had heard it I miss being moved! I miss walking up to Safeways singing: ""I'm walking in shit again, woah woah woah..."" I miss excitedly running up to Pugwash hugging him... I miss rushing to the cookies to grab the final one I miss queueing up for chips whilst laughing myself to tears I miss getting my mustard :( I miss, oh wait a sec, I must appreciate this moment, Iris is playing........... ""I'd give up forever to touch you..."" O, lets carry on... I miss the way I was obsessed with your Lilo and Stitch impression I miss the adrenaline rush in a lesson, because I know that I'll be with you next I miss the fact that when I knew I wouldn't see you for a while, I'd run up to you, and wrap my legs round you whilst hugging I miss the feeling of never wanting to let go I miss rushing home in order to phone you I miss the way I'd change my previous plans to be with you, like when I went to the panto I miss the 5 hour long conversations we had I miss singing along to your keyboard playing I miss ""watching"" the films together, when we were actually talking on the phone I miss discussing the funny moments in music videos, like the fat lady dancing on Busted, and the drugged up boy that smiles in The Idols's video I miss my dad making me hang up when it came to 2 in the morning and I was still on the phone I miss the fact that one time it came to an hour, so we hung up, I didn't ring you back straightaway because I needed the toilet, within 10 seconds of hanging up, you'd rang my house phone wondering what I was doing. 10 seconds. But most of all I miss what all the above build up to, our friendship   Sammy, I love you"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Hey. Last night was pretty cool. My bestest mate in the hole wide world  urlLink     urlLink   , well yeah... Ian rang me and we talked about Sunday, he's going to come round mine after church and then were going to dress up really proper  urlLink   , I can't wait! On the phone I told him to go online so I could talk to him for longer. As we were talking I noticed that he wasn't writing back to me very fast, so I asked him who else he was talking to and he said Bowie, I told him to add him to the conversation, so at the end of the night I was reunited with the love of my life from 5 years ago! And I had made 4 friends! Me and Russ were talking until 3. It was well cool. He's helped me to become a ""holy"", he prayed for me, so now I'm working on it, and I'm trying at it really hard aswell. I've seen the others, they are all seem so happy, I want to be like that. I want the relationship.  urlLink   , hehe! That means God is great, which he is! Well nothing happened today, but my Mommi bought me the Muse album  urlLink    Oh I love her!!! Well better be going xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Tabby, thank you for the answers, but is it toffee fingers or toffee pennies you like? And the best way to die on the sims is make them swim then take away the steps... or put them in a room and take away the door... all great fun!!!  urlLink   . I might go up Safeways later to get my photos developed, don't know yet. Take care hunnies xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well todays been cool, I woke up again to my mum ringing me.  urlLink http://www.candystand.com/games/cs_shock_cscd.htm  , just to annoy Mark! Anyway... Mum offered me coffee again, so I got a lift. Then I got to school and spoke to Tabby, she seemed a bit upset, I think it's about her mum waking her up, or not waking her up, she'll write about it in her blog, it'll make more sense! First lesson was art. Luke kept making this really weird noise,  Shebby...   I ofund it hilarious! We got to paint our sculptures in white paint, next lesson we're gonna paint the base of it black and white checkered, the points into a rainbow and the people, I dunno, but it will be fun :)  Second lesson was history, another very funny lesson! I've nearly catched up on the pages with Clur, just one and a half more to do!!! I can't actually remember it... wierd. I just love writing! And Clur panicked so much....again.  At break me, Clur and Tabby went into the hall. Tabby seemed offish, Sammy won't let me sing in the Linkin Park thing, it's rude! He kept making jokes that I didn't get!   Third lesson was science with Mr Bradbury. Again ver funny, I think it's all teh hair sprouting out of his ears that makes him not hear Sammy's evil comments. Even when he was talking to Sammy he didn't hear tehm.. weird! Me and Sammy told him we hated him as we walked out...  Fourth lesson was english, on the way there I tried persuading Sammy to bunk with me, but he refused, then later when I gto int he classroom, Sir wasn't there, how rude??? SoI had to write this huge essay thing, it sucks! Frankie text me half way through the lesson, she's finally back from holiday! She said she was going to pick em up from school.. how cool? My life is complete, both Frankie and Ian are back!!!   At lunch me and Tabby went up to Safeways, Clur and Sammy went with eachother, I think it's pathetic walking like 2 foot away from us, we're all good mates, but yet we never associate with eachother. Me and Tabby bought fullon munchimoos, it was great! Then we tried to sit with Sammy and Clur but they pushed us away saying that they wanted to talk. So we sat with Kayley and her crew. WOW! Hey Ya's playing...   We had extended form time, Isobel Mill walked into my hand with her crotch, it was disturbing! Then Michaela did this really weird thing with her hand, it was sooooooo funny! All the way through form I couldn't stop laughing! so Sir sent me out the room for 20 minutes, how rude!!! Sammy walked past and apolagised, then he went somewhere :S.  Last lesson was I.T, Sir totally wants me!!! I was being pretty loud and irritating! I always am in that lesson... I've gotta stop doing that!   Well at the end of school Frankie met me and me, her and Clur (Edwards) walked to Spar, picked up  Frankies wages, then Frankie got fags and we walked home. Now I'm on here, I love Rik!!!  Love y'all Jessxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well last night was pretty poopy. Met up with Letty (IN THE END!!!), after going to Tabby's.  Then we went to town. then we came home, went to sleep. Then I woke up today and called on Tabby. She's staying over.  Got to go, dinsdins ready. Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well todays been as normal as any other Monday... First lesson was art. I sure have missed that lesson! It was pretty fun being back with them guys again. We got to cover our toilet roll figures in that wierd plaster stuff... Anna said somethings that I found quite funny...  I don't like giving head, the man's penis is so ugly!  I don't see why men like tits, all they are is blobs of fat...  Second lesson was English... Before I actually went into the lesson I saw Air, he said ""Alrite Fish""...he's sooooooo nice. In the lesson I nearly fell asleep! It was soooo boring! And for homework, we have to draw what we think the island looks like... how fun? At break me and Clur hung out, we had laughs, then we walked to science, then went into science! Sammy was doing the whole going cross eyed thing, I yet again couldn't stop laughing! I asked him if he was going to p.e next, but obviously he wasn't, so at the end of that lesson, we went down Letty's. On the way down we panicked, we were trying to cross the road real quickly because we didn't wanna get caught bunking... but cars kept on coming! Then, as we finally managed to cross, we walked through the park, and the pigs drove past, so in utter panic we ripped our clothes off and pretended we were 6th formers. It worked quite well... when we got to Letty's we listened to his cd, I deeply recommend number 7, by whoever it is! It's well nice... Sammy did these weird trick things bout your arm rising and falling through the floor... overall, pretty freaky! We walked back to school found Clur (in the end) and then we went up safeways, was pretty boring! I had to wear white trousers because my others had had a ""mishap"", or so my mum says... well, there's mud all over them, thanks to the rain and Sammy. There's even mud going up the front of them. Well I gaev Sir most of my sweets when I gto back into form, he called me a star... I must of looked good today... he wasn't the only teacher flirting with me...  Last lesson was maths. As Tabby wasn't there I was completely deserted because Sammy and Clur decided to completely ignore me... I was talking to Ben, I gave Rich my email addy, so hopefully he'll add me :) Me and Ben talked about music, he said I can sing Blurry by Puddle Of Mudd, but I sound like I'm getting strangled when I sing Away In A Manger...  Sir said that if anyone was naughty then they would have to be punished and have to sit at the front, next to me. I gave him the most evil, but yet sexy glare!lmao! Then when he had finished talking to the class I said to him that I resented the comment he had just said, he apolagised, then I said I should hit him, so I got Ben's long ruler, then Sir goes yes you should, so I said bend over!!! OMGOSH!!! I can't believe I said that! I wa flirting with my maths teacher, you should of seen the smiles we were giving each other... I went home to Letty's, and we watched Loser. He's got Air's hat!!! And I yet again, wrote down notes that I liked...   You don't need flea medication do you? I dunno... he has slept with alot of dogs...    Your my asshole buddy!    Well that's about all form me  Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Hey I'm back. I didn't do anything yesterday. Today wasn't much different either. I got credit, texted just about everyone! Tidied a bit of my room... my Uncle and his Girlfriend came down today, I've turned ever so shy!  I know I must sound the most pathetic person in the world but I really want to go back to school! I miss everyone! I miss meeting Clur and Tabby for break, I miss my scarf being confiscated, I miss being told to shut up constantly in every maths lesson, I miss being completely ignored by my English teacher, I miss saying ""Hi Harry"" every time I walked past him... I miss looking for the basket with the sachets of mustard in. But overall, I miss my friendships. I haven't seen any of my special mates this holiday and I just have this aching pain. I love you guys so much! I may not show it, but you guys are my life, you're the ones that got me here today, your the people who make me who I am, I appreciate it so much. Take care guys I love you Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well today's been cool, walked to school with Frankie, arrived and was kind late, oh well. First lesson was p.e, tabby tried to hit the ball as a retard would of...I won't say anymore. It was generally fun, the singing and stuff.  Second lesson was business, I didn't do any work, just emailed len and Rik constantly, I'm sure they enjoyed the fact that I did this. And I'm sorry I have to stop writing about my boring life because of Kris. He can say one thing and it pisses you off! No wonder why he deleted his blog. Arg! Well yeah, the rest of my day was highly boring. meh meh meh  Toodlefeekingpipxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Hey I don't know y I'm doing this. But it Looks kind of fun in a shocking kind of way. Anyway, to tell you bout me I don't know where 2 start. I I'm probably deranged in the head, as I have a dent - but people keep telling me that its just the soft spot on the head... ANYWAY!!!Yeah... I love chickens. They are the most intelligent and cute of ALL animals, they will rule the world one day! Yeah, and next time you go to McDonald's, please, please, please, put on a scottish accent and say: McChoken burger please? That would jus be immaculate (just like ma teeth) he he! I also love Rainbows and the Goo Goo Dolls, which is kind of ironic because Goo Goo Dolls sing a song named Iris, and it is such a beautiful song... and I looked in the baby book and guess what iris means -  RAINBOW! It's a sign! Well ill write more tomorrow because I'm kind of pooped! thats all folks *snort snort and laugh in a piggish sort of way...* ain't n e of u guys seen that? its fabulous sweet dreams n take care love u ma little lepricorns! plop xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well todays been poopy. Woke up went to the toilet and er...well I wasn't going to school lets put it that way! So yeah, I've just spent the whole day on the computer, I dunno what to do with my life, my friendship with my older relationships is getting strong again, it's great. I might be back to the old Jess soon enough.  Well nothing else to say, apart from, MEW. Ok that was lame...  Toodlepipxxxxxxxx"
KZNN0AI,female,15,"Well I had to wake up proper early, arg! Had the good old coffee though. Went on the bus, to see Chrystynay there, but no Corrin. Well I've bought lots of munchimoos, the days been pretty poopy, that girls dance is making me laugh again.  Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Hey I'm back. The days still been pretty boring, coming towards the end of it now though, arg! Lol, nothing to say. I've ate so much it's untrue, I've seen some of my my sisters mates, but I don't think they recognise me, I'm getting dropped off at Nippsipuff's later, so I'll write more when I go home Bye (again!) xxxxxxxxx"
S18LPVI,female,16,"It took me until a couple days ago to discover the notes that you can leave on entries! SO, after reading them, I have one thing to say: Thank you Nathan!!! That was so sweet of you to say! :-D  Ah, so THAT'S why Nathan wasn't at the choir banquet. Silly me. :-P (He won an award, too!) It was a great time! I also went to the Quill & Scroll/journalism banquet last night, which wasn't quite as meaningful, but oh well. I'm not going to be on staff next year, anyway. (I'm still debating whether or not that's a good choice, but I think it'll be better in the end.)  Speaking of which, I still haven't turned in my schedule changes. Urgh. Stupid technology credits that don't fit anywhere on my schedule. Why do they insist on making me take some class that I don't even need, when I could take another class that is much more challenging/stimulating? WHY don't they count photography as a technology credit, or even yearbook? Since when are computers and cameras not technology? Grr...  Sarah, you told me you would post pictures from the party! I WANT TO SEE! ;-)  Geometry was actually fun today (everyone remember this, because you will NEVER AGAIN hear me say that math is ""fun""!). We finished working on our tessellation projects (which, for me, involved coloring), ate ice cream cones (I had three!) and I listened to my CD player. If only school was like that more often..."
S18LPVI,female,16,"Hola all!    Argh. Did everyone see LT's new schedule for next year? First, LN students pick up their books at registration. Argh. That's gonna be a headache and a half. Then we get out of school for winter break Dec. 23rd and go back January 3rd. But we do get ""flex"" days, meaning our spring break is March 23rd until April 4th. Eh, that could be worse. Ah well. Ha! Prom is 4 days before my birthday!  And there is still an honor's night. I'm not going. I hated it this year. Don't ever want to go again. Ah well. That short rant is over.     So yeah.     I went to lunch with my dad and Sarah today. That was....stressful. I think that it was time to talk to him again though.  So yeah. He still wants to meet Nathan. And yes, Sarah, my father does like you. I wouldn't worry about it. He likes most people. Ah well. It was an interesting time. We talked mainly about school and such of that sort. So yeah. Don't worry. I am still alive and he didn't really upset me. I told you all I could handle it.  See? Strong Ashely! (Who still can't spell her name! Ah well. C'est la vie!)    Well, Michael, you just signed off, but you never gave me that link, so I won't be clicking it anytime soon, will I? (Long story. WAIT! You're back!)  I'm too lazy to delete this paragraph, so deal.     Well, tomorrow I am going to Kokomo with Sarah and her mom I think. That should be fun.      ""Shall we go to bed?"""

S18LPVI,female,16,"Well, I figured that I should  post, although I'm not in a great mood, and I spent some of tonight crying... Argh, I can't wait to get back to school. Seriously people. You all might hate it, but I like it. This has not been the best summer, and I want to put it behind me a.s.a.p. Seriously, not a happy Ashley tonight.  :-(  I'll get over it. There's some people I need to talk to though, and after that I should feel better. But yeah. Highlight of my summer so far I went to see the air show. I love it every year, but this year it was sooooo great. It was beautiful weather and I got to see the P 51 mustangs fly. yay! I am so going to fly one day. Seriously. It's my dream, and it has been since like 5th grade.  Betcha didn't know that, right? I'm also going to join the air force. More on this when I feel like writing.

S18LPVI,female,16,"WOOHOO!   It's Sunday, which means that this time tomorrow I'll be at Ball State! :P Right now, I'm packing for workshops, and all you gals will be glad to hear that this year I'm only taking 3 pairs of shoes! (Last year, I had seven separate bags - one being just shoes!)     Workshops are going to be a bit different this year:   Smitty's being out of business entirely, no more buying Mamma Jamma's, ( hopefully ) no Chris or whatever the other guy's name was to stalk Beth and me...     I have come to the conclusion that reminiscing is fun. However, even more fun is eating, and there's food downstairs that's calling my name. (In other words, I'm hungry! :P) I'll talk to y'all on   Friday!      ""Shall we go to bed?"""
S18LPVI,female,16,"It was such a hilarious movie!!!!  I'm so glad that we went to it.  I had so much fun at the party.   Thanks to all you gurls for making it an awesome weekend!!!  Right now, we just moved into our room at the Academy and are unpacking.  It's been boring so far today but hopefully, it'll get better once we meet new people and there's less boring talk from the teachers.   classes start on wednesday so i'll update you on how that goes...but looking at my schedule right now, i have classes everyday except thursday at 8 and monday, wednesday, and friday, my classes go till 4pm:(  this is no fun!!! and i don't have any classes with christian, sean, jane, or lisa!!!! it's horrible!!!  hopefully that'll make me meet new people which i haven't been doing much of lately.    hope you guys are enjoying your nice vacation while i'm already away from home sweet home.   ""The strawberries and  our are having a nice, big family reunion. What were you thinking?"""
S18LPVI,female,16,"Okay, the quote last time was the play is over. Marten gets points for that. It can also be the drama has been acted out. These words announced the end of a performance in a Roman theatre, adn Emperor August said these words on his deathbed. I'm giving Marten points. Micheal, I'm not sure where you came up with that translation, but the reason the feminine part is in there is because fabula, is feminine. Otherwise, no one except Marten gets points. Sorry!  Anyways, your new quote is Crudelius est quam mori semper timere mortem. :-D Have fun. Think about the meaning!  Anyways, yeah. Just thought I'd update this. Sarah, as we all know, is in St. Louis right now. I went by and saw her mother yesterday. (And her father.)But that's a long story that unless you really want to know, don't ask. Ah well. I have to go get ready to leave!   ""LOOK! Purple tuna!"""
S18LPVI,female,16,I changed the layout. Hope you guys like it. :P
S18LPVI,female,16,"I will add up points in a little bit and give them to you. Marten got the last one. He's really catching up! yay! Go Marten! The next quote is Fortitudine vincimus. AND... Something happened today. Something extraordinary. It's amazing.   I cleaned my room. I mean CLEANED it. I took 8 garbage bags full of junk and yeah. It's SPOTLESS now. I mean, I have a floor, a bed, two bookshelves, a dresser, and...A DESK! And desk chair! wOOt!!!! It's amazing!!!! I am so happy!  Nathan gave me the most awesomest cd last night. I love it so much. Actually, I switched in between his cd and my new Band of Brothers cd as I cleaned my room today.  Otherwise, not much more here. I'll update later! Sarah comes home soon!  Jane and Ali: I need to talk to you both. Email me. Please. (musiknote2000@yahoo.com) :-D ""LOOK! Purple tuna!"""

IQRQ47R,female,24,"I am moving again in two months and i have been in NB for month now!   Well things have been ok. Still not working and the boss at the place i was going to work said that she will call me next week. What is up that? I am getting pissed with all th crap i am getting here. Some places say they need people but then they don't call me. Man i hate Edmundston people. I have to get back to the big city before i go crazy.  I am moving again to Fredericton New Brunswick in two months. I am moving in with Brandi and Brenda which will be great. I can't wait to move. I think my parents don't want me to move again. Mom's said  ""Well this time she will not be so far away!""  I will be about 3 hours from Edmundston. My mom tells me she understands why i don't like Edmundston. Its so small and there is nothing here which pisses me off. I need to be in Fredericton where its nice and big.   Brenda was telling me about the amazing Firework show they had for Canada day. I wish i was there to see it. Fredericton is bigger then Brockville and so they had more fireworks then Brockville would have. Sometimes i wished i stayed in Brockville but i wouldn't have more money then i do now.   A funny thing happened yesterday. I was playing with my mom's dog and he bit my nose. It still hurts today. The little bugger. Anyways i have to get going. Still have stuff to do before i go. Have a good week!"
IQRQ47R,female,24,Sorry but things just happen!  I am sorry to those people who do read my webpage. I have been a little busy and my mom is in the hospital. So things have been crazy. I go to visit my mom everyday. So that takes a bit of my time. I always have things to do and i don't seem to find time to write. But i promise things will get better by the end of this week and i will write more often. What's new? well other then my mom being sick there nothing new. I am currently looking for a job. I am hoping that i will be working by May. For all of those who pray please say a little prayer for me and for my mother. Well i better get some sleep. Have a good day!
IQRQ47R,female,24,Well today i had to cancel Humane Society because i was not able to get the car. Cable 10 is still on for tonight. I have to go for now. Have a great day!
IQRQ47R,female,24,March Break!   Nothing much to say but I am happy that I got to a computer. I really missed it. It is nice to be home with my family. I didn't realized how much I miss this town. Yes I did miss it and I can't believe it. The town I hated since high school and I missed it.   I think I will be getting some movies for tonight. I think we should have movie night since my brother is going to be home. I got to drive the car today which was nice. I missed driving. I can't wait until this summer because I will have a car to drive.   I haven't even open any of my text books since I have been here. I just don't feel like doing any of it. I will have to do some homework. I think I will get something done tomorrow. Well I have to get going. Have a nice day everyone!
IQRQ47R,female,24,Moving Once Again!   Well I am moving once again. I am still going to the university but I will be moving to just outside of Fredericton. It will be a lot of traveling but i will be at peace there. My life has been a little busy and i can't seem to get things done. So i get a little upset about that. Anyways i have to get going. I have homework to do.
IQRQ47R,female,24,I DROPPED A COURSE   I dropped my Deviance course. It was getting to be to much for me. I really didn't want to be there in the first place. I got an email from my cousin Sheila which i haven't talk to in a long time. The last time i saw her was about three years ago. That was the summer before i moved to Ontario. We had went out to the bars and went dancing. Anways i have to get to bed soon. So have a good day!
IQRQ47R,female,24,Tired but all is good!   Well there is nothing much to tell but i will find out today what i got on my mid-term.  My website is fixed and running well again.  I have the next four day off. I don't have any schoo friday. Like i said i don't have much to say but i needed to write something because i will not be able to until Monday. Well i am going to go for now. Have a nice day!
IQRQ47R,female,24,Trust??    Do you trust everybody you know? That is the question. I know there is a few people in my life that i don't trust. There is a few people who have lied to me. So i have lost that trust in them. Don't get me wrong i don't dislike any them but i would never tell them anything about me or my personal life. What do you think trust is suppose to be? Tell me what you think.
IQRQ47R,female,24,Brandi and I almost DIED yesterday   Well Brandi and I went downtown. If you know Fredericton we were on Regent St going towards downtown area. We were almost at the corner of George and Regent. Then we see this shitty ass red car go through the RED light and of course there is a big ass truck coming the other way on the green light. Well the both hit then of course the red car is coming towards Brandi and I. Well the car hit the pole that was about 5 feet away from us. Thank god we were not 30 seconds faster because we would have been right in front of that telephone pole.   Brandi and I where both in shock for most of the night. We couldn't believe that we where so lucky to be alive. Thankfully no one was serious hurt. Anyways have a good night.
DDOX7B8,female,14,"Last night I dreamed we were at hockinson and Sara went to hockinson also and on the very first day of school Sara found a boyfriend. It was sooooo weird.

DDOX7B8,female,14,"Today was a horrible day.  First I woke up at 7:30 so I couldn't take a shower or anything, I couldn't even brush my teeth. Then when I put my contact in it hurt SOOO bad but I couldn't take it out because I didn't have anytime. Then, I don't think I told any of you this but I have been having a lot of hearing problems recently, I don't know why...but I couldn't hear at all in one ear.  So I was blind and deaf :)  Then when I got to school I realized that I left all my books on the dining room table with all my homework in it.  Sad times.  Then, I was in a rush to get to tennis and I went to go get my bag out of the bathroom and it was GONE. Someone stole it...I had 150+ dollars worth of wonderful stuff in that bag. Including my favorite shoes. waaa   So at tennis I had to use my horrible shoes that don't have any grip so I slipped and slidded all around the gym. It was kinda funny...in a really not funny at all sort of way.   Uh oh.   My play starts soon so I got to go.  I will recount my horrible day maybe..tomorrow..."

KFXLXX0,male,35,It's interesting what you come across when you search the Internet for your own name.  This blog's first shout out::  urlLink Feedster blog   Thanks Scott Johnson. Love your site. Feedster rocks.
KFXLXX0,male,35,"Here's a particularly funny comic strip, about a kid who reads Palms:  urlLink Foxtrot by Bill Amend"
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I need a system reboot. No --- not my computer. Me. My brain needs a rest.  What I'm talking about is a month with  no stress . A month where I can sleep in until any time that I want. Or a month where my wife and I can go on a driving vacation of the United States and Canada, and not worry about what time it is.  It's not that I've never had a vacation. I've had plenty. My last vacation (to Aruba) was in May. (Only four months ago, but it feels like an eternity.) The problem with that vacation was it was only 4 days, which was not enough time to relax.  My previous vacation, a year ago, was also only 4 days. Short vacations are nice, but they don't provide any real respite.  The only time I've had long vacations, I had long journeys to go with it. The occassional two or three weeks in the Philippines. But again, no respite.  And it's not that I have never been unemployed. I was off a month between my last contract and this one. But it was a month where I was working hard -- finding and interviewing for jobs, writing a book, working on side-projects for  urlLink xguru.com  clients. It was no vacation.  Before that, I was off for 8 months in 2001/2002. I guess that qualifies as time off, even though I was writing another book, and working on other xguru projects.   Anyways, it looks like I won't be able to have time off for a while. Not even a week. The project I'm working on now is under a tight deadline, and every week it just gets tighter.   Perhaps after this contract I won't look right away for the next one... What's the worst that can happen? I would be willing to sacrafice a few months of earning money in exchange for some better emotional and physical health."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I've been fascinated over the past week or so about this sniper that is terrorizing the Washington, D.C. suburbs.  I made a prediction to some friends earlier this week that ""this guy has finally made a mistake -- for the first time, several witnesses saw him and can describe him, its only a matter of days before an arrest will be made"". Boy, was I wrong. The entire story (van/taillight/ladder/AK74/dark skinned) was concocted by one witness? And it turns out he was making the whole thing up? And so, as a result, the police has no (or at best, conflicting and confusing) information. If anything, the police are worse off today than they were a week ago -- at least a week ago the public was looking for anything, now the public is only looking for Arabs/Hispanics with creme colored vans and AK-74s!   Even if they eventually arrest the sniper, a good lawyer should be able to pull an ""O.J."" :: get an acquittal through confusing and conflicting evidence.  If we learned anything from the O.J. trial, its that if you get a high-profile case, with hundreds of detectives, lawyers, experts, witnesses, etc. Any piece of evidence can be made to look like anything. Every witness can be made to be a liar.   And, I distinctly remember watching CNN on Monday afternoon, and hearing the reporter say ""It looks like the sniper has taken a long weekend off"" or something to that effect. I wonder if this VERY statement on CNN caused the sniper to go out and shoot someone, just to prove the reporter wrong..."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"Today is a historic day here in Canada. We're having an federal election today, and it's expected to be the closest result in my lifetime. Much like the Bush-Gore debacle of 2000, a few thousand votes will end up being the difference in who gets to govern this country.  Now, there is a significant difference between the U.S. and Canadian political systems. In Canada, we don't vote for a Prime Minister. When I voted an hour ago, I voted for one person - my local Member of Parliament. At the end of the night, the party with the most MP's gets to form the government.   What makes it even more interesting is the prospect of a minority government. A minority government is one that needs the support of another party (or parties) to pass its legislation. Minority governments tend to last only a year or so before they fall, and another election is required."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I read recently that the Pope has approved the first miracle attributed to Mother Theresa. In the Roman Catholic church, it takes two confirmed miracles to make you a saint. So Mother Theresa only needs one more miracle to become a saint. The gist of the miracle attributed to her was that someone who was sick prayed to Mother Theresa and was cured of the disease.  I also read that in the 20 years since John Paul II has been Pope, he has canonized more saints than all of the previous popes combined. Think about it for a second, more saints have been created in 20 years than in the previous 1,400 years.  What's wrong with that? Lots of things I say. First of all, I don't believe in miracles. I believe there is a God, there has to be. He created the Universe, how else could it have been formed. But that's where his involvement in our lives ended. He started the ball rolling, and everything that occurred since that time has been due to the Physics and the Laws of Nature. That LIFE exists is a miracle. That someone thought they saw an image of the Virgin Mary in the mist of a waterfall is not.  (Every once and a while the Toronto Raptors win a game, which can be considered a miracle I guess too. But I digress.)   Second of all, just because someone lived a good life (or a great life -- Mother Theresa is often cited as the epitamy of kindness and selflessness) does not make them an actual saint. Sorry. That's not how it should work. There are tens of thousands of people like Mother Theresa -- nuns and missionaries who have devoted their lives to helping the less fortunate -- who will not have enough ""fame"" to be made into a saint. It shouldn't be a popularity contest. There should be an injunction on the granting of sainthood for 50 years. Or perhaps some future pope will recind sainthood from a few hundred of the less worthy...  It's kind of like all those Universities that grant Doctors degrees to movie stars. Bill Cosby has a Doctor's Degree -- and for what? Doesn't that diminish the value of the people who earned their doctorates? Doesn't thousands of new saints diminish the value of the existing ones?  Scott (I hope I don't go to Hell for that...)"
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I've been following  urlLink a story  that has been slowly developing over in the amateur sports world, about a new drug test that has been developed to detect a previously-undetectable steroid.  It seems several sport federations are adopting this new test, and even retesting urine samples collected at past sporting events. The results of these retests will be interesting indeed!  The rumours circulating are that drug use is rampant in amateur sports. American athletes, in particular, are under great pressure to succeed at sports. And this pressure (along with the money and endorsement deals involved) can lead some athletes to cheat if they thought they could get away with it.  So does this new test throw a monkey wrench in the cheater's plans? Or have the athletes and their coaches been aware of this new test for months, and have switched to other undetectable steroids?  We'll see."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"10 U.S. soldiers were injured in Iraq today in three separate attacks, a day after George Bush dared Iraqis to ""bring it on""...  Canada.com sums up one point of view in their story, aptly titled:  urlLink   'Bring them on,' Bush says; Iraqis do   .   The most daring of yesterday's attacks took place just before 10 a.m. in Baghdad when a man on foot fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a three-vehicle military convoy moving down Haifa Street, a busy thoroughfare in the centre of the city. One Humvee was struck, wounding three soldiers, witnesses and a military spokesman said.  Witnesses said soldiers in one of the other vehicles opened fire indiscriminately, seriously wounding, and possibly killing, at least one Iraqi driver nearby. Blood pooled next to the slain driver's blue Volkswagen Passat soon after the attack.  A crowd of people gathered around the destroyed Humvee and looted it, taking whatever they could remove. Children and adults climbed on top, stomping on it and chanting, ""God bless Mohammad!""  Then someone set the vehicle on fire and the crowd backed away, watching it slowly burn. Children hurled rocks at the blaze and, in a particularly Arab insult, threw shoes at it.   Of course, the guy who fired the grenade disappeared into the crowd and could not be found."

The $1.4 trillion deficit will become $3.0 trillion if the tax cuts are made permanent? Who would have guessed Canada would be in a better financial position in 2010 that the United States?"

David looked at him through the eyes of God and said he's too big to miss."" -Wally Carter   ""When God saw that many men were lazy, and gave themselves only with difficulty to spiritual reading, He wished to make it easy for them, and added the melody to the words, that all being rejoiced by the charm of the music, should sing hymns to Him with gladness."" -John Chrysostom   ""Never before has the world been so desperately asking for answers to crucial questions, and never before has the world been so frantically committed to the idea that no answers are possible."" -Edmund Clowney   ""It is as if God the Father is saying to us: 'Since I have told you everything in My Word, Who is My Son, I have no other words that can at present say anything or reveal anything to you beyond this. Fix your eyes on Him alone, for in Him I have told you all, revealed all, and in Him you will find more than you desire or ask. If you fix your eyes on Him, you will find everything, for He is My whole word and My reply, He is My whole vision and My whole revelation.'"" -Anthony M. Coniaris   ""Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.""  -Jesus (Matt. 6:25-34)  I like the way The Message puts verses 30-36 of Matthew 6: ""If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers--most of which are never even seen--don't you think he'll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you? What I'm trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with getting, so you can respond to God's giving. People who don't know God and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met. Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.""  ~  Whoever you are, wherever you are, as you're reading this take a second to pray for any unsaved friends you have. In youth group we have that board of names of people we're praying for, but I think sometimes it is all too easy to write down a name and then forget to pray for them. I know I'm guilty of it, at least. So right now, let your heart break over the same thing that breaks God's heart - ask Him to draw the hearts of our unsaved friends to Him. Ask for them to have a desire to seek after Him, and ask Him to let His light shine through you. I know that I want to be Jesus to the world, and what better way to start than with your friends? I think that sometimes we forget that yeah, we're going to die someday, and not everyone is going to heaven. Just because our face to face meeting with Jesus seems far away doesn't mean that we can ever ever ever EVER give up praying for our friends who don't know Christ. It is so important to be steadfast in our prayers, because prayer does make a difference. You may never know what kind of an impact you're having. That also applies to sharing the Gospel and standing for what you believe every opportunity that you get... you never know who's listening, and you never know what kind of seeds you might be planting in the hearts and minds of those who are. Just... always, always remember: your prayers do NOT go unnoticed. Patience is everything - God's timing is not the same as ours. Wait on him, because he's not going anywhere.  Matthew 9:37-38 Then he said to his disciples, ""The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.""   Matthew 21:22 ""If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.""   Romans 12:11-12 ""Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.""  Philippians 4:6 ""Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.""  1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 ""Be joyful always;  pray continually;  give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."""

I won't give a review because I don't want my stupid opinion to interfere with your viewing of the movie and you like it but be held back by my judgements.  So I will say that I need to see it again.  Not because it was confusing, well...  To me the movie was confusing, but only because nothing has stuck in my head this week, my brain is completely gone.  A combination of many things led up to the destruction of my brain, but that would take to long to go into and hey I don't have the brain to talk about it.  And plus I have decided that I will no longer think about movies until I have seen them.  I anticipate movies way too much.  Lately the films I have gone to see haven't lived up to my great expectations and I have been let down.  So no longer will I anticipate a movie."

KCSJWMV,male,16,"10 Things I Love About Dracula   I watched  10 Things I Hate About You  and the original  Dracula  today.  I have always heard good stuff about  10 Things  ever since it came out when I was a wee lad, so I decided to find out for myself.  It was cliche, but it was good.  The ending was beyond predictable, but that didn't bother me.  I love how in depth they got with the clicks (sp?) of high school and the social status of people.  I really liked Heathe Ledger's character because he was the weird transfer kid who everyone is afraid of but he's actually a really nice guy.     Weenies who complain about me ruining movies look away.  Then I got in the way back machine and watched the original  Dracula .  Surprisingly I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It was interesting to see how far we have come in films.  Since this was made just after sound was put into movies the scenes were very quiet.  No music had been put into it.  Luckily when they decided to restore it and put it on DVD they hired a composer to make pieces for the film.  About half-way through the film without the music I realized I was about to go to sleep and my mom already had.  So I put it on the musical version and it was even better.  I've always enjoyed the old horror film stories of Dracula and company (Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Mummy, etc) so I was really getting into it.  The best performance was definitely the actor who played Rainsfeild, he reminded me so much of Gollum.  He really knew how to catch the light in his eyes to make him look like a raging psycho.  I really want to study up on Dracula and Van Helsing now because at the end John asks Van Helsing if he was coming and Van Helsing replied, 'No, I think I'll stay a while'.  And then in the movie  Van Helsing  there was some unknown past between Dracula and Van Helsing.  I think I'm going to have to investigate."

As he was driving the last nail into the post, he felt a tug on his overalls. He looked down into the eyes of a little boy.   Mister,"" he said, ""I want to buy one of your puppies.""   ""Well,"" said the farmer, as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, ""these puppies come from fine parents and cost a good deal of money.""   The boy dropped his head for a moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change and held it up to the farmer. ""I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look?""  ""Sure,"" said the farmer.   And with that he let out a whistle,""Here, Dolly!"" he called.  Out from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.   As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse. Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its best to catch up....  ""I want that one,"" the little boy said, pointing to the runt.   The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, ""Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would.""  With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, ""You see sir, I don't run too well myself, and he will need someone who understands."""

JHW49Y8,male,26,"SCO IS SMOKING CRACK   Linus Torvalds is  urlLink interviewed in eWeek about the SCO Linux lawsuit .  This article sets out rather simply and clearly why Linux code isn't covered by SCO's copyrights.  According to Torvalds, SCO's alleged offending code is either historical Linux code, BSD code, or only identical with SCO's copyrighted Unix because it complies with public standards.   Torvalds was asked whether SCO could be right in its claim that there are either so many lines of code that are infringing, or infringing and non-infringing code are so intertwined, that makes removal of that code impossible.  Torvalds' response: They are smoking crack. Their slides said there are [more than] 800,000 lines of SMP code that are ""infringing,"" and they are just off their rocker. The SMP code was written by a number of Linux people I know well (I did a lot of the SMP IRQ scalability myself, personally), so their claims are just ludicrous. And they claim they own JFS [journaled file system technology] too. Whee. They're not shy about claiming ownership of other people's code while at the same time beating their breasts about how they have been wronged. So the SCO people seem to have a few problems keeping the truth straight, but if there is something they know all about, it's hypocrisy. Yeah.  What he said."

It appears, in poking around on the web, that he's been a few a few other places in Southwestern or Central Asia, like Almaty, New Delhi, in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, as well as that other very dangerous city, London.  Well, thanks for sticking your neck out so I can read all about the bombing near Kirkuk and the shelling of Chamchamal, etc."
JHW49Y8,male,26,"KURDS ADVANCE TO WITHIN 20KM OF KIRKUK  After Iraqi soldiers retreated from their positions near Chamchamal yesterday, Kurdish Peshmerga  urlLink advanced to capture the checkpoint of Bani Maqan  outside Kirkuk.  In a counterattack,  urlLink Iraqis have shelled Chamchamal , according to resident bomb-spotter, Reuters' Mike Collett-White.  The big question now is whether the Kurds will avoid the temptation of trying to take Kirkuk, what with the deals the Kurdish leaders made with Turkey (and probably the United States) to not capture the town.  Mam Rostam, the local Peshmerga commander, has attempted to reassure everyone that urlLink  the advance hasn't gone beyond the limits  set in those deals.  While  urlLink the advance  to Bani Maqan was made not only by soldiers but by some (looting) civilians as well,  urlLink many people are staying out of the no-man's land  until things settle down."
JHW49Y8,male,26,"I've been doing some reading and thinking, and this general thought came to mind:  The United States' winning the Cold War was based on its credibility.  That and the Soviet Union's inevitable collapse, but let's stick to American credibility.  American leaders made statements of strategic or ideological intentions and showed that we would follow through on our rhetoric.  We saved Berlin through an early airlift and through President Kennedy's electrifying Berliner speech.  Our credibility suffered when we could not save South Vietnam.    I think credibility is still the currency of international relations.  Military power, which the Bush Administration seems to rely on to such an extent, is only one component of credibility.  Military power is in fact an instrument of a credible foreign policy, and can't be credibly used willy-nilly.  American credibility is tied to strategic coherence - removing hypocrisy from American foreign policy is key.   I think the hypocrisy comes from the way in which American foreign policy is pulled in different directions.  Just as an example, we are protectionist toward American steel and agricultural producers, but try to promote free trade abroad.    If we are to promote American credibility abroad, we have to resolve these inconsistencies to whatever extent possible.  Tough job, huh?    Yeah, but that's what presidents and other leaders are supposed to do.  Demonstrate strategic coherence and improve American international credibility."
JHW49Y8,male,26,"Do you think it was a good thing for him politically to show up at the American State of the Union address, the closest American analogue of those dang Party Congresses in the Soviet Union or North Korea?  Doesn't that make him look like a stooge?  Frankly, I wondered the same about Hamid Karzai last year.  Good short paper topic, if you could find the data in local newspapers from home, etc.  The effect on foreign political leaders of attending American state of the union addresses."

JHW49Y8,male,26,"THE ANSWER TO ANSAR AL-ISLAM?  Amid all the Byzantine dealmaking over what will happen to Kurdish northern Iraq,  urlLink American bombing of Kirkuk, Mosul, Chamchamal and other areas  is continuing and  urlLink people are leaving these towns .  Increasing numbers of U.S. forces are being moved there to open a second front.  Interestingly, U.S. Marine Col. Keith Lawless, speaking in the Kurdish city of Salahuddin, said that it should not be presumed that these troops are being flown in, though senior PUK officials said that 300 Special Forces soldiers were flown to Suleymaniah on four transports, increasing the American presence in the area to approximately 500.  An American commander,  urlLink Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Henry ""Pete"" Osman, has also arrived in northern Iraq .  Some Special Forces troops  urlLink are working with the Kurds to attack Iraqi positions  near Chamchamal and Kirkuk.  Other  urlLink  lightly armed U.S. soldiers are headed for Halabja , the front-line city in the Kurdish fight against Ansar al-Islam, the group some say was responsible for a car bomb attack over the weekend (Komala, a smaller Islamist group, may have also been responsible).  U.S. special forces and Kurdish peshmerga troops are  urlLink preparing for a major ground assault   against Ansar.   urlLink Tomahawk missiles have rained down  on Ansar villages in the mountainous border region, which may contain 1,000-3,000 Kurdish and Arab fighters. The first target for attacks will be  urlLink Khurmal , a town with its own small Islamist group, which commands a strategic road leading into the mountains.  When the fighting will start is still unclear."
JHW49Y8,male,26,"Cancun talks go down in flames.  Protesters couldn't bring it down, but European and American agricultural subsidies could.    First, as bad as this is, I'm happy we finally see European and American agricultural policies seen as the stumbling block to world trade in dramatic fashion.  I mean, what do you think the third world is producing?  Semi-conductors and accounting firms?  The EU and U.S. need to stop imagining they can create a world trading system with these privileges for western farmers, and I'd like to see the U.S. government forced to trade these subsidies for further trade liberalization in other sectors.  But it'll take a new president, I'm sure.  An administration that'll support steel safeguards to win Pennsylvania and Ohio won't do anything to lose votes in ""red"" states with large agricultural sectors.    Oh, and if there's going to be change on this score in Europe . . .  I don't know what.

Well it's gotten so bad lately that I've even planned ways that my son will spend his summer. Aside from all the fun things like road trips, camp, and waterslides he will have a lesson plan created by me to keep up his education.   I think each day will be based on a theme. Places and era's of those places, people and their contribution to others, animals, inventions, and plants/flowers. He will have an asignment, all age appropriate that he will need to complete for me to review. I think that this will not only broaden his horizons but teach him basic study tactics and writing abilities. Not that I'm going to test him but I do plan on have a discussion about his discoveries. I plan on incorporating art and music into these topics. Am I doing to much? I said it would all be age appropriate but I think knowledge is the key to success. And learning doesn't end with last class of the day or the end of the semester. It's an ongoing thing and I may even give him some light scale assignments during the school year on the weekends. I plan on taking my child to see some of the things he learn. For instance, if he's studying the Harlem Renaissance, I want to take him to museums and actual sights that he's reading about.  I hope I'm not doing too much and he appreciates my efforts. These are things I wish my family could've done with and for me. Jordan doesn't know how lucky he is to have a mother like me.

NJFQE4C,female,24,"Erykah Badu is the Bomb. She is very talented and I really enjoyed her concert. She had two dancers and participated in some of the dance routines. It was mostly modern, jazzm and African moves. She was on the ground, had her legs in the air, and she managed jumped and spin in the air. I was very impressed because she looks about 6 months pregnant.   I've been hearing some wack things, things that I hope are just rumors but I guess we won't find out until she's ready to reveal. The story goes that the baby is by D.O.C. He's the one with that song ""Let's Get It Funky"" in like 1989. He rapped with NWA if I remember correctly. I will be very disgusted if this is the truth.  I heard that a month ago common announced that he and Erykah parted in Sway's ""Wake-Up Show"". I never listen to it so I don't if it's true or not. I'm going to do some research on the topic tomorrow.  Back to the concert. Floetry opened. I'm really not into them but I think that the singer has a beautiful voice. I may go out and buy their CD's just because I love her voice. She's not like the rest of these beautiful faces, tight bodies, but vocal talent (Ashanti). That was mean but oh well. She made me believe what she was saying was the truth. She made me feel what she felt. And her side kick was a good hype-man. I know that's not her job but I'm really not digging rap right now with all the wack people out (Chingy).  Yeah the music will make me get out my seat and dance but his lyrics have no substance. I need to listen to someone who's going to teach me something or make me think (NAS). I'm getting off track again.  Floetry's equipment was screwed up in the beginning. I guess the two mics were clashing when next to each other so the two members had to share on mic for an entire song which was pretty difficult when it went from rap verse ti hook and back again. The ytook a moment, prayed, and finally the stage workers got it together. They look much smaller in person. Either they've been working out or it's true what they say about tv adding on the pounds. I was kinda of mad that they were only allowed to sing four songs. I think it took more time to set up and take down there equipment than they actually spent performing. Oh well, E. Badu definately made up for it.  Erykah Badu looked beautiful. She had her hair in micro-braids and they were way past her behind. Her whole band and herself were dressed in none other than Afroc-centric attire. The costumes were very simple but did stand out with the colors in the background.  She had a story to go along with different songs and she categorized her songs and realy interpreted them for me. Okay maybe not me personally but a lot of her stuff finally not only sound good to my ears but made since in my mid too. She's definately a 5% and she has a foul mouth but it's cool. She's seems to be very excited about the new baby.   She scatched on the turn-table not only with her hands but her elbow, her chin, and behind her back. She played some of her own instruments too. Damn, this girl is talented. I've always enjoyed her music but I didn't know she could sing the way she did. I'm convinced now that she's one of the best performers I've seen in a while. Among other I thought were fantastic were Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, and Luther Vandross.  My only disappointment was that she didn't sing ""Love Of My Life"", ""Bag Lady"", and ""Grenn Eyes"".

NJFQE4C,female,24,"1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?     I like to shop when I have money. I don't spend lots of time      trying on clothes and trying to decide so it's not a hassle. I     can't stand shopping with other people though because I'm      a very impatient person and I like working on my own time.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?     Clothes for my son from the Nautica shop.      3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?     Online is always easier but in the store you can actually see     how the product will look on you so it's more beneficial.  4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?     I did. My father would send me $20 a month. My mom would     dish it out prn style. As needed.  5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?     Tickets to Portland. Although I got to spend time with my       boyfriends family, it was one of the worst trips I've ever       taken.

I talk on the phone with Nermel a lot, but I do not see her as often as I would like, which is why this is probably the first time she's been mentioned on here.  Nermel: Did Joan Cusack and Jack Black get together at the end of  School of Rock ? Me: No. At least I don't think so. That would be painful for Joan. Nermel: I don't get it. Me: Go ask your mom then, hon. (This part is all overheard by Radar Ear Cate:) Nermel: Hey, Mom, why would it be painful for her? Dr. Sick Genius: Because it's all fun and games until someone skinny has to sleep with a fat, hairy man! (Nermel comes back to the phone.) Nermel: Oh, I get it. She might suffocate or something.

55UQ6LW,female,14,"Well, Finally.   I fixed the cookies. I am way to tired to even try to pretend and/or think I am technologically literate.  Guess what? No, seriously. Guess. Whilst I was gone to Alaska (which was very, very fun because it involved rafting, sea otters, and pyromania by way of Michelle), my parents re-did my whole room!!! They painted it green, and it is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I love it so. I may post pictures of it on the LJ soon if I ever figure out the godforsaken digital camera. Because it's just way too pretty. And very IKEAized, thanks to Mummy's (and Vati's) trip to Chicago. Also products of the trip: Sephora makeup (the Sephora Lip Marker in rasperry, and Nars eyeshadow in Night Fairy), and a copy of  Eats, Shoots, and Leaves .   I bought Entertainment Weekly's Must List issue. It is, needless to say, a Must. I will talk about that, and my adventures in summer reading, tomorrow when I blog.   But, first, this is what I have to say about Alaska: I now like flying. Whitewater rafting kicks ass and might be my new passion.And quotes:   Attention-Seeker : What's erect-ill die-ess-function?   Kathy : You know, in this family, why can't you just fuck up and not have people think it's premeditated?  Grandma : Yeah, that's what we said. We said, ""Yep, she just fucked up.""   Michelle  (who is male, but had very long hair; he is speaking of the eskimo drawing on Air Alaska jets): The guys behind me, they were arguing over whether the eskimo was a bulldog or Bob Marley.    Grandma : I'm just going to spark on ahead to the bathroom.   Kathy : We told them, ""She drools, she snores, she wets the bed.""  Grandma : You told them I wets the bed?!?!?"

55UQ6LW,female,14,"Cate, Meet Blushing.   I blushed for the first time in my own recorded history today. As we all know, I do not have many epidermis-related pigments in my body and am, in fact, just about as white as you can get without being considered albino or medically dead, thus, I do not blush much. Today in language arts, Pat 2 and I were quoting  O Brother Where Art Thou?  and he said the line (in a very bad accent, may I add) ""I've stated my piece and counted to three."" To which I replied, ""Son of a b*tch!"" But the class decided to synchronise their awkward silence with my stage-whispered expletive. And we had the Stupid Swearing Sub, who told me, hypocritically, that I would be left with a warning. Well, she's sworn dozens of times and no one's given her a warning, ever, as she is obviously still invited to teach at this school.   According to Tickle.com, my IQ is 117. Which is inaccurate because: a) I got mad at the last page and guessed on the answers and b) I have already taken the government-standard IQ tests and it's much higher than that at 178. (See? I'm not just a pretty face...) Although my extended family occasionally does not believe this and immediately buys into the fact that my other cousins are smarter (well, some of them) largely because their parents do nothing short of posting their report card grades in the newspaper. And, well, I'm sure their kids ""apply themselves"" in math. Which I don't. Because math sucks. (Another fallasy from the IQ quiz: I'm good at math problems. Um, no. Logic problems, yes. But not math. I guessed at the math ones.) And that is why you should not take Tickle.com's IQ test. Because it sucks and it will only tell you that you're good at guessing at math problems."

55UQ6LW,female,14,"Hm. Random Thoughts from me for the Night of Saturday, February 21, 2004.   -Nobody is online. I wish someone would get online. Princess Di? Mariana/Marinara?   -I'm reading a book with a protagonist named Pagan. Now who, for the love of God, would name their daughter Pagan? This isn't even some weird sci-fi book where characters can get away with having strange names, either. The author should just have named her Sarah or Jessica and gotten along with it. Pagan is not even a good name for a fictional character. I mean, really, even if someone doesn't honor God or whatever, it's not nice to name them Pagan. I think I will invent characters named Pagan and Heath-short-for-Heathen. Heh.   -I think Laurie on  Trading Spaces  is having some lipliner issues tonight. Did anyone else notice this? And Hildi's flower bathroom made me tear up a bit. The last time I cried over something on TV was when  Sophie's Choice  was on, and before that it was Sally's impression of Crush-the-Finding-Nemo-turtle on Mike's Super Short Show (not deserving of bold, sorry) on the Disney Channel. Bad things make me cry.   -You would be amazed at the fabulousal CD collection at our local library. I think I may have gone a bit overboard in checking out: the  Chicago  soundtrack, the  School of Rock  soundtrack, a Nick Drake retrospective, Radiohead's Kid A, When the Pawn... by Fiona Apple, a Cranberries CD, Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and the  Josie and the Pussycats  soundtrack (laugh if you want to. But I can't hate a movie with Parker Posey. And Fametrackers reccomended the CD.) And I also checked out a bunch of books, too. But no magazines, since their  Entertainment Weeklys  are suspiciously missing. I haven't told my mother about this yet. I think she might become clinically depressed again when I tell her."

M36INTY,female,23,"so i got my math midterm back today! i got 99/100!  im just amazing myself!  amazing!  i have an ee midterm next week on tuesday, and a cs midterm on monday.   this past weekend seemed to go by so fast.  friday was the sisterhood sleepover which was actually alot of fun! we ended up all going to sleep really really late which was not good cuz we had icc cleanup the next morning.  we had to leave the hotel by like 715-730ish.  i had to drive which sucked even more ehe cuz i was so tired!  but it was ok i guess- even kind of fun cleaning up mission street (between 19th and 20th).  so funny- like the block we were assigned was the EXACT block i had gone to before like a couple years back with some friends trying to get a fake ID..coincidental!  anyway.  so like my back was hurting alot right? by sunday it was getting a little bit better, not much thanks to friday sleeping all funky on the hotel bed.  but anyway, we go to costco on sunday to get some food- and i end up making it worse!!  how?  well you know those little dolley things, like where you can put heavy things on them and then like wheel it somewhere else?  i have no idea what we were thinking.  will got on it, and i tried to like tilt it back right? and push him a bit?  i managed to tilt it back, but right then i realized that it was tilting a bit too back and i didnt have the strength to push it back up right!  moment of panic! i  didnt want to drop will on the floor! so somehow i managed to lower him slowly (well not that slowly) to the ground, putting immense strain on my back- like exactly where i had hurt it before.  clever huh!   i have no clue what we were thinking.  we ended up both on the floor- and at the moment it was hilarious....but not anymore! i think my back is worse than before now.  i had a cig today and it was unenjoyable.  thats good!  i think cigarettes are starting to wear off on me..  well i have LOTS of homework to do today! ttyl!"
M36INTY,female,23,"hm today seemed to have been such a good day.  i had fun at work too.  i dunno, i think its too early in the month for me to be pms-ing though.  we went to 99/costco and everything was fine and dandy.  and we're getting all settled in for the night and will's playing final fantasy and im watching the ama's, and suddenly i get this like emotion attack or something!  i guess i get used to these little emotion trips once a month, and i always says its pms, but its way too early for it this month, so im kinda perplexed.  i dunno.  like i guess it was just a big bummer bomb or something, made me feel really blue.  and its not something that i even really know how to talk about u know?  its just like a bomb and i wait for it to go away.  like when will asks me whats wrong i dunno what to say, cuz i dont even know whats wrong.  my bummer bombs. :)  im feeling better now though, just typing this and thinking about the situation instead of being in the situation u know? things should be looking brighter in the morning..99!"
M36INTY,female,23,"so today started out to be actually a pretty fun day.  we woke up hella hella early cuz will had a tee time at 6am at half moon bay!  but people were lagging so we ended up getting there kind of late, but they were nice enough to let them play anyway.  i didnt know if i wanted to go cuz like i figured i'd be really bored, but then i figured if i didnt go, i'd be totally unproductive and probably still in bed when will got back.  so i went.  and i brought homework to do and everything! but it was soo cold that i felt like i was using all my energy just trying to stay warm! so i went back to the car, and there were pillows and a blanket there so i lied down and slept! it was nice. :) when i woke up later it was such a beautiful day!!  we headed back and kareen/andy came over and we watched the lakers game.  it was an UNBELIEVABLE game!!  10 seconds left, lakers down by 4, seriously we all thought it was over.  except andy- he was like, 10 seconds is an eternity! its not over yet!  it was really really amazing watching lakers beat the blazers.  we were like jumping up and down cheering!  after that we headed down to newark to have dinner at this sushi place with some of will's friends.  the place was not that good.  i must have drinken like 20 cups of tea cuz i seriously went to the bathroom like 4 times! no kidding.  after the second time i had resolved to not drink anymore tea, but i couldnt help it!  it was a fun dinner.  there were 2 other couples there, and then these two other guys.  will's known them all since like early college.  one of these guys though, REALLY got on my nerves today.  he's like one of those cynical types, so fuckin sarcastic.  and like i guess i've gotten used to his attitude.  like he actually told me once that me and will werent going to last.  that made me pretty mad.  but he made like a rude comment (not to me though) and i was thinking like gosh what an asshole.  i dunno- its funny.  like sometimes people dont really make an impression on me, but it can be like one small thing they do that like totally make me change the way im thinking about them.  afterwards, we headed to the home of one of their other friends.  it was an interesting visit.  like so here we are, 4 couples.  one couple are newlyweds with a 5 month old baby!  and the other two are both talking about their wedding, getting last minute details done because they're both getting married this summer.  then there's me and will.  FAR away from marriage!  well not that far but you know, like im still in school for goodness sake!  it really got me antsy, i dunno why.  im kind of tired of mapping out our future.  i think im def going to just go with the flow.  first things first.  finish school.  then get a good job.  will's going to go back to school.  then we'll see what happens.  give it a few years, make some $$ and save up and stuff u know?  i guess thats just what happens when ur young!  ahaha all of will's friends are going to have kids and stuff by the time we even consider getting married.  our kids arent even going to be able to really hang out with his friends' kids because they're going to be walking and talking and our kids are going barely going to be able to move. haha.  its kind of funny actually.  but we'll see."

SNQI72O,female,16,"i know i said i wouldnt blog, but i just want to say some stuff. this is a pretty personal entry. it was going to get emotional, but i'm exhausted by all that i was going through, and i dont have the energy to repeat it again. it's not like it comes out right anyway.   tomorrow im gonna tell the class. im just thinking... WHEN. i dont know what they'll think, i dont really want to care. i just feel i should tell them myself, and so i will.   today i realised that i never really loved my parents enough. love was always a weird concept to me... i dunno who i love, whether i really truly love them, or whether it's just i felt bound to relation or something. but today, i really think. my parents are deserving people. i mean, they have their faults, and they're paranoid like any other parents are... the only thing they didnt deserve was this.   my parents think it's stress. the school thinks its peer pressure. i think it's just that i have stinking moral values, and a non-existant moral compass. i need to know what i really want, and what i really draw the line at. i've been too impulsive, too easy influence. i have a streak of pride and independence that i've always prided myself on, and this time, it got mixed up, and it went wrong. i've decided on one thing. if i'm ever going to do anything, i want to know that i can live with my decision from now on. i'll try not to do things on impulse, and exercise self-control. lol. u know what? i sound like those politically perfect people whom i've always loathed. nowadays everything i do, i end up questioning myself, and everything i see, hear, experience, i see it in a new perspective, and somehow, it relates back to what i have done and how i feel. now i know how they feel, and i wonder if they feel the same.  i've been quiet and different, i know, but this i do because i feel wobbly, unstable, unright, and i think i need to get back again, find who i am before i dare say that's me. im constantly questioning myself, and im trying to lie back and just... see first. i dunno. dont ask.   i think god must love me a lot, to make me learn the hard way. if i wasnt loved, i dont think i would have been caught, and then it would have just led to more and more, and the basic degeneration of my soul (not that it isnt polluted already). i have sinned much, not only in terms of this and it has made me wake up, realise my mistakes and it made me think. i was looking at izzy's qoutes (she has a lot! =]) and i came across this one by thorton wilder. it struck me.  ""When god loves a creature, he wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery. He wants them to know all being alive can bring.""  i dont think i've fully understood the meaning of being alive, but i hope that i can be a better person religiously.   on another note, i have the best friends any gurl could have. some of them dont understand, but i know they care anyway. and i'm touched. really. i love y'all [u know who u are! =P]. and that's the best compliment u guys can receive, because i've never really told someone i loved them, and really meant it before. and i mean it this time. =)   now i'm on an official and proper hiatus until after exams. damn the papers."

Friendship, loyalty, love, devotion, sacrifice. *sniffsniff* It's so sweet! And I always get really irritated when the best friend never gets his girl. See lah, took so long to realise your love for her. And then when he finally realises he loves her, oops too late, she fell for another guy and he becomes her lover. Then the poor best friend have to give way and just stay a friend. So sad ='(. I'm always rooting for the best friend(s) because I think love really stems from friendship, you know?

LMSZ873,female,37,"U.N. Parties During Reagan's Funeral   U.N. chief Kofi Annan and U.N. General Assembly President Julian Hunte (St. Lucia) were among the VIPs at the state funeral for former president Ronald Reagan in Washington.  But the National Day of Mourning didn't stop the U.N. from its regular schedule of festivities.  The U.N.'s headquarters in New York City remained open for business and all employees were expected to report for work, says spokesman Stephane Dujarric. ""The U.N. does not discriminate on the basis of nationality,"" he explained.  That is not exactly true.  The U.N. shuts down for numerous Christian and Moslem holidays. (Interestingly, it has never closed for any Jewish holiday in its entire history.)  In September 2000, President Bill Clinton asked the U.N. to delay the opening of the General Assembly out of respect for the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur (the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.)  The answer was an emphatic ""No.""  Clinton boycotted the General Assembly's opening day and spoke the following week.  On Friday, not only did the U.N. remain open, but also the annual ""Staff Day"" festivities, previously scheduled, went forward as planned.  Staff day is set aside by the United Nations to ""honor"" its employees.  In recent years, Staff Day has become an event for parties and ""talent shows"" more reminiscent of those often found in college fraternity houses.  It is like a U.N. version of ""American Idol"" (without the record contract).  Which left the U.N. in a potentially embarrassing situation.  While President Reagan was eulogized in a somber memorial in Washington, U.N. staffers in NYC were partying it up.  Many staffers inside the U.N. bureaucracy blame Reagan for massive cuts in U.S. funding of the world body, which resulted in thousands of layoffs.  Under the Reagan administration, more than $1 billion in U.S. dues went unpaid.  The president once remarked, ""If the U.N. does not like New York, they are free to move, perhaps to Moscow.""  One staffer remembered that former Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega once told the General Assembly, ""President Reagan should remember that Rambo exists only in the movies!"" That brought a standing ovation.  All of which left mixed emotions among the U.N. staff.  ""He [Reagan] wanted to get rid of us ... that's why I voted for Clinton and will vote for Kerry,"" lamented one American U.N. staffer.  But one immigrant from the former Soviet republic of the Ukraine had tears in her eyes; for her, Ronald Reagan was more than just a U.S. president:  ""He is very special to me and my family. He gave us something which had been taken away [by the Soviet government]... our lives.""      OK THIS IS THE LAST ONE FOR TONIGHT!"

2KGLR28,male,37,"As I get older, if there's any kind of hangover that I still experience, it's called The Return to Work After Vacation. I'm lethargic, cranky, chained to my desk not so much by my workload but because of my lack of interest in getting up to see if anyone else has work for me. I could take a Motrin to calm the pangs of ennui (hmm... pangs of ennui) but I'd rather just walk out the door.  It's hardest when New Year's falls on a Thursday. I don't take the next day off even though every time it rolls around, I think afterward that I should have done just that. My workday is actually half over, even though most people are just beginning at this moment, and that makes my complaining twice as annoying, I think.  This holiday vacation was less satisfying than most. This ""wintery mix"" of cold/chills/sore throat etc didn't keep me in bed the whole time but I took these really long 4-6 hour naps during many of the days, which has a way of blowing giant holes in plans  for friends or even just uninterrupted reading. Having said that, I did get some extra reading done and the bf and I spent some extra time together Monday. And I still got my gym time in.  I'm probably going to DC for an extended weekend in late January. It's time to spend a few days with Chris and his boyfriend and other friends, see the city and read books and stuff. I think this is going to be a trip without the boyfriend. This is often a touchy subject with couples. I think my boyfriend will get along with it. Frankly, he'll have to.  I'm such a bitch! I don't mean to come off that way. We talked about the idea in principle back when we first started dating and he seemed amenable to it at the time. I think this trip will be the first time to put it into practice. I don't expect much of a fuss. Plus, I'll be the good boyfriend and suggest trip together at the same time-- probably to Toronto or Chicago.  Relationships don't have to be like America's relations with North Korea. And mine isn't. But I move carefully sometimes to protect the bf's feelings, since he's more of the ""I'm happiest only when I'm with you"" kinds of people. I'm more of the bastard of the two of us."

I would have given it an 8 except that the giant wave that overtook New York City really didn't destroy the city. The tall buildings remained standing. Yes, freezing causes lots of damage. But it's not the same. I loved the Amero-centric point of view:  oh yeah, Europe froze, too , was the general message. How fitting for Fox. Remember... ""Armageddon"" extended a hand to our European allies, offering up the destruction of Paris.  There's a momentary shot of a lurching needle on a seismograph during the tornadic destruction of LA.

2KGLR28,male,37,"A dinner my roommate and I had with some other gay friends last night reminded me of the rich history of gay life in America. In particular, of the Mattachine Society and the important role it played in gay life-- before 1970.   It was a very secretive society. But this was a time where most gay men were guarded about their sexual orientation-- even with other gay men. The fact that you wore a yellow handkerchief in your breast pocket might be the only indicator to another that you were ""a friend of Dorothy."" The Matachine Society itself was set up in such a way that members of one cell group in a city might not know anyone else who was a member of another cell in the same city. It was kind of like the Freemasons.  It was a very closed society for gay men at a time when society was very closed to gay men, if you get my drift. A new, more activist, gay consciousness grew in the years after Stonewall and the Mattachine Society fell behind the times. But it still holds an important place in gay history.

For this reason: he's outside of the accepted Todd demographic. He's young. Not unacceptably young... but younger than guys whom I usually find myself interested in. Seriously, I'm not giving him shit. I do notice that I'm more skeptical of him and any possibilities... merely because of his age. But, he's smart, cute, has nice eyes, seems to know what he wants from life. And so we keep talking. Who knows... maybe in a couple years when he's old enough to drive we might go out on a date. Ah yes... nothing like humor that borders on pedophilia to perk up a Monday.  btw... he reads this... which means that the person getting  a lot  of shit is going to be  me .  A wet, windy, cold Monday. Yesterday, we had winds gusting upwards of 50 miles per hour. Branches were everywhere... dogs the size of large chew toys were flying down the street... people lost electricity. Not that this is unusual in Michigan. Since I've moved here, I've discovered that losing electricity in Michigan is commonplace. It rains, the power goes out. It snows, the power goes out. The Pistons lose, the power goes out. And when it does, it seems like it takes a week to get it back on. This isn't much of an obstacle for the true Michiganian. He just grabs his gun, shoots something moving, skins it and rubs a few sticks together to make a fire. A friend of mine: ""It must look like the Early Man Exhibit at the Smithsonian.""

I did not get this notice because I was on vacation. I paid the bill by June 1 like I thought I should. When I went to their website, it even said that payment was due on June 1 and that I had paid in full. However, when I called they said because I did not pay it by May 25, on June 2 they shut off my phone. They shut off my phone after I had already paid the bill. When I called them, they said they would turn my phone back on if I paid them $85.00. I pay my bill on time and in full, and they shut it off and expect me to pay them another $85 to turn it back on. I think not. Therefore, we are just using our cell phones now. I have never once had any problems with Verizon, my cell phone company. They are always polite if I call. SBC was not.

It never got past 74 degrees and was nice and sunny with a breeze. It is supposed to be the same for today and tomorrow. Tuesday night there was a massive thunderstorm and the power kept going out. Some of the thunder was shaking my house. It was making the dogs upset. Well, that is all the news that is fit to print today. I got this picture from my uncle. It is a picture of my Aunt Chris and her pack of dogs.    urlLink    Auntie Chris and the dogs  urlLink      A Little Gardening Tip     What's the difference between an herb and a spice?      Culinary herbs are different from spices. Generally, the edible part of culinary herbs is fresh or dried leaves while the edible part of spices includes seeds, roots, fruits, flowers, and bark. Culinary herbs usually have a mild flavor while spices tend to have a strong, pungent flavor. However, the terms ""herb"" and ""spice"" are artificial categories, not a botanical designation of any kind. Common herbs include parsley, sage, and basil, and some common spices include cinnamon, cardamon, and ginger. From Ohio State University website."
QWEBTU5,female,27,"There was controversy in our house last night. Do we watch Survivor and tape American Idol, or watch American Idol and tape Survivor? We ended up watching Survivor first. Can you believe this Survivor love story? They really need to break up the love birds. I already didn’t like Boston Rob to begin with. Can you believe that they voted off Ethan? Why would they keep Jerry over him? I can see that Ethan was stronger, but Jerri, as Carolynn says, is cranky.   After that we watched American Idol. Carolynn just loves when they all sing together and do that funny stuff. I think she is still laughing about Jon Peter Lewis in a banana suit and then he fell out of the hammock. And she got to see her boyfriend Clay Aiken. She gets to see him live again on Monday night. We saw him last summer on the American Idols concert tour. And of course, last night we had to say good-bye to Leah LaBelle. I guessed the bottom three would be Leah LaBelle, Camille Velasco, and John Stevens. Oh well, one of the ones I guessed was the one that got voted off.   Just So You Know-   There are three types of people in the world; those who can count and those who can’t."
QWEBTU5,female,27,"Well, not to much excitement going on here. Carolynn gave out some thank you cards for her friends at school. I worked on my English term paper. I worked on some other homework. Catherine sneaked a big chocolate bunny this morning and she polished off the rest of the birthday cupcakes. So she is in big trouble. Tomorrow will be American Idol. I hope that we won’t have to have a repeat of last week. I made pork chops for dinner. There are only a few more weeks of school for me, and then it is over. This classes six days a week is a pain. They are at all different times, and the school is an hour away and that makes it more difficult. In the summer I will only have classes twice a week and the same in the fall. It would be different if I didn’t have to take Catherine with me everyday. She makes getting going way harder. She drags her feet and plays around while we are trying to get ready.

It should be a nice trip there. I have to drive through Illinois and Indiana. I have done that before. My friend Cari lives near Indianapolis. There is not much to see between here and there. However, then I have to drive through Kentucky and into Tennessee. That should be more scenic. Phillip drove to Kentucky with his friend once and he said it was nice. Well, that is it for today. Tomorrow I have my English final and on Wednesday, I have my history final. Then that is it until the summer semester. Phillip’s mom will be here that week. She is excited about her visit.

It is the fanciest hotel we have ever been in. They have ballrooms, chandeliers, and all that refined stuff. This hotel may be too good for us. They even have an indoor water park. It's a good thing too because it is pouring rain outside. The water park was cool. They have three big slides and three little ones. Catherine could go on one big one and all the little one. Everyone else could do them all. They had a huge Jacuzzi. There was even an arcade in there. We spent most of the day there. We got some snacks in the snack bar down there at the water park. Then we came back to the room and ordered a pizza. After dinner, we went down stairs to the water park again and stayed until closing. Sarah, Phillip, and I were having a contest on who can make the biggest splash off the water slide. Then my bathing suit top broke. It was wet and stuck in place so no one has to see what I keep underneath. Plus I am not exactly a sting bikini kind of girl. I like my bathings suits to cover all. Sarah fixed it so I could go up stairs and change. Luckily, I brought a spare bathing suit. However, Sarah and I were laughing so hard we were afraid our sides would split like my swimsuit. Well, my mom told us to do something funny everyday. Almost giving a water park full of people a booby show definitely qualifies. What makes me mad is just go that swimsuit and it broke. Sarah ate her first White Castle burger today. We stopped for gas on the way here and it was right next the White Castle. Therefore, we drove thru and got her a cheeseburger. It cost $0.62. It took forever in the drive thru and when we finally got the one burger, we ordered they gave us a free soda for waiting. We got a heck of a deal. Nobody in our family likes White Castle burgers. Sarah liked them. Ewww! Tomorrow we will be enjoying the hotel’s breakfast buffet. Carolynn says it is just like the time we went to Vegas and stayed at the Circus Circus. They had fun stuff for kids and a breakfast buffet too. Of course, Circus Circus was a little less refined than the Hilton we are staying at now. After breakfast, we will be heading home. I have a class tomorrow night and Phillip has to go to work tomorrow night. We are going to Six Flags on Thursday. That is all for tonight."

7NFA3OH,female,27,"Timeline:  Present  As of today your author has turned a Team Leader of Ponderland's forming Humanity's Team. Solara had some stories to share with me, indeed. Especially her latest experiences at  The Hague - International City of Peace  truly captured my attention which, as you already know, was quite dissected yesterday. Then again, her contagious enthusiasm quickly washed my aforementioned indifference and I soon found myself in the heart of founding Ponderland's Humanity's Team alongside Sol (having a good night's sleep yesterday also helped a great deal). What can I say? She just knows how to hit the bullseye of the leader in me.  ""What is the Humanity's Team?"" one may ask.  It can be described as an international movement currently parented by The Conversations with God Foundation but is planned to be a non-profit and separate organization by 2006. It is the actual response to the wonder,  ""I have been following the  Conversations with God  series and they have changed my life. Now what can I do about it?"" . It is a roof that will house individuals who live to make a change in the world (and start doing it by changing themselves), who want to flourish and progress continuously throughout their Odyssey, who want to share their experiences and be supported in a closely-connected  group  family that is purely based on understanding and love regardless of religion, race, sexual orientation they belong. It is not a new religion! It is a totally new approach towards religion, rather... and God and above all Life...  ...Life which is the most precious gift we are presented with. Through living lies the message of Spirituality... Through living lies the expression of one's true self.  And ""your message is your life,  lived "" is Humanity's Team motto. It is ""a civil rights movement for the soul"". It aims to create a ""world in which humanity truly experiences unity and oneness"". Its mission is to ""renew and restore our connection with the creator, the powers that be, Fate or whatever you name it  and  with each other"".  I am very proud to be a part of this great support and also excited by the fact that I have this space of transparency wherein all my efforts to make a change as my life collides with the Humanity's Team shall be recorded (yet another bliss of being a blogger). I am honored to feel this loved and this embraced among a group of peoples who are as willing to take a step further to enrich the experience of ""living"" through neverending self discovery and acceptance.  We are all so unique and totally capable of making this world a beautiful,  peace ful place. All we need is to take a baby step towards it. You can also share this incredible experience by becoming a part of the Humanity's Team which is open and welcoming to each and every one. Simply click  urlLink here  to find out more and what you can do about it.  There are so many things to be done. First and foremost, I need to have a business card. This is the classy part and all about the ""Here... take my card"" trivia. Then, we will be trying to find a publisher while I start translating  New Revelations: A Conversation with God  into my mother language. It is still not on the market here in Ponderland. On Tuesday, Sol and I will be going to pay a visit to the art center that will be sponsoring and organizing N.D. Walsch's visit to Ponderland. It seems that we will not be ""shoulder deep"" in arranging this visit at all. Yet, we will be so in the coming days, possibly towards Fall since Sol is planning to host the next country coordinators meeting here in November.  Still, before that we have to prepare the Humanity's Team brochures that will be presented to the guests during N.D. Walsch's conference. That conference will be very important in the name of advertising, for certain. We also need to build a website and turn Sol's house (where I will be spending most of my time from this point on. May I get a hurray for leaving the asylum behind, please?) into our counseling office. Amidst all these will be the lookout for a publisher and my translating Walsch's unpublished books.  I feel so alive and in tune with myself at last! Can you tell?"

Now before I start mauling you, leave me alone...""   -----------------------------   ""...will you?"" I blinked my eyes open to see Mrs. Rose smiling at me right next to my table. The sun hid itself behind a cloud yet the rays were streaking from the clouds, causing intricate patterns all around the sheltered garden as the shadows of the leaves fell upon it. ""Excuse me"" I said with an embarrassed smile, ""Were you saying something?""   ""That soup, darling. You won't finish it, will you? It's cold already anyway. Would you like me to get you a new one?""   ""Oh no, thank you."" I muttered slightly shaking my head. I was so lost in my musings that I forgot about the soup, indeed. She leaned over to take the china bowl away and patted me on the shoulder. ""You seem a little worried, Aura. Would you like to talk about it?""   ""Oh it's nothing, really.""   ""Let me know if you like anything else, then."" She turned away and was climbing the steps leading into the cafe when I raised my voice which caused her to halt, ""You know I may need something, though."" Mrs. Rose turned around with her eyebrows raised and that compassionate smile dominating her sincere face, ""That Brownie cake with chocolate sauce of yours. That might be just what I need.""   She laughed as she disappeared and I sighed deeply. There should have been a way out of this. There was a source of light somewhere and it was patiently waiting for me to find it. Perhaps it was this darkness that my eyes got used to which was making it harder to spot.... Perhaps, when I found it, my eyes would need some time to adjust daylight again. Nevertheless, there was a way. There always was a way that led to a brand new beginning since nothing in life was permanent. No matter how long a situation might have seemed to linger for, it was destined to...   -----------------------------   ""...change! You have to realize that this is not the way to deal with problems. You are neither the first nor the last person who is turned down at an Interview!""

You are disappointed alright. You were expecting this voiceover thing to be an exit out of this place but there'll be other opportunities. There'll be so many opportunities when the time comes that you'll turn back and laugh at these days.""   ""Fine! I'll laugh when the time comes, then! Now if you please excuse me, I want to concentrate on this minute and the fact that another chance is missed and it's all because of....""   -----------------------------   ""...you? God, is that really you, Aura?"" I raised my head and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw one of my high school friends smiling at me. Dearest Bee! We were really very close since we went to the same high school, were living at the same neighborhood and our summer houses were at the same district. It had been years since I last saw her, indeed. That last time was my huge (re)Birthday party back at 1999 when all my friends were invited to meet the real me for the first time. We hugged each other tight and I stuttered, ""Bee... I... can....cannot believe this! How have you been?""   ""Where have you been should be the one."" We chuckled as I invited her to sit down with me but she had to go, ""I am just going to meet my fiance."" she said and my face obviously got the you-gotta-be-kiddin' expression so she smiled and added ""Right, I'll be getting married this summer but anyway. I tried to call you dozens of times but your number was unreachable."" Obviously, I had changed my mobile number ages ago once my speeddating days were over so we swapped numbers and hugged again, making sure we would meet as soon as possible.   Mrs. Rose was bringing my cake in the meantime and saying, ""Ah what a lovely sight, darling. Old friends coming together again. You know what is the best?"" She placed the plate on the table and sighed, ""The fact that thousands of things change yet some things always remain the same. Memories of good-old times are one of them.""   I smiled and nodded, ""True. At least those good-old times are always as real as they could get and not...""   -----------------------------   ""....fake! I'm your dad! I'm on your side!

7NFA3OH,female,27,":: INSIDE OUT ::   Timeline:  Present   I have been feeling exhaustingly sick these last two days.. I woke up suddenly early Monday morning and could barely have time to make it to the bathroom to throw my dinner up. It was nearing 5 am, all dark and nothing was audible apart from my uncle's snoring (storming). I felt thankful for it since I didn't want to wake anyone up so I sat there on the ground, randomly effected by a reflexive cramp which caused me to double over in pain and retch. Having left anything but bile to deliver into the toilet, I leaned my forehead on the edge of the bath tub and waited for the palpitations to subside...   ...it was then I realized that I was actually practicing my future. In that lovely ""Playground"" I have recently described, such would be the case if something like this happened in a long distant years ahead. A lonely suffering as it always has been. Still, I was not that scared child who was so afraid of vomiting any longer. I got up feeling dizzy and weary, flushed the mess, washed my face and went back to the Cocoon feeling as if my stomach was literally replaced with a rock. It was obvious that I was suffering from food poisoning. Resting my back on the pillows, I sat there in the silence, hugged my toy dog Johnny who has been my inseparable friend since I was 1 and whispered to him softly, ""Well Johnny... Here we go again."" He looked up at me with that compassionate smile of his as always and remained silent (as always). Then again (his) silent understanding was all I asked for.   That and the embrace of music... Wearing the headphones of my walkman, I turned the radio on... only to be welcomed by the entrancing tunes of Sarah McLachlan decipher all that I go through into notes:   ""... Passion chokes the flower 'til she cries no more...  Possessing all the beauty, hungry still for more...  Heaven holds a sense of wonder  and I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides..   In this white wave  I am sinking in this silence...  In this white wave,  In this silence I believe...""   So I believed and so I sat there embracing my companion until the first shrinking violet of the day sneaked into my Cocoon as if apologizing for all the darkness I have had to go through."
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: FAREWELL TO ARMS ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1995)   Deliberate neglection was all about Gambit's ultimate Scorpio revenge which I joked about and laughed at when among friends and caused me an emotional flux when alone. The couple emitted all the glamour of a summer affair, indeed. That is to say when they were up and around. It wouldn't be a gross understatement to say they were mostly down and rough-and-tumble. Throughout the days they were locked indoors at Gambit's and since it was located on my way to the beach, I could see the girl's stuff, shoes at least, scattered around his veranda. I was trying to make myself believe that it was all about sex and this idea was highly supported by Goddess who was the girl's friend. That was how Gambit met the girl, indeed... Obviously the girl's family bought a house in one of the many blocks built along the seashore. She was a newcomer, Goddess was her friend and her introduction to the gang had been inevitable. I didn't mind that, at all, honestly. Although Goddess was feeling quite guilty about this affair, thinking she had played a role in it, I never blamed her. Who was I to blame someone in this entire issue but myself, anyway?   It was I who had entered the dark waters at first place and stirring them with my subconscious seduction, caused a whirlpool which sucked both myself and Gambit in as it drifted us half drowned into different directions. I rarely saw him throughout the seemingly freewheeling days and lonesome nights. The house where he had disclosed his most genuine feelings to me looked so corrupted now as I passed it by a few times each and every day. Whether it was simply hormones or not, my intuition told me you could only remain strangers if you slept with someone once.   If you slept with that person twice you were no strangers anymore.   On the outside everything seemed so painfully normal and as fun as it could get since everyone knew this was going to be our last carefree summer. From that point on, higher education which meant the initial step into maturity was going to be a major part in our lives... lives that could no longer possess the irresponsible merriness of youth. Every night was a party, every night equaled a hedonist swim in alcohol, every night was pulsating with a club beat or meant bringing someone's house down. The families were understanding, probably because they also knew that this time it was not only a farewell to summer but also a farewell to adolescence on our parts.   One specific afternoon while I was returning from the beach, it happened for the first time. A cramp slowly emerged in my thighs, made its way up to my crotch and spread all around my belly. I was accompanied by a neighbor so tried my best not to manifest my pain but as soon as I arrived home, I couldn't suppress a moan. My grandmother was at a visit to a nearby friend (simply everyone loved her and she loved being not only with us but also in a neighborhood where she can get together with old people like herself and socialize. She had been living with her sister, my obsessive compulsive Granny and her manic-depressive schizophrenic son all this time so I understood her all too well) so I made use of the loneliness so as to endure my pain freely. I turned on the shower and sat under the pouring hot water for about an hour trying to figure out what was wrong with me. When the pain turned relatively tolerable, I got out, leaving wet footprints behind me, and finally found a few pain killers in some drawer to ease it.   I got dressed with shaky legs while I experienced the first striking fear which disabled me from keeping my calm. I curled up under covers, wettening my pillow all the while, and sobbed the afternoon away until I fell asleep.   It was my father who woke me up for dinner and slashed me for ending up in bed all wet. Ignoring his comments, I got up to realize that the mysterious cramps had subsided.   That night the gang's plans were to go out clubbing and instead of sitting alone at home and worrying myself to the bone, I got ready and headed to the beach before everyone else. Sighing, I leaned against the garden walls of a villa on the shore and lit up a cigarette. It was a most serene night accompanied by a crescent moon alongside the rhythmic symphony of the waves breaking with a crescendo and retreating with a decrescendo.   ""Some things change, it seems. You are never early.""   Or maybe it was not....   I closed my eyes slightly then re-opened them to see the shadow of Gambit sitting on the sand a little away. ""Yes"" I said weakly before exhaling the smoke ""Some things change.""   He buried his cigarette into the sand and came over to sit next to me and it was only then I realized the frown on his face. He seemed way too thoughtful than he usually was when he turned to look at me. It was that moment that I realized the many references made in romance novels could actually reflect truth. The tension in between was so dense that I could touch it. I had been there for more than a month and it was my third time seeing him at most. Not to mention our first time just by ourselves. It was I who finally broke the eye contact to face the salty breeze coming from the sea. ""That and you are never silent."" he said after a while, catching up with the conversation that already seemed a million light years away from me.   It was too hard not to cry right there, right then. However both of us knew that a tear would mean his victory in this game that I had started a year ago. ""I don't like being silent."" I said.   ""Then speak up"" he urged with a cute smile before lighting up another cigarette. Taking another breath from mine, I simply said, ""I can't.""   ""You can but you won't."" he said dryly to which I shrugged and muttered a ""Yes"". He knew me way too well to see everything I was thinking about on my face. That was why I was trying my best so as not to look him in the eye after the first contact. Then again I couldn't help an inevitable ""Why?"".   He remained silent for sometime and I was way too afraid to look at him, to decipher his facial expressions or his body language. ""Can you..."" he asked softly ""....can you tell me that history won't repeat itself?""   He shouldn't have asked that. We both knew that it was the only question I could not answer properly. It was not my fault I was not born the way I should have been. It was not my fault that I couldn't love him the way I was, in the form I was trapped in, within a life that didn't even belong to me. It was not my fault that when I desperately wanted to run free of my skin and all the borders that imprisoned me, I could not face the world right next to him, holding his hand and looking at a tomorrow not closeted.   And it was not my fault that I couldn't lie to him... A barely more than a whisper ""No"" escaped my lips which was followed by an ""I cannot"".   About half an hour later, the gang found me sitting on the sand all by myself with salty traces of already dried tears on my cheeks and a burning cigarette butt between my fingers."
7NFA3OH,female,27,"Timeline:  Present  For all the 27 years that have passed me by, I have never dreamed a dream such as the one that kept going on last night. Not only the content was totally brand new to me but also the dream was one of those that ""continued"". I do not know whether there are others who have experienced this before yet this is a dream sequence that does not let you go even if you wake up amidst it. You blink open your eyes and as soon as you are back in the caress of Morpheus, it goes on from where you left it off.  Today I was hoping to compose the new chapter of the Incubus storyline. However, he decided to pull a trick on me which lead to my complete loss of words if not freeze of creative juices when morning stroke.  First in 27 years, Ladies and Gentlemen, I dreamed myself as married.  I repeat,  married !  The little wings of Apollo which comes attached to the ankles of every Sagittarius at birth seem to need a major repair... or upgrade! Because my Incubus was very much wearing 21st century clothing this time (a light colored tank top revealing a broad chest and strong arms and matching sweatpants over long, powerful legs) and holding me close to his chest, kissing me most...  ...tenderly.  It sure was ""in his kiss"" and it was striking...  ...and his being not a stranger anymore, startled me beyond reason.  For all my life, I never ""dreamed"" about that kind of bond unless, casually, the subject leaned towards that direction during intimate conversations with friends. I am still a child at heart, free and merry as a robin and I ended one or two relationships in the past simply because the issue of marriage was brought into the relationship too soon.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, felt so.... different.... and so unexpected that, (t)his twist knocked the breath off me.  I could feel in his carress and in his kiss that he was... holding me as if I would slip through his arms...  ...and I was going to slip through his arms the instant he came into my dreams again, for certain...  Thus, there we were, husband and wife... his presence before me as the man I am bound to no matter how free I may be... Caressing me, he held my hands and took us out of what seems to be a bedroom and out into a gloomy afternoon.  Wrapping an arm around my shoulder, he pressed me close to his hovering figure as we walked out into what seems like a patio... and as the first thunder was heard in the distance, my arms were around his waist, my nose brushing under his chin... harbored in a hug which turned me into the piece of a jigsaw puzzle which found its place...  Husband?  Wife?  Hence what I was placed at, ladies and gentlemen, was not a puzzle of flesh, this time...  ...but a puzzle of the heart!  And just when I thought I was abandoned into safety, he dungeoned me in perplexity."
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: SCORPION MATTERS ::  Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1996)    Setting:   The insouciant beach scenery in a Nocturne.     Fixtures:   An almost-full Moon pasted to the night sky leaving a phosphorescent trace that led to a vague horizon far, far away. Waves crash serenely on the beach and from afar two shadows can be seen; One somewhat pacing back and forth, the other looking like a wispy pile on the sand.  The approach towards them begins.   Mumble mumble.. mumble mumble.. mumble mumble screwed.. mumble mumble totally banged.. mumble completely bonked! I raised my head to the overwhelmingly irritated (which was getting irritating) figure of Goddess whom, I thought, was soon to start a journey towards the center of the earth now that the traces of her constant pace started to look like the beginnings of a dike on the sand. She had dragged me out of my family's triplex soon after our arrival to the summer house and embroiled me in this monotonous monologue that had been going on for the last 15 minutes and was made up of the technicolored synonyms and derivatives of the word ""fucked"". I sighed as silently as I could so as not to sound as if I was getting bored but ennui is the inevitable outcome of a circumstance that seems to process in circles instead of an ascend towards the climax (tell me!).  ""Would you relax a little, hun?"" I shot, so that she could snap back at me and the subject would at least change. That and at some point, I had to remind her of my presence.  ""Relax?  R E L A X !?!?  I mean here I am drowned in self-pity and stuck in a situation beyond me, desperately in need of a close friend who, just in case you need an explanation as to why you are here at this particular moment, is you and you are telling me to cool off! Ever thought of writing an advice column?"" Her voice echoed off slowly in the currently solitary beach whose hidden corners were soon to be occupied by girls whispering ""Don't..."" and guys inherently taking this opposition as an erection signal.  ""No. I advice for free. How about telling your mind that takes my remark as 'cut the crap' to back off, sitting down next to me and telling me about what happened?"" I tilted my head and even smiled sweetly knowing that although I couldn't see her face, she could see mine.  ""Oh well..."" she retorted and literally fell down next to me, her chest heaving either from the best of physical exercises, ie. sandwalking, she had been through or from the anxiety that engulfed her. I waited for a moment so that partial calmness is recaptured before clearing my throat.  ""So... shall we start from the beginning?""  ""I'm screwed.. I'm...""  ""Fast forward a little.""  ""Here I am drowned in self-pity and...""  ""Goddess!"" An eyebrow raised to intensify the exclamation. Anyone who knew me personally was cognizant of the fact that when an eyebrow was raised, seriousness (or danger) wafted in the air.  ""Alright, alright"" she raised both hands and ceasefired, ""First off, I want you to know that I, now, can understand where you are coming from when Gambit issue is considered."" I narrowed my eyes and an ""Oh?"" escaped my lips while she continued, ""It's really impossible to form a healthy relationship when the relationship is surrounded by a myriad of mutual friends and is constantly microscoped.""  I nodded and, although why Gambit and I were never a proper ""issue"" had nothing to do with that (at least, back then), kept my silence. She took a deep breath which, I estimated, marked the end of the introduction and the beginning of the real thing, ""I guess I'm in love with Predator"".   Predator made up the last corner of the friends-for-life square during our personalized version of Dawson's Creek. Gambit, Goddess, Predator and I formed a subset alongside many others that constituted the actual set named ""the gang!"". We were about 30 people who grew up together, initially bound by a suburb of Ponderland that was inhabited by summer houses.  I am not an easy person to surprise. I can take in statements like, ""Guess what? I had sex with a dolphin last week and am pregnant with the first anthropomorphic being on this planet now!"" with a smile and possibly with indifference unless I'm expected to be its godmother. I guess I'm way too much of a Forgiving Humanitarian for my well being. Then again, the fact that I can forgive and empathize someone rarely implies that I hesitate to rebound out-of-date personalities in my life to the waste bin. ""Well..."" I said, cutting my musing halfway and turning back to the reality, ""That's awesome! I always knew that you guys would make a perfect couple. Still, I wonder how your boyfriend will react to that.""  Goddess sighed and leaned back, resting on her elbows, her expression coming and going between anxiousness and numbness, ""And that's where I need you in.""  I mimicked her posture and we sat staring at the sea for a while before I broke the silence, ""How close are Ben and Predator?"" I asked to save myself some time.  ""Very."" was the answer, ""Through last winter, we formed a tangle. You know, Predator and I as childhood friends, Ben and I as lovers, Predator and Ben as buddies which developed into a team that are glued to each other. The thing is, as we got closer, I realized that I am helplessly drawn to Pre instead of Ben. We have never been this close and boy, Aura, we just make so much sense together it was inevitable!""  ""Well then all I can say is..."" I bit my lower lip, ""...break up with Ben as soon as possible. It's no use to act as if you take him for granted while you actually don't. You can only take someone for granted if you still have a gain.""  ""Nice words. Now how about filling me in with the appropriate way of wasting a relationship of 3 years?""  Sarcasm, I can relate to. Sarcasm due to hopelessness, I can sympathize. But sarcasm once the eyebrow is raised is pushing luck. ""What do you want me to do, Dess? Abracadabra your life? I didn't get myself stuck in manure and from where I'm standing all you have at hand is your honesty to stop the sinking. Take it or leave it!""  ""Eat it!"" she said but the tone indicated that she was with me and backed off.  ""I'm not saying cut the ties with Ben and jump in the sack with Pre that night."" Her eyes twinkled so I added, ""However tempting that might seem. Then again, although your hormones can invade your reason, I'm sure Pre's won't be effected by them. He is a sealed box that needs too much time to lockpick, go in and re-lock the latch from behind.""  She nodded, ""He's a total mystery. How much do you know him?""  ""No further than he allows me to see. We only had a quarrel once in all these 8 years we have known each other. We've shared a lot of moments, a lot of video games, a lot of movies, a lot of jokes but if you ask me who Pre really is behind the outlook, I'm all blank.""  She moaned and raised, sitting cross-legged on the sand. Taking a handful, she let the particles flow between her fingers, ""I wish I could sneak into his mind... No not even that! I wish I could just take a peek.""  ""Sorry but if what you told me about this tangle of yours is on-key then you probably know him better than I do. Then again, I know him to the point that he has his own morals and his heart would lie in dignity. He would never arrive on a trotting horse, withdraw his sword and, armor shining, rescue you from a blinking boyfriend who has no idea what's going on, grab you by the collar, kiss you passionately as the two of you sail off towards the sunset. You have to be careful, sensitive and above all, sensible in this case which means break up with Ben immediately. Cut this meaningless threesome and let the situation fallow.""  ""Easier to say than do."" I sensed the tears in her statement and also raised, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. Alas! We were 19 back then and such crisis were still parts of our late adolescent dramas. We sat there silently, leaning on to each other and on to our mutual trust until couples started passing us by in search of the greatest location for the ""deed"".    Conclusion:   Goddess didn't break up with Ben neither that summer nor the following year. Thus, I, while still fighting gender dysphoria all by myself and hidden from the light of the world, not only had to put up with her episodic tantrums thanks to Pre's romantic affairs but also the occasional, allusive eye contact with Gambit during those rare moments when his girlfriend was away to shower between shags."
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: GATES OF THE UNKOWN ::   Timeline:  Past (Summer of 1995)   Whatever happens, happens for a reason...   ...at least that was what I kept repeating to myself for the rest of summer. When the results of the University exams were officially announced, I was delighted to hear that I achieved what I had always dreamed about. I was accepted to Bayside University (for our new readers, the college is the Harvard equivalent of Ponderland) and was going to study Western Languages & Literatures specialized in English Literature. I was slightly disheartened at first because my initial goal was to study Translation at Bayside's School of Foreign Languages. Then again, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences did not sound utterly repellent, either. Later, I was going to thank the powers that be for ending up in my department since analyzing texts turned out to be something I was successful at... and above all, something that I really loved doing. Since University degree is next to compulsory in Ponderland, I believe (apart from studying at School of Arts) this was the only department that I could put up with.   All my friends were rejoiced since we all managed to pass the exam successfully. Parents were delighted... They showered their children with pride and love thinking they deserved everything they ever desired. Abusing this atmosphere skillfully, my friends ended up receiving cars, holidays abroad, credit cards with boosted limits to shop till they drop, etc. All I got, though, was a pat on the back and a ""We knew you'd make it"". When everyone else was ""gosh!""ing at my success, my father was the same old man who was always so darned sure about my success that he was not aware of the fact that this attitude lead to looking apathetic instead of what he believed it was mirroring, ie. his trust in me.   It had been like that all throughout my life. It would be useless to think that my first personal achievement would alter him. This is probably why there had been no reference to my father up until this point. He was the man who backed me up financially and constantly criticized me, that's all. My father's voice equaled a mistake I was to be faced with. It could be anything and everything ranging from the way I walked/talked to an actual mistake for which I needed some confrontation and parental guidance instead of unfavorable judgements (A reference goes to the logs covering my childhood. Remember, I told you that when I was a little child, I was susceptible to such behavior from my mother in the form of physical violence thus, I was extra cautious against my father while he practiced a different form of the same pattern... Pleading guilty when I was not). After a while, I started ignoring his presence altogether because it was no use to expect some empathy from him. I was actually lucky that the higher education issue entered our reality just after my mother's death because it gave me an opportunity to stay out of him as much as possible.   40 days and 40 nights of celebrating success with friends came to an end when the Pre-registration period arrived. I was not dying to stay, anyway, thus, I started packing up and having said goodbye to everyone, returned to Ponderland. This time, my Grandmother moved in with us to help with our daily lives and taking care of the house which we were going to practically use as a hotel we didn't need to pay for from then on. Although she had been dying to be with us after my mother's passing away, we disregarded this idea simply because we needed some time to adapt and adjust to a wife and mother's absence.   ... As I stood up before the entering gates of my University on a day at the verge of fall, I took a deep breath and stood there for a while unsure of what lied beneath that entrance for me.   A brand new beginning or a brand new ending?"
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: TRAINSPOTTING - Part One ::   Timeline:  Past (Fall of 1995)   As I entered the Piano Room on the aforementioned date/time, it was infested with many (used to refer at the uncountability of individuals) people who seemed so enthusiastic to start singing right away (not!). All around me were people drowned in goofy humor centered around the many ways of nailing a concert of which I had no idea about since it had taken place last year. Don't get me wrong, I'm not overly judgmental when it comes to stepping in a brand new setting. Then again, when the degree of your invisibility feels to high to bear, there is nothing left for you to do but to sit back and watch people.... in a not so neutral level. It was obvious that I was the only new arrival for the day (the Auditions lasted until Friday so perhaps there would be more newcomers in the coming days) and the only thing I could expect from this crowd was a few interested stares that didn't remain fixed on me more than a second before they turned away to meet that of an acquaintance. So I waited silently for the Avarel guy to appear in some corner since I heard that he was the one responsible for this ensemble.   Finally he appeared down the stairs and entered the room with that pesky smile on his face accompanying his slouchy walk. He was simply irritating, if you know what I mean. The first impression we had of each other was obvious and I wasn't fool enough to think it was going to be easy for me to sing when I had a thing against the one who would train us. He stood next to the bench (yes a bench, indeed) behind the piano and raised his voice to gain some attention. ""Hey hey!! Silence please, everyone? Thank you... first of all, it's great to be among you again. I see all the old faces."" [insert single claps, yeahs and yays from a huge crowd of guys in a corner here] ""Yeah yeah nice to see you, too guys! And a few new faces..."" he turned to nod at me and seeing all the attention turning at me with the speed of light, I nodded back to somewhere between him and....them. ""...We'll have plenty of time later to chatter but let's be off. I want you all to take out a piece of paper and jot down a few sentences concerning what you expect from this ensemble."" [rising murmurs from the crowd] ""Come on guys it'll only last a minute then we'll start.""   I tear out a piece of paper from my agenda and scribbled the following apathetically:   Well I'm here because I'll be darn famous one day and am writing this so that you can use it in the future as a proof to brag you had the privilege to work with me!   I passed the paper to him with a cute smile and sat back on the window pane I had been sitting all this time. His irritating smile spread on his face as he cast the paper aside before receiving others and placing mine on top of the pile. Then he arranged groups around the piano in a cresecent starting off with altos next to him behind the piano, then mezzo sopranos next to altos, bass next to mezzos, baritones next to bass, tenors (I was placed among them) next to baritones and finally sopranos who ended up on the other end of the piano....   ... It was fun, at least... but what was even more fun was when he read my note out loud during the break. I shrugged and stated, ""Truth is truth."" which received a few chuckles around. This is how Sprinter approached me for the first time to introduce himself. He was an all-smiles guy with a rather pinkish skin which actually emitted all the health he possessed. He was an athlete, quite well build yet unfortunately short. Well who cared? At least I now had someone I knew... Moreover, he was a tenor, himself, so it was a bonus (Actually I was NOT a tenor as everyone would soon agree but that was the highest possible male range... meaning, the only group I could fit in).   When we neared the end, Avarel said we were going to start working on Long Train Running by Doobie Brothers next time. We were passed out the lyrics of the song and he asked each and every one of us to obtain a tape and carry it along with us. They were going to record each song on our repertoire on our tapes individually so that we could practice the songs and our partitions at home.   Then again it was not ending here. He pointed at a few altos to practice the lead vocal of the song for Friday...   .....before he returned to me abruptly, adding ""And you, too!"""
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: MUTINOUS MARIONETTE ::   Timeline:  Past (Winter - Summer of 1996)   As my life was gaining momentum, my relationship with my family (ie. Granmother and dad) was going down the hill. My father had never supported my extreme zealousy for center stage and although he saw my talent, he believed that all I had was a fertile land which needed to be cultivated. He drew the line once by going, ""Whatever you sing, I don't care. If it's music you're after, you should have chosen conservatory instead of an academic degree.""   What he was unaware of was the fact that it was not my choice to study at Bayside.   It was my mother's last wish.   One of the last conversations we shared was centered around my future. I can still remember that winter day when I came back from school and found her sitting on the bed and knitting while a bandana covered her bald hair caused by chemotherapy and her tiny hands holding the knitting needles as expertly as if they were an extension of her fingers. I sat there by her side, watching her while we talked and she said, ""Dearest, no matter what you want to be make sure that you study hard enough to open the gates of Bayside. Save your future with that diploma so that you will always guarantee a second chance in life if where your heart takes you fails you. This is my last request from you."" Certainly, I opposed this last statement of hers, telling she would never have enough of requests from me which made us both laugh for the moment.   How could we know that it was truly going to be her last wish and the next day's chemotherapy would paralyse her, leading up to the week of her death?   I hid this request from my family for a long time. It was my only motivation while I was getting ready for the University exams and when I succeeded, I knew that it was not only the first, real achievement of my life but also a reason for my mother to rest in peace. Needless to say that if the strings of my life were at my hands, I would have preferred an Academy of Music/Drama but every turn of events possesses a lesson we need to learn. That is why they happen although we usually frown and think ""But wait.. This is not the reality I chose. I didn't want to experience this."" Think twice... I did so and I know that I wouldn't have been half the person I am now were it not for the people I met at Bayside and those 3.5 years I spent there.   So my father not only ignored and directly told his absolute dislike towards my passion for music but he also never missed an opportunity to nightmare my next day whenever I missed a phone call to let him know I'd be late or wouldn't be home the previous night. It was his house, wasn't it? It was his rules, weren't they? And just as long as I lived with him, I had to go by them. Period! One would have thought that I was miseried by this situation but on the contrary it only served to fuel my free spirit and my on-stage enthusiasm. The more he pulled my strings, the further I pulled back. The more he wanted to control me, the more a vagabond I became. The more he tried to fit in the shoes of Mastro Cherry, the more a  urlLink Pinocchio  I turned into.   It took years for us to come to terms with our personalities and accept that we are as far from each other as Pluto and Mercury when our perceptions about living are considered.   He didn't even change his mind after I scored an A at the Proficiency exam that Summer and was ready to start my Freshman year the following semester. I shrugged his indifference away as usual and celebrated it with my friends totally unaware of the fact that the more apathetic he was towards my personal progress/dreams, the more I was trying to prove myself to him unconsciously in whatever I did."

I've lived alone since November.  It looks like we're going to get along pretty good.    The past couple days I've found myself hamging out with  urlLink Rich  a lot.  It's good to have him back on campus.  Me and him went with a new guy,Jacob,to eat and hang out with Lori.  Naturally, Rich and I talk about blogs a lot.  Jacob asked, ""Is it required to have a blog?  It seems everyone here has one.  I haven't been to orientation yet.""  We two bloggers burst into compulsions of laughter.  I don't think he understood why.    I got 4/7 items on my to do list completed.  Now all that's left is that darned incomplete work for a class I took this summer, financial aide forrays, and signing up for the meal plan.  Come to think of it there are a couple other things I need to tend to, one of which is a job.  My hope is to find a library or bookstore to hire me.

7Y3DCU4,male,23,"Freaky Tattoos  At 2 am this morning, while getting ready for bed, I realized my bookbag was in Donna's locked car.  How convenient?  I only really wanted my notebook, who needs those schoolbooks?  I had trouble getting to sleep, but while I was in the process my mind ran Olympic marathons.  Twice when I came to consciousness I grabbed a pen from atop the mini-fridge beside me and wrote notes on my arm, much like  Memento .     1. Remember  Taxi   -I loved this show.  I used to stay up to watch it all the time.  Now that it only airs on TV Land, another station this town doesn't get,I have been deprived of that viewing privilege.  It deserves a place in my top 5.  Sorry,  Early Edition  you've got to go.    2. We're like sawdust .-  It's a concept I plan to incorporate into a poem.  It seems we're the wood that is being cut, but rather we are the sawdust that falls to the ground.  The sawdust is collected time after time and something great is done with it.  The cutting is equivalent to the trials and tribulations of our lives.  It may seem our problems are mere splinters, but instead, they are gigantic timbers.  When God cuts that away there isn't much left sometimes.  3. Dream:Ms. Piggy and Kermit -I was Kermit.  I was chasing the pig around trying to explain something to her.  I couldn't talk very clear because my head was clogged up.  I woke to find my face smushed into the pillow.  My dreams went on to be equally bizarre.

7Y3DCU4,male,23,"Dying Words and Sentiments  I have an announcement to make.  As of January 1, 2004 Eye Level will cease to exist.  But never fear, my few dear fans, I'm not quitting the internet.  I have a new project that will soon be underway.    This is this and that is that.  This is not over yet.  I want to go out with a bang.  Over these next 8 days the site will be more alive than it has been in ages.  I will be reflecting on the past 1 year and 10 months of Eye Level, evaluating the failure and success of it, discussing my first solo encounter with the blogosphere, how I've changed and what I would do differently if I had to do it over again.  Additionally, I will be detailing the plans I've drawn up for the next experiment.  This is the part where you get excited and tell all your friends (and hopefully buy into my new vision).  The main difference between ""This and That"" is that there will be a much more intense focus with the new site.  For the purpose of painting a clear picture of myself here I have made many random strokes.  The resulting self-portrait has more than less been what appears simply to be blobs of paint.  A mess.  An undescript chance occurence.  A collection of unrelated particles.  Sure, if you know me, you know better.  Sure, with time you got to know me, even if our connection previous to this was non-existant or merely by way of computer screens.  But my often hyper-inward focus alienated many.  I thank you for sticking around for the good parts.    With all my struggles, I don't think I'm self-absorbed.  That's not what I'm trying to hit at by talking about ""hyper-inward focus"".  In this almost two year time period I have not failed to talk about the world around me.  And I definetly haven't failed at writing about myself.  What I aim to do with this upcoming exploration is to better mesh these two topics together:  to talk about myself in relation to the world.  I want to be me, but I don't to alienate anyone either.  This is a tricky dichotomy.  I think most bloggers have wrestled with it.  What I want to do is connect with humanity, with people, and to lend a hand in people connecting with each other.  Is this an overwhelming purpose statement?  Definitely.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  So c'mon everybody.  Gather round my deathbed and let's sing a song.  Watch me pass from this life to the next.  You need to do this, it's part of the grieving process.  Oh, and Happy Christmas!"

7Y3DCU4,male,23,"I'm not going to always be there for you.   So much for finishing strong.  I think this is the next to last post, although I'm really not sure.  I really don't care.  I decided anything I haven't said here can be said at the new place.  This week Rich Clark is working on getting my new internet home, Artistic Differences, set up.  Don't any of you blogspotters get any crazy ideas.  I mean, I'll be paying Rich.  I'll be paying BIG.  I don't just mean money.  Oh no, we're talking  indentured service.  Slave trade ain't cool, but whatever gets the blogs blogged right?  I make no sense.  There remains at least one final post.  I'm going to go ahead and include you in on the joke.  See, the first post was called ""A Shave and A Haircut""  the last one will be titled ""Two Bits"".  I'm not cool enough to do something that cool and not point it out.  I just had to tell you.  Ok, Ok, it's not the coolest thing.  Alright.  Basically what happened was...Mike taught me that knock back when he was my next door neighbor in the dorm.  One of us would knock the ""shave and a haircut"" part and the other would respond with ""two bits"".  Hearing that response signified that the other was home and awake.  Then a year or so later I wrote that first post.  I gave it the title I did because I had just participated in National Shaving Day, a holiday of my creation.  I shaved off sideburns/chops that had adorned my face for about a year and a half prior.  Eric Linton had given me a haircut. Later when Mike read the post he said something about ""two bits.""  I wouldn't have wanted to tack that onto the first title because well, it was all free.   However, for a long time now I have planned to use ""Two Bits"" as the title of my concluding post.  That works as sort of an endcap, and a nice aset of bookends.  I dig things like that.  Besides, A shave and a haircut represents a lot of things that went on in my life during the two years of Eye Level.  For starters, Mike is one of my closest friends.   I surely consider him a golden friend and one of the best I'll ever have.  Secondly, the knock represents all the other pals I've made here.  Eric sure was nice to  cut my hair for free, just like Rich would be willing to set my site up for me without a charge.  I figure he deserves to be paid.  In fact, perhaps I'll give Eric a couple bucks.  I know it's late.  These are just three examples of the kind of high caliber people I've come into contact with here.  I'd make a shout out list, but I'd be afraid my feeble mind would forget one person for one moment and even though they probably wouldn't be one of my fifteen daily hits I'd still hate that.  Thirdly, the knock is reminiiscent of my life here at the college, particularly the dorm and Apartment 13.   That is all for now.  I'm out."

LLWIYFP,male,43,Changed templates today. Will reset the comments and all in a while. Thanks for reading...
LLWIYFP,male,43,"urlLink Synchronicity , Anyone?  Check this great quote that I found in three -  count 'em!  - three totally unrelated places today...   ""Is it possible for people to miss their lives in the same way one misses a plane? And how is it that death, the nearness of death, can restore a missed life?""  -Walker Percy,  The Second Coming"
LLWIYFP,male,43,"Don't worry about the graphic...it's only there to hold a place and serve as a graphic link for my ""almost daily"" e-mail newsletter! Got it? Good!"
LLWIYFP,male,43,"Long Time, No Blog...  Well, the battle with the ""creeping crud"" (AKA the worst flu bug I've had in years!) is hopefully over! I survived, but just barely, it seems! Been fighting the sniffling, coughing part for a while, and ""the rest"" kicked in about Wednesday night! Bad news!  Anyway, some of you have e-mailed me and I haven't gotten back to you. I'll catch up later tonight. Thanks for the comments, thanks for all the good blog stuff that's been helping me keep some semblance of sanity, and thanks for the long-distance friendships!"
LLWIYFP,male,43,"Graphic Grace: Quick Notes on ""The Passion of the Christ""  Just got back from taking our students to see the Mel Gibson movie. A couple of thoughts...  Graphic violence? Yes. Intense? Definitely. Distracting? Nope. No matter what you've read in the media, the film does not go as far graphically as it could have. I guess seeing it in pictures is more graphic than reading about it in the Bible, but the Bible's words are much more brutal and graphic - especially when you factor some of the prophetic passages.  More striking to me than the graphic violence was the ""graphic"" grace! Especially in the scene with Malchus in Gethsemane, Mary Magadlene's ""flashback,"" and the thief on the cross. Also, Simon of Cyrene's scenes are pictures of Jesus' grace and mercy.  Most impactful of all? To me, the sheer willingness and determination of Jesus to complete the task of redemption!   Oh, and I was pleasantly - and powerfully surprised with the resurrection at the end, since I had not heard that the film went beyond the crucifixion.   A couple of things...the ""subtle"" inclusion of icons (like the Shroud of Turin, for instance), and that weird ""demon child/old man"" that the Satan character (masterfully portrayed by a woman, BTW...OK, OK, nothing inferred or implied by that!) carried toward the end of the crucifixion scene...what was up with that?  All in all, a powerful presentation, from my vantage point. Your mileage may vary..."
LLWIYFP,male,43,"urlLink Jordon Cooper's  Next Home Run Quote/Allusion  He always...I mean always has something thought-provoking in his blog. He posted this little gem while describing his church board meeting:   ""One of the things I brought up was something that Janice McKinnon wrote in her book and that was that in trying to save an institution or a way of life, we often end up destroying it because we don't allow it to change as it needed to. We all thought the same could be said about the church.""   I have seen this in action. We all have!"
LLWIYFP,male,43,"Good Rules to Live By  I'm right in the middle of a message series entitled   ""Real Reality,""   based on Ephesians 4 - 6, and using some of the ""reality TV"" shows as themes. Yesterday was    urlLink Newlyweds    and I talked about marriage, using Ephesians 5:21-33, I came across the    Contemporary English Version   translation of  urlLink verse 21 ...    ""Honor Christ and put others first.""    That pretty much became my outline about marriage, and I said it could be the best two rules I know of for any personal relationships. I went on to say that all the major problems in my marriage (coming up on 20 years' worth this June 30!) have happened as a result of neglecting one or both of these  principles.   I want to put these simple rules into practice in my marriage, my ministry, and all of my life!"
LLWIYFP,male,43,"More Good...No,  Great  Stuff from PostModern Pilgrim!  One of the ""new' blogs I've linked to is PostModern Pilgrim. Check out  urlLink what's posted over there  now.  I like these ""necessary"" things a witness needs to remember...   ~~ Work in a Team.  Don't ever go it alone. Paul always had others with him and picked up more people on the way.   ~~  Live with the people.  In the old mission days the missionaries lived in the Big House or the special place, locked and gated, a refuge from the heathen world they were trying to convert. Today we all need to live with the people to learn their language and culture and needs, not what we impose on them.  ~~  Share both the Gospel and your life.  In other words, don't be aloof, but be a servant with the people.  ~~  Set an example- in other words- disciple others.  We all do it. We are always setting an example, so what is it you are going to share? Do you live like you believe- truly believe what you are saying is true?  In all of this never forget that God is present at all times in words, the Word, and Power.   And then these thoughts on the difference between recruiting members and making disciples...       ~~ When you recruit members you are trying to bring people in.    ~~ When you recruit disciples you are trying to send people out.    ~~ Members are for us and our survival.    ~~ Disciples are for others and for God's Kingdom .   After a long, long day yesterday...and ""money (or lack thereof!) finance meeting last night at church...I needed these thoughts today! Actually, it would've been better if I had them at the meeting last night. There's just something so... cheesy and manipulative  about trying to get people ""in church"" just so ""our financial problems can be solved."""
LLWIYFP,male,43,"""The New Face of Church in America: A Tool of Satan?""  I'm reading Donald Miller's    urlLink Blue Like Jazz   . Now I know that I'm an old geezer at 43, but some of Donald Miller's book sounds like ""I'm writing this because I want you to know how cool I am."" I may be way off-base, but that's the way some of it reads to me.  Having said all that, there is some pretty good stuff in the book. I just finished reading this passage, on page 111:   ""A friend of mine, a young pastor who recently started a church, talks to me from time to time about the new face of church in America - about the postmodern church. He says the new church will be different from the old one, that we will be relevant to culture and the human struggle. I don't think any church has ever been relevant to culture, to the human struggle, unless it believed in Jesus and the power of His gospel.""   Now, look at his next couple of sentences...   ""If the supposed new church believes in trendy music and cool Web pages, then it is not relevant to culture either.  It is just another tool of Satan to get people to be passionate about nothing.""     Passionate about nothing. Passionate about  nothing?  Passionate about   nothing!    We talk a good game, when we talk about our passion. Our passion for reaching the culture. Our passion for being relevant. Our passion for making a difference. Our passion for  whatever....   Does our -   does my   - passion lead me to be passionate about the things Jesus is passionate about? Is my passion full of action that really costs me something? Or is my passion empty words and clanging cymbals?"
SAK06HI,female,15,"Kuronue:  Death Print Bull's-Eyes aren't really telekinesis.  You see, the techinigue is proformed by actually marking the victims body with spirit energy and the ammunition (which can be anything from rocks to a fuel truck) follows that small ammount of spirit energy and normally hits the marks.  Unless you're like Urameshi, than you can always dodge them."
SAK06HI,female,15,"Baka:  No.  My name is Baka.  It means idiot, but my birth name is and will stay Baka.  You will use my name properly.  And FYI if you listen to the Yu-Yu Hakusho episode ""The Human Race"" in Japanese you would hear my name.  Kuronue:  Of course, Kuwabara was calling an eleven year old psychic idiot...  Baka:  Do you enjoy living in a paradox?  I mean, you watch the show that you're featured in.  Kuronue:  Technically, that's not me.  That's an imposter.  Baka:  Still...  Kuronue:  In fact, I'm not even in the show as far as I can tell.  Baka:  Well, your old partner is featured in it.  Kuronue:  Okay, I'll give you that one.  Baka:  Good.  We finally agree.  Kuronue:  Don't get used to it.  Baka:  Oh, come on, can't you feel something developing between us?  *takes Kuronue's hand*  Kuronue:  Let...go...of...my...hand...you...rodent!  *pulls hand away rapidly*  Baka:  Come on you big tease.  Kuronue:  *runs off into the distance*  Baka:  Got rid of him.  Buddha:  You were lying the whole time?  Baka:  Not the whole time.  The first four sentences are true.  Buddha:  I'll never understand demons.  Baka:  I'll never understand FLCL, but, hey, it's still awesome.  Buddha:  That doesn't sum up most demons, however.  Baka:  *picks up empty rum bottle*  Did you drink all the rest of this?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  So, Kuronue ran off into the distance completely drunk?  Buddha:  Yeah, I guess he did.  Baka:  I hope he has a high tolerance for alcohol."
SAK06HI,female,15,"Kuronue:  As I have already pointed out, my eyes glow red, but I believe that is due to the fact that I have a high accumlination of spirit energy.  Also, I am a demon (not in the sense as you are reffering to)."
SAK06HI,female,15,"SARAH:  I'm sorry, but you're name's too hard to pronounce, and therefore, too hard to spell. So I suppose I can stick to K like in   MIB.    Yeah, I understand, Jack. To be truthful, she isn't all that aesthetically pleasing to me, either.  It's because those demons are too caught up in trading insults to understand the concept of sarcasm.  K, Kuronuway, whatever: You say anything like ""the humans should be exterminated"" one more time and... and... I'll... use my ""blue Force energy"" on you, causing you great pain and possibly a bit of a black-out. As Jack said, if we're so pathetic, why don't evil guys with glowing eyes rule the world?"
SAK06HI,female,15,"Schizophrenia? Not really. I mean, in the sense that it's two personalities in one body, I suppose so, but it's not any kind of mental disorder. Much more rewarding than that, really.  Yes, just yellow. So? Eyes can glow another color?    That to which she is referring is neither schizophrenia nor multiple personalities disorder. To reinforce her idea on this, she even researched the two; you can be sure that her analysis is correct.  As for glowing eyes, I am aware of only one chemical which can cause this, and it has a tendancy to cause the eyes to flash in a yellow or golden light. I hold no expectation that there is no other chemical with such a property."
SAK06HI,female,15,"Sarah:  *deciding she doesn't think Baka is too excessively annoying, zats Goku once* That guy's getting on my nerves. Can't we bring someone decent in here?"
SAK06HI,female,15,Jenn: In geometry we had paradox quetions on our T/F homework.  The guys i sat with for the entire year always called everything a paradox.
SAK06HI,female,15,"Jenn: gou'ld!! Ok, kill him.  he has snakes in him. Mwahahahahaha"
SAK06HI,female,15,Kuronue:  Why does it have Sarah's name on there when O'Neill seems to have posted it?
SAK06HI,female,15,"Baka:  Whoa!!  This is gettin' wierd.  Hiei:  Hn...  Kurama:  Hiei, what are you doing here?  Hiei:  The hell if I know.  Baka:  The gangs almost all here.  Hiei:  You're here?  Baka:  Yepa yepa!  *a twig pops and there is an eerie creak*  Since when are we in the woods?  *one of the ""creatures"" from ""The Village"" appears and is swaying ominously*  Hiei:  What the hell is that?  Baka:  It's one of the ""creatures"" from a movie I saw yesterday.  It's really just some guy dressed up as a monster.  *walks up to creature*  See.  *trys pulling off the costume**it doesn't move*  Oh crap!  *Hides behind Kurama*  They are real!  Do something!  *Hiei pulls out his katana and kills the creature*  Hiei:  Coward.  Baka:  Heh..."
BFAVON5,female,25,"Ain't no valley low enough, Ain't no river wide enough, to keep me from gettin' to you babe    So today the company, well SMM(we all go by 3-letter initials here -- I thought it was quite weird at first, but then the weirdness fades away.. into.. where was I, oh yah), notifies me today that we are going out to lunch on Friday to send me off. That's nice of them, isn't it? I thought so. weeee! I told Carlos aka geek computer guy that comes in on Thursdays, that next week is my last week in the office. He tells me that he should(should? damnit he better damn well do it.. ha!) take me to lunch. I said, ""Sure, but I'm going on Friday. So any other day is superb to moi`"". So I guess we have a tenantive lunch ""meeting"" on Thursday next week or sometime that week. Funny he mentioned that his good friend is a chef and he's a sushi chef in one of the Hollywood & Highland restaurants. mMmm.. sushi. If you ONLY knew my love & lust for sushi that I crave daily, nightly. mMmm.. did I tangent? *looks at what she wrote* Apparently I did, as always. I've got to focus my wandering mind.   So anyhow, I can not WAIT until I am off this shift, 5pm to be exact. whooT! Then its off to the bus stop.. I go? Yes, I do ride the bus, at least for the time being. Its a bitch driving on the 405 in rush hour traffic IN Los Angeles. Luckily for the ride home, I have my handy-dandy book to keep me company. I'm reading  ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". It's got me glued so far.   It looks like the job search is going well. I've gotten a few calls and interviews and I'm not even in San Jose yet! Totally kew. I'm also looking at jobs in San Francisco (they tend to pay more over there). So save a little cash, put a lot towards school. I'm totally set.  I just sometimes sit back and think, ""wow, I am actually doing what I have been wanting do to for the majority of my life. I just had to decide."" I indeedy have a problem with deciding at times, but when I have my mind made up.. I see no bounds high enough."
BFAVON5,female,25,"blech. so i feel sad today.. and ive been feeling depressed lately.. it happens every several months, its odd. theres nothing really to be so SAD about. its just the feeling of utter aloneness! waaaah. i feel very unexpressive and bored perhaps thats whats leading to the depression. that and its been awhile since.. you know ;)    work is same as always. how predictable. blech to that. hey, it pays the bills at least until i make up my mind to move with Jay to NJ. Im sure i will b/c i cant stand to be away from him."
BFAVON5,female,25,"Last nite was one of my most INTERESTING nights. I ended up totally sloshed out of my mind, I even forgot what happened part of the night. I had a few drinks to start the night off.. 3 to be exact, I only remember drinking 2. lol I saw Deep Dish. They were off the HOOK! I was dancing my ass off until I could just not MOVE any more. On my way out of the club, I ended up making out with some random HOT chick. NO apparent reason, just cuz she was simply HOT. Damn, I'm a fool, I didnt even get her name or number for that matter. ha! All in all, a very kick ass nite.  mMMm.. indeedy."
BFAVON5,female,25,"I know sometimes I may not always show that I love you, But I do, always will I know that I can just shut off completely without a soul in  But I love you just the same, if not more, always will  I fall in love with you everyday, over and over again Every morning is a new love when i look into your eyes."

BFAVON5,female,25,"Soo...            What to do? What to do... ? I swear that relationships are so complicated sometimes, I just want to BE. Just be.. fall into a person.. we become one. Romantic? or Dillusional? I'd have MORE please..      But seriously, I notice when I find a flaw in someone, I just back away and look else where. Am I building walls or just noticing the cracks right away? I dunno.. maybe I just need to cool it with new boi.. good thing he is 657 miles away, enough space for my comfort and enough for it to grow into something potential.       I suppose a tramatic ending to my previous relationship is still somewhat fresh in my mind. But I can not just cave in into the mess that it is.. its not my style. I need to feel free. To be. To live. To breathe in and feel alive.. the thrill."
BFAVON5,female,25,okay.. im trying out this blog thing. ive SOLD out! thanks a LOT megan & shane ;)   i decided that  urlLink diaryland.com  was for the kids at heart and this is hardcore.. yO.  so let the games begin...
BFAVON5,female,25,"Maybe I am stoopid             Well today I attempted to get a hold of ""whats his face"", again no avail and probably no response -- per usual. I just can not grasp how this love could reach such density and just be cut loose with nothing to show for it. I felt as though I had been kicked aside so that he could pursue other interests. .. which is in fact, IS the truth. However, he did it in such a cold fashion. Bastard son, he is.   I think I am over the hurt part.. now, its just replaced with resentment towards him.        In short, I just want my shit back. And he could have all of his back for that matter. ;)        Going through my things at work.. I forgot that I had brought one of his poems he wrote for me... it was written back in May. It's about how ALL OF HIM loves ALL OF ME. But in hindsight, that was all just a bunch of crapola."
5YF09SK,male,17,"What happened on Friday? NOTHING! Completely nothing.  Like bupkiss.  So, let me try to find something interesting.... hrmph.  Let's start chronologically, so I don't miss anything...  Drove to school, sped a lot, I drive the speed limit on Clark, but on Rutherford.. hahaa I go 80.  Bio Class, uhm... Slavica & Co. extended the quiz the day before and so we learned/reviewed.  Fucking bitch.  Also got to see a mark update, didn't go up or down, stuck at a crappy 86.  IB Math, work period, had intersting conversation with Pardeep I think.  Chem, I balanced some equation really quickly, I think that's the only thing in Chemistry that I've actually mastered, balancing equations.  I can do them really fast for some reason, meh.  Then Mercier proceeded to do a lab that produces Nitrogen Dioxide, which is deadly in high concentrations.  Yay! Death! Fucking nub.  I fell asleep through the lab and bits and parts of the aftermath, Hannah kept poking me to keep me conscious.  Good thing too, otherwise I would have missed puffs of orange smoke appearing from a green liquid.  Lunch, did mark update thingy, uhm, talked about some stuff, Chrismukkah, and how I'm Jesus and Andrea is Moses.  We need a name for our ""Bible"".  English, slept through about 40 minutes of it, woke up to listen to some talk about Fifth Business, I was suppose to do a presentation, but she extended it to Monday since no one came to class.  Yay Academics!  Afterschool, played N64 on a projector screen, I owned up Golden Eye, and then proceeded to help out with Cabaret and stuff.  Work, went by really fast, not much to say about it, except I hate Sam.  Worst co-worker ever.  I also ended up being a messenger between.... okay from now on in this blog, Ruth from Work, will be called ""Yellow Ruth"", Ruth as in president of sac will be called ""Black Ruth"" and Ruth Ruth, is ""White Ruth"".  Ahh the beauty of colour-coded-ness.  So anyway, as I was saying, I was the messenger between Yellow Ruth and Calvin.  They were passing on retarded messages via me, and I just passed them on.  I ended up making fun of Yellow Ruth because she kept flirting with Calvin and since Calvin was engaged, I called her a ""home-wrecker"".  Hahaha, that was good.  Go me.  That's it for Friday."
5YF09SK,male,17,"i had a long post.  it was good too, about yesterdya and a elaboration of friday, but it didn't post for some reason, and now i'm pissed off and not retyping it.  So, I'll sum it up:  Gays are taking over.   Look at all those gay tv shows, and a gay bishop.   Saw Erin C. and Alex D. V. at work  Liz, from work, is a stupid bitch, who doesn't understand that Peter, DOES NOT like her, and she should get a life.  She's so desperate it's sad, she keeps bothering me to get him to talk to her, and it's ridiculous, I""M NOT YOUR FREAKING MESSENGER.  Ruth, from work, from Applewood, was wearing a Cat Women Costume, and she was fucking hot.  God, HOT.  Dawn, who I just met, a friend of Vanessa, who came to the afterwork thing, is also hot.  Liz is stupid.  The post was huge, and it was alot of backdrop story telling and etc, maybe I'll retype it tomorrow, but not today, argh, stupid internet."
5YF09SK,male,17,"If you were asked if you could only live once, what would you?  The most likely responses are:     fall in love   succeed   become powerful   become rich   becoem famous     I'm sure there's more, I'm sure there's more petty things everyone wants, but I'm just trying to be general here...   As of this moment, I'm doing all those things, I'm doing everything I've ever wanted, and then some, I'm letting go of my past, and moving on.  I secretely dispise my family, it's like as if they're the biggest weight I have to carry, and yet I love them at the same time.  I'm not perfect, I'll make millions of mistakes from now and until I die, I'm just letting go, letting go of every inhibition, of everything that could prevent from just about anything.  Because honestly, I feel like I can just about do anything and that's how I want to live.    To Leslie and everyone else:  Sure, I've been taught many things, and I think it's about damn time I stopped listening to other people.  Peer Pressure has been my friend, my enemy, and most importantly my tool to convince other people into doing whatever.  It's overwhelming how powerful a few nods or a few shakes of a friends' head can be.  I really just don't give a damn about much anymore.  I'll probably tell you off, if you said something I didn't like.  Am I being more reckless? sure.  Am I hurting anyone? No, not really.  But everyone seems to think that I will, that I will kill myself, or worst yet, kill someone else.  I can do that everyday, I drive that 2 tonne box of metal down the 410 everyday, I can become distracted for a single instant and slide far left into the median and probably take out a few cars on my way.  I might miss some kid running behind a parked truck and nail him.  Is it going to happen? Who knows.  I'll let God decide, since that's what popular opinion tells me.  Am I bragging? No, not really, I'm sure I said something how I'm not boasting somewhere in there, but to reaffirm, this is a journal, and this is for my use.  3 or 4 years from now, I want to be able to look back at this and read what I did, the misadventures I stepped into, and the things I've learned from.  I try to keep this thing as truthful as possible, but in some cases, some topics are just a little too personal.  Maybe you've grown to know me a little better through reading my blog, but it will never make up for Danny in person.  The blog is just a portion of my personality, a portion of my thoughts and it isn't the whole package, you might be reading something shocking, something funny, and something sad, but in the end, you're only getting a part of a picture.  Think of it as fullscreen compared to widescreen.  I think it's great how I can somewhat communicate with friends via this blog, but I really do miss talking, I really do miss speaking, I really do miss listening, I'd really appreciate if you came up to me in the halls and called me a fucking idiot.  I really would. (no sarcasm here.)  Yeah we probably argued over the internet more so than we've talked in person.  But circumstance has prevented us from ever talking, I really can't blame anyone for this, so I'll just let it be.  Growing up has nothing to do with getting better, getting wiser, we all make the same mistakes over and over again, hence why history doesn't even know how the Greek empire fell, but in any case, it doesn't have to be like this.  You don't have to hate everyone, you don't have to ""escape"".  I'm sure I'd love to just get away from here, but at the same time, there's a lot of good things going on too, and that's what keeping me going, the good things, there's no point of focusing on the negative, it never brought me any good.  For the past 17 years, I've been an introvert, a person who never shares, a person who never tells, a person who kept their mouth shut.  Why? Conditioning.   I've never been allowed to argue with my parents and never allowed to talk back, and until recently I actually believed and followed them.  Now, it's a lot different, I'll explode on anyone, anywhere if you push the right buttons.  I started letting go of the old, and only now am I the person that I really want to be.  I realise that now, and it's good.  I guess there's just a lot of pent up anger.  And if you want a closer, even though I've said it a thousand times:  I realise it's wrong."
5YF09SK,male,17,"Today, the entire day, from 11am to now, was spent at work.  Yep, the whole day wasted at the corporate asian establishment aptly named the ""Mandarin"".  It's so damn communist, it's China.    So anyway, my apologies to Christie, for my misuse of your picture but, it was just too hard not to use.  Here you can use this one of me, and turn it into something funny or better yet, spread it around:     Okay, back to me working for the corporate ""man"".  So today, I went to work half-dead, and wasn't in the mood of smiling for customers, so I didn't.  I didn't smile at all, it was quite sad.  Oh on Friday, I saw Hannah's boyfriend there with his mom, it was weird, he wore pretty nice dress clothes with shoes to match, but he had various string braclets and accesories that ruined the whole shabang.  Oh well, it was nice seeing him, although I don't think he saw me.   Apparently, one of the hostesses, is like my cousin's cousin's father's friend.  Or something or other, 'cause since we're all asian, we have to be related :/.  But really, it was weird, I was like, woAh! Like 3rd degree of seperation, and what not, it was freaky.  Anyway, her name is Elizabeth, but she prefers Liz, and she was trying to hit on Peter (my co-worker), he's a busboy too, but he's the son of the president of Mandarin who's a millionaire.  Okay, let me start over, so it makes more sense.  James Chiu is the founder of Mandarin, and he's cash-money-money up the ying yang, and wants his son to learn how to earn money and whatnot.  So Peter, his son, is working for me.  It's funny, I train and boss around people who are way older than me and can clearly kick my ass, it's pretty cool :).  So yeah, this guy is like 5'11, pretty good looking, I'd assume and drives a modded Celica, did I mention he's 19?  So yeah, I could see why girls would fall head over heels for this man, he drives a damn nice looking car and his dad is a fricken millionaire.  So yeah, back to Liz, yep, she got all upset and what not when I told her that he has a girlfriend.  It was quite funny to watch her squirm in dissapointment.  I owned her good.  In fashion news, I think the new hip thing for females is those sweaters with excessive neckage.  You know what i'm talking about, those like cord like sweaters with all the crazy extra fabric around the neck area.  Yeah, it's the new thing.    So yep, working is such a waste of time, but I think I actually do need the money now for Uni, for sure.  Anyway, later days."
5YF09SK,male,17,"I saw Alyssa today.  She had the coolest hair ever.  Like dreads, but not really, I think she called them shreds, but I'm hard of hearing most of the time.  Meh.  She said something about twisting and tweezing or something.  I dunno, it's the fucking coolest hair I've ever seen in a while.  Fucking TOO COOL.  Oh and she was wearing a a tank top that said ""Tree Hugger"", I thought it was funny, and suited her well.  Meh, I dunno more on this later.  There you go Adeel.    I have to work tomorrow.  I probably won't update for a while.  There's more, but I need to sleep right now, or I'll die tomorrow.  Oh I dominated the world again, and co-dominated it with Alex and Aaron.  Fun times.  Fun times indeed.  I think I have a winning record of like 4-1.  The game of global domination!"
5YF09SK,male,17,"Knitting is like all I do now.  :/  When I said it's addictive like crack, I wasn't joking.  But, today, I dropped like 5-6 stiches on the bus ride home when we hit a bump in the road.  I tried to fix it, but I had no idea how, so I'm just going to let it sit for a while and hope someone tomorrow can fix it.  I'm looking at you, Hannah ;)  I'm not doing as bad in Bio as I orignally thought, but it's not very good.  Ms. Kowalska complimented my knitting today, but with her, it's hard to tell if she's being sarcastic or being serious.  Like, it's impossible to tell if she's joking or not.  :p  Went out with Ruth tonight, and just for clarification, it was the white Ruth, not the ones from work.  I got her some bubble tea, and when I was waiting in line looking at the flavours, I got really confused what flavour I should get her.  I was really afraid that she didn't like certain fruits and what not, so I automatically took out all the foreign/asian flavours, just to be safe.  So that left me with like... honeydew, watermelon, strawberry, mango and some other ones.  I decided on mango for her, and taro for me.  Btw, taro and mango are my two favourite flavours for bubble tea.  So yeah, bubble tea!  On my way back from Missisauga, it was really really windy, and when I was passing the airport, the ground isn't blocked by buildings, so I got the full force of all the wind, which caused my car to drift to the left a lot.  It was weird, compensating for wind is really weird :/  As I headed for her house, I got lost, 'cause I'm pretty horrible with directions, I honestly have no idea where I'm going at all :p  But I still found my way and ended up being 10 minutes earlier.  Yeah, I got lost, and got there EARLY.  I'm rarely late,  if ever :p  So, I went to the door, greeting and such, gave her her bubble tea, got a picture taken.  Then we went to DQ for more sweetness, and ended up talking for some time.  Oh, and my Blizzard had something in it that wasn't suppose to be in it, which really through me off.  The person making it, had to spoon something out of the cup before handing it to me.  Which was just, I dunno, disconcerning.  But yeah, I had a good time, and caught up a bit with Ruth, so hooray!  And then on the way back, I got lost some more.  I honestly don't know any roads except major roads :p   Mad Hax:  A E D A D E A D B C A C"
5YF09SK,male,17,"or lack there of.  Here's everything that I imagine my life to be:  1)Semester 2: Work Full Time & School Full Time - Make around 10-15k by the end of summer, which brings up my total cash that is owned personally by me, to around 20k.  2)Sept, 2004 - June, 2009: Get into some university, preferably Toronto and in a dorm, followed by Waterloo, and do Electrical Engineering possibly.  Meanwhile, on weekends work at the Mandarin making $20 an hour.  Do co-op during the breaks, and on weekends still work at the Mandarin.  Hopefully, by doing this, I'll be out of of university out of debt and with a nice buffer of cash.  Also, talk to Peter about getting an import car and get those really damn nice rims that keep spinning when you stop.  You know the ones that I'm talking about.  Hot Damn!  I figure if I'm going to blow money on anything, I better look good while doing it.  During this time,  take up flare bartending.  Oh yeah!  3)June, 2009 - *, *: Hopefully, by this time, I'll have a full-time job working for god knows what sort of IT company developing whatever needs be with a healthy salary.  I'm aiming at around 60k+ a year, maybe I'm aiming high, maybe I'm aiming low, but whatever, that seems to be decent in my opinion.  At the same time, still working at the Mandarin, because I need cash to fuel my constant car obsessivism.  Of course, around the age of 24-28, I'll hopefully find my wife, or at least someone to spend time with.  Wooo!  Sometime around here, get hired at a bar, stop working at the Mandarin and just do bartending and my fulltime job.  4) During my early 30s, if I'm married:  Slow down, stop working at a bar/restaurant, and just concentrate on my full-time job and my wife.  If I'm not married, well it's party 24/7 over in Danny Land.  5) That's all I got.   ____   Who knows maybe I might do none of these things and take another route.  Time will tell."
5YF09SK,male,17,"I honestly think I'm bipolar.  I'm happy for one moment and then quite sad and depressed the next, usually I rarely show that latter, but today, I think I was pissed off a lot and it showed.  Today was really uneventful, but I was pissed off at my stupidity in math, pissed off at my stupidity in chemistry, and pissed off of the stupidity of Ramy.  My god, stupid kid, stfu.   I always end up forgetting to do things that I really wanted to do, and afterwards, wallow in a sad state, it's quite retarded of me, maybe if I had more initiative.  I really wanted to comment on Ruth's necklace.. I think it was new, maybe it wasn't, heck, it looked good on her, I could have said that at least.  Now, it's passed, and I can't do anything about it, except say the same thing tomorrow.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Tomorrow.  In retrospect, it isn't as important as I usually make it.  I take almost every moment of my life seriously, as if it was my last.  I guess that's a bad way to live, but whatever, I think it makes sense, what if I get shot suddenly... Meh, whatever, too much thinking, not enough doing.  Maybe it's the weather, I tend to get more pissed off as the amount of sunlight decreases.  There's a name for it, I can't think of it right now, maybe I'll get to it at some other point.  Also, I'm really itching to fight someone.  Really.  A can of woopass to be unleashed.  I think it's bad, but I really really really want to break something over someone's head right now.    I'm not actually as crazy as this all might seem, I just get mad at a lot of stupid things.  It'll go away, like always.   Oh, and my wrist is like broken, it doesn't bend certain ways.  sigh...  Highschool really seems pointless to me now.  Last year, I always thought I was learning for a greater purpose, to get a little closer to The Truth, but in reality, I think learning all these things makes it just a little worse.  I haven't, in reality, learned anything, I've just memorized things, and forgotten them when they weren't needed anymore.  Meh, this is so melodramatic.  Tomorrow will be better.  Later Days."
5YF09SK,male,17,"Woke up to a my phone ringing, yeah, I don't use an alarm clock, my parents just call me :).  So, I woke up and did my morning business, made myself some wonton noodle soup and and left for work all in 45 minutes.  I sped down Bramalea and Steels like usual, but this time I pushed to 110 on Steeles.  Still doesn't beat my pb (yay! running lingo!) of 140 on Dixie.  So, I got to work with about 3 minutes to spare, got changed with about 30 seconds to spare, and did the opening routine.  12 o'clock rolls around, and I'm like.  hrm. isn't there suppose to be two other people here to help me?  THen my manager, Nelson, tells me, Leo called in sick, and the other guy took the day off a couple days ago.  I'm like, 'You're kidding me, it's Saturday, you expect me to do this by myself?""  Nelson is like ""Pretty much, yeah, here, Ling (assistant manager) will help you.""  Where I go, ""Ling? There aren't busgirls for a reason you know.""  -Laughter-  Ling goes ""I'll do the cutlery (easiest job with little effort) and you do everything else.""  Then I sigh with, ""Thanks.""  Argh, worst 5 hours of my life.  5 HOURS of doing  TRIPLE  my normal workload.  IT was horrible.  Did I get compensated?  YES I DID.  Double my pay.  Yay!  It wasn't worth it though, those 5 hours were absolutely the most tiring and difficult hours that I've ever worked for in my life. Not including anything related to X-country of course.  The worst part of this is that I got a 30 min break for lunch before my next 6 hour shift started.  Yay for people not showing up to work!  Also, Santa showed up to the Mandarin, there was a party of like 150 people in one room, most of them kids with their parents.  Santa also had 2 really hot elves.  I like hot elves :).   But anyway, as I saw them and Santa, the first thing that came to my mind was :  ""I wonder what these kids are dieing of.""  When in fact, they weren't dieing from anytyhing, after about 5 minutes of scouting around I noticed none of them looked pale or had respirators, so I assumed it was some sort of coroporate party for the parent's' kids.  Yay!  Hot Elves!  In my second shift, Yellow Ruth was around, and I proceeded to start with the homewrecker jokes again.  She got extremely upset.  She hit me a couple times and threatened to pour various liquids on me.  I was like woah.  Hold it girl.  Then I started up again, but this time to everyone else, and we all laughed alot and she got even more upset.  When she was telling me to ""stop it"", I sware to god she was about to cry.  Stupid me, I just laughed and made fun of the fact that she was blushing, which she was.  I felt really bad afterwards when I was reflecting on my actions, and I concluded that I hurt her feelings big time.  Argh.  We had about 20 minutes of silent treatment between us, and then we did the bumping-into-each-other-by-accident routine and ended up talking again.  So I guess she got over it pretty quickly, but I still felt bad.  I planned to apologize after work because in the Mandarin, if you talk about anything seriously, it's a big deal.  Biggest gossip circle that I've ever been a part of.  It's crazy.  So yeah, I just carried on with my work and stuff, and Sam screwed up a bunch of stuff which I had to fix, fucking mongloid.  So afterwork, I hung around late, and talked to Ruth.  I was waiting for a good time to get the apology in, but she kept talking about Michelle Branch, who I like, and how she went to her concert and she showed me a bunch of pictures, and some of her art pictures.  I was like, why aren't you using an SLR? and she was like.. ""What's an SLR?"" and I'm like ""OMG, you're in an Art School, and you don't know what an SLR is?"".  Yeah and the the rest of the converstation carried over to other topics and stuff, we spent about 1 hr talking about a variety of things, and by the end of it I lost my opportunity to apolgize for being such an ass.  Bleh.  What the sux.  I wasted an entire hour to not do what I wanted to do in teh first place, man I suck.  Sped my ass home, and got home in about 8 minutes.  I should time myself, and see how fast I can get home :)"

Apparently one of the criticisms of the existing regime is that ""there is no federal regulatory process for approving the gangly producers of renewable energy.""  Project opponents say local communities should have a say in the projects, which can have a broad impact on the environment and aesthetics.  In addition, lawmakers also want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to have a say in how projects fit into a region's energy needs - even though traditionally,  siting of generation has been a matter for state regulatory bodies."

BC Hydro's Vice President is more than willing to share the information  ""BC Hydro has accumulated valuable data at a number of locations in British Columbia that we are eager to share with interested parties,"" said BC Hydro's Senior Vice-President, Distribution, Bev Van Ruyven. ""This will further enable private sector wind and wave energy development in B.C. and help these projects compete in our future commercial calls for new electricity supply.""

OFKXO5R,female,40,"Update on Offshore Power Off Long Island  Kim Acevedo has an   article  in Herald online entitled ""Winds of Change to Power Long Island"" (2/13/2003) reports that since the release of the Long Island Power Authority RFP seeking a developer for an offshore wind farm, various groups in the area have expressed interest in the proposal.  The article reports that:   The wind turbines would be located at least 2.5 nautical miles -- 2.875 statute miles -- offshore. The hum they produce would rarely, if ever, be audible from shore, officials said. ""This site has been chosen very carefully,"" Lowndes said.  The height of the wind turbines, with one blade straight up, would be approximately 360 feet to 428 feet above the surface of the water. They might be visible from shore on a clear day, Lowndes said. The park would have between 25 and 50 turbines that would produce a total of 100 to 140 megawatts of electricity on an optimal day.  The described location of the proposed wind projects within three miles of shore places them in state waters (which extend three miles from shore) and thus, avoids the jurisdictional, ""who owns the land"" squabble jeopardizing the Cape Wind Project off Nantucket as we've described in other posts.  More information on the RFP is available  here  at LIPA's website."

According to the article, a radio ad by McCullough, a year-round resident of West Tisbury, asks: ""How would you feel if you heard that in one of the most beautiful unspoiled places in all America, a sprawling factory was to be built?""  Apparently, McCullough believes that the proposed wind farm - ""to call it a wind farm is to romanticize what in fact is a factory"" - would transform Nantucket Sound ""into a 24-square-mile city with fog horns and hundreds of blinking lights."
SVHEUZY,male,16,"I am an instigator. I am a scrappy terrier that will chew your leg off if you look at me funny. That's why what I'm going to say is going to be more shocking than the last five minutes of a majorly-hyped Law and Order episode.  Sophia and Marten are being childish and need to bury the metaphorical hatchet.  You know Marten, you're the administrator of this blog and I respect that. However I think your indignation towards Sophia is covered in crap. Petualantly hiding away and editing posts isn't going to make this go away. Okay, Sophia may have offended a loyal reader. Big Deal. That's not nearly as bad as the time when I told Erin that my post may be so asinine she should ""close [her] eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better"" If you would have let this g, talked to her face to face, and I'm not just talking about the Ryan Hagan post, but rather the calling here bitchy, than this would have been a non story. But instead you openly attack her on the blog, which automatically put her on the defensive. Now Sophia's mad and you're mad and the rest of us are caught in the crossfire. But if you insist on starting things, than you better finish them completely, because if you just hide away than I will wait in the tall grass for you, Marten, because you are killing the blog.  I'm not saying that Marten was the only one wrong in this argument. I have once (spectacularly) gone off on someone and made mountains out of molehills. But Blatantly attacking a read with no reason given to this sudden outburst is just confusing and apparently unacceptable. If you are going to hate something you need to give a reason, because otherwise you look petty and small. And Believe me, I know petty and small. But you have to remember that I openly apologized and extended an olive branch once I realized that I was wrong and that my comments were offensive and petty. So If you don't stop being ""bitchy"" and apologize to both Ryan and Marten, than you are just as wrong as Marten is, and someday we may look back and realize that Compendium, what was a Utopian Shangri-La for hilarous intellectuals, failed because petty squabbling between the writers.  I may be hypocritical for saying this. I might me monumentally out of line. I am pretty sure I looked back five minutes ago and saw that line that you don't cross with an administrator fading away in the rear-view mirror. Marten, If you don't want to apologize, If you believe that you are absolutely right, than I accept that. But if you believe that you were wrong and are just afraid to swallow your pride and apologize, then God, Marten. I don't even want to know you"

I did not buy her a tribble, although she did buy a tribble for her mom.  Ashley told me she likes me better than her birds, then Richard Biggs (B5's Dr. Franklin) asked me if she was my Lady.  Anyway, with all that, we're together now.  You can meet her at the speech meet on the tenth, or I  might  bring her to youth group sometime. Micheal: That only makes it funny when you're on Caffiene, which most of us aren't at the moment.  Also, what the heck does Schlammes mean? Jonah: I have a statue of Emperor Palpatine.  Would you like to borrow it?  Oh, and cornblog is a stupid idea. Lara: Where can I get a copy of your book?  And will you sign it?"
SVHEUZY,male,16,"Great Job, Nathan. You might as well have just said MacBeth! Also LNTV? Is that like announcements? Because that would just be mean. Also because it bears repeating,  Start Your Own Blog.   In unrelated news, Break A Leg, Erin! And Massive Props to Marten!  In a completely unsurprising twist the italicization of the blog can be attributed to one Marten ""Glutenous Polypeptide"" Dollenger. See my post ""I am on my way. When I am manifest, our work begins..."" wasn't italicized when I posted it. But it was after Marten posted his silly post. So it's all Marten's fault.  Also Comments are down until I get back from Chicago. Sorry!"
SVHEUZY,male,16,"Standing Stone was okay, but Triennium would have been better. I keep forgetting I'm the weird one. Mostly walking to and from the dam, to and from the rec hall, and playing cards, or video games when my cousins ditched me from time to time. It wasn't in a mean way, they just never made an effort to find me before they went and did stuff, and when I found them later in the day, they're all ""Where've you been?"" In my freaking cabin, if you cared to look. sheesh. oh well. Some are coming to Jekyll and Hyde.  Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie."
SVHEUZY,male,16,"Okay, I did the title and the description. I'm officially declaring May 3rd-7th ""Michael's Birthday Week!"" The Comstocks thought too small, ha ha for them. They didn't get a week. They got three days. HA! I mock them!  It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!"

SVHEUZY,male,16,"Paul is in the house! That's really awesome, we're really happy, get ye a title scheme. Actually after telling people that you actually made it onto the blog, I was responded with two 'awesome's and one 'what the hell is that little mofo doing here.' I won't *cough* Erin *cough* mention any names, but it's too bad that there's still such evil in this world.  I don't remember what else I was going to- THOMAS! I HAVE TO GO!

67XWU76,male,17,"This is just a punk rock blog, written for the people who see something's wrong...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh, hey!  Here's another brand new fuckin' blog comin' at ya faster than...somethin' thats fast!  OK, well today's slogan (the thing up there that is followed by the phrase  ""...its the Punk Rock Editorial!"" ) came for the song  ""Punk Rock Song""  by  Bad Religion .  Just givin' them the recognition they deserve, you know.  Anyway, lotsa things have been goin' on recently and everyone is fuckin' busy.  Whats the cause?  I'll tell ya in a second!   School!   Yeah, thats right, if you hadn't heard me bitchin' about it before, we've embarked on yet another journey, another quest to attain knowledge.  Sounds like an epic conquest!  Anyway, yeah school has started, and I'm still tryin' to get back into the cycle.  You know, stayin' up all night when I was on vacation really screwed up my internal clock thing...so I'm tryin' to fix it up.  School's been pretty good though and I've been havin' a lot of fun so far.  Heh, yeah from now on you are prolly gonna be hearin' me talk more about school because...school is now (once again) takin' up a large time slot on my time tables.  Yay!  Alright, somethin' I havta address.  As some of you know,  Nick  has about three blogs, which include:   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare , the  T.E.W. , and somethin' he calls  Rants .  Well last night, I was doin' my regular check up on all the blogs, seein' if there has been anythin' new posted or whatever.  Well, he did an article on  ""teasing, heckling, and blah blah.""   So he talked about how the  ""cycle of teasing""  has to somehow be broken.  You know, read the article for the full story.  Sorry  Nick , but that is the biggest bullshit I've ever heard!  Breakin' the cycle of teasin' huh?  Thats sorta impossible.  Because the thing you refer to ""the cycle"" has always and will always exist.  There's no way you can disrupt the cycle because its there and its one of those things that doesn't need any verbal recognition to justify it's existence!  Everyone, yes everyone, gets fuckin' teased by someone else.  Yeah, even if some people get made fun of more than others, there really isn't anythin' you can do to stop that from happening.  Does anyone remember those tips they used to give us back in elementary school on how to handle situations with teasing?  How they told us to say ""please stop"" or to just walk away?  Yeah, well they were fuckin' idiots to say that because you would expect adults to remember how school was, how bein' young was, and how, if you used those bullcrap techniques to try and avoid a confrontation, you'd be worse off.  If anythin', those ""techniques"" for avoidin' a fight provoked more than they did pacify.  But teasin' doesn't stop in elementary school.  Remember junior high?  Everyone was fuckin' conscious of themselves because we were goin' through so many transitions at that time, it was hard not to get picked on.  And bein' a kid, I know how kids are...we're discriminatory idiots and it was either pick on or be picked on.  Its the same way in high school.  Yeah, we're sposta act ""mature"" or some bullshit like that because we're gettin' older and its expected of us.  First of all, who are they to fuckin' set standards for me and tell me that I havta live up those fucked little standards?  Anyway, even in high school people get teased.  And teasin' doesn't stop there.  Elementary, intermediate, and high school are just little models of what society really is.  Look at them.  Can't you see it?  Those stupid little ""levels of society"" may not have been apparent, but they're there.  In school, you've got the popular kids...jocks and cheerleaders...you know, the elite...Then you've got the middle class, where the majority of kids are...then there is the band dorks, nerds, geeks, and the smelly kids.  School is an impeccable little clone of what society is really like.  You may not know it, but yeah, people are classifyin' us into little castes right now.  Or maybe this is just my fucked up perception.  But here's what I think...teasin' and hazin' is just a fuckin' part of growin' up...its one of life's fucked up little lessons so you gotta accept it...you can't go through life without be made fun of who you are, cuz you know what?  We live in a fuckin' world where variety is both a good and bad thing.  Though our beliefs, opinions, ideas, gender, ethnicity, background, appearance...,basically the things that define who we are, seperate us from everyone else and makes us ""individuals,"" the problem is that it seperates us from everyone else and makes us ""individuals.""  You can't expect people to coexist peacefully.  People are always goin' to discriminate...people are always gonna form stereotypes...accept it.  Not everyone is goin' to agree with you, and not everyone is goin' to tolerate you.  Right now, whoever might be readin' this is either noddin' their head vigorously in agreement, or is shakin' there head and brandishin' a fist at the computer screen.  Big deal to me.  I say,""Right on!"" cuz that means they are fuckin' stickin' to their beliefs.  I'm not here to tell you whats right or wrong.  I'm just tellin' you what I think, not teliin' you what to think.  Anyway, people only make you feel inferior with your consent.  They are just one person outta who knows how many who dislike you.  As long as you know who you are, then fuck what they say.  RIght?  I mean, yeah, I've been to those points where its just like ""I can't take it!"" but hey, its like a shot or an enema...its over before you know it.  Their is some psychology behind hazin' as well.  Make them look stupid so that you look better.  Yeah, kinda like an ego boost.  Its stupid, but I admit that I still talk shit about people...cuz you know what?  Its fuckin' fun...and sorry, some people set themselves up to be made fun of (i.e. big mouth girl who is very fat and wears see through pants so we can see her fat asshole devour here poor little sky blue underwear!).  Anyway, I know my limits.  Its kinda weird how kids get teased and then they decide that the best retaliation is to shoot up the place.  If you seriously brood on bein' made fun of that much, then you've got a problem.  You care too much of what others think that you kinda forgot what you think.  You know what kind of person you are.  Don't let other people change the perception you have of yourself.  Only you have the right to do that.    That hasta be the fuckin' longest blog I have ever written.  Course, you can expect more of this right here on the  P.R.E.   I think I wanna continue on this topic...of school shootings and what not.  Strange how things branch off...and well I had been talkin'  Elyse  about this stuff last night.  Remember though...""Your point of view, it belongs to you/No one can take it away.""  Sorry listenin' to  Pennywise's  new album,  From the Ashes !  Yeah, it comes out  Sept. 9th .  How am I listenin' to it you ask?  Bootleg connections, bee-otch!  Alright, I'll do another blog later.  Maybe it'll be longer?!  Who knows!  More to come...!"
67XWU76,male,17,"Alright. Doesn't life suck? I just have to say   IT REALLY SUCKS  By the way, since it is PAST midnite, this is the first blog entry of the week! So, JR do you have anything to say about that?  For a while, life is great to you. It does pretty much everything that you want it to do. Then, it screws you over! All of your hard work is just thrown down into the toilet. It's like crap, isn't that why people say ""Oh, shit!"" they must be referring to their life! Ok, maybe that was really corny (in fact, it was!), but there are some good things about life.     DISCLAIMER  : this blog is merely for comical purposes. That is all."
67XWU76,male,17,"This is my new blogchalk:   United States, Southern California, Riverside, None of Your Business, English, J.R., Male, 16-20, Punk Rock, Video Games.   :)"
67XWU76,male,17,Haha...still at  Nick's house .  Did you know that you should dance yer cares away...down at  Fraggle Rock!
67XWU76,male,17,"Yeah, I know. It's been pretty dull around here. Not much has been going on at  Three Eye Witnesses . Our contest recently ended, but that is about it.  Stay tuned for an update tomorrow or Saturday. I can't guarantee that though, ha ha, the update I mean."
67XWU76,male,17,"The second blog today...its the Punk Rock Editorial!!!   Yeah, thats right everyone, this is the second time I've blogged today!  Its kinda like, when you get a new VG (video game for those who don't know of the acronyms I've made up over the years) and you play it every miserable hour of yer life and then get yelled at by yer old man for playin' and then continue to play some more.  You just wanna keep playin' and playin', or in this case bloggin' and bloggin', at the beginning.  I hope I never get tired of bloggin' or anythin', and I'm sure  Nick and Elyse  will hear nothin' of that and will prolly do anythin' in their power to prevent me from stoppin'  I should hope so!  Anyway, why did I start bloggin'?  Well, there are a lot of reasons and yes, Nick , Liz, and Elyse (and hopefully the others) are some of the reasons.  Well some of the other reasons are:  to inform the world of the atrocities that happen everyday, to show the world my outlook on life's ups and downs, and the possibility that typin' up my feelings and emotions and sharing them with others might not only benefit other people, but maybe myself as well.  Anyway, what can you expect to get outta this blog...?  I dunno, you can search for some special meaning in all these words, and fuck maybe there is, but basically its just a punk kid typin' up his opinions on this scary place, where Hotchick69 could really be some fat guy waitin' to jump on yer ass and rape you, where porn makes up about 3/4 of all the places you can visit, and insecurities can be erased by way of emotionless and idle conversation called ""the IM""...this is the Net; a ""cyber-haven"" built on a foundation of lies and deceit.  Hmm...how similar to the real world it is.  Only a few people choose to wield the truth and even fewer still have the balls to speak about it.  Well, just somethin' you should think about.  Anyway, I've met my goal of typing more words in this blog than the last I just posted.  More to come...!"
67XWU76,male,17,"This is  JR.  bringin' you, the public, another blog.  This is the second blog of Monday.  It is very early, and if you happened to read the  Punk Rock Editorial  before you read this blog, then you know why I am up so early...Anyway, to business.  It seems that today may be sunny with light clouds, but you can never really tell what the weather will be like in good ol'  Riverside !  Well, i don't think I can make anymore weather forecasts for today because I'm pretty tired out and because I'm not your local meterologist!  Well, I hope  Nick  comes on to take over since it is now the  morning shift , which is not the shift that I work (I only do morning shifts on weekends), and types a follow-up blog to this one.  Sorry for not givin' you a cheery mornin' prediction, but I'm one of those people who really doesn't do mornings very well.  Anyway, I should clock out and start gettin' ready for school.  Signin' out of the  graveyard shift , its  JR. !!!   Nikolas Brown  will be takin' over shortly...stay tuned!"
67XWU76,male,17,"'Rents on a rampage...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh, well here I am again, bloggin'.  It's pretty late (or early, depends how you look at it) in the night (or mornin', depends on how you look at it) and I'm still up for no fuckin' reason!  So, since I was doin' nothin', I thought I'd blog, since I don't really have anythin' else to do.  Plus, bloggin' doesn't require much effort, does it?  Well, actually, that's a false misconception!  It's really hard to come up with topics to talk about on here.  It really sucks sometimes, and yer just like ""Dammit!  I don't know what to blog about!"" and all desire for writing a blog is lost.  Trust me, thats been the case many times with me.  I go on, all happy, and ready to blog.  Type in my username and password...yeah we're gettin' somewhere.  Then the  ""Create New Post""  page pops up.  The little cursor in the empty text box blinks...and blinks...and blinks...just an utter annoyance...calling...mocking...teasing...It drives you into the dark recesses of insanity and then yer like ""Ah screw this, I don't havta prove myself to you, you fuckin' cursor thing!""  Then the arrow, controlled by the mouse, which happens to be controlled by me, goes up to the top right-hand corner of the page and clicks angrily on the little ""X"" which closes the page and begins what I like to call  ""idle time"" , where I stare at the bright ass fuckin' compooter screen (yes, I am in the semi-darkness of our compooter room...oh slightly sexual...and unnerving) and wait for someone to rescue me from my own insanity.  Oh wow, I was reminded of that song that goes  ""Wake me up inside (I can't wake up!) somethin' somethin' somethin'...""   I forget, cuz I don't really listen to that crap.  Hey, but this time its different!  I didn't go insane!  Hah!   J.R-1, Society-0 !  Suck a dick, bitch!  Right, recently I got in a spot with my  old man .  Not that this is uncommon, but it has been awhile, and I was rather enjoyin' it.  Whatever.  Anyway, it happened a few days ago, and it was my utmost intention to blog about it here...but I forgot what happened sorta...I know my dad did raise his voice...I talked back, provoking...he raised a vacuum threathingly as if he was goin' to dash my brains out with it...oh yeah, OK!  I guess he was mad at me cuz my room isn't exactly clean.  And he was mad cuz I sleep til like two in the afternoon or somethin'...as if that was a crime, really.  Oh yeah, and both my 'rents were mad at me cuz I stay up all night on the compooter and havin' phone sex (haha J/K) with my supposed girlfriend  Elyse .  Isn't that lovely?  Yeah, I got in trouble for it, and I've been caught over and over again.  Luckily, they aren't very good at enforcin' punishment, so I can consider myself lucky, can't I.  Well, enough about me, how about you guys!?  Hey, that  Operation: Revolution  really needs to get started!  Who the fucks in charge of this pla-oh...oops its me!  Damn my own laziness!  Right, I'll try guys, I really will!  I was also thinkin' of postin' lyrics for songs on the blog every now and then...A nice little treat you know?  Well thats it for now...More to come...!"
67XWU76,male,17,"Waging the war against errorism...its the Punk Rock Editorial!    Yep, thats right folks, yet another edition of the Punk Rock Editorial!  Speaking of editorials, did you hear that my friend and Blog Superior  Nikolas Brown  , and thats how I spell his name (I think he likes it) has been accepted into our school's/prsion's/our personal hell's/our ""workplace's"" newspaper?  Well, he has and I just that it deserved some mention.  I'm kinda surprised that I am on my third blog today, but i have a lot to talk about!  Of course, this being the weekend and all, I have more time to blog.  The number of new blogs will prolly be reduced to two (2) per day or less...or worse...none!  Hopefully that is not the case though, right?  What else can I talk about in this blog?  Oh, how about I tell you a bit about my weekend?  Well, if you are a reader of  Nick's  blog, then you may already know about our history project on WWI/II.  Well, I'm glad to announce that I got together today with my friends  Eddie, Derek, Robbie, and Eric  today and with everyone's help, finished the video portion of our project!!! In the video, I played various parts such as  Hirohito , Emperor of Japan,  Winston Churchill , Prime Minister of England, a  Japanese citizen , and an  unwilling kid  refusing to be drafted (very punk rock!).  Last night, I went with  my sisters  to a karaoke party held by  my oldest sister's  boyfriend  Mark .  Not only was it fun to sing, but I got a 99 (the machine scores your performance)!!!  Future contestant of American Idol?  No way!!!  Someday, I want to take my friends to Punk Rock Karaoke.  I have yet to go myself.  It won't happen anytime soon, becasue I think you havta be 21 and older to go, so unless I miraculously turn 21 or a fake I.D. mysteriously falls into my hands, I'm gonna just havta wait.  I'm in no rush though, I can just as well sing punk songs for my friends anytime of the day.  Well, I've run outta things to say for now, so I think I will end this blog pretty soon.  Lets see how long I can go without creating another blog...I will just keep on typin' until I run out of things to say...Oh I'm comin' close to runnin' outta things to say....what can I talk about, what can I talk about...I'm burstin' with opinions, but right now I dunno if I can think of one...I know!  Maybe my two ""Blog Buds""  Nick and Elyse  have some suggestions.  But anyway I'm now at a loss for words!  More to come...!"

H65Q8TH,female,26,"The only thing worse than being sick is not having someone to take care of you. Gosh I need to meet a new man who can whip up chicken soup in a heartbeat. WHERE ARE YOU???Lucky for me between the two days I took off to go to Miami on Monday and Tuesday and calling in sick today, I only worked 2 days this week and surprisingly was pretty productive. Now if I could only get permission to ""work remotely"" I would be set. I mean what does it mean to ""work"" from home - proof a DSL hook up and a telephone for conference call. If that is the case, surely I ""work"" remotely in the morning and at night around work."
H65Q8TH,female,26,"Well as you may or not know, I have this obsessive shopping habit. I figured eventually I would run out of room for things, but I didn't realize it would happen so soon. Well it has. Despite 4 closets, 2 dressers and numerous plastic clothing containers my last few purchases have been forced to stay in the shopping bags/boxes they have come in. So I decided to get cracking and start getting rid of everything I did not need. Well I realized I have quite a tee-shirt collection, many of which are too sentimental to dispose of. I have tee-shirts commemorating my boarding school days, the time I tried out to be a VJ on MTV, winning a spring break booty contest in Jamaica, my first law firm job, my first rap concert, my first real job at Reebok, my first vacation with a man and the list goes on. So while I did manage to fill three shopping bags with donations to Good Will (and a smaller shopping bag of things to sell on eBay to make money to buy more stuff), certain tee-shirts will stay in the drawer for many spring cleanings to come. Thanks to Sharifa who I helped move into a new apartment with her boyfriend for inspiring my own cleaning. Now if only I could be inspired to find a man I could actually see myself living with...."
H65Q8TH,female,26,My luggage has been found!!!!! I haven't skipped in years and I skipped all up and down my hallway. This according to the man on the phone who hopefully wasn't lying. He said the bag has to go through customs first but then I could come and pick it up - I don't trust them delivering it. I will post again when the luggage is officially in my hands!!! I am so happy I didn't have to kill any airline employees. I plan to stay out of jail for at least the remainder of the year. I am 26 now afterall. I guess I am supposed to start acting like an adult. Thanks to my sweet boss who let me leave today at noon since I have yet to go to sleep with anxiety over this luggage.   Update : My bag is still at Heathrow. Lying British Airways bastards!! I made them give me $100 for the trouble of gong to JFK and back without my shit. They say they will courier it to me first thing tomorrow after it lands. We shall see.....
H65Q8TH,female,26,"Last time I checked, Old Navy was a family shopping store. There commercials always feature fashions for children and adults. So who in the hell at GAP Inc. determined that it was suitable for their new commercial to feature a song about ""Daisy Dukes"", also known as pum pum shorts or ""hot"" pants. Maybe I am a bit prude, but something is fishy..."

H65Q8TH,female,26,"So I am coming in from work (I actually did some work today!) check the mail box and low and behold I see a hand written letter addressed to me from ""Durham Correctional Facility""!!! I never get actual mail - when you are my age EVERYTHING is like Beyonce sang - Bills, Bills, Bills. Immediately I run down a mental list of some of the memorable southern brothers I used to roll with in my days of pimpin. I consider myself a cute girl, well dressed, born and raised NY'er and I have a lil bootyliciousness going on so needless to say, I was very popular with the home grown thugs of VA, NC, SC, DC, etc. I was attracted to how easy they are and the flash of the lifestyle. I would go check my best girl who moved to VA when she was 14, hit the mall and within minutes we had guys taking us on shopping sprees and out to eat. There is not much else to do down there and truth be told, southeners are a little slow.  By freshman year in college, I had one guy named Corey sending me plane tickets every other week so he could see me. He would book me a room at the local Sheraton and we would spend the weekend at the local mall, bars and of course my favorite - the go-cart track! That was one of the few things I looked forward to during my freshman year at NYU. I actually thought it was cute that I had this guy attached to me like puppy who wants to play. After a while I realized dating a guy in the fast lane was not for me. Long periods alone waiting for them to ""handle business"", never knowing their phone number or address or real name, constantly feeling like people are watching you. After a while I would pick fights with him to be done with the situation. He would send me cards begging me to come back. He said he thought I was the one because after all, he always wanted a NY chick and he finally had one, or so he thought. I felt guilty when he started to catch feelings. He had no idea I was in it for the money (that and it made my boyfriend in NY very jealous). I guess I have always been addicted to something, shopping is my vice and clothes and shoes are my drugs of choice. Guys use women for sex before they grow up (some never do!), women use men for other things (father figure, material goods,etc.) before we realize what relationships are all about.  Well by now you must know this letter I speak of is from Corey. He tells me he found God and actually apologized for everything we went through back when we were dating. I guess you don't realize how memorable you are to the people in your past until they pop up in ways like this. Although I have always been unlucky in love, I guess I have always been remembered judging by the calls I get from men of my past. See what happens when you keep the same cell number and address for years! Just when I thought I put my foolish, childish ways far behind me, there it is in your mailbox one day. I have no choice but to write him back. I am glad I have moved past those days. I am sorry it took him a trip to the pen to do the same thing."
H65Q8TH,female,26,"With my friend Linda's baby. I finally got to meet her 5 month old baby while in D.C. and boy is he a heartbreaker. He is the finest chocolate butterball in the world with the cutest long eyelashes and curly afro. I held him most of the day and we even took a nap together. I fed him his gross lunch of rice cereal and wiped it off his face when he made a mess. I can't wait to see him again this weekend in NY!  Don't get it twisted - there is still not a man that walks the earth who could bring me to be permanently connected to him by bearing his child so he could later run off and screw the next hot young thing, but it was fun to play pretend for a day. I know everyone reading this is saying I am bitter, but every married couple I know personally has had to deal with infidelity. At least I know if/when my husband cheats, I'll go to work one day and never come home again. You can't do that after you have pushed out the kids.  Thanks to Linda and all my other girlfriends who will allow me to experience a small fulfilling taste of motherhood, without the hassle, stretch marks, weight gain, permanent disfigurement, financial instability and forever attachment to a male."
H65Q8TH,female,26,"""nicole  I want to inhale her...I want to make her SOOOOOOO happy, or at least as happy as she's made me...I wrote about being in certain types of love, but a part of me remained cynical...sure, in theory you believe that type of love exists, but...I don't know...I guess you don't know until you're there and your brain and heart and mind come to the same frightening realization... ""nothing else matters"" this is it...the gravy, the grits, the guts...whatever inane analogy you wanna use to describe something of great importance...

Young's blog .  I had to give this blog props because boy did he sum up in his own words what love is like - inhaling the one you love. My question is, when does that feeling go away? It sucks to feel that when the relationship is long over. Deep down past the mean bitch I like to portray, I am a hopeless romantic who still mourns my first true love - Rodney Johnson a.k.a The Sheriff. That was eight years ago in 1996. Well it took me another 5 years to fall again in 2001 so I guess I am just biding time until 2008. That will be perfect cause I'll be 30 years young and hopefully mature enough to deal with what comes my way."

You can't just force me to go to some website. Explain yourself.   OK, OK, I'll explain before you go. It's a letter of opposition to the UN and the EU to show the worldwide support for the Israeli security fence.

8HO357I,male,44,"urlLink Barbie is damaging to American girls with her materialistic ways  - you've heard this before. While I agree with the anti-Barbie crowd (to a very limited extent) that she could use a little smartnin' up sometimes, this stickery article reflects the local tone toward, well, frankly, what we'll call 'an American toy'.    So what's on Barbie's mind these days?  The November election? Holes in the ozone? Stephen Hawking's recent reversal on subatomic theory?   Well, these  are  all things on the minds of most 5 year old girls in America.   Nope - she's looking for just the right pair of floral-design pumps.   Girls buying shoes! What next!?   A wonderfully shameless display of cross-branding is one thing. But a Barbie who pigeonholes girls in an antiquated stereotype?   Young slender women at the mall carrying bags is now a stereotype, says the guy whose ideals probably include the loathing of any center of commerce.     ""How do you spell 'ugh'?"" asked Debbie Newman, a stand-up comic in Eugene. ""But what are you going to do? That's what advertisers tell little girls they want: Little boys want to play with guns and little girls want to play with makeup. It's just not letting  women  be as much as they can be.""   Any 'women' who purchase and play with this doll have  this doll  to blame for their lack of success in life. Got it. Please continue.    But Newman, an office manager with Schnitzer Steel, would rather see the toy company introduce ""Office Manager"" Barbie.  ""She'd be just crabby all the time,"" Newman said. ""And outside her little Barbie office would be 17 people lined up needing something from her.""   She'd be crabby, indicating that 5 year olds should carry that attitude, while being as much as they can be. If Barbie's life sucks as an office manager, could I suggest Barbie Community College? Moving on.    ""Mayor Barbie,"" the doll dreamed up by Kitty Piercy, 62-year-old nominee for the post in Eugene.   Piercy, although absent the shopping gene, said she's OK with shopping Barbie ... as just one manifestation of the countless roles that women play in society.  ""I'd like to see 'President Barbie,' "" she said. ""I'd like to see Barbies in different sizes, shapes and colors, Barbies of different ages - and there's no limitation to what a Barbie can be or do.""   Because every kid wants ""Golden Age Barbie"". Hey Kitty, how about pro-choice Barbie? I won't go into a description, I just can't do it. All I'll say is, abdomen made of pliable material.  This  is how you spell 'UGH'. I can't believe I'm posting this.     Sally Sheklow, a 53-year-old founding member of the Eugene women's comedy troupe, WYMPROV!, said ""Improv Barbie"" would have ""a belly and a butt and hips, nipples.""  ""Improv Barbie"" would use props and shop the garage sales, not ALDO, Sheklow said. Above all else, she would enjoy free license to speak her mind ... for laughs.  ""She could get away with saying anything about the need for regime change without fear of repercussion,"" Sheklow said, ""because she'd be a comic.""   Because we know all Barbie can say now is:  I wish they taught shopping in school! Let's bake some cookies for the boys! Don't ask me, I'm just a girl. Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us. Now low let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream! (episode 1F12)  Too bad Barbie wouldn't be calling for regime change, that ""regime""'s ideals made her a household name.   I guess all I have to do is proclaim my status as a comic, to avoid the 'Wrath-croft' of the government.  (Yeah, g'head and use it.)"

8HO357I,male,44,"I'm addicted to blogs.   (I don't like that song, I'm not sure why I thought it would be clever.)  Obviously, not addicted to this  blog, but other people's.   Nary a workday goes by where I don't spend my break time (or possibly a little more time) reading blogs. Most of them are the high profile one's in everyone's history (for example - Lileks's TibetanYarnNoodles.com, Everyonehaveahappyspoonsexperience.com, bludgeoningIMAO.us) but I've found myself bouncing around people's blogrolls and looking at little personal blogs (like this one.) Today I thought, ""Why?"" I don't like people, people often annoy me - why do I care what they scrawl on a post or two? Maybe I'm intrigued by those of us who can do this, and impessed by those who do this well. After all, not everyone writing a blog gets on the elevator with me and tries to make small talk for no reason at all.  'Uuuuggghh, only Tuesday, huh?'  I half-smile and hope they'll go away."
8HO357I,male,44,"I took my last final Friday morning (and was too busy to blog all weekend), so I'm officially done with the 2003-2004 school year. The atmosphere in the library Friday morning was indicative of finals week; about 20 people using the computer area that accommodates 150, and work study kids behind the information desk eyeing passersby with solemn contempt ( ""Would you people hurry up and leave so that I can go DRINK already!"" )Unfortunately for them, happy hour was a long way off, and a slow day was in the way - no one checks out books or needs help finding a certain journal on the last day of the school year. Well, maybe grad students. Nerds.   ""The  urlLink Kelley Engineering Center  is going up quickly"", I think to myself. Looking at the giant crane I was reminded of last fall, when my vector calc class was migrating to another building on campus. As we passed, we all watched this massive structure being erected by a smaller, yet still massive mobile crane. My thoughts go back to the progress of the build. There was a time when I would have considered the notion that experts -- quality thinkers and doers -- were due credit for what's been done in that amount of time. From the engineering team to the welder on the frame of the 2nd floor, these guys have a work ethic and a desire for excellence so strong that the physical evidence (the building) was the progress.  But instead, in a loathful voice I said, ""Bet the state's burning huge sums of money to get this thing done so fast."" My faith in the tireless proud worker is beaten with a stick when the state of OR gets involved."

Vito Corleone is one of my all time favorite film  (read 'film', not 'movie')  characters.   The Eugene Police are trying to regain the respect of the community. Half of Eugene was already disrespectful to the police because they might find their stash, and the other half thinks a police-free society is plausible. They have an uphill battle."
