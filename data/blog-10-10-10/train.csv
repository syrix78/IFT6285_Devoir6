7M03OTX,male,24,"Well another boring day, not much going on at WORK today. The highlight of the day was Charley turning into a category one Hurricane and its projected path is South FL. Now, before I get excited and host my first Hurricane party, every hurricane that was projected to hit SOUTH FL last year missed us and hit the Carolina's (note to self, don't buy ocean front property in Carolina). So we will see how is pan's out. The good news is that I am a Conversion Analyst, converting over 600 offices to PeopleSoft, well that is not good news but. We have a huge conversion this weekend in which we are converting one of our largest clients (100 Million $ Account), I don't think we are ready, but upper management does not care, so the only thing that might stop this conversion is CHARLEY. Hmm, is it bad to want a Hurricane to hit, I guess I should ask my therapist, I will get back to you guys on that one.  I have a friend in town tonight, she rolled of the project a couple of months ago, and for some reason I am not that excited to see her. NO, it is not that I don't want to see her I just don't want to see some of the people that are going out with us tonight (i.e. evil bitch dog from hell) oops did I type that. Well I am already upset, because we where supposed to go to O'Heras on Las Olas. Now, it is one thing to go out and have drinks with 20 straight co-workers, and have a gay bar right down the street so when I am drunk I can sneak out and go flirt with GAY MEN. My co-workers don't understand, but who cares, anyways. To my dismay they fuckin changed the venue, to some trashy bar called Fox and the Hound, ewww, who would want to go there anyways. So who is the bitch that did not want to go to O'Heras, well it was Gayla so I am not going to hate, I might just not show up so there. I just don't understand the straights sometimes."

7M03OTX,male,24,"urlLink    On this weeks episode of the Real World....  Today was not the best of days, got into a huge fight with someone whom I thought was a close friend, but turns out just to be a co-worker. Over the past year I have made so many new relationships with associates on the project. Some of those relationships have turned into great friendships. Some of these friendships I had hoped would last a lifetime, but don't always turn out that way. Life sucks sometimes, but I guess you have to keep rolling with the punches. It is sad sometimes when you invest so much into a person to get nothing in return or to finally see how they really are. I guess you could say her TRUE COLORS shined through brightly today.  Rena and I had a disagreement about how we have treated each other over the past couple of weeks, one of my issues is with her was honesty with me. Her issue is that I have not been treating her very nice the past few days and honestly I have not, because this issue has been eating away at me. So we where down at a co-workers cube visiting and she made a comment about something I said, I turned around and called her a mean word and we went back to our desks. Fifteen minutes later a get a long e-mail that pissed me off, so I wrote back and got everything off my chest, she in return said she is done with me, and that is fine nothing I can do but move on. Sucks when you speak your mind sometimes saying the things people just don't want to hear how they shut off. Honestly, I feel better about the whole thing, I guess some friendships are not worth fighting for.  It is very HARD to maintain some of the friendships on this project only because we work with each other 10 hours a day and since we relocated for this project leaving friends and family forces us to also feel the void of social activates after work. This sometimes is a recipe for a mess, maybe we need some time apart. Well hopefully my day tomorrow will be better, until then......   urlLink"
7M03OTX,male,24,"I had a great weekend. Aaron is out of town for the conversion, so Jenny and Maggie May stayed with me to keep me company.  We went to a house warming party on Friday night came back watched a few episodes of Sex in the City and went to bed.  Saturday, We watched a few movies and cried....( urlLink The Prince and Me  &  urlLink Love Actually ). I love romantic comedy's, if you have not already seen  urlLink Little Black Book , you must. I give it 2 Thumbs up. After the movies we went shopping at Aventura Mall, OMG, have to go cruising at this mall more, the guys are way hotter than at the Boca Mall. We spotted this hottie in Bloomies and he followed us into Gap, where we lost him, damn it. We are not creepy stalkers, besides he followed us. After a uneventful shopping trip we met my friend Kelly in downtown Hollywood to have dinner and drinks. Downtown Hollywood is cute (Hollywood, FL) I loved it a cute downtown seen with some trendy places to eat. Had a great dinner said our goodbyes and went home.  I am reading  urlLink Naked , by David Sedaris, he is so FUNNY, tried to finish, but I feel asleep.  Today I am at work.....over it, but this is my last CONVERSION so I am so happy. Took us a little over a year to finish the part of the project. Hopefully today will be smooth, until then........"

Today i saw Shrek 2 and It was tres funny and i have a newfound obsession with calling people pigeon. Then we were gonna go to nando's  for some spicy portuguese type food but it was full so i had to trek all the way to St. Benedicts to the Italian place. I forget the name. No, wait, Umberto's Trattoria Italiano. It does killer Lasagne. Well not literally, I lived to tell the tale. As you have witnessed. I'm now going to hut up as this entry is rapidly becoming the nonsensical jabberings of a retard Hmmm..."
64F8JNR,male,16,"I, I still recall, The first full moon in may, 'Neath whose rays we lay together, And those bright nights on glassy waves, When we would glide lightly away, From the grain, For wicked flights of pleasure.  Those visions fade, Like ghosts to lifes parade, Though incisions once made her so vivid, A scarlet whore, With both heels in the door, Of a heaven severed from me, Insipid.  And midst the writhe of parapets, Where angels sigh, Lonely she sits, Upon the lip, Only a slip from whence I beg her.  That i would wish, Her kiss a chrysalis, To break to make my fluttered heart amiss, And in those frozen moments won, From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun, In drapes inwove with deathshead wing, I thank god for the suffering.  Love would have conquered all, But for the rapture, That ancient plan for my defeat, Denied faith skies that would have set her free, It seems again dreams wend to capture  Once dancing in a spotlit waltz, Through a shadow dimension, Given to the rivers that bedizened her eyes, The world drifted by in lost momentum  With no divine intervention  Regardless that the author, Of sin was me and I, Lay chaste of hate in Faith's embrace, As mortals warred with more besides  They warred with life itself, And in those frozen moments won, From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun, In drapes inwove with deathshead wing, I thank god for the suffering.  And i thank god for the suffering, As i still burn, For her return I would make my peace with everything  I, I still recall, The first full moon in may, Consigned to flames like secret letters, And midst the writhe of parapets, Where angels sigh, Lonely she sits, Upon the lip, Only a slip from whence I beg her.  That i would wish, Her kiss a chrysalis, To break to make my fluttered heart amiss, And in those frozen moments won, From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun, In drapes inwove with deathshead wing, I thank god for the suffering.  Love would have conquered all, Were we not parted, her splintered loss rekindles rage, the winter frost dwindles across my stage, lit up once more to score finales started.  Love would have conquered all,  Love would have conquered... Hate"

Is it just the french teachers i have had that do this? Probably not but as only 3 people have my link i'll probably be in a minority.

Why doesnt anyone ever ring me, my parents are always getting fone calls. If i ever meet Alex Fairhurst of the medical sickness centre i'll shove everything within arms reach up his nose. TWAT!!! Leave me alone, she'll ring you when she gets back! I don't need to be rung to ask whether she's home yet cos if she was, she'd have rung you. YOU TIT! And i have tan-lines again.

QTSYZJV,male,26,"As you can see I am updating my blog.  I am trying to learn how to do this sort of thing on my own so I can start working on the Barley and Hops website for Nate.  My next task to reapply the links to everyones blogs.  Bare with me.  Getting prepared for a monster weekend.  Beer gardens is Friday and should be fun.  My plan is to go out after class, have a few drinks, come home and eat, and then go into work and turn that mutha out.  I don't see any holes in that plan.  That is all I gots. Later."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"I am not  urlLink Michael Jordan .  I did not score any points on a professional basketball court.  I never played minor league baseball.  I did not retire from my job three times.  I can serve two drinks at once.  I do know how to make about 20 different variety of shots.  I am Ryan Hayes, his bartender."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"Lately, it seems to be the fad to pick on me and various aspects of my life.  That is fine, just watch your backs.  You know who you are.  On to more serious matters.  urlLink Kylie Minogue  is pretty hot, so is  urlLink Leann Tweeden .  But if you like looking at girls from closer to home, watch the new  urlLink Girls Gone Wild  video and you should see a bunch of girls from Oshkosh.  One more thing, even though I can not vote, if I could it would be for  urlLink Wesley Clark .  I just kind of like what he has to say.  That is all"
QTSYZJV,male,26,"So, nothing new really happening in my life.  I do have to say even though it was hard to dismiss the obvious, I still held out hope that  urlLink baseball wouldn't be tarnished by cheating .  The last 7 years of baseball regrowth has been ruined by a few cheaters.  Many people in the media say that the  urlLink fans do not care  about steriod use in professional sports.  Being a fan, I say that they are wrong.  It reminds me a little bit of breast implants.  When you see them for the first time, you know that something just ain't quite right.  If you are lucky enough to play with them you feel incredibly excited for the opportunity to view greatness.  And when you find out for sure that it isn't real, you feel a little smaller for having ignored it when it was so obvious to everyone around you.  I imagine that to be the case when dating a  urlLink girl with fake boobs  as well.  Speaking of steroids,  urlLink Wrestlemania XX  is happening in less than 2 weeks.  I currently do not have a venue to enjoy the extravaganza.  Anyone willing to host this event on their TV would be my personal hero for at least 5 hours. (hint KP or AC)"
QTSYZJV,male,26,"I just discovered something about my 4 and half year stint at Hollywood Video.  I watched a lot of movies, most of them crappy, simply because they were free.  As I walked the store today, nothing seemed appealing to me.  I just hope the same thing happens when I am done getting drinks and sex for free at my job now.  OK so I am just getting the drinks for free.  I still have to work pretty hard for the sex."

QTSYZJV,male,26,"A tribute to the Mann.  When you agreed to live with me I knew it was with some hesitation, but I knew that you could live through it.  You had some reservations about the other person that you would be living with.  In the months to come I think you came to accept and deal with the faults of both your roommates.  I just wanted to take the time in cyberspace to thank you for the time that you have taken to enriched my life with by living with me.  I know that I am not the easiest person to live with, but who is.  I learned that by you living with me that we are truly good friends.  I know this because we were able to live together and remain friends in the end.  I believe that we are better friends because of it.   Good Luck to you on your future challenges and always remember that I am here for anything if you ask.  My good friend Chris Mann, University of Oshkosh-Wisconsin graduate and one hell of a MAN.  Salute!!!!!"
QTSYZJV,male,26,"Wrestlemania update.  Nate is a friend of myself, Chris, Som, Kevin and various other media outlets.  I believe it will be going down there.  I think it will be a BYOB type of deal.  I will consult him before the week is out.  In the meantime enjoy this funny thing. It is an ad considered to risque for us.   This is also funny."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"So I am going over my personal entertainment budget for the next month and I am a little surprised.  It is going to cost me a lot of money to go an see OTHER PEOPLE get married.  Now I am all for these glorious union of souls, but should it get in the way of my good time.   One wedding I am just going to and I am not even bringing a date and I figure to spend at least $200 on it.  I come to this conclusion because I have to pony up for a hotel room and I lose a Saturday night of working, easily my most lucrative.  The other wedding I am standing up in.  This will cost me the price of a tux, gift, hotel room, hooker for the night.  This wedding I figure around $250.  And I have not even thought about bachelor parties.  D'oh.  The sad thing is that I am probably getting off pretty easy this year.  Next year my sister is getting married and I have to travel to the homeland for that. My friend and boss Nate is also getting hitched and I am just scared of the bachelor party.  That being said, this weekend is the 2nd Annual Barley & Hops X-mas party.  This will probably be the last weekend this summer that I really cut loose.  Those of you invited to this soiree, you are officially warned.  That is all."

ASLB0XH,male,26,"urlLink What Is RSS ?   RSS or 'Really Simple Syndication' is an Internet standard just like HTML (i.e. the web) -- with one key difference -- delivery.  When you use the web, you're constantly browsing, searching ... seeking information.      With RSS new information -- information that you select and information you can turn off at any time --  is automatically delivered directly to you.   This information is called a Feed since it feeds direct to you.  An RSS feed is sometimes indicated by [an]orange [XML] icon...    Within an RSS feed there can be text, links pictures and more just as you find on the web.  The different 'chunks' of information within an RSS feed are called posts.   Analogy: Think of RSS as 'Tivo for the Web'."""

ASLB0XH,male,26,"urlLink Yahoo! Help - : ""What are your guidelines on spam?""   Again and again SEO firms attempt to ""trick"" the search engines into raising their clients' rankings to increase their sales. Sure there's a need for this, however Yahoo! and other search engine giants continue to change their algorythms to eliminate bogus websites from their listings.  One point that Yahoo! tries to make again and again in their guidelines is to create page for humans, not for search engines. Tricks like duplicating your website with different urls, redirecting your visitors to other places, and using extensive linking to inflate rankings are becoming more and more under attack by the search engines.  Find legitimate ways to increase rankings and sales."
ASLB0XH,male,26,"urlLink How Often Should I Submit My Site To The Search Engines? : Again, the answer seems to be now that search engines are more advanced it's not necessary to be submitting your site once a month or everytime you make changes to it. Trust in the power of the web. You'll be okay.   ""So the answer to your question is, it depends. If you're talking about Google, don't submit your website at all. Just do a few link exchanges with quality sites that are already ranked well with Google and let Googlebot 'find' your site automatically.  If you're talking about Inktomi, Altavista, and some of the others, using their 'Express Submission' services can speed things up considerably, but it isn't really necessary.  And remember, once your site is indexed in the search engines, re-submitting it will simply be a waste of time and/or money."""
ASLB0XH,male,26,"urlLink News Aggregators: All About Delivery : ""Just has you have a browser for the web, there are browsers for RSS.  These browsers are called News Aggregators or 'Aggies' because what they do is aggregate, i.e. gather and present new information.     Summary to date:  RSS is a way for you to have new information sent to you automatically.  The reader has complete control and can turn off any feed at any time.  This means there is never spam.    Within an RSS feed there are multiple chunks of information called posts.    An orange XML / RSS  (  )button or a text link like 'Syndicate' lets you get a site's feed.    A News Aggregator lets you view your collection of RSS feeds."""
ASLB0XH,male,26,"urlLink Its All About those Little Orange Buttons... : "" Any website, weblog or even any ecommerce site can provide information to you as an RSS feed.

When a site has an RSS feed or feeds available you might see something like one of these:   Syndicate This Site (XML)  (RSS)    What these text labels and icons mean is 'This site has an RSS feed and here's the URL'.

G0ZNF9M,female,23,"today i went to movie trading company to sell some movies on videotape i still had, i didn't want them anymore, they took up too much space   accidentally i ran a red light, the black suburban coming at me stopped i daresay two inches away from my bumper, not because they couldn't brake in time, just one of those aggressive drivers   turns out the black suburban was going to movie trading company to sell videotapes as well, when i got out of my car, the driver of the suburban did too, she had three children in tow, she started screaming her head off at me, i was about to apologize for cutting her off, i didn't after that, i was getting red hot with anger at that point but i didn't say anything since she had small children and all, i went in the store and got in line   as she came in she was bitching and cussing and being a one woman show, she told her children ""if she hadn't cut us off at the light, we would be first"", one of her children of about 5 years of age said  she should've gotten a ticket mommy, she's a bitch"", several people turned around at this remark and so did i   ""contain yourself and your child before i stab both your hearts out""   she started walking toward the exit door saying she was dialing the police on her cell phone, to which i said   ""i was reconsidering stabbing you since i'm in a hurry, but now i really think i'm going to"""

G0ZNF9M,female,23,"""But not fighting does not always equal a loss. Sometimes that is what is needed. Must take it moment by moment. Don't push me, cuz I'm close to the edge."" Chris,  I was not made to sit still and do nothing. If others can idly watch while the shit hits the fan, goody, but I can't, I won't. I don't agree with that defeatist behavior and I won't ever think it's an acceptable course of ""action"". I respect those who choose to sit back and ""see"" how it turns out. I think individuals are entitled to execute their God-given free will. But just because I respect that someone's a moron and let them be in peace doesn't mean I think they're right. It just means that I want the same respect from them, I want them to leave me be in peace. In my experience getting off your arse is half the battle, unfortunately the mentality of sitting still and waiting for divine interference prevails."

I haven't really talked with her though so it may crunch yet...   I spend too much money! I have to slow down here... save some money for things I really want, or even put it towards paying off my bills in a more rapid time frame. alas... a lass... now that would be nice!  working on a new song, not quite there yet with the lyrics but I think I have a good title for where the song seems to be headed: questions and apologies. maybe I'll just list it as Q&A on the outside of the cd I'll have someday(hopefully by the summer)... and then perhaps the full title can be written out inside... hmmm... ideas, thoughts... we'll see. I realized that I have much more free time than I had previously realized... I believe I should use this time a bit more wisely than I have been up to this point. not that I don't enjoy the time with my friends, but rather than it just being routine for me to ""hang out"" with them, I would like to spend more time playing/writing music, reading, studying, praying, and even just plain soaking in God. oh man oh man, that would be sooo great!   gotta get my music in order, record a cd, play shows... gotta gotta praise God, live my life as worship... (that should really be listed first!)... lookin' forward to habitat (it's going to be freakin' rad yo) gotta make more money(pay off some bills, save some money, get some more musical and sound equipment) gotta make sure to be attentive to keeping up friendships, can't lose 'em, become distant  aright...

(perhaps someone specific, perhaps the idea or just someone...) but it seems like every turn, every curve in the road, we get frustrated and confused because they are different, they don't think the same way as us, the react strangely to things, and we just don't understand.  but we go on, hoping that the next time it will be different, that this time she'll ""come around"" and everything will work out for once... then we're left wondering if it'll ever ""work out,"" if their truly is someone for us, or if we're doomed to an existence of solitude, with no one their to share life with, no one to love and to cherish 'til death do we part.(and hopefully not even then)  do they realize what their doing when they do it? do they even realize it anytime afterward?

I'd have to say that it was a complete success, especially for the first night. but if we can keep the numbers we had tonight, and have that to grow from, that would be sooo sweet. sweet like the swiss chocolate I had yesterday. mmm mmm good!   Johnny was back at work today... it's good that he's back around after his 10 day hiatus south of the mason dixon line. then our boss John was just extra JF today. I don't know what his deal is. Bobeng attributes it to his diabetes. I suppose that's a good reason, but geez! I really need to start making some money on the side. Windy City just doesn't cut it if I want to actually get an apartment. yikes! financial resposibility. oh, it turns out that my parking ticket fine was due yesterday. so I missed out on that, have to pay an extra $10 now. what really bites it is that when my mom called me at work to tell me, I found out she was sick with a massive fever and just getting ready for my dad to come home and take her to the doctor. God bless health insurance! I hope she gets better soon, she seems to have this nasty habit of sickness clinging to her. here's to God breaking that curse!  well hopefully soon I'll now something more.

MAWG9RF,male,25,"welcome back ed. lightning is a gorgeous creation that has the power to entertain, excite, scare, and destroy all in the same instant. I saw some great examples of this wonderful display we call lightning on the way home this evening.. ah yes.. on the way home. I went to quencher's tonight for their open mic night. I went to enjoy and kind of feel the place out for future opportunities. talk about future opportunities! I actually ended up playing a couple rough songs at the very end. my voice was nothing short of dieing on me but it was fun. eric(the guy who kind of heads it up.. a former employee of wcm actually) said that he wanted me to come back next week and play earlier in the night when more people would be around. most certainly. so then I mentioned that I could help out with the sound too if he needed it. *wam* opportunity smacks me upside the head. (praise God. He is so awesome. I love and appreciate Him immensely) looks like I'm on the sub list for running sound there now. (yeah.. woo hoo!) I got his phone number and he introduced me to steve and I gave steve my number so they could get a hold of me. looks like I'll be heading down there tommorrow night(tuesday) to get a grasp on how things work there and where everything is. ( \w/ rock on!) apparently it's some jazzy group tommorrow or something, and it starts 'bout 9:30pm. (sah-weet!) I'm excited. what's funny is I was talking to shawn today (this guy I met through elliot on a windy city show.. he's goin' on tour with converge in a couple weeks to run sound for them. now that's cool.) he was talking about going to some club and talking to the sound guy there and basically getting in like I did tonight at quencher's. sometimes God moves quicker than we expect. I probably wouldn't have said anything to eric about helping out if I hadn't talked with shawn about such thing earlier in the day. man, God's timing is weird/amazing/ perfect . (that really gives me hope for waiting) I'm stoked! got to play some tonight. gonna play some wednesday night at the ashbarry coffee house. get to hang with daniela during the day wed.. go to church (christian hills) see kyle flannigan probably. see brooke. ""working"" tommorrow night (learning the ropes at least) maybe hanging with will friday night and going to that ihop (international house of prayer ...no not pancakes) extension that's in the area (and if not this friday, then prolly soon at least :)  summer kick off bar 'b que for habitat thursday night. hopefully souled out again this saturday.(I like going there. I always seem to get something from the service) what a great week in store for seth. it makes me quite happy. (and I already talked about going over to chuck's last night after chillin' with dan culp for a while. that was cool too) I need some rest. still fighting off this cold ( or whatever it is.. it sure is annoying!) have a great day and God bless.  ps oh yeah.. almost forgot. looks like from the calender above the bar that there is an open jazz jam (or something like that) on sunday nights. I know some of you like jazz. we shall have to go sometime.  pps I love you."

9MOAJR2,female,34,"I had a short conversation with Precious this eve after a breakthru recovery with Eben.  The spanking she recieved reminded her of the place she wished to be.  I have told her I feel at times more a council than else.  Tonight she needed to be mentally cuddled a bit.  Have tried to explain to her that more than anything else she is a brat.  Equal to all in all manners save for her sex.  There she needs a strong hand to force her submission that she may experience all that she can at her most free.  She doesn't understand yet but she will.  Her side of the scene with Eben was exstatic save for one thing, she felt an overlong pause needed a new warm up session.  Her concern was rewarded by Eben.  One of her rewards was to watch her favorite tv programs uninterupted as long as she remained unclothed.  Upon listening to her side and hearing most of his, I gave her instructions to perform for me during this 'Reflectory' period.  To enjoy her tv program but during the comercial breaks to take his cock into her mouth.  Not a blow job, not a suckle, no suction or swallowing, simply to hold it in her wet warm mouth for the duration of the comercial.  A fitting way of reminding him of warmth deprived and the thought of teasing him so seemed to give her much thrill.  I hope to hear soon how the evening progressed."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"Tonight is supposed to be Anna's orgasm night. However she only gets one tonight and it's going to be over quick. Before she does though, she's going to get something else that she has had coming for a very long time. A special punishment.  I never had any desire to punish Anna over Erik like she thought I had done the day before I told her I knew. It never entered my mind. In fact, I have as of yet to punish her over a matter of heartfelt conviction until tonight. I've punished her for odd and end things, but tonight is special. Tonight Anna gets punished for something she truly deserves. How she talks about herself.  For Years she has refused to hear me when I have told her how beautiful and lovely she is. All she has ever wanted to do is have that selfish little pity party with her Cosmo magazine and comparing herself to those wretched cosmo models. Holding herself to not only an unreasonable standard, but rejecting the very standard I chose her for.  Anna has never understood. But tonight, we will begin to show her the way. Tonight, it's 10 hairbrush strokes followed by 200 sentences on the board. I regret it's only 10. In fact, I wish it was the Pain Stick instead of the brush (it WILL be next time!) But even if it was 1000 strokes, it wouldn't be enough to show her how much she has hurt herself and me with her insistent self downtrodden talk all this time. Time and again she has broken my heart with that crap. I'll be warming her up over a small matter of the kitchen sink. And after...She will probably need to stand up the rest of the night.  She's getting off easy. After it's over, all is forgiven and I'll hold her close and hopefully watch a new self esteem blossom from the tears and ashes. Submissive tend to feel well loved when they are disciplined with corporal punishment for something they know is wrong. Tonight, Anna will feel very loved indeed."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"You know what I said about not being able to wait to see what Dom had planned for me?  It didn't exactly work out that way.  I came home, greeted him briefly and was told to go in the bedroom.  He had a surprise for me, a poster of my rules and punishments for breaking them.  A poster.  Not a sheet of notebook paper.  A poster.  I paniced.  Not because there was that much new, there were a couple new things.  Not even because of the punishments being spelled out, although some were pretty harsh.  I just saw the size of the list and felt smothered.    Dom asked me why, made me think about it.  It's been so much easier to think clearly and answer honestly the last few days.  So I thought about it.  And decided I was afraid of resenting the rules when I didn't feel submissive.  Like I didn't feel submissive last night.  And then I told him I needed him to make me submit more.  I know, I know.  Make up my mind, right?  I'm still very confused.  Unsure of what I want or need.  A little scared.  And still just a tad haunted by our last efforts at D/s when I felt like I let him down.  So he informs me he is going to punish me for that guilt.  To help me let it go.  All he would say was he was going to punish me so I  felt  punished.  And wouldn't tell me what he was going to do.  Then he made me sit and watch the movie I rented and stew about what was coming.  I managed to work up a good head of fear by the time the movie was over.  He bound my breasts and tied them over my head to the power rack in the gym.  Then made a crotch rope, just for stimulation I think because I don't think that was attached and cuffed my hands behind my back.  He used this little leather slapper on my breasts.  Very sting-y.  And then he used a small rubber flogger.  And the riding crop some.  Then he put clothes pins on my nipples and used the flogger a little more.  I was in tears, but not letting go of much at this point.  He took me down and had me stretch out on the massage table and cuffed my hands in front of me.  He talked to me for several minutes and I started crying again, blurting out some junk from my past.  Just feelings, how I felt about my relationship with my mom and how it made me feel.  And that I didn't want to be her.  He told me I was on my way to being like her.  He couldn't have said anything more painful.  A little more talk and he stood up and moved behind me.  He used the crop on my ass and in no time (it seemed) I was sobbing hard.  At one point I was sobbing so hard I couldn't feel the crop.  I mean, I could, I could feel it touching me, but it didn't hurt.  All my focus was inward.  I've never experienced that before, not even with the hairbrushing.  I did feel punished when it was over.  And I felt clean.  Later when we were in bed cuddling I told him it was gross, but I felt like a big nasty wound that was very infected.  And when he punished me, it was like draining the wound.  Painful but necessary and much better afterwards.  He told me that was how it was supposed to feel, that I was doing just right.  And that eventually, after we worked out a lot of my fears and resentments and other poisons, I would still crave the punishments and still feel the release but for it's own sake.  I guess I probably will, as much as I am looking forward to the next one already."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"We exchanged so many emails back and forth after she noticed my blog.   Emails where she was in control, and emails where she was not.  The reaction to the ones where she was not opened a window that let me know her.  I revealed to her what I saw.  That in her a large part of her needed to submit.  She resisted at first.  But the first time we talked via messenger it was obvious.  Even she will confess as soon as she sees my icon indicating I am present her legs spread wide to display her shorn cunny even if fully clothed at work.  She embraces my commands with ferver of a convert, and fills my heart with joy doing so.  This will be an interesting journey."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"I spent the morning cutting and coiling out lengths of soft rope. 6 ft., 12.ft, taping the ends. I've given my drawer of personal knick knacks the boot and filled it with the tools and toys of this ""dark"" art that I'm looking to ply. I've equipped the bed with nylon strapping, rings, and fastening points. I've made a spreader bar, all for the pleasure of having Anna tied, stripped, and writhing for me. The thought alone is delightful. I spent the mid morning with Anna's dad. I acquired his services in repairing the massage table that I broke the weekend before. We talked and worked until now it is sure to hold her well for pleasures of massage, and pleasures of play. This afternoon I've secured what I'm going to serve for dinner. I'm about to prep for the scene that I have planned out the last few days. I'm excited. A little nervous after some miscommunication have been confronted, but the feeling is fueling my desires. I am confident of the scene. Anna knows a scene is coming and with luck the anticipation is working on her as I write. Time will soon tell."

9MOAJR2,female,34,"It's been a slow week on the surface, but minds have been racing. It's not what you call on subject but I do have a bit of a rant.   I was chatting with a friend of mine in California today when she told me of an incident where some brats yelled at her from a moving car, ""Hey, try Jenny Craig!"" I told her that this is why God invented the rocket launcher. Now she takes things in good stride, and she says that she only gets down on herself occasionally, but there are many many more that are not so fortunate. They take things like that to heart, and into relationships, and to bed. And that is where I begin to take it personally.  It's never been made really clear here but I don't mind putting it bluntly, if a woman weighs less than 200lbs, she probably isn't even going to catch my eye. Now before you go off with your comments and snickering e mails I have one thing to say; fuck you.  I not only have a brain in my head, I know how to use it enough to make up my mind about what I consider attractive and what I don't. I don't need Cosmo, or Hollywood, or joe lunchbucket standing next to me in line at the store to tell me this is attractive and that is not. Most of the clowns I know that complain about the weight of their wives just use that as an excuse to one, be lazy in their relationship and not bother to make an effort to keep it hot, and two they would rather lust after some other little number because she don't know what kind of limp dicked dead fuck they are.  Skinny chicks (IMHO of course) are by majority, unattractive. They are bony and weak and have the look of the starved, beaten dog you see in the street. They hide the truth from others and themselves with lingerie (that big girls don't need) and by using this mysterious social advantage they have to the hilt. That's it. They have no other assets. Breasts are inadequate to please, even if sufficiently sized if they are alone on a plain flat dull surface. It's like serving lobster on a paper plate. An ass that you can fully grasp with one hand is nothing to play with and enjoy. I could never spank a little girl. No pleasure in it. Nothing to look at. I could never have a skinny girl to hold. I'd always be afraid of breaking them in half. Even if they have decent tits, so what? Nothing to back them up with. You can't rest your head on them anywhere. You get poked with bones rubbing their back is a disgusting proposition who want to caress someone's spine? Someone might say sex is better with a little girl. How? Number of positions, or access maybe? Bullshit! When it comes down to it, pussy is pussy and the difference is in the PC muscle.  If you like skinny chicks, good for you, you can have them. You can have them all. But don't make fun of what you don't understand. You mindless, brainless drones are victims of someone thinking for you and I think your the idiots here not I."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"The scene went off, but not without it's hitches. Just as I got into the swing of my preparations, including dinner, the power went out and stayed out. I know that living here in the south I should be grateful that we have power, and indoor plumbing, at all. But the timing was aggravating. However I was undaunted. I simply made a call to a pizza parlor and made arrangements for a pickup. Anna and I took our meal to a local park. The weather was nice and I wanted to be good and sure I had lights when I returned. We talked and had a good time. After coming home we began to play, but my off timing that began with the brown out stayed with me. I made several on the fly decisions that gave our scene a rough edge to it. It just didn't feel like a well prepared set up. This is a disappointment to me that I can only blame on myself and fate. Anna was a trooper all the way through. Anna took far more enema water than she ever has before and held it for me a rewarding long time. I was extremely proud of her. Even in her suffering she had a playful attitude. In the scene, we agreed on a marking quality spanking for her, a bonus I did not count on. But again, fate and timing tried to play havoc. We have 2 hairbrushes, a short straight one, and a crooked handle, longer, lollipop type. I tried the latter this time, believing it would be the better of the two. Anna's new training and the trust she has in me shined through as she found a way to communicate that the other brush was better for her. Again, she pleased me in her acceptance and expression. As far as timing. All of you experienced spankers know that after the warm up, but before you really lay into your submissive to mark them, there is a point you can pause at and let the endorphins and excitement in the brain, catch up with the body. Pause at the right time, and for long enough, your Submissive will fly straight to the moon when you resume the spanking. I told Anna that was what I was doing the 1st time with the wrong brush, but I had to do it again after changing. I tried changing her position to finish the spanking and, again, she effectively and rightfully communicated her concerns with me. She humbly mentioned that I had not done what I said I was going to do in ""Busting her ass"" I told her she was right. (This was the perfect que I needed for I had planned top delay longer than she needed by a teasing before returning to her ass) And I took up the brush in the new position and began again. This time I finally hit the mark and she slipped deeply away into subspace. I got caught in another dilemma right away, and I have to confess I acted selfishly. She began to cry. The very special cry that she has when she has reached that point of magic inside herself. I wanted to keep spanking her, adjust the pace so that she would stay at that point just as long as she could stand it. I also wanted to see her beautiful face. In those watery eyes, and streaming tears there is a face that she never shows. I've never seen that look on her before just a couple of weeks ago, but that look is the one that melts my heart. It is the look of open honesty. Vulnerability. Without defense or defiance. Her soul is laid naked before me in those eyes and she needs me to cover her. I whisper to her to let it out, and she does. She cries and cries tears that have nothing to do with the data of the nerve endings in her bottom. She weeps what she weeps for in the awe of pure, unabashed freedom to express what no words can utter. It is a face I would long to look upon every day. If only her bottom could take it. So I act selfishly. I lean in and study her face. I can tell she is a little disappointed by her body language. But in the state she is in, it's a small point. I study that face, those eyes, her tears and the sounds she makes. They are sights and music that I try to keep an echo of in my head for as long as I possibly can. I don't delay too long. I want her to get all she can from this. I begin to spank her hard again. Again she moves to a peak of tearful expression, but she can't hold it. She soon says her safeword and I take her into my arms, as best I can with her hands lashed to the bed.  At this point I'm back to my original plan And guesswork on implementation. I planned to tie her to the bed and slowly tease her with various sensations to ecstasy. But this was before all the delays, and the pleasurable sidetrack of a harsh hairbrushing, it isn't to be. The night has become to long, and the sensations of her spanking have left her senses far too shorted to enjoy more subtle essences. I choose a couple of items. Headache cold presses that I put on her bottom, and a fur mit I rub her all over with. She gives only half toned signals of interest in sex. My guess now, looking back, is that is was a form of assurance she needed, if I was reading her right at all, and she did indeed want it. I put on a lubed up condom and took her from behind for a while. When I rolled her over I could see that it wasn't working. A gentler approach was what was called for. I made a mental note of this for next time. There was no way she could peak again after all she had done. She asked me to stop, which I was about to do anyway based on what I saw in her. She got a little upset. She knew I wanted her to have an orgasm, but it wasn't in her, even with the offer of her best toy. It was easy to see and understand. All the stimulation had simply blown her up. She muttered about my orgasm and I asked her how she felt. She told me that she felt loved and cared for. I told her that was all that mattered. I meant it to. Having her like this is a treasure far beyond a mere getting off. And as long as she felt as loved as she conveyed, her orgasm can be made up anytime. Getting off is one of the smallest elements of this game. Any fool can buck-thrust cum out of themselves, and usually do. But the privilege of pursuing the deepest reaches of one's emotions and soul, is a place few will take the bother, the study, the pain, and the willingness to put ego aside, and go to. These are the things I seek in Anna, and in myself. Mistakes in the scene? You bet. Several. But I have noted what I've seen. I have high hopes Anna will ""Monday morning quarterback"" with me, if I can assure her there are no personal feelings of self esteem invested in her critique. My esteem is driven by what I'm doing as a whole a Dom. And who I am becoming by doing it. I find that I myself have been hidden behind masks. Something I promised myself 8 years ago I wouldn't do. Ah well, grace is most kind to me that events have fallen the way they have. I am in love all over again with an incredible woman who is blooming like a plume of flame from a phoenix at night. And I don't feel so bad about myself as much either."
9MOAJR2,female,34,test post to show   how to use post summaries and   what a good programmer I am.
9MOAJR2,female,34,"Instead of trying to come up with different words to describe my reaction to the events discussed in Violated, I'm going to post part of an email I sent Dom the day after it happened. I told him I needed some time to process what happened and decide how I felt about it all. I didn't realize when I said it how that sounded to him. I didn't realize the anxiety my silence was causing. It's just my way. I rarely react to something right away. I have to process, think, let it settle into my mind and see where it goes. I know he thinks I  think  too much sometimes. And I do, sometimes. But it's just how I am.  Here's the email I sent him (with a little editing and his permission, btw)...    To Dom 7/28/04 Ok. I'll tell you what I've sorted out so far. A large chunk of it was me being embarassed. Humiliated is actually the better word. And so wrung out I couldn't move to take care of myself much less you and I couldn't stop you from caring for me. That in itself is hard for me to handle but when you consider what you were doing for me, well. It was difficult to say the least. I have never had to have someone clean me up like that since I was a very young child. Even when I had my surgeries and burned my hand I managed that by myself.  Anal sex is very emotionally charged for me for that reason and because it makes me feel so vulnerable and helpless. You know I've always been that way about it and that's a big part of why I didn't want to do it for so long. Just every once in a great while when the need would become overwhelming. I guess that was my submissiveness needing to be fed, even though I had it so completely surpressed, it still was a part of me and still expressed itself.  And to be honest, it was rough and a little painful. I felt used and discarded. Like a sex toy or an object. It didn't really feel like rape and I didn't think that word until you said what you did about coming so hard from raping my ass. I think that may have pushed me into subspace.  When you finished and moved so quickly to clean up I got deeply embarassed. I revere your cock. Because it is part of you and you are my Dom, my Master. I want to worship it, not shit on it. And because you got up so fast I figured it was a real mess and you couldn't wait to get clean. That pushed me further into my headspace.  Then my damned old brain kicked in and I started thinking about what had happened and I'm sure that made me seem distant. If I felt raped. I don't know if there is truly a difference other than in just semantics, but I felt used and a little violated and discarded. But not raped. Even though yes, it did hurt a little and I know that even without intent you could hurt me much more back there than you could during normal sex (not that you couldn't hurt me that way too, but it would be different). I wasn't really afraid of being hurt.  And I started thinking about how I felt about being used like that. My first thought was NO! I don't like it at all. But then I turned off my higher brain and listened to my feelings. And catalogued my body and how it had reacted. I felt more like your possession than I have ever felt. Ever. And I noticed that the dull little ache in my lower belly was still there. Stronger in fact. My cunt was throbbing again.  The little snippet of a fantasy came about a few minutes later. When I guided your hand to see how wet I still was. Or again. If I had truly felt raped or violated in a bad way I would not have done that. I certainly wouldn't have shared my desire and asked you to act it out. Do you really think I could have let you spank me that hard if I felt you had done me wrongly? I might have not stopped the scene if I was afraid of you (which is NOT the case, I'm just saying that is a much more likely possibility) but I would never have submitted myself to more pain from you.  I don't think this is something I could handle on a very regular basis. I still struggle with giving up control and this is the ultimate in losing control. I still have a hard time thinking of myself as yours, your possession to use. Last night stretched my limits, a lot. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But after Monday night it was a bit overwhelming.  Frankly, I don't think I could have handled it, maybe not at all but certainly not as well as I have, if I hadn't had Monday night. I know I haven't said a lot about it but it was pretty amazing. I didn't think I could take that much, not yet. And I'm kind of proud of myself. The buttplug helped, I think, but I was in subspace most of the time and when I asked you to stop I genuinely felt the words I said. They sounded silly when you told me to use them but I felt like you were my master and I wanted to beg for your mercy when I did it. So thank you. It made me feel very submissive and very much yours. That made what happened Tuesday night easier to handle.      Now, as to the other part of the post. The name called out. *sigh* If I dreamed, I don't recall it. Which is too bad, really. Yes, the crush does feed some need in me. Deep inside, I'm a very needy little girl, always looking for male approval. As an adult, this approval comes in the form of attraction, sexual interest, flirting. Sometimes it's as simple as an admiring second glance.  When it was pointed out to me that a certain person had more than an occasional second glance for me, it turned my head. It made me look at him with new eyes. It made me feel good, feel feminine and attractive. At a time when things were troubled at home. And even now, since we are working on our relationship, it still gives me good feelings. Ones that I'm not ready to give up, selfish as that is.  I'm still unsure of myself in my new role and our relationship isn't completely patched up yet. So I cling to the ""crush"" and the feelings he inspires. I don't fantasize about him much anymore. My physical hunger for him has abated somewhat. More because of the intrusion of reality than anything else. He hasn't done anything untoward, made no passes, not told any leading, off-color jokes that could lead to a provocative discussion or encouraged me in any blatant way.  But his reaction to Dom's appearance at work one day was rather telling. Indicating the presence of some kind of inappropriate feelings or at least thoughts. You don't act as guilty as he did without reason. In fact, his reaction made Dom wonder if we had actually  had  something physical. Of course we haven't. I suspect it would take a very direct move on my part for that to happen. And even then, well, I don't totally believe he would take me up on it. He has a lot to lose if we got caught or things went badly between us. More than I do.  Maybe that's why he keeps things as they are. Maybe it's because he doesn't want me, he just feels affection for me. Maybe he does want me but is too much of a gentleman to ask me to risk my marriage. Maybe he doesn't want to risk his own. I suspect I'll never know the truth. But that's ok too. For now, his attention is enough to fulfill that need in me. Maybe someday, when I'm more self assured, more confident in my submission or just able to love myself, maybe then I won't need his attention and his implied approval it brings. Maybe."

I don't do that to people out of respect and it is none of my buisness, what the hell happened to etiquette?? Ack, maybe I am being overly defensive, but geez... really.  On another note, I was at curves tonight and realized that the 20-40 sit-ups I have added to my daily work out is really hurting me on that ab machine. Which is good.. but loardy is it painful... kinda makes me wish I was happy being chunky. You ever meet a truly happy chunky person?? I haven't... we need to change the way the world thinks : fat is healthy!! Less stress, no upkeep!! And best of all, take out when ever you want! I mean you're going to die anyways, go out with a full belly of meat and deep fried crap in cheese!! Yep, a whole new outlook... I can see the glow...  Hmm, maybe I will just completely shock the system and do something different today. Not like Brazilian wax different *ouch*, but like make a page in Kira's scrap book different. Something I haven't done in awhile but costs zero dollars. Yes... maybe. I am trying to save a bit of cash for when we go to Montreal this september, about 500 bucks ought to cover it. We will after all only be there a week, and Its not like we are paying for accomodations. So basically it is just for spending money. We spent about 600 bucks in Mexico, and it was a fortune to do everything, and we went on three excursions.. so ya, 500 is a good number I hope. Last time I went to Montreal I spent a lot more money then planned... but I was 13 and had 150 bucks from babysitting, lol!!  SO now I have 17 days left of freedom and Kira-filled days until I have to go back to work. *ugh*. SO looking forward to that...!! I am trying to keep in mind that working makes money, money can be saved in a bank account, the bank likes to see money saved in your account, the bank gives you a mortgage, and then you get to buy a nice house with a pantry two bathrooms and a fan over the stove!! *Grin*... so this is why I am going back to work. All selfish-ish reasons I suppose, but I have to make my life work as well as Kira's, right? Right. Plus she will have the added bonus of not living in a trailer park like I did my entire childhood... not that it is a bad way to go, or that i don't appreciate the trouble my mother had to go through just to keep us in that park, just the idea of living in an actual house to me is more appealing. Most likely because even though I lived in the trailer and was comfortable living there, I was constantly reminded that It was a lower class place to live... which sucks because I shouldn't care what people think, and now I don't really, but I did then, and that formed my opinions of today... you get all that?? HAHAHAHA...Still, I have a daycare lined up for Kira, and hopefully she will be okay there. I am so afraid that they are going to break her.. she is so good. She hardly ever screams or throws tantrums, she babbles ALL the time, she smiles ALL the time, she laughs ALL the time. I would really hate to see the joi de vive sucked right out of her. I will watch for signs of unhappiness, and if she starts to weave into the anger side or what not I will pull her out and decide what to do next. Suppose that is all i can do for now.   On a plus side it is only 2 months away until we go to Montreal, and I am super excited about that trip. I know you have all heard it before... but It will be so cool to go into a provence Mark has never been too. I wish we had longer so we could go do all sorts of stuff... like take a tour of the churches there. I loved that when I was 13... which I know you must be laughing because you are thinkin ""Mich? Church? you got the right girl there??"", and normally you would be right If I were to attend Mass or anything. BUT we were just looking at the art, and architecture and all the neat furnishings and strange little antiquities. There was this one church, I can't remember the name of It now... but it had a saint that was like mummified or something preserved in a glass air tight casket at the front of the church on where the alter is. Freaky.. I loved It!! She was so stoic (of course) and just looked so peaceful... It was odd for me to see a dead person and not feel all the emotions that are usually involved with death.. no grief or that pain in your heart.. just an odd curiosity of the individual, and If she were In fact real. I tell ya, I learned a lot about how hard it is to be a saint.. and why I would never fall into that category! There was also a really cool sailors church that had all this nautical stuff all over the walls.. actually it looked like something one of the designers from trading spaces looked at and then subjected it on a home owner.... but the one really cool thing was it had all these casts and crutches and stuff all over the place.. and I didn't know what that was all about and my step gramma told me that they are from sailors who were considered lost at sea and returned to their families with what ever injuries the inccured.. and the casts, etc. are there for reminder that the ones lost can still be found.. like a ray of hope. I just thought that was a really nice idea and made me sniffle a bit because It was so bitter sweet.      Dessert    Mommy found a piece of gyp-rock in the basement to enclose the computer!!

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind    Going for my drivers course (16 hours of learning wtf a break pedal Is…) this weekend. Fun, fun.    Crap of the day    I know I have been posting In the afternoon, but I wrote this last night knowing I wouldn’t be able to post today. Basically I will be picked up by my father-In-law from Curves ® , pick up Kira from daycare then going to Glendon for the weekend. I am really excited about the driving course (because I will be one step closer to my license) but I am also really apprehensive about spending the entire weekend with my In-laws and no husband. Not that I don’t get along with them, It’s just weird. I have a tendency to say the way wrong thing at the exact wrong time… so I am just worried about making an ass of myself and hurting someone’s feelings. Mark helps me around people…lol, anyone IN real life can attest to me being a loud mouth schnook, So you can see why not having my “coach” around could be potentially dangerous.  Although my week has been really busy, I have no excuse for a few things that I should have mentioned. Not only In this journal, but In general. One thing being my baby girl turned 11 months old on Wednesday and I forgot. I know It Isn’t like a seriously monumental thing and I will be forgiven In the grand scheme of things… but I like to take a picture of her on the fourth of every month and just document the changes In her. Like her hair Is longer and curlier. Her smile now has six very visible teeth In It. She has balance now, and can walk albeit a cautious walk. She has acquired this laugh that just sounds so funny, like a tummy filled he-he-he. And I usually send out a bulk e-mail to friends and family of her monthly progress and the things she Is still working on. Did I do any of this?? No.  So now I feel guilty. I could have taken the picture today and just said It was from yesterday… but I just can’t. This may be one of the stupidest things I will have ever said, but I refuse to lie about anything concerning my daughter. I don’t care what It Is. I want every word that comes out of my mouth to be truth when It comes to her. I find that I by one way or another had to lie (or just not fill In the Info of the truth) to people In a lot of times In my life. Not that I am looking back on things In regret (those I felt bad about I have already dealt with acknowledged and apologized for), just that I know what this world expects and demands of us at times, and I just don’t ever want to be caught In any nature of lie regarding her. The only reason why I think this sounds so stupid Is because this statement comes off like I am a perpetual liar, and that Isn’t It at all, It’s just that I know people sometimes tell little white lies that do absolutely no harm to anyone, but It still an untruth, and I just don’t want that air around my daughter. Do you get that at all? I probably made that all come out wrong, I suck at telling my thoughts. At any rate, I feel guilty for that, but I am sure that once I e-mail my weekly statement to everyone I might feel a little more alleviated of that guilt.  Another thing I feel I have overlooked Is Mark helping out. He has been juggling his schedule as best he can to make sure Kira and I have been taken where we need to go. He has been extremely helpful around the house, and even though he Is just as or more tired than I, he has never snapped at either Kira or I. Total gold stars for that man. I just know I bitch about him frequently (lol) so I figured overlooking this part would just be shity of me.  I suppose In this week I have regained a part of me I had forgotten about as well. I have reclaimed my sense of accomplishment, not that I don’t think being a mother accomplishes anything. I just mean that I have defiantly achieved the goal of being a good mom (well I think I am doing a good job, Kira can tell you how awful I am In about thirteen years), and have figured out how to make my home and make It all work together. So this Is a new challenge and I think I am starting to figure out where It all fits In the wheel of time. Of course I am being highly optimistic and trying my best to make good of this situation I am In, so I might be seeing things through rose colored glasses. But I find that I am stronger then I thought I was, more reliable than I thought I was, and I am totally capable of being a mom and a totally separate person from a mom. I can be an adult, with adult conversations, and adult responsibilities, and adult problems. I can be tired and cranky and sad and happy. I can feel, and have my feelings hurt. I can just be me, and not feel guilty about that.  Well, as I have sucked up about five minutes of your time, I will end this little blather and come back Sunday or Monday with what will most likely be a completely different view than the one voiced above… because you know, I like to do that.     The Silver Lining    Today the silver lining will be my alarm clock being shut off at 5:15 am and not being reset until Monday morning. Have a good weekend guys!    Something Amusing To Me    This Isn’t a quote or a factoid or anything, this was just a general observance from Tim Horton’s. So I guess It Is a real life amusement to me.

Something Amusing To Me     Fun little fact for the day...The animal responsible for the most human deaths worldwide is the mosquito.  I can totally see this, fricking things flock and feed like mad... and they are really disease infested. Like I said in a previous post ERADICATE THE MOSQUITO!!     Crap of the day     Well yesterday had a bit of a scare. It was really stormy outside and guess what I saw in the sky? Can anyone say funnel clouds?? How about hail and lightning?? Ya.. So I tore my beautifully sleepy baby from her slumber and hauled ass downstairs to the empty basement room to hide under the fluffiest quilt I could find. Kira was really impressed *not*, and I was freaking out on the phone with Mark... who was driving on the highway watching the swirlly clouds over head. No tornados though *whew*. I hate this weather, freaks me right out. Worse off, there are a bunch of pine branches all ove rthe yard and house now from the winds blowing them off our neighbors trees. So now I have to go pick up all the sticks of allergins and hope I don't break out in hives. Joy.   We are still planning on going into Edmonton on Thursday for Klondike Days, but now we have wrangled us a whole day of festivities. We are going to go and see my brothers fancy shmancy house in Sherwood Park!! I am so excited, I get to see where the upper crust live *snort*. Just kidding Jay, I am excited though, I like to see houses even If I know I will be totally and completely jealous beyond reason!! :p Looking forward to wasting all my money on the carnie scams too.. didn't get quite ripped off enough at Colonial Days for my liking!! I always spend a little bit of cash in the pavilion that is dedicated to some country. I bought this awesome purse there two years ago.. I think it was the Philippines... at any rate, it only cost me 15 bucks and it holds EVERYTHING!! I love it.

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind    I think I need new glasses. Not that mine suck, I just need a new look on my face. You know??    Crap of the day    I am tired. I don’t remember ever being this tired. I am just trying to stay awake and think good happy awake thoughts. I was up now for two nights way more than I should. The first night (Sunday night), we were just getting back Into town around 9:30pm, so I had some stuff to do and unpack our things, etc. I didn’t get to bed until 11-11:30ish. Then I was woken up at 4:30am from Kira hacking up a lung!! I know I have been to the doctors a few times now about her cough, and they say she Is fine… but this Is bad, and way worse then before. I would be bitching about doctors right about now, but this came from two doctors I respect… so I will listen even If I have doubts. At any rate, I was up early which wasn’t terrible seeing as though I would have been up by five anyways. That half hour sure makes a helluva difference though, especially when It means the difference between 5.5 hours of sleep, or 6.5 cuz you hit the snooze button…lol.  After all that I was TIRED yesterday. So we came home from work/daycare and basically lounged around for a bit. I hear a ringing of a doorbell, and I honestly didn’t register that It may be MY door!! We don’t get visitors unannounced, and we have like zero friends out this way. To my surprise It was Chris!! He was driving back from New York (his sister got a teaching job there and moved from little Yellowknife to the Bronx!!). He stopped IN for about an hour and a half, then off he went to Edmonton for some Taco Bell (bastard!).  After that, we just had supper, gave Kira a bath, and both of us crashed on the couch. Mark came home at 9-9:30 and took Kira up to bed and attempted the process of waking a hibernating bear. It worked eventually, but I was so tired that I could have just fallen asleep on the couch the whole night. Well, until around 11-ish, which Is where Iwill go next.  Kira was up at 11, and 11:45, and 12:15, and 1, and so on and so forth until 5:15am (when my alarm Is suppose to go off) with a fever that would not break. It finally broke around 6:30am, but I can’t just say ‘Okay, time for daycare and work now that you have no fever”. She Is still sleeping, and I have just woke up. I will most likely stay home just until Mark gets off of work today (he only has to do some shmoozing with a client), then go In to work for half of my shift. I don’t want to… but I should. We will see how that plan goes!!  Kira Is fine now (don’t know If you got that up there) and she Isn’t hotter than the sun, so I don’t need to worry to much. I was going to make a doctors appointment If she was still sick today, but I think she might be okay. Suppose It Is normal for kids to be sick within their first few weeks of daycare… just getting used to all the other germs and whatnot. Still, Kira never gets sick like that, so I was worried.  The really sucky part of today?? Although Kira may be fine… my house Isn’t. So I have to use this time to my advantage here. On come the karmic pay back for the lovely weekend of no dishes…lol!!!  Mark Is about to get his days off here. His trainee Is taking over as a full fledged swing driver and Mark will have this Sunday Monday off, yippy!! Now the thing about this, Is trying to get his mind away from work for that time frame. Not as easy as one may think. He Is a constant worry-wart and just loves having total control over his route. So now he Is getting all ancy and It Isn’t even his day off yet!! He will also be training another guy In about three weeks. Mark didn’t think that he would be training again so soon, but hey It’s another 300 bucks In our pocket when he does It, so bring ‘em on!!  Not to be gross or anything, but I have this bump on my leg that hurts like hell. I think It might be a spider bite or an ingrown hair… not sure. All I know Is that for one little pore, It sure makes my whole leg throb. I hate It when that happens… something so small just hurts like heck and then you like gash yourself and It barely hurts at all. Seems so wrong. But It happens to me (the little things that Is) all the time.  It's tuesday so I have a few shows to watch tonight (yay!!). I of course will be watching Big Brother... wouldn't It be so funny If they changed the veto power so that If no one wins In no one gets It??hahaha.. well Marvin would be gone, but It would still be funny that Jace stayed because of them again!! I will also be watcing Sex In The City ( I really love that show now) and Outback Jack. I think It Is the finally tonight. I think this show Is just hillarious, and have found It pure entertainment... and Mark likes It too, so It stays on. But like I said, I think It's the end, and If he picks Marrisa (which I am sure he will) I will be disgusted. What a ho bitch that Marissa!! Ah well, not my life!!  Well I should get cracking on my house while Kira Is still sleeping, and maybe I should feed the poor dog. You know you are a bad pet owner when you look back on the day before and think “I feed the dog right??”. Ya, my dog Is loving me right about now Im’t sure.    The Silver Lining    Kiras fever broke, and I get to play hooky this morning heh heh.    Something Amusing To Me    Did you know that 90% of new drivers get Into an accident within the first year of obtaining their license?? So If you weren’t scared of me before..lol!!!"
V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind     Wondering If Mark is still awake... He's operating a very large motor vehicle with lest then 5 hours sleep..Ouch.     Something Amusing To Me     Fun Fact of the Day: Lemons contain more sugar than strawberries do.   I just thought this was of particular interest to me.. Because almost all of Kira's food has lemon juice in it to keep the color from turning, and I thought the sugar count would be lower then the foods that contained fruit. This explains a lot!!     Crap of the day     YAY! I got a call back from this lady I knew in Bonnyville, I had remembered that her husband used to offer drivers training, and he still does and has a course offered for August 7th and 8th!! I am so thrilled!! I will have to do the 10 hours of drive time after the course.. But hey, no problems right??lol.. At least that worked out alright, I was beginning to think it was completely hopeless!! After the course I will sign up for my drivers test and hopefully from there I will be driving!! YAY!!! Plus It was the CHEAPEST one too!! It was only 400 bucks instead of 495, or 550!!! *whew*, one crisis averted for today!!   Well we ended up not going to Klondike Days yesterday. We did still go to Edmonton, we just went out for dinner (to the outback *yummy yum yum*!!) with my brother and his wife, then went and saw their house. It is gorgeous!!! I am so jealous!! Two and a half bathrooms!!! I would love, love, love to have my own bathroom.. Free of the nasties men procured!!! Their house was really easy to find too, which was a total shocker to me.. Everything in Sherwood Park is hard to find! They have all these weird districts, the flowers, the Glens, the trees, all these little areas that If you aren't from there you would get totally lost and confused. But actually It was much more simple then I had anticipated.. Though I kept my brother on the phone just in case!   We also went to see Rob, in a word: he is TANNED. My goodness, at lest that's one thing his landscaping job is doing for him.. Free tanning services! He moved to the corner condo in his building (like right next door actually!!) and it's awesome! He has two balconies off the living room now, so he gets a nice cool breeze all day! That is SO much better than his old place, because you would literally melt and be so stuffed up from the sweltering heat that was just trapped in his living room. It's so strange though, everything is backwards and to the side of where it all was.. So it's like you have to fight all your instincts to get to the right room!! I figure the first few times he got home a little staggered he must have had a great time with that!! He's doing good though, still nineteen..lol... He's just our all-purpose Rob still, so we love him!   The drive out lastnight was a little freaky, lots of gead ground hogs everywhere, so every fox and large hawk were on the road trying to get their hands on the free food. I don't remember foxes looking so scraggly.. I thought they were all cute and fuzzy. Mark reminded me that we are not north anymore, and the picture in my head remains the same from the plush fox tail on my parka..lol. I couldn't help but laugh.. He is probably right. OH, and IF you happen to be an animal rights activist, don't bother to bitch at me, the rest of that fox was most likely eaten by a tribe of Inuits and the furs traded, so DON""T BOTHER, because I like the fur! *ahem*, anyways, there was a lot of wildlife out last night so we were extra careful on the way home. We also realized that we are getting to ""old"" for this jaunt into the city for dinner thing. It is just to inconvenient for us to pack up Kira even though she is really good in the car, we can't just expect her to sit for dinner when she wants to be walking and crawling around since she just sat for two whole hours!! So that routine is getting old, and we most likely won't be doing it again. We will reserve trips to the city for a day trip rather than a limited amount of time. Other then that... Well nothing of interest happened... So I guess that's It!     The Silver Lining     We went to the Outback and had those awesome shrimp on the barbie...ummmmm... succulant shrimpies!!!!

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind     I made muffins from this instant just add water mix, and I am trying to figure out why they are so darn small!! They look like little buttons where muffins should be!!     Something Amusing To Me     Ice is a food and like any food, it can go ""bad."" Every food code in the U.S. and Canada defines ice as food. We eat more ice than we do bread, nearly a hundred million tons a year or about two pounds per person per day.   Oh, believe you me, this is totally true! I have had ice in the freezer, and had it come out tasting like … well… freezer!! Especially awful when you want to make a daiquiri!!     Crap of the day     Okay, I am going to let you In on a little secret. I actually type my posts a little bit at a time. I usually start off in the morning posting a complete post, and then taking my crafty “Blog Template” that I made In MS Office “©” and start a new one. From there I usually get the word of the day and the amusing sections done. Then I do what ever I do In the day, and when ever something strikes me as something to squawk about, I type It down. I know, It’s sorta like cheating… but I have no time to just sit and type all this stuff all In one shot!! Anyways, so you know, most of my posts end up speaking about the previous daily events because of this. Just FYI.   Kira got up at 6 am today (yesterday, bwwaahhhaaa) and was really pissy. I think she realized that we have now tampered with her sleeping until 9 am, and she Is just plain mad. I was too when I was little and my mommy used to kick my but out of bed, then realize I was actually awake long before then anyways.  I digress, so Kira wakes up and Is screeching her lungs out, a first time thing for all of us to experience. You know what Mark does? He nudges me on the shoulder and says “ you gonna get that?”!!!! I almost died. Of course I was going to go see to her, but STILL. So I went and got her out of her crib, brought her to bed (which I never do), and plunked her down by her father. He looked at me all horrified, and I just calmly said “Good morning hun, I am going to go make her a bottle and go pee, your turn!” Well, that was one of the funniest moments in my life!! He realized that he was being an ass and apologized to me after I got out of the bathroom. He also changed her diaper and calmed her down, so It’s all good… but I sure had a laugh at his expense this morning!   The dog Is really beginning to just Irritate the living shit out of me. Seriously. That dog has to like, go get a job or something!! She Is normally really good around Kira, and around the rules of the house with begging and where to be during diner and all that jazz. But lately she has taken It upon herself to REVISE the rules to her liking. I can tell you she is this close to death. She doesn’t do this to me (because she knows I would kill her), but she waits for Mark to come home and eat diner and BEGS. She sits there, all pathetic In full out begging mode. Mark could care less, he Is so hungry by the time he gets home, but me on the other hand. I get so mad at her, and yell at her to get the “hell down the hallway now or you will be my next pair of mukluks!!” I think she might turn Into a fashion don’t, she had better be careful.   Well Mark did me a huge favor last night, he installed MS Office on my computer (yay!), but In doing so It made my Sims just vanish off my desktop. I haven’t the slightest Idea why that happened, all I know Is I have to start from scratch now.. and I think I am happy about this! At first I was REALLY pissed off, and 10 kinds of nasty… but I re-installed It and It Is so fresh! So new!  I started playing It again today and ENJOYED It!! I haven’t had this basic a game In months, so I am happy now. Well, happy as one can get..lol.   I wanted the office program so that I can keep count of how many words I type, but I must have It all set up wrong or something. I just have this bar that tells me how many words are In each paragraph. So I am going to have to fix that. It also adds spaces, and I don’t think you should get credit for pressing the space bar, unless you are habitually running words together, In that case you deserve a fucking metal!! You know what I could REALLY do without? That damn paper clip. That thing Is really getting on my nerves. Really really.  I do like the instant spell checker thingy and the grammar thingy.  That helps me lots, because… you know, I have no writing skills at all and still managed to graduate from high school and go to college. * grins *  Oh wait.. I just figured It all out!! It’s a separate thing you have to look for .. eish, like talk about work!!!     The Silver Lining     I am happy with my Sim’s game… and I am making spaghetti for supper.  That’s about all I got today.

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind    I want to know why my hand hurts. I have this searing pain running up between my index and middle finger on my left hand. I don’t do anything strenuous (not with my hands) and I don’t remember hurting It…  Maybe It Is just on strike from having to pour coffee Instead of typing!! Evil brain telling hand to serve…noooo…    Crap of the day    I was a little bored from Kira being sick and sleepy… so I started looking at the real estate around here. There are a few deals that Mark and I are going to look Into. I really really really want my own house. I know I have stressed this point enough, but I would just like to be IN a place that was 100% mine. Well of course It would be Marks too… but lets face It, not like the guy will come shopping for throw pillows.  Looking at a few other options too, like moving Into the city, which I don’t know If that will happen or not. So Mark Is going to have a chat with is boss, see what his options are, and go from there. But looking at real estate can’t hurt right?? lol…  Like I said, Kira was sick and sleepy, so I was really bored. I couldn’t clean (to loud) I couldn’t watch TV (nothing on anyways) I couldn’t read (my eyes are too sore), so I basically surfed the web and flipped through magazines until she woke up. Fun fun.  I also did something I know I should never do, I watched Oprah. I should always just pass It by, but NNOOO, had to sit there and watch these poor women tell their stories of terror as their ex-husbands shot their children and now just want to die. I always get upset and cry and hold Kira till she fusses and squiggles her way free of the crazy lady sitting where her mom used to be. So now there Is this combination of Insane parent and bored parent trying to figure out what to do with her child. I am pretty sure only booze at this point could make matters worse for poor Kira. Do you know what I hate to do more than anything else In this world?? Wait. I have to wait all the time, and I realize that just life blah blah blah… but I’m seriously not liking It. So you are asking yourself ‘why does she care all of a sudden If she has to wait for anything?’… well I’ll tell ya: there Is a parcel In the mail. Mark went to go and pick It up. It’s a box that Is full of books I have wanted to read, and Dave finally sent them to me. And so now I have to wait and wait AND WAIT until Mark feels he has tortured me enough, comes home, and lets me crack new spines In glee. I have no patients, and I am not very virtuous, so I go a little nuts waiting for things. I get overly excited and anxious and then tired from expending so much energy moving around like a crazed lunatic, scrubbing counters and bugging the shit out of the dog. Just a mental note, I don’t know why I always say “crazed lunatic”, one would think that a lunatic was crazed so there for Is a redundant statement… I need help.  Mark and I got to have lunch together for the first time In … well.. I honestly don’t remember when the last time we had lunch was. We has BLT’s which were very yummy, and I think I will cook something for super too since I have all this free time that normally gets soaked up by work *ugh*. Maybe chicken fajita’s. I make these deadly fajita’s, with red, yellow and green peppers, chicken (duh) and sweet onion. Tossed In my secret fajita sauce (old el paso packet hehe) and wrapped with cheddar cheese and salsa In a warm tortilla… *drool*… ya, we be havin’ those for dinner!! Of course I could take a picture of these and make you drool too.. but I am mean, and If you want to know what the taste like or look like, well you are more than welcome to come for dinner. HA.  There Is a god damn fly buzzing around here and just generally annoying the crap out of me. That stupid thing had either a) DIE or b) get out of my house! I am buying a fly swatter today, and I will remember to squash It like.. well like a bug. The bugs now seem like they are IN hoards and swarm over me all the time. I remember thinking that the bugs were never that bad unless you went to Long Lake (then the horse flies would eat you alive) or camping IN the bush (those are some seriously nasty bugs). Now It just seems like they are there ALL THE TIME…. I hate summer.  I have done nothing with my diet/exercise lately. I suck. I still go to Curves ® but I missed a day last week from being so sore, and this week I am determined to go the three times. But I have been eating terribly and thus far have gained back 7 pounds. I know, don’t get down, just pick back up and start a fresh. I was doing so well though, then I got all stressed out from the work, daycare, driving things and all of a sudden I am back Into the same old routine eating that got me to this weight In the first place. And I saw It coming, and didn’t do a damn thing to prevent It. But on another note, I like Tim Horton’s cake donuts since they started baking them *grin*. Yep, I suck. Oh well, I will try again here soon… notice the hesitation and no definitive planning.. lol.    The Silver Lining    Well, Jace Is on the block and Marissa got the shaft. At least reality TV Is going my way...!!    Something Amusing To Me    ""Life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent."" ~RD Laing.  Just plain true.

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind     My weather pixie isn't working properly. I am not sure If It Is a problem related to their site or this blogger site. As It stands, Brian had a good deal of trouble getting In to read my page yesterday, and today I had the same problems. But I think It Is the actual Pixie page, seems to be wonky.   I am also thinking of another revision for my page. I am not sure what this will entail, but I think It will work out for the better. I am considering ditching the word of the day (I like It, but I get It In my e-mail so I don't know If you all like It), and maybe the amusing section. I mean If I find something amusing I might add It later, but I don't know, I sorta think Its neat. We'll see what happens.      Something Amusing To Me     Factoid:  The color combination with the strongest visual impact is black on yellow. Next to follow black on white, yellow on black, white on black, dark blue on white, and white on dark blue.   Hmmm, well my Header Is white on dark blue, and my main text Is white on darker blue, and I find It easier to read and more pleasant than my previous page Of purple on black. But who knows, this could all just depend on the reader right?? Then again, I always see a bumblebee and hardly ever see mosquito's coming.     Crap of the day     Only four more days of freedom left. This sucks so bad I have no words. I am hoping for a long shot here and maybe a winning lottery number. * Sigh * I suppose It will all be okay In the end. Right now our main concern Is all the driving and scheduling to make sure Kira and I are able to get home. Mark works ungodly hours (have I mentioned that?? lol) and I have no license yet, so we have to try and make a game plan to go by. As It stands we are okay In the morning leaving at 6:30 to drop Kira off at daycare, get me to work by 7 and he goes to work after me. BUT coming home Is a bit tough. I think next week might be a okay because I will go to curves after work all four days, but usually I only go three times a week, and that Is all you are suppose to go, but I missed once this week.  But after that, I don't know If It will all be good. Mark figures he will end up doing his bin work and paperwork after twoish because that is usually when he gets done his calls in town. Then he will have to do other work until I get off of work to get Kira and drive us home. This Is just such a drag, I actually can't wait to have my own license now.   I don't know If you all know about my Better Business Bureau claim, but I just got a letter In the mail about It and apparently for them to get my money back and file a complete claim, they have to be able to contact the business I am complaining about. Obviously, right? Well the damn business doesn't have a legitimate fucking address or phone number!!! I am so pissed off, now I have to try and track all this shit down and I am having a lot of problems with It. SOOO, in the efforts that maybe you guys can help this Is all the Info: The company name is Clerical Gear (clericalgear.com DON'T go there, just telling you), the owners of the business are Judy & Troy Ellis and as far as I know they had there businesses set up In Boston, and Newtown PA. This Is all I have. I have tried getting the address and whatnot from them, but like they are going to give It to me so I can file a complaint about them. Anyways, just to reiterate, everything on-line work related Is a total, utter, complete SCAM and no one at any time should EVER give them any amount of time or money!! * ahem * that being said, happy surfing.   I have a huge mess In the kitchen to clean today. I made muffins and cookies and two dinners, and haven't cleaned up at all!! I know, that is so bad, but hey, I just wanted to eat not clean!! Mark was a good boy today and did most of the dishes and loaded the dishwasher, so all I have left Is the cookie sheets, pre-soaked muffin tin and a bowl, plus just wiping counters and sweep/mop the floor. So actually It Isn't a HUGE mess anymore, but a mess that I am avoiding anyways. I also should at some point get up stairs and sweep/mop the floors up there. We have laminate up there and I  always forget to quickly bring up the mop and do a quick swipe. So the upstairs doesn't get much love from the mop, which Isn't to bad because It Is laminate and shouldn't be wet, and we only go up to sleep so It's not In a high traffic area. Still though, need to remember It.   Talking with  urlLink Kaye  on messenger today she pointed out that I capitalize all my ""I's"" . I had no Idea that I did this, so I looked back at all my posts, and sure enough I do!! It's like a sickness! You don't have to capitalize them all, I just do. Somewhere I must have picked up this notion that you HAD to, and so I just got Into the habit of doing It.  But now I am OVERLY conscience of this, and capitalizing even though I know I don't have to, and I am going crazy!! So, I have decided that I just don't care, and I like my capital ""I's"". SO there!! TTHHHPPPTTT!!!   Mark and I were talking about projects that still need to be done to fix up this house, and we were talking about not painting until the winter and instead putting up a new fence. The one we have now was make shifted from materials from our old deck, so It Is an eye sore. Plus we hate our neighbors and their fucking dandelion infested lawn, so It would be nice to have a big tall fence to separate. I agree with all this totally, but given that there Is only what, four more weeks of summer (well not really but you get It) we don't have that much time. Plus with the new daycare expense we are set back just a tad for the initial down payment (first and last months fees) . We aren't broke, but I don't think we have the cash for a fence, It's a little expensive and we still need gas for the truck and food for our bellies. I haven't a clue, we will do what ever.   Evil MS Office.. It has slyly changed the annoying paperclip to a cute little doggy, I'm on to you Gates...!!!!     The Silver Lining     I know this might sound so 50's, but I made cookies and they turned out perfect! The nice consistency of chips to batter and smooshy center to crunchy bottoms!! Oh, I made chocolate chip cookies after the disastrous peanut butter cookie fiasco (which I haven't mentioned, I just burnt half the mix is all).     Word of the Day       ensorcell or ensorcel   \en-SOR-suhl\, transitive verb:    To enchant; to bewitch.    All of a sudden Mark was clucking like a chicken!

She Is SOOO annoying! If I were any of the house guests I would have evicted her a LLOOONNGGG time ago!!!!    IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED NIP/TUCK, DO NOT READ THIS!! SPOILER!!    Could that kid Matt look anymore like Michael Jackson??  Seriously sickening, he has the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the fake white look (hehe)  everything but the eyebrows, I have no Idea which parent contributed to those bushy bad boys, but thank the gods because that Is probably the only thing they can Identify with!! Ugly guy that one, and what the hell is with Christians hair? Way to short and not playful at all. He Is still totally hot though * wink * . Can you believe this turn around though?? The whole thing with that chick who plays Jean Grey on X-men Is just sicko. And the whole sperm donation from Christian to Liz, WOW, talk about your monumental disasters!!"
V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind     Just wondering what I should be doing today, I cleaned up so well yesterday I have bleach marks on my hands... That can't be good...     Something Amusing To Me     The ""you are here arrow"" on a map is called the IDEO locator.  I always wondered If that thing had a specified name..lol.     Crap of the day     It was HOT here yesterday. Too hot, I hate summer, have I mentioned that before?? I know some people think I am completely nuts, but I love Fall. I love that In Alberta. There are four distinct seasons, and Fall is perfect. It Is pretty and cool and wistful... Great weather for a light sweater or pull over. That to me is perfect weather, nice enough that you don't need a coat, cool enough that your skin won't scorch under the sun. I can't wait for Fall. Banish all those tanned people back to the white and pasty bwwaahhhaaaa!!!   We were also on tornado watch yesterday *joy*. It was totally not breezy at all until about ten o'clock last night, then It was like a huge storm was passing thru. SO of course we check out  urlLink weather Canada stats , and sure enough we get this warning:    Severe thunderstorm warning    A severe storm has developed, producing one or more of the following conditions: heavy rain, damaging winds, hail of at least 20 mm in diameter or intense lightning. Severe thunderstorms may also produce tornadoes. The storms expected motion and developments will be given in the warning. If you are in the area specified, take shelter indoors.

Ken was mowing the lawn yesterday, and it is the first time in awhile that the front lawn has been cut (it doesn't grow as fast as the back yard), so inevitably there were some nature of funky weeds that I happened to be allergic to, and the windows were open. So now my eyes are all puffy and red and my nose is runny. Fabulous. I hope Kira doesn't get the same bout in allergies that I seem to have... All stupid stuff that is air bourn. Well that;s not all, but those are the most annoying. Not like you can ask mother nature to give you your air with ""no pollen please"". Grr. Well at least I know the summer is getting closer to ending from the blooms.   I have no ideas about what I am going to do today. I know I should go for a walk with Kira and check the mail... But we will see how hot it is today. I should also get my laundry done (well as done as laundry can get), and probably should try to clean out my fridge and go grocery shopping. The fridge Is another thing I hate doing... *people* keep putting back half drank pop that spill and never get used, and t-bone steaks that the dog is never allowed to have yet they will never eat the damn things. I just think It Is all a big waste. I have things In little containers, and I use them up... Maybe that Is the difference between growing up to appretiate your food.     The Silver Lining     Once again, no tornados!!! Also, Kira is taking steps all on her own now!!

Some friends had given gift vouchers for  Landmark  and  Westside , so it was time to redeem them before they would become invalid. Kalpana was busy getting goodies for herself and some cute things for the house. Poor me, she did not buy me anything. Anyhow, once all the shopping was done, it was time to hog and the perfect place for a quick bite was "" Transit "", the food court at  The Forum .  This place is awesome, the look and feel gives you an impression as if you are in some Bond movie, the food is not bad either. This time though we had a bite of the Thai food at the "" Panda Club "".  Chicken Satay , kind of a Thai version of Chicken Tandoori though the size was a hundred times smaller. I had a Thai combo non-veggie meal while Kalpana went for the Vietnamese Combo veg meal which she did not like one bit. So, I had to swap my plate with her in the anticipation that she does not throw up. What can I say, she has peculiar tastes :) But I had a good time and I really feel the food court is done well, a thousand times better than the one at Kemp Fort.  Highly recommended for a change."
MMSPFVE,male,23,"I was completely taken aback the other day when I had to cut a  blank face to the question that Kalpana asked me, ""Sunny, what's your goal?""  Its been some time now since I thought about my future and I  wonder why I haven't been thinking about it lately. Is it because I am happy with what I am doing or because I am very busy to think about other things or is it due to the fact that I am a married man with a lot of responsibilities and blah blah blah ..  That certainly does not stop anyone from pursuing what one wants to do in this life. But, if I ask myself the question as to what do I ultimately want to pursue as that one thing which I would always love to do, I just don't know .. its like I still don't know what I would like to do for the rest of my life. I am  completely confused.  Well, my mind is never stable. I am always in the jumping state  and I hop from one state of mind to another faster than the speed  of light (now that's a stupid analogy). I guess I need to improve my concentration, which as I look at it now, is very poor. I need to improve my focus in life and try to find out that one thing  which I would love to do and find it fast.  Until then,   -+-"
MMSPFVE,male,23,"Finally, the name changes   From sometime, I was thinking of renaming this blog from the exanimate title ""Piyush Garyali's Weblog"" to something else. When I finally could not think of anything else even after giving it so much thought, I thought  T h o u g h t s ...   would look like a title I was thinking about.   So hereafter  urlLink http://piyushgaryali.blogspot.com  would take you to the 'thoughts' of Piyush Garyali. Gee, I guess I should get back to work now."

MMSPFVE,male,23,"Today is the second day of the Petrol Pump strike in Calcutta  and the one in Mumbai just started early this morning. When I  think about these cities I can't imagine the state of living with no transport (public or private) & other basic amenities  It gives me shivers to think as to what would happen to B'lore if there is no petrol available for days together. How shall people come to office? Even if they do, how shall the  generators work if there is no diesel? (assuming that the electricity is also dead) On top of that, if the water department calls it off, I get goosed up to imagine how filthy life would become.  Its nice that the weather system in Bangalore is pleasant and one does not sweat as bad as one does in Calcutta or Mumbai but I am sure that without the basic amenities, life would becomes one  big hell.  -+-"

MMSPFVE,male,23,"Talking of places to eat; this one is new. Its called   Manjia  , a Chinese restaurant in JayaNagar on top of the Corner House. The food is extremely pleasing though a little expensive.   It was Saravana's birthday on the 2nd of June and he decided to give a treat today which turned out to be good opportunity to taste the wide variety offered by the restaurant.  So, if you plan to go to this place here are some hints to pick your meal  1) If you are a vegetarian/Non Vegetarian, go for a Hot and Sour vegetable/Chicken soup. It is mind blowing.  2) For starters you can have the Spinach Toast if you are a vegetarian or the threaded Chicken if you happen to be a non-veggie. These are really different and you would not have had anything like this before.  3) For the main course go for Chicken volcano, Mongolian Noddles or Szchewan Egg trapped fried rice; something really new.  4) You can avoid the Combo meals and the vegetable spring roles as they are not worth the money.   How do I reach there?  Simple, If you know the road in Jaya Nagar where Nandani and G K Vale are on your left and Pizza Hut is on your right, keep going straight, cross the junction and you will find the place right at the corner.  Happy weekends"
MMSPFVE,male,23,"After a long time, atlast my hands clicked ""create a new post"", and to add to earlier listed reasons of weblogging, this time the motivation is very different. Sat to write my thoughts, or say to capture my ideas to get myself reminded of it in future. Unlike many people, I do not write a diary, instead my thoughts flow thru e-mails, sms, talk, or penning on the last a few pages of nearest found notebook, but the problem with that is its hard to retrieve and that doesn't serve as reminder. Yeah, I have tried outlook ""task"" mechanism too but that works only in office.... ok, whatever after this background and justification of my log I shall come to the point.     As told by the title of this blog, sometimes I struggle with myself to get the answers to this question, that how long can we or should we wait to start doing something meaningful for this society? When I say society, its scope varies widely which starts right from the people around me and upto the thought of this whole world as society. Very recently for past couple of months I have extended my current scope to global society. :-) Well, but this idea is not that wide scoped, instead it has a boundary of a village or a town in India, specially not around Bangalore.     Yeah, so I was thinking of establishing some kind of school level science lab for my village. More specifically, my idea is not to make a school style lab instead to bring up a workshop which has basic scientific principles demonstrated in practical and meaningful ways. It will also have basic machine tools and ofcourse a x86 computer dabba. The ultimate purpose of something like this is to bring-in the awareness of science and nurturing engineering thinking in people right from the beginning and in the way which will be useful to them. Yes, it would be open to all and will have all the motivational fundas those are needed to pull the people inside the structure. There won't be any fee, or may the minimal fee which is generally needed to inculcate discipline. I have no great expectations from this, other than just making people aware of the things what they generally don't see, or get scared to when see in a city. Its like just giving information and once they have information eventually (though with very slow pace) they will start developing interest in it. But, I am not looking forward for some great breakthru or something like this, I just want to create some fumes and lets see how everybody reacts. By now we all have realized the fact that access to infomation is the key to growth and interest, otherwise how each of you started this blog thing, or why anthropologists try to lobby against MTV and other channels like that? When information is available, it takes up some cells in your brain and as the brain does a brute-force search at times, these cells happen to get refreshed and influence the results of queries, and then slowly becomes significant enough to influence your interests and decisions. Pardon me for my own crude explanation of ""how brain works"", atleast do not tell it to Manik. ;-)  Ok, so now its time to think about the logistics. Well, the first thing I do whenever this kind of idea hits me is to pick the phone and talk to my father and trouble him to go to our village and then talk to people there and then come out with a appealing proposal with cost and feasibility, BUT... this time its not possible, coz I am in different time zone and he should be asleep by now. So, I have sent a mail to me to serve as reminder for taking this thing forward after coming back to Bangalore (ah, one more week).     Its strange that I get so much of impulse of doing something like this and most probably once I am back to Bangalore, I would be far too busy in other ""more important"" tasks and all these stays in blog or task lists. There I have to convince my girlfriend to marry me, have to stay in office for long hours (though without much productivity), worry about food and accomodation (as if I do not have those already) and do all the other things those ""sound"" more important to me. Then I'll think that, let me get settled in life properly then I'll do all this... and the life goes on without reaching to a ""settled"" frame of mind forever and the wait never ends....     Will there be any moment in our life which will bring up the priority of this thought above other ever-lasting worries of life? How great we need to be to start doing something for the people who live hundred times below our so called greatness?     I salute people like, Dr. Devi Shetty, Dr. V J Kurian and Anna Hazare."
