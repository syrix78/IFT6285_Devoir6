QTSYZJV,male,26,"This is an actual email intercepted by myself.  Read and enjoy        From: ""Al Coenen""       Sent: Thursday, January 29, 2004 3:03pm       To: ""Chris Mann""       Subject: Confused about us?  Dearest Chris By now you have read Ryan's very nice and innocent farewell to you on his blog.  I can't help feel a little jealous though.  I know that you said that you needed some space and you wanted to sort things out.  And I know that Ryan Hayes is the probably the closest thing that God has created to the perfect heterosexual male, but still I am seeing red.  Remember the good times.  Like our weekend getaway to Rhinelander.  That was amazing, all the roses and wine.  My knees are still week.  Or even as recently as last weekend when we went home together.  I guess I am trying to say that even though our ""relationship"" may be sinful in some eyes, I feel it is beautiful and I don't want to lose you.  Gotta go, my roommate is calling me for some sweet gay porn start hot young Japanese baseball players. Forever yours,  Big Gay Al Coenen  In know people, I was as shocked as much as you were, but it does explain a few things.  Keep reaching for that rainbow Al."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"Tarantino just doesn't stop.   He is now planning a  urlLink third Kill Bill .  Could be good, could be horrible.  I have seen ""Walking Tall"", the Rock is going to be a leading man in a good movie sooner or later, just not right now.  The story was kind of weak, but the Rock has grown as an actor already.  I don't think he will be wrestling anymore for the foreseeable future. Well in closing, is there a time when Britney doesn't look hot.  I think not."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"So I had one of those turning point experiences tonight.  I ventured out to Evil Roy Slade's tonight with my friends Nate and Brent.  A little background is probably required to make this story understandable.  Nate is my boss at Barley & Hops, and he is 32 yrs old.  Brent has been a friend of mine for about five years now and is 26 yrs old and about 5 months younger than me.  We all go into ERS and the bartender wants our ID's.  She then says to me ""your fine"".  At this point I don't know what to think.  Nate says to her that he does not have his ID but that he is 32 and he knows the owner.  The bartender says ""I guess that is ok, but next time bring an ID"".  I do not know if this bartender knew me or not.  But going on the assumption that she does, then it is ok for her not to card me.  On the assumption that she does not know me, well then she must think that I am really old.  Either way I get to laugh at my boss, and I like that.  Seacrest Out."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"Saw Kill Bill Vol.1  and I would have to say that I am forever desensitized to violence, and that happened in the first five minutes of the movie.  This movie is very good, but it is so violent and crazy it slowly becomes a comedy.  A must see all the way.  That's all for now, I have a recently bought parrot that I must return because it was sold to me deceased."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"Some big television news today.  WWE is planning a  urlLink 24 hour wrestling network .  It will be interesting to see how it works out and how much it will cost.  And the answer to many a fanboys desire, the return of  urlLink family guy  to the boob tube.  What trouble won't he get into? urlLink quagmire.bmp All right!! gigitee gigitee gigitee!"
QTSYZJV,male,26,"OK I also saw Matrix 3 and liked it well enough.  I felt it was a good movie, but it did lack some loose end tying.  Are they leaving it open for new sequels.  It would be interesting to see another ""The One"" battling a new Agent Smith.  However, I do have a problem with people saying that this set of movies is our generations Star Wars.  This statement is totally innaccurate.  Star Wars started the whole movie inspired tye-ins trend.  One of the best selling toylines ever came from that trilogy and made George Lucas the ceo of several different companies.  Star Wars changed the way movies would be made from that day forward.  The Matrix trilogy is good, but the sequels never really improved or surpassed the original.  For a trilogy to be great, the story and visuals all have to be better.  Examples of this include ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""The Godfather, Part II"", and ""T2.""  All much better movies than the originals that allowed them to exist.  The Matrix is more like the little brother of Star Wars, a trilogy of movies living in his older brothers shadow.  I am done ranting now."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"Been awhile since I posted, so here I go.  Went to see KISS on Wednesday with Kevin.  It was a good time, but I only know their last 5 songs, so I probably did not enjoy it as much as others.  Poison opened for them and I enjoyed that a lot more than I thought I would, maybe I was drunk though.  Got to see the Mann at the  urlLink Safe House .  It was fun as well.  I am incredibly hung over today.  I worked with Jeremy last night and that requires heavy drinking to get through the night.  As of right now I am watching women's beach  urlLink volleyball  on TV.  It seems to be a good hangover cure.  Good looking, athletic women in bikinis sweating.  You don't see that in Wisconsin very often."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"First I would like to say ""Big Ups"" to the  urlLink Alist Supreme ,  urlLink Tie ,  urlLink Bill Stevens ,  urlLink Kevin's Sister , and  urlLink CM-Unit , all of who successfully blogged yesterday.  Are we all trying to entertain each other, I think so.    So far this year is the best year for a new years resolution ever for me.  My resolution this year was to drink more.   I have been out every night since the 3rd.  This includes work, since I do quite a bit of drinking at work.  That is all.  By the way, Chris the CM stands for centimeter.  HEHEHEH.  Blog ya later."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"I just wanted to comment on urlLink  Al's  recent attack on my character.  And yes I am ""coordinating"" this post with  urlLink Chris  .  I just wanted to comment on the last line of the post.  In it you say, and I quote ""This work of satire was brought to you by the letter A, the number 17, and Viewers Like You.""  Let's break this down.  I think it is a little  urlLink narcissistic  (here is one of those big words Al has trouble with, click the link if you need a definition) of Al to have his post be brought to us by the letter A.  I mean if you type A, you have already spelled half his name.  I don't think we really have to delve into why the number 17 was chosen.  Let's just say that Al prefers numbers  urlLink less than 18 , wink, wink.  Finally we come to Viewers Like You.  The sad fact is people are only technically viewing the site.  It really should have said Readers Like You.  Well that's all I have to say.  Thanks for reading and I hope that we have all become better people for this."
QTSYZJV,male,26,"urlLink KP  gave me a little grief about not posting for awhile.  So I have decided to start using the technology available to me.  This picture is early in the night, but it clearly show's who is responsible for all the drunk stupidity of that night."
FJTPK9I,female,15,"[edited...finally...] I am now going to try and recollect what was supposed to be written here… and I am now using Microsoft word so that it will not happen anymoreeee. And now I cant remember anything…  Everything that occupied my mind for the whole week ended last Friday! Quizzes and experiments are now finished! Yay for me! And we’re starting a new week and it means more and more assignments and quizzes. * groans *   So our class encounter is normal. Not that bad and not that excellent. But my hand experienced hell for 2 hours writing 47 notes to everyone in the class. Slept 2 hours earlier than last year’s. We slept with the lights on, didn’t knew where the switch is located. Found out all about it the next morning. Breakfast was cold. Didn’t enjoy that. Took pictures after our class encounter ended [wow. Sobrang detailed talaga nito ah] I was the only one left. My parents came at 9…and that’s an hour late…? Then I slept for almost 5 hours after eating lunch.   We watched Spiderman 2 yesterday! Yay!! Finally watched it and I’d give it a lot of thumbs up!! Ang gandaaaaaaa! There’s this only one thing that I hate. Nasa pinakaharap kami!!!!!!!!!! Waaaaaaaaaaah! Laki ng screen. Nakakaduling. Punong puno ang buong sinehan! Hay naku…  I didn’t realize that my wallet fell somewhere during the class encounter. And I don’t know where it fell!!! It’s not in my room or in any place in this house!! Si manang na lang talaga ang aking huling kong pag asa!! Kailangang makita nya yun sa formation house [that’s where we had our class encounter]!! Or else a not-so-large sum of money will be lost!! It became my habit not to empty my wallet after school. My wallet became a sort of piggy bank.  I was so bored during AP. Some of us want to sleeeeeep. Or maybe a lot of us… I kept on yawning and my eyes kept on watering… and I wanted to fall asleep. But I can’t afford to miss one minute of discussion. Sir B keeps on telling stories that he might include in quizzes…   So yay! We should have our Bio Quiz tomorrow but since were a little late in our lessons it was moved to Thursday!! So so happpy!   The ones Raphael, Roxanne and Errol wore a while ago during Reload is the one they wore when I went to the taping. So I guess some scences a while ago are the ones they taped last week.  Hehe… want more of Reload. Bitin sya! 10 ba namang kwento ang ipagkakasya sa isang series…"
FJTPK9I,female,15,"Damn it. I missed scq today. We went to mass e. The only thing I was able to watch is the last part. *sighs*  This is the second time my finger was hurt because of a stupid wire[braces]!! Its the same hand...same wire but different finger. Thank god. The first is the pointer...second is my thumb. The first is...kinda gross. I wont mention it anymore. The second is...I was trying to floss my stupid molar. It's hard, I know, but i still have to floss my teeth you know. So...nasabit ang aking minamahal na thumb sa lintek na wire."
FJTPK9I,female,15,"Ooooh...blogspot got something new. Tagal na siguro nito...  anyway, this week is the most most hectic, most hell-ish week ever in my wholee whole school life!! Gawd, good thing  almost  everything is over...almost everything! only 2 more UT1s to go...and that, i think, would be given to us next week...  and what i said an entry ago... we had 4 tests each day. well we were supposed to be free of tests today...well except for a practical test in Lab... so nervous. Im gonna be the 2nd one to take it next week. Di ko kaya! How will I be able to finish mounting and focusing a microscope under time pressure?! and 1 minute lang?! And only a few...only a few got a perfect score of 20!! and you can only get a score of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20! *sigh* And i got a week to worry all about it.   gaaaawd, OE practical test next wednesday! I havent thought of a creative name to describe my communication/thinking skills. I.am.not.creative.at.things.like.this.and.i.hate.this....so..god help me..please?  Im never creative at some things...or maybe all? Pleaaase magkaroon ng miracle at maging creative na lang ako bigla? hay naku...  anyway, i dont know what i got in Business Math...the equivalent i mean. But i dont care if its line of 8. Its my fault why i got that score. Should have  read the instructions first before answering them. So stupid...but i hope my score in algebra wont be the same. Hope its higher... And Bio...gawd. NO ERASURES? what does he think of us? perfect students who doesnt commit mistakes? Eh we cant avoid that! And were also under time pressure. Oh well, i dont expect to get a score of 90 and above...   anyway, what else...Oh...APPPP! Gawd, ang sobrang dali!!! Pero grabe talaga. I studied for almost 3 hours last night almost memorizing chapter 1...i said almost...not totally. Well...parang alam mo na na hinde? Pero ala talagang pumapasok sa utak ko! Eh may dumating sa akin na balita na dapat memorize mo yung evaluation part ng chapter 3 & 4...daya ano? Buti na lang talaga at narinig ko yun! kung hindi....almost 20 points ang mawawala sa akin... And he didnt even change the order of the answers...tsk tsk... Well...good for me. lol  Softball. *grins* Halos lahat ng ka-group ko hindi alam na kami ang group 1. my first game this year, ever and i ended up being the pitcher again...i was assigned by ate karen. nice. i guess, she remembered me from last year's intramurals... She just said and pointed to me ""Kaw ang pitcher natin"" period. I guess i pitched fine...compared to the others [kapal ko]...I threw strikes *grins proudly*  I guess that's the  only  thing that i contibuted to the 2 games we played. Gawd, i think i need my eyeglasses during clubtime. I can't bat properly for heaven's sake. I was only able to bat the ball at least 3-4 feet away from me?! at almost foul ball pa siya! How humiliating... Almost all pitchers that i have seen can bat properly. eh ako? walaaa! or maybe nasa pitcher din yun? ganun kaya yun? hay naku... at full bases pa nun...gawd, they even said na ""uy!! home run!"" hay naku... hate it. I really hate it pag kami ang una sa batting...kahit kelan basta mag bat. ayaw ko...na.   So i guess ito na?...woah...it took me almost 2 hours to finish this entry..."
FJTPK9I,female,15,"The dirty ice cream scene with Romer reminded me of something that happened to me when I was a little kid... *grins*  After buying one, I went back inside. Before reaching the door, the ice cream on top fell! So I went outside to have my cone ""refilled"". Then it happened again! Then well you know what happened next...The ice cream fell again for the 3rd time!! Hanggang sa 3rd time na lang yun. I made sure na hindi na siya mahuhulog. Kasi I think when I licked it...the ice cream went with the flow. Nasobrahan ba ung lakas ng pag lick ko? lol"
FJTPK9I,female,15,"Didn't I just promised that I would scan my books or even read them? Well, I'm already half-way through! Yay! Good for me!   I'm reading the one for Filipino. It's called Gapo. The accent is stressed on the second syllable. I'm also making ""summaries"" of each kabanata. So that I wont forget the story when its 4th Quarter already.   Well, its a weird story. It's mainly about the discrimination between the black, the white and the brown during the 70's in Olongapo City....hence, the title of this book. Those pinoys are grouped into 2 those who loved and those who hated the white. It's also about the desire of the pinays to at least have a glimpse of this wonderful world of the white. And also...about a GI baby who has a heart of a true pinoy. Don't ask me what's a GI baby...Di ko alam kung ano yun :P"
FJTPK9I,female,15,"*waves* hi hi! Last night while I was watching Ok fine whatever, I was browsing thru my notes for AP since we have a quiz, which was done this afternoon.

Magiging double period na siya...every friday. So naapektuhan ang aming double lab. So we had double BIO a while ago...and i got 55/60 dun sa UT1 namin! Eh after our bio class OE na.

Nawala ako pagdating dun sa talent part. Hindi ko nasabi ang dapat kong sasabihin...at bakit ba ang laki laki ng mga ngiti ng mga kaklase ko? hay naku...tapos yung fishbowl question sakin ""if you will be reborn again where do you want to be born?"" something like that. Nanlaki mata ko...namutla raw ako. Tumakbo isip ko sa lahat ng bansa na alam ko.  sinabi ko na I dont want to be born anywhere else...im proud to be a filipino...stuff like that. basta ang labooo. Bakit ba di ko naisip na hindi nga ako pinanganak dito sa pinas...diba? tsk tsk...hindi talaga aandar ng maayos ang utak ko pag under pressure...  Hindi ko matanggap na...tapos na ako! lol its so weird. I was having a hard time in eating. Good thing I decided to eat baked mac...and not rice with ulam...

So after lunch...we had HomeRoom, English, CAI, and then Filipino. Ok pa sana sa homeroom e. pero pagdating sa english....its ZZZzzzzzzz time!!! I almost fell asleep!

FJTPK9I,female,15,"So yeah...classes wasnt suspended today. damn it. But since it was signal #1 early this morning...my brother didn't have to go to school for the second time!! Hate it. It's sooo unfair. Is the sun appearing behind the clouds a part of signal # 1 of a typhoon?!?! It was not signal # 1 awhile ago well not for us! It was like any other day! The winds are blowing and the sun is shining! No change! Nothing flew, nothing swayed. And in fact I never wore my jacket today! The moment I stepped out of the bus service...hot air met my face...removed the jacket the moment I got inside the classroom.  So okey...I was too preoccupied with finishing book 5 of HP yesterday to study for a quiz in AP. I had the entire afternoon to study still I didnt cared...don't know why. I was not surprised when we checked our papers. I guess I was already expecting a failing mark. Didnt put enough effort to even memorize the book! Well the ones I read and understood didnt came out in the quiz and those I just skipped came out! Didnt mind...didnt cared. *removes the thought of the quiz away*  During recess instead of reviewing for AP we had arm wrestling! My arm ached after that. Well both my arms did ache but the left arm waited till lunch to suffer the consequences of arm wrestling. We were making so much noise that 2 teachers 2 tables away from us made us stop. They actually looked amused at what we were doing. They stared at us for almost 2 minutes grinning! I guess we were the topic of their discussion since they keep on glancing at us. We just laughed it off...again didn't cared. In fact, I enjoyed arm wrestling. Feels like your a kid again...as if im not one.   But the real consequence of that arm wrestling came when we had our swimming class. I was going well with doing freestyle until we did backstrokes. My arm really ached at that moment! I dunno...may be it got a little overstretched or maybe twisted when i swam. Good thing the pain subsided...but still my arms are aching right now.   So there...tomorrow's our first choice for our clubs already! And that's the only thing I look forward to every friday now. All the subjects are fine except one and you know that of course...house meetings. I really don't know the purpose of having and sorting us into houses. The only thing i know that we will do every meeting is to practice for the so called 'activity week' where they will stuff all the activities of the whole school year into that one week only!! I really dont know how will that happen...They are just so weird...And I dont like it."

It allows you to subscribe to various syndicated news feeds (such as weblogs, news sites, etc.) and have news from these sites be delivered right into your Outlook folders. There are thousands of sites which syndicate their content in RSS format, and many more being added every day. You can even read NNTP newsgroups with NewsGator.   urlLink RSS Bandit : a .NET RSS desktop feed aggregator.   urlLink Vox Lite  allows you to keep up-to-date with all your favourite sources of information that support the RSS protocol.   urlLink BottomFeeder  is a news aggregator client (RSS and Atom) written in VisualWorks Smalltalk.

They also store your feeds locally so if you're traveling you have an archive of things to read.  Web based aggregators require a connection at all times.   If you purchase an aggregator make sure it can import and export OPML -- a standard for sharing the feeds to which you subscribe.  Without this you might be locked into a software package.

ASLB0XH,male,26,"urlLink Yahoo to test its New Homepage - PakTribune : ""Yahoo has begun quietly testing a makeover of its home page, as evidenced by trial mock-ups seen by some Web users over the past few weeks when they accessed the portal.""  Yahoo! is stepping up to Google's announcement of it's 1GB storage space for it's Gmail users. They've announced that they'll give 100 MBs to their Yahoo! Mail users sometime this summer.   Yahoo! also recently revamped their Messenger Service to include the popular LAUNCHcast internet Radio and a Y! Search field at the bottom of it, something that's a new innovation when it comes to Instant Messaging.  They not too long ago also added a product search on their engine, a feature that mimics Google's product search Froogle. Yahoo's toolbar has for several months now included a ""WebRank"" that is an obvious knockoff of Google's PageRank, however, it acts more like Alexa's toolbar ranking in that it determines the ranking by aggregating Yahoo toolbar users' browsing patterns.   With these changes and others, Yahoo and Google are begining to look more like each other and are pounding out the way we interact with the web. A little competition here is very exciting...I'm liking the improvements on both sides.  Yahoo also rolled out today a new mail interface that matches its Messenger and that allows 10MB of email transfer and 100MB of storage. Thank goodness! I have been over my limit for several months. Kind of Yahoo! not to close that account. Kind of them to increase my storage to 100MB. Thanks Yahoo!"

I know I mentioned that before but.. searching God on what to do and * bam * Dan calls and asks if I want to go to camp. I must say that I'm starting to lean towards it. I still have to pray about it, and get the right info from Dan on it.. but it seems right. ya know? the next two years are going to be key. I can just tell.  I've been listening to the gloria record   start here  a lot recently. nothing is actually playing right now.. but that's been in my car cd player almost without exception. i was born in omaha is like my favorite song right now and I can't wait to hear it again.   seeing as it's almost 6am and I would like to get some good rest before traveling off to the beach..

I was up front for a little while, talked a little with mark, prayed, and then a little after that I went over to where the pool tables used to be, and is now a ping pong table. so I'm standing over there against the wall when tim comes up to me..(he didn't know who I was... he just knew he had to come up to me and say something in order to be faithful to God) he says something to the affect of; even if everyone else leaves you, God is still there and will never leave you. it's a cool statement, and even cooler that someone would go up to someone they don't know to relay it. and it's true, I know it is, but it's got me wondering if it's a warning. like that I need to remember that statement, that fact, because everyone  is  going to leave me(or at least it will seem like it) ok God, it's all well and good that you wanna say how you'll never leave me, and it's fine to put in even if everyone else does... but if you take away all my friends to prove a point, or cause me to grow, it's going to suck. yeah it'll be worth it in the end cuz I'll have learned something, matured or whatever. but why doI have to go through all this suck time huh? the easy road is not the one you intended for us; love is not self-seeking; ... so the next year and a half huh? gonna be quite the growing time isn't it? in some ways I look forward to it... in others... well I only have one word: !@#%! ...yeah."
MAWG9RF,male,25,"normalcy is going to kill me one of these days... it's nice when you have a friend you can share things with, and they can share things with you, you're able to converse, joke around, even flirt a little... it becomes hard when one side develops feelings for the other, it becomes harder when the other finds out and doesn't know how to react. it's nice when the other side starts coming around again, and you can start having conversations again (no matter how small, or seemingly meaningless) I still don't regret any part of it.  you know, jon hartsaw writes some good music. I'm listening to his most current addition to  urlLink mp3.com.  it's really good. speaking of good music. I went to the Volta do Mar show tonight and their quite amazing as well. all this reminds me how much I want to take time to work on my own music. I know I have some good stuff, and that I could put something together worth buying, worth playing out, I just need to take the time to do it. Casey wrote me an e-mail the other day (I still need to respond to that, speaking of responding... later) telling me about some oportunities up in the Madison area, asked me how things were coming along down here, wondered if our project was still on, or if it should be shelfed for a while. he has spring break soon, said he could maybe come down... that would be good, I think he should really do that. it would be nice to play with him again. maybe there's a show that week that we could go to as well... hmmm.... have to look into that some more. man... no... God, I need to play, I need to write, I need to get out and share it with the world, I need to share You with the world, the gifts You've given me, and the experiences I've had... I know it's all for a reason... or at least You can use it that way(does everything have a reason for happening, I don't really think so, but I know this has, I have, purpose; God reveal!)   ahhh, the cool determination of steel."

9MOAJR2,female,34,"I woke up this morning to a cuddly husband.  While I did my morning 3 minutes of teasing myself for Erik he scooted over to watch, as usual.  This morning found me getting more aroused than usual though.  When I stopped playing with myself, Dom picked up where I left off, telling me to show him how to do it the way I liked.  I guided his fingers to the best spot and he teased me for several minutes.  I told him that Erik had said the night before that I deserved to come at least once today, because of something that happened between he and I.  He seemed amenable to that.  Then he rolled over on top of me and wanted me to show him how to fuck me.  That was a lot more difficult to do.  Because I have a hard time saying what I want or need.  He was patient up to a point, trying different things, different positions and speeds, asking how this or that was.  I was having trouble giving him more than just answers to his questions.  He finally got frustrated with me and moved back to his side of the bed.  I lay there for a few minutes, struggling to come up with the words he wanted.  I finally moved over next to him and started giving him some specifics of what I liked.    I would tell him someplace I liked to be touched and how I liked it and he would do it, asking if that was it.  It got easier the more we did it that way and he returned the favor, showing me a couple of particularly sensitive spots of his own.  I got my orgasm this morning and instead of announcing that I was coming like I usually do, I had to say thank you Erik.  Seemed fair since he was the one who said I deserved it.  It was nearly 1:30 by the time we got out of bed.  Good thing it was Sunday.  We were both starving and somebody had a craving for ice cream.  So I made him an offer, I would fix us a nice lunch if he would go get his ice cream.  I went all out, fixing steaks, au gratin potatoes and garlic bread and he brought back salad to go with it all.  After we ate we played school with him being the schoolmaster, of course.  We went over some basics of submission.  I felt like it was information I needed because of my lack of experience and the problems we've had this past week.  Some of it was a bit daunting but when I brought that up he pointed out that each relationship is different and once I had the basics down we could take what worked for us and leave the rest.  That helped some.    We got some ice cream and sat down to talk for a little bit, going over some things that had come up in the class.  We set some limits that I think will help me be more comfortable with this.  Things like when we are at home I might be subject to punishment or correction for things I do that displease Dom, even if it's not a written rule between us.  I'm not sure about this one but told him I wanted to try it out and see how it worked.  The reason I agreed to try it was because I got a little aroused thinking about the possibilities and I decided to let that guide me.  What I did next was very hard and very scary.  But also very exciting.  I sat in his lap so I could cuddle up into his neck and talk to him without having to look at him.  That made it a little easier.  I told him it would help me if he would give me the punishment for breaking one of the rules that he hadn't given me.  Then I confessed that I had broken that rule another time he didn't know about.  In case you are curious, the rule was I am supposed to ask permission before using the bathroom while I'm at home.  Friday morning I flagrantly broke it and told him to put the penalty on my tab.  Then Saturday morning he got up before me and closed the bedroom door so as to not disturb me and it was easy to sneak to the bathroom without him knowing.  I could have gotten away with that one and honestly, I didn't feel all that guilty.  It wasn't like the transgression was weighing on me.  But I wanted the punishment.  When I told him I needed to be punished he asked me if my heart was pounding.  It was.  He asked me if I was excited and I admitted I was.  He told me to get undressed and go arrange myself on the bed, on hands and knees if I wasn't too sore from yesterday's workout and if I was too sore I could lie flat.  I did and he came in shortly.  He leaned over me to tell me how proud he was of me for confessing and that I was a good girl for that but it wasn't going to lessen my punishment.  The penalty for breaking that rule is 10 licks with his belt, so I had 20 coming.  He didn't warm me up and he put some power into them.  I know he didn't hit me as hard as he could have, but it was hard enough that I was crying before he was done.  He held me and petted me a little while I cried.  Then he surprised me by telling me he was so proud of me that he wanted to reward me.  I could have my choice of another orgasm or some more belt.  I thought about it for a few minutes, knowing which one I wanted but having a hard time saying it.  I asked which I would get if I didn't decide and he said neither.  So after a few more minutes I asked if I chose the belt if he would start a little slower this time.  He assured me he would, that this time would be out of love instead of a punishment so it would be a slow build up into it.  This time I got flat on the bed and he sat beside me, starting out with little smacks.  Working up to stronger blows that made me squirm and moan.  He stopped a time or two to rub my bottom, giving me a break before starting again.  When he had moved on to harder blows I relaxed my muscles and that acceptance seemed to be the key to letting me fly.  It wasn't long before I was sobbing hard and after about another minute I cried out my safeword.  I cried much harder this time, probably harder than I did Friday night.    After I cried myself out in his arms and blew my nose so I could breath I started rubbing his cock through his jeans.  I asked him, teasingly, if it gave him a stiffy to beat me so he showed me that it did.  I slid down in the bed and took him in my mouth, sucking him back to a nice hard erection.  Not to brag, but I'm pretty good at sucking cock so I had him moaning in short order.  I didn't stop until he came in my mouth and when he did I sucked him dry, licking him clean.  I have discovered that I love to do that and have done so on many occasions lately.  I slid back up to cuddle in his arms again and asked if that was an adequate thank you for my belting.  He agreed that it was.  I told him I felt very loved and cared for and very special.  I wasn't trying to get anything else for being a good girl, but I did want him to know how I was feeling so I took his hand and put it between my legs so he could feel how wet I was.  He seemed impressed, telling me it would be a shame to waste that and proceeded to start teasing me, rubbing my clit and sliding his fingers inside me.  He got up after a couple of minutes and got one of my toys, handing it to me and telling me he wanted to look in my eyes when I came.  I started using it but before I got very close to my orgasm he informed me he had another erection and we decided it would be a shame to waste  that .  He told me to turn over so he could take me from behind (my favorite position, I admit) and I could use my vibe to get off.  It wasn't long before I felt my orgasm build up and I asked permission to come, obeying one of my rules.  I had to beg but he finally said yes and when I let go I had a long, hard orgasm.  I thought it was going to last forever.  I came so hard I started crying again.  Afterwards we cuddled for just a few minutes before he sent me to blog about it while it was still fresh.  He brought me a glass of champagne and we toasted our relationship.  He told me my actions screamed so loud he couldn't hear my words, referring to my reservations about being submissive.  And that brings me to right now and I'm going to go watch a little t.v."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"If you ever wonder why Anna seems so confused sometimes, look no further than me.  I've been hooked on Darvacet for years. A year ago after a severe accident I got access to not only more Davacet, but Lortab as well. And I got hooked on mixing them.  When all this came out about Anna. I swore to quit. I have to be the best man I can be for her. And that means being there for her. Especially when she wants someone's love. No way I can be doped up in those moments for her anymore. I weaned myself as best I could and then it's been cold turkey. It's hell. And it has become hell on both of us. I've been able to manage the body pain, the shaky feeling and the cravings. But the place I have been losing this battle is the most important one. In my mind.   When I go into withdrawals, I get really paranoid. I say things I don't mean or think. I do things I don't mean to do. I break my word. This inconsistently is hurting my relationship to Anna, it's hurting her budding self esteem as A SUBMISSIVE, and it's hurting the chances I have of winning her love again. It has to come to a screeching halt. Now. NOW goddammit now.  I've shut down my other blog. I'm going to focus on this undistracted. And the biggest part of that focus must be to shut the hell up. I've got some new herbs to use to help ease the symptoms. I have a new plan for at home, and I have a new job to help keep me busy. I'm going to beat this. Nothing is more important to me than Anna. Nothing. And I am going to become the man she wants and needs no matter how much discomfort the changes make in me.  What kills me is that Anna put a whole new level of trust in me. So much so I had to go hide and shed a tear of joy, then this comes up and I talk trash for 3 hours in the middle of the night. Shame? You bet. Guilt? Truckloads? Giving up? NOT ON YOUR SOUL!  I'm going to beat this. But I'm not going to be one for much talking until I do. I've needed help. I've wanted to talk to other dom's and sub's and get to learn things to make me a better man suited for Anna. But no one ever responded to the emails I sent. Like the Titanic, my s.o.s has gone unheard, and I did not sink.  Now I have this hurdle to cross, and I will not sink. I will win. But don't expect to hear much from me about it. At least not until it's over but good."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"I found a blooger I can at least partially relate to. Claire of the blog  urlLink Cliffnotes  seems to have some of the feeling toward her dom in the entry Status Quo that I do toward Anna. The primary difference is Claire sees her bratty behavior as a cry of attention. Anna either doesn't, or is still in denial. Her worries about her dom seem valid to me. I have the same worries about Anna.  We took the day off again yesterday. Not even as much as a greeting. We were both still tired and I'm still trying to shake the effects of a night terror I woke to Sunday morning. I haven't had one in a couple of years so it took me by surprise and bit me really hard. Unless you've had them for a long time like I have, it's hard to understand.  Anna showed some interest in being wrapped in the big roll of plastic I have tonight. I've been looking forward to seeing the effects of sensory deprivation and bondage on her. Especially after a stressful day at work. Something to look forward to. I feel like it will touch her in a way that will put her in touch with her submissive side than other methods we have tried. Guess we'll see.  She stayed up late last night, then right when she was going to come lay down with me, work called. The end result was getting in bed super late and waking up grouchy and sullen. Not the best way for a brat to start the day. Maybe she won't have as bad a day as she thinks. Maybe if she does she won't run screaming from the very thing that might help her sublimate. Ah, you have to love all the ironies of this kind of life."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"Since both of my Doms have now weighed in I guess I will take a turn.  I'm going to go back and make posts for every day since this started which will go back to Wednesday.  For simplicities sake I will back date them with the appropriate date.  That will keep from making one big post that would be hard to read.  So I guess you should read those first for this to make a lot of sense.  I'll try to get those up as quickly as possible.  Today was supposed to be a day off for me.  Mostly because it has been so intense and all consuming from the beginning that I've barely had time to catch a breath.  But like the naughty sub I am, I couldn't leave well enough alone.  This morning before I was even out of bed I confessed that I was curious how a spanking on my still sore and very bruised ass would feel.  After making me ask for it (still something hard for me) Eben indulged me.  And just in case it's not obvious, Eben is my husband.  (Really sweetheart?  Eben?)  What I found was that it got very intense very quickly and I cried uncle pretty soon.  Eben had to leave shortly after to go work a few hours.  My plan was to shower and go find a couple of movies to lounge with for the day.  Instead I got this blog set up and sent invites to my Doms.  And sent Erik a nasty picture from last nights festivities that he instigated.  He replied back and told me a day of rest sounded like a good idea to him too.  Only he suggested a bath instead of a shower.  Before I could do a shower or bath Eben called to check on me.  And once again, I had to push.  And bring up some insecurities.  He didn't say a whole lot about what I brought up, other than to reassure me.  Then the cruel man told me to play with myself and answer some questions.  What's cruel about that?  I'm not allowed to have an orgasm until Wednesday.  And after last night's mistake I certainly want to obey that order.  When he finally let me stop I was in tears of frustration so he stayed on the phone with me a few minutes more until I was ready to get in the shower.  Since Erik told me to take a bath I ran one and soaked for a few minutes.  That felt really good on all my sore muscles.  (Of course, I had to stand up to wash my hair anyway so I got both bath and shower)  It was mid-afternoon by this time and I knew I had to run to get my errands done and be back before Eben.  I found a couple of movies and got a pizza for us.  He called shortly after I got back home and told me to read my email and do what it said.  Basically he called bullshit on my insecurities from this morning.  And said if that was true, I was going to be punished for not being trusting enough.  Well, after I thought about it I realized he was probably right and I did deserve punishment.  But I certainly dreaded it.  I'm still sore and bruised all over.  I pleaded my case after he got home and I had greeted him properly.  He decided since he was at least half right I got the punishment.  A few stinging slaps on my poor abused pussy and tender nipples later and all was forgiven.  Then he had to tease me again by using my sore pussy to get himself off.  But I didn't get to come.  I had to really concentrate on not coming and I confess I was in a bratty mood afterwards.  I'm lucky he was in such a good mood from his own orgasm, I only got scolded for it this time.  We watched a movie together and now I'm spending some time online.  I have to work tomorrow, but tomorrow evening is my makeup free time.  If I don't push again."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"Instead of a chronicle of all the depravity I've enjoyed this week I thought I might try something different.  Trying to write about feelings.  Specifically my feelings.  I've hinted and danced around the edges of them occasionally.  Inferred things.  But I rarely come right out and bare my soul.  If this gets too difficult I'll stop.  Or divulge my perversions.  I thought I would try though.  I've been suffering the last week.  Feeling really bad about myself and not able to enjoy the new sensations and relationships I've been exploring.  I think it started with a medical problem, was exacerbated by pms and fed by my own unwillingness to stop the pity party.  You see, as painful as it is for me to admit, it's easy and comfortable to feel sorry for myself.  I've had a hard life dammit and everybody should feel sorry for me.  But no one does.    Instead I've got a husband, an online lover, a work crush and an email friend telling me how wonderful I am.  How passionate.  How beautiful.  How brave and daring and erotic.  Only I didn't want to hear it.  I wanted to wallow in my own flaws and shortcomings and not see or acknowledge these other things.    I couldn't see my beauty for the extra weight I carry.  And yet I'm constantly told by those few (count them on one hand few) who know my weight that I don't look that heavy and that I carry my weight beautifully.  We're talking healthcare people.  Professionals who see women of all shapes and sizes and know women's bodies more intimately than most lovers.  The last time I got on the scales at the doctor's office the nurse thought the scales were broken because she said ""I don't think this is right, you don't weigh this do you?""  But instead of remembering that and being encouraged by the progress my exercising has brought me (I'm starting to get my waist back again.  I have curves now) all I could do was compare myself to unrealistic and unattainable standards set by people who don't know me or care about me.  I couldn't accept the love these men were trying to give me, each in their own way, because I didn't feel worthy of it.  I didn't feel like I deserved to be loved or desired and couldn't understand how or why any man would want me.  In fact I began to suspect their sanity.  Well, maybe not sanity.  But there must be something wrong with them, for them to want me.  As Groucho Marx put it, ""I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.""  I couldn't accept pleasure.  Nothing tasted good, sensual touches left me cold.  Even the pain I have come to crave left me numb.  I wanted to climb into my little hole and shut out the world to keep myself safe from disappointment and rejection.  Pretty pathetic huh?  This morning started on a very sour note.  But I have to give props where they are due.  Instead of just retreating after I shut him out (his usual defense), Dom confronted me.  I broke down and cried, admitting I didn't feel worthy of his love and efforts.  He decided we needed to get out of the house and talk some more.  After a long impassioned talk in the park with Dom, some honest looking at myself in between talking and riding to the next town, and about 3 hours sifting through Books A Million, looking for the self help book that would inspire me, I'm feeling better.  Open, raw, exposed.  But better.  And hopeful.  I know it's not going to be all better, just like that.  However I also know that the decision to make a change, the desire to change, is more than half the battle.    I found 4 books that spoke to me on some level.  One on communication that I hope Dom will read with me.  One on the Womanly Arts of Pleasure-how to find pleasure in yourself and your world and how to use that to get what you want.  One on body acceptance.  And one on breaking the addiction to misery.  I'm not sure I'm addicted to misery, but a random sampling of the text found more than one passage that hit so close to home it moved me to tears.  So I took that as a sign I could benefit from the book.    I'm going to read and re-read.  Highlight and underline.  I've already started writing out index cards with quotes and affirmations.  I intend to use these tools to springboard to self love and confidence.  The conventional wisdom is that you can't love another or accept love from another until you love yourself.  And I want to be loved.  And wanted.  And accepted.  And celebrated.  I crave these things.  Now I'm searching for the path to getting them.  What does all this have to do with being submissive?  A lot I think.  All this muck got stirred up when I began exploring my submissive side.  I've dealt with it before, worked on my esteem.  But not enough.  I didn't pursue it well enough or long enough to find true self love and respect.  You can't submit yourself to another if you don't feel you are good enough.  When you feel like garbage, it shows.  And nobody wants garbage.  Nobody wants to dominate a worthless person.  Not anybody that has any business doing it anyway.  A Dom who uses a sub's lack of self respect, who manipulates that sub and wrings their submission from them based on their feelings of self hate, is a true bastard.  Regardless of sex.  Male or female.  I think it's very likely that any submissive feelings I have had in the past got shoved down along with the other things I've suppressed for so long.  I didn't recognize them for what they were but I didn't try to explore them either.  So it makes sense that when I tried to tap into the submissiveness I stirred up the other things.  The self esteem issues and self hate.  And it looks like I'm going to have to deal with them before I can go much further with the explorations of submission.  Now for a little fun stuff.    Last Sunday's experimentation.  After I posted we retired to the bed to see how we liked having sex while I was on my period.  Something we never tried before but I was intensely curious about.  We put down a towel and got down to business.  Plain vanilla sex, but speaking for myself, I was aroused to try something so different.  Until we got into things.  One thing I didn't even consider and really wasn't prepared for was odor.  Blood has a very distinctive smell and since I was bleeding fairly good, I could smell my blood.  I have rarely been exposed to this odor and in this setting it was a bit unsettling.  I couldn't help but be a little turned off and wonder if Dom was too.  I guess I should have thought about it, but most of my periods are spent keeping blood from ever seeing the light of day so I just wasn't prepared.  We still managed to have good sex, orgasms all around.  Hopefully it was just bad timing, my painkiller wearing off and not the activity itself, but my cramps came back with a vengeance right after.  I wasn't inspired to want to spend the afternoon this way, but I'm certainly not crossing it off my list for the future.  This month was particularly horrible and other months I have been hornier than a goat.  So I predict this will become part of our stable of tricks.   Tuesday evening I worked out in the nude for Dom.  Lifted weights for him to be exact and since I have been doing aerobic workouts lately and neglecting this routine, it hurt.  Not that night but the next few days.  I'm just now able to walk without hobbling.  He really really liked this performance.  I did it because I knew he wanted me to and because I really needed the workout.  Trying here.  I'm trying to do things he likes to express my submission even when I don't love doing it.  It's hard but in this case it was gratifying.  Wednesday we went to the river and watched a rain shower go over while we talked.  This is where the esteem thing got brought up again and Dom told me, without coming out and saying the words, that he thought this was why I couldn't get aroused or get into my headspace.  Much more was said, many tears shed.  But I felt good afterwards.  He put thumbcuffs on me for the ride back to town.  That was, different.  I guess the best word I could come up with for the way it made me feel is reassured.  Thursday was a royal screwup that I won't go into, other than to say there were hurt feelings on both sides but we came to a little better understanding of where I am right now.  Last night.  Last night we tried something I've been wanting for a while but we haven't been able to find the time.  We did this once or twice a long time ago and I really enjoyed it.  Which doesn't make sense because I'm a tad claustrophobic.  I was wrapped up in plastic wrap from shoulders to ankles, blindfolded and had on sound blocking headphones.  Dom got me set up and laid out on the bed and said he'd check on me in 30 minutes.  Those 30 minutes seemed like 5.  I was flying so high and my mind was racing, thinking about things that I've recently experienced, things I want, I couldn't even tell you what my thoughts were.  My feet were unwrapped and hanging off the end of the bed and this with the tightness of the wrap made me feel like I was literally floating in space.  When he checked on me my blindfold got knocked aside.  He misunderstood my problem, thinking I could see too much with the blindfold on and put a bandana around my eyes.  I couldn't communicate for the duct tape gag and tell him all I wanted was the blindfold pulled back into place.  The messing around my head tensed me up and it took a few minutes to get back to where I was.  But I did and floated again until he checked on me again.  This time I tried to communicate that I was ready to stop but he misunderstood and left me.  I thought he was getting things ready to release me when instead he was getting the baby monitor set up so he could go in the other room.  I finally used my safe word signal and got released.  It was an intense situation but no harm was done.  I didn't really panic and enjoyed the whole thing immensely.  I'm looking forward to the next trip.  Tomorrow is family time, going to a family reunion with my folks.  I'm taking off Monday and we have tentative plans for a marking.  He thinks my butt is too pale I guess.  He said last night I was overdue for one.  And that's where I am right now.  Still trying.  Still struggling.  But now that I've been honest with myself and have named my enemy, my self hate instead of myself or my husband, I have hope.  Hope that I'll become worthy of the love and attention the men in my life seem determined to shower me with.  Hope that I'll become the flirty, sexy, confident woman I know I can be.  Hope."

9MOAJR2,female,34,"The first day of our new union...(deep breath of the fresh air)....And gag coughing.   Anna woke up in Brat OVERDRIVE I was actually glad when she left to go to work, which is highly unusual for me. Ah well I immediately began to plan the evening based on it. Some writing sentences based on some affirmations I made to help her self esteem, some time in the corner and the world would be right again. I had some other surprise goodies, but seeing how it went ""not quite to plan"" I'll save those for later.   My search for a job came to a head when a prospect required an interview at a time that I was scheduled to work my current job.  Job is less the word for it. They are starving me to death not giving hours. I confronted them about this yesterday and they gave me attitude. So today when I go in and explain developments to them, they hit the roof. Seem like they could not understand why I would give up their generous 18 hour a week schedules for a chance at a 40 hour position somewhere else. I tried to be diplomatic, and it got ugly.   Now anyone who knows me, knows I am a confrontational person. I'll fight you. I'll fight you just for kicks. You can walk up to me and say ""Hey, want to fight?"" and I'm good to go. I love the sensation. The adrenaline, the fear. I live for it. (CAVEAT:  as long as it has no significant emotional attachment)  But today I had already been kicked twice. My morning had not been smooth at all, and my job search had lead me out of town, in blazing heat, and taken hours only to produce the need for a second two hour interview that was sure to cost me....This blow to my esteem; I turned my back and walked away, rather than facing off and getting smart back.  I don't know for the life of me why. Exhaustion maybe. But by all rights I should have laid into her instead of getting in my car and driving away, only to feel like a complete sap a mile down the road.   Anyway, I stifle it. I've got bigger fish to fry, and I'm bound to get that new and much better job.  (insert hard swallow here) I've got Anna the Brat to deal with. I stop by the drug store and pick up a decent enema bag. I go home and ply my creative skills to my new trade and set up the scene, brew a catnip tea solution for the enema, set up the sentence writing board in the punishment corner. Get the affirmations I want written set, set up the massage table under the power rack and hang the bag,  get the plug for the retention time at the ready, and pick up.   Before I can even get my shower she's home! On time for once. I sit and wait for her to walk in, giddy for a chance to get this day going in the right direction. She hits the door. Falls to her knees beside me on on the couch. I look in her eyes and....   She's in pain. Terrible pain. It seems her cycle has kicked off a week early and she's in a bad way.  Right away it's a change of plan. I tell her to get some medicine in her, and I get her to lay down.  I lie down with her and I talk to her, soothe her as best I can while we wait for the relief to take hold. When she gets up to sit I fix us something to eat and I massage and stroke her hair while we wait. After dinner, I watch a bit of TV with her. In the evening she says she wants to do something to take her mind off it, so I set the enema back up and administer it, just not quite to plan. Very slowly, and the entire time massaging and stroking her. Once it's in I don't plug her, I just tell her to hold it as long as comfortable, but not to crap. She has enough of that going on. I play with her hair and try to be as soothing to her as I can be. When she mentions something that sounded like regret I told her that a good Dom was also a friend, and right now that was what she needed the most.   She crashed immediately after voiding. Exhaustion from the previous nights combining with the strong herbs, and hopefully, my love and caregiving to give her some rest.   While this may not seem like the dominant thing to do to some of you, it was the most loving thing to do for Anna. The corner and white board will be there, the Brat will diffidently be back."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"Friday morning I got on IM and chatted with Erik.  Not the best use of my work time, but I couldn't help myself.  We chatted for entirely too long and he gave me a couple of assignments for the day.  At two different times I was to go to the ladies room and play with myself for 10 minutes but not come.  The first time was right after I signed off IM with him.  I went to the public restroom so I wouldn't have to worry about taking so long.  The cool metal of the stall dividers felt good against my hot bottom.  I was pretty sore from the previous night's spanking.  The 10 minutes passed quickly and I washed my hands and left for my desk.  As I was coming out of the restroom I heard my name paged overhead.  Not unheard of, but not all that common either.  As I came around the corner to the operator's desk I saw why I was being paged, my husband was there.  I felt a small flash of guilt but walked up and greeted him like nothing was amiss.  He had some flowers and a gift for me along with a card.  He likes to do things like that for no reason and when he has a reason he tends to go overboard.  The gift was a heavy silver bracelet that he fastened on my wrist himself.  Standing in a busy hallway like we were we didn't say much but did exchange a meaningful look.  I carried my goodies back to my desk and sat down carefully to read the card.  The card carried some instructions for me to follow, informing me of a clip in the bag with the flowers.  I was to take the clip to the bathroom with me at some point in the day and put it on my nipple, leaving it on for at least 1 minute but preferably 2.  Then put the clip on my clit for a minute.  I was going to have a very busy day with all the running to the ladies room I was going to do.  I took the clip with me and left it on my right nipple for 2 minutes.  It was difficult to leave it on that long and I broke out in a sweat.  But I did it.  Then I put it around my clit and left it for a minute.  Later in the afternoon I did my second 10 minutes for Erik.  By the time I left for the day I was more than a little aroused and in a fairly submissive state of mind.  After work Dom greeted me and offered me a glass of wine.  Pretty much insisted on it in fact.  I thought it was a bit odd, but rolled with it.  When I finished the wine he had me undress and led me into the gym where he had a chair with a pillow on it in the middle of the room.  Seating me he cuffed my hands to the chair with two sets of cuffs then blindfolded and gagged me, using a strip of duct tape for a gag.  I was very comfortable and very curious as to what was coming next.  What came next was he plugged up a work light that is very bright and quite hot.  I couldn't see the bright, but I could feel the heat and realized what it was.  Even with the air conditioner at my back I got hot in a hurry.    He sat down to my left and started talking.  Telling me he knew about Erik and that he wasn't as dumb as he obviously looked.  Explaining that he had figured out I had an online relationship of some sort and it was my carelessness in leaving something logged in that led him to the who of it.  He went on to describe how he had read Erik's blog (know your enemy stuff) and that he had even spoke with him on IM that morning.  Apparently at the same time I was talking to him.  He told me it wasn't the fact of the relationship that shocked and hurt him, it was the nature of the relationship.  That I was letting someone else dom me instead of coming to him with those desires.  This whole time he is talking my mind is racing, trying to see where this was going.  I have to say honestly that in spite of my position I wasn't all that scared.  I probably should have been, but I wasn't.  I wasn't particularly relieved either.  Just wondering what was going to come of it.  I didn't think he was going to throw me out but I couldn't be sure.  I briefly entertained the thought that maybe this was why the spanking got so intense last night, maybe he was punishing me in advance.  I was pretty resigned to the idea that I was going to have to give Erik up and had already entertained the idea myself.  I had thought that if our relationship was going to move in this direction that maybe I owed it to us to give it my whole attention, put all of myself into it.  So you can imagine my shock when he revealed he wanted to not only keep domming me himself, but he wanted me to continue submitting to Erik.  He asked me a bunch of yes/no questions I could answer by nodding or shaking my head.  Then he took the gag off and asked more questions.  Things like, when I was with him doing something Erik had instructed me to do, was I with him or with Erik.  I truthfully told him I was doing it because Erik said to, but I was with him.  I also told him that it just sort of came about, that I didn't go looking for even a relationship, much less a Dom.  And that I had denied the submissive in myself right up until we started chatting the first of the week.  I got a laugh out of him when I said that if it was any consolation I had fought Erik as hard as I had fought him on the few previous occasions when he tried to dom me.  He said thank god for Erik for getting me over that so he didn't have to.  I also told him I was still very confused by this person I apparently had inside me and that I didn't have a clue what she wanted or needed.  But that I was open to finding out.  I was told that if Erik wanted to share and continue our online relationship that I had to obey him and that he would punish me if I didn't.  I didn't get to talk to Erik until the next morning but obviously he did want to continue.  This wouldn't be my 2 Doms otherwise.  Before he let me go he jerked off into my mouth, using my mouth as nothing but a cum receptacle, not even letting me pleasure him.  We had sex that evening, not lovemaking.  He fucked me very hard and made me come several times.  I had to ask for each orgasm and wait until I was given permission.  Afterwards we talked some more.  Sharing some bad feelings, resentments and such.  I broke down and told him I couldn't keep being in so much control of everything, that I needed help.  I guess that is where some of this need for submission came from.  But not all of it.  And that can't explain the need and delight I take in the pain.  That's just part of who I am."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"I felt good driving to work. I felt a little bad for tormenting and using Anna so last night. But after waking her up by fingering her asshole, and fucking her mind while she did the required playing with herself without orgasm that Erik has her do each morning, and listning to her moan like a whore, I felt good. Good and vicious.  I stopped by a horse and tackle store on my way to work to look for somehitng nice to give to Anna. I know as well as Erik that after several days of teasing and our demanded chastity of her, she's ripe for pleasure. She's almost to the place that she will do anything, try anything, endure anything, to achieve that permission to orgasm.  While I was browsing a young guy walked up and asked if he could help me find something. I was in my mode, dark and firm and I flatly told him ""No thank you."" Now I don't know if he was suspicious of me being a shoplifter, or a pervert, but he had to push and find out so he asked me ""Are you looking for somehting for a horse?"" Never looking back at him I replied in a firm and confidnet tone, ""No."" immediately he went away....  But I noticed someone else in my periferal vision, at the opposite endcap where the dog food is. I turned my head to find an older, well seasoned looking woman staring at me. She had on the typical white trash cut offs and T shirts that prevail here and looked like an old shoe from too much suntanning. That and the fact she was a stick gave me no cause for a second glance.  I finished and moved on to leave. I bought a soda with this woman in line behind me, then following me out into the parking lot. I could feel her staring so I tured to face her with one of my patented ""hard looks"", expecting to see her looking at me like I was a freak (I get that a lot, it's a look I foster). Instead, to my surprise I find her with this look that says something closer to ""Please take me with you.""  Interesting. And novel."
9MOAJR2,female,34,"I'm finding I don't have enough time to keep this as current as I would like.  I'm kept so busy with everything-real life, work, submitting-that I'll suddenly find I haven't written anything for several days.  I'm going to quit stressing over it and just write when I have the time, or when I can steal a few minutes.  Let's catch up here.  Tonight Dom had to work and I haven't seen Erik online so I've just surfed the net and caught up my vanilla blog.    Last night I had an online session with Erik that got a little too intense.  Dom was home and became interested in what I was doing.  And came over to watch.  It's kind of unusual for Erik and I to play like that when Dom is home.  I have to confess that instead of being exciting it was distracting.  Maybe because I wasn't mentally prepared for both of them.  Maybe because I still feel a tinge of guilt over Erik.  Maybe because of half a dozen other things, I'm not really sure.  All I know is I couldn't get into or stay in my headspace like I usually can and had to call a halt to things.  I regret it, but I just kept getting more upset and finally asked to stop.  My evening ended in tears and an apology to Erik and one to Dom because Erik  wanted  him to watch and actually had plans for that.  *sigh*  Next time, maybe.  Tuesday afternoon was very enlightening.  After greeting Dom he brushed my hair and petted me a bit.  I felt restless, needy, but didn't know what I wanted.  I finally asked him to do something, anything he wanted, to make me feel like I was his.  I didn't mean to make it a test but I think that's how he saw it.  He tied me up in a modified hogtie and left to get something.  Coming back he told me not to move and put something on my back.  Because of the position I was in and my curviness, he had trouble finding a flat enough surface.  He finally did find one and he asked if I knew what it was.  I said I didn't but suspected it was either a candle or a glass of water.  Turns out it was a glass but it was empty.  Nice psych though.  He got the riding crop and teased me with it and then the phone rang.  It was my mom and he talked to her while fingering my ass.  It was a little difficult to keep quiet, especially when he handed me the phone with instructions to get rid of her and went back to enthusiastically stretching my ass.  I got off the phone quickly and was soon begging him to fuck my ass.  He was quite generous and let me have a toy to enjoy my missed orgasm (the one I didn't get Monday).  After begging for the toy of course.  And begging to come.  It was a very intense orgasm but I only got the one so I was left wanting more.  Which I'm sure was the point.  In any case, I did feel very much owned after that and quite submissive.  I don't think I was even as bratty as usual after an orgasm.  I'm sure Dom will correct me if I'm mistaken.  Monday night's punishment.  It was quite effective in getting my attention and definitely made me resolve to watch my tongue around my Doms.  But honestly it didn't have quite the intended results.  Not at first at least.  I had to cut short writing my lines because our power went out and when we went to bed Dom told me he was disappointed I didn't get to blog about the experience, that he was curious to see what I would write.  The next morning I got up and was still fuming so I decided that as soon as I got a chance at work, I would put down a post about it, but not what he wanted.  I knew what he wanted, he wanted to know how it made me feel and if I thought any differently.  Well I was going to be a brat and just write the details of what happened, with no mention of how I reacted to it.  Or maybe just say that yes, my attitude was different but no, my thinking wasn't.    I really couldn't say why I was so infuriated by it all.  Possibly because I'm not used to being punished for my failures.  I try so hard not to fail at anything and when I ever do slip up, I work extremely hard to fix it or make up for it.  In this case, that wasn't an option.  I know I didn't appreciate being punished for an opinion, I still don't know if I like that part of it or not.  And to make it all just a little more fun, I started my period Monday and was feeling really crappy.  We had lunch together and talked about how or if the little matter of my biology asserting itself was going to affect our play.  We decided to more or less do the same thing we are with most of this, play it by ear and see what felt right.  Dealing with cramps and the aftermath of my punishment, I passed on my chance to have an orgasm, even with the understanding that it might be several more days before I got another opportunity.  I just knew I wouldn't enjoy it.  I was too humiliated, too angry and too determined to be a brat.  Until I read what Dom  urlLink posted  about the evening.  It very nearly moved me to tears and did more to soften my thinking than the spanking or writing the lines did.  To see myself through his eyes like that was breath-taking.  It's something I am very rarely able to do, see myself as others do instead of in my own warped mirror.  I felt beautiful after reading that.  I may have to print it out and keep it posted close by (maybe next to the mirror) to read when I'm feeling unattractive.  Re-living the experience after reading that and Erik's comments both on here and to me personally I have a different post to write.  I understand how much love and frustration went into that spanking and how important it is to my Doms for me to have a better opinion of myself.  I feel gorgeous and cherished and very very loved and cared for, by two wonderful men.  I also owe them (and myself) an apology for dissing my looks. So to Dom and to Erik, I'm sorry for not appreciating your compliments and not taking them to heart.  And to Anna, I'm sorry for not loving you for your own uniqueness.  Sunday started off with a bit of a fright.  Dom had been out of town and I wasn't expecting him home until the early afternoon.  I had just got back into bed and dozed off after getting up to go to the bathroom.  I also undid the deadbolt, just in case.  He had told me the night before that if he could get an early start he might slip in and surprise me.  But I really didn't expect him to, certainly not as early as he did.  So I was dozing with a cat curled up beside me when all of a sudden there was a hand over my mouth and a body behind me.  It gave me a big start.  He had slipped into the house completely silently and had a stocking over his head.  He then proceeded to ""rape"" me.  Tying my hands behind my back with a curtain tieback was a nice touch.  He wore a condom like a good rapist, leaving no evidence behind, and used his leather belt on me when I struggled.  It was exciting and I think I can look forward to a more intense repeat in the future.    Sunday afternoon we went shopping and bought me some feminine things to lounge around the house in instead of my usual tee shirts and shorts.  I bought a couple of camisoles and a lace trimmed tank top and some sheer cheeky panties and lacy ones to match the tops.  I tried on one last night, a hot pink cami and black sheer panties with hot pink polka dots and trim.  Dom was quite impressed and I did feel pretty in it.   We went to Hot Topic at the mall too and got a few accessories.  These  urlLink bracelets  really make me feel like I belong to somebody when I wear them.  I like.  I picked out a wristband for Dom that looked appropriate to me.  Couldn't find a pic of it though.  Saturday was more or less a day to myself.  Went and splurged on a pedicure and manicure and treated myself to my favorite lunch.  Dom was out of town and I didn't catch up with Erik.  Saturday evening I spoke with Dom on the phone but we kept getting interrupted so we didn't get to do a phone scene like he wanted.  Friday night I had a pretty intense session with Erik via IM.  He is amazingly good at controlling me thru the computer.  He makes me want to do whatever he tells me to do, just because he wants it.  I guess that's what a good Dom does though, huh?"
V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind    Well a few things, which are detailed below,… but I am also thinking of getting a new set of gym clothes. My Husky pants have a dryer hole In the leg, and It is just staring at me when ever I go on the leg machines. I bring my legs forward, the hole gets bigger.. push legs away, hole gets smaller… It Is really distracting when I am trying to count and not worry about the state of my pants.    Crap of the day    Well another exciting day In the saga of Kira-hood. I mentioned that Kira was all sick and fevery and whatnot right? Well, I went to pick her up from daycare yesterday (Wednesday) and she had SPOTS all over her body!! So the first thing I think Is?? Chicken pox’s of course. But this looked different, and she wasn’t Itchy. So I took her to the hospital (couldn’t get Into see my doctor again) and the doctor there told me she had fifth disease. I freaked out Initially (lets face It, a doctor tells you your child has a disease, you aren’t exactly suppose to be calm.), but he explained that It Is a strain of Strep and that she was In the end of the cycle. Apparently kids get this all the time, and why It Is called fifth disease Is because they have a fever for four to five days, and then break out IN a rash on the fifth day. So she isn’t contagious or anything (she was some time last week haha) and she can go back to daycare tomorrow.  Another thing we were talking to this doctor about Is Kira’s nasty cough. I explained that It comes on almost every night, and some times during the day. And when she gets a little sick, It sounds like we have a smoker In the house again her cough Is so bad. He told us that It could be one of three things, one: nothing to worry about It was just saliva from teething. Two: Some normal non-growth In the sphincter that will adjust Itself as she grows older, or Three It’s Asthma and/or allergies. If It Is the third, then the next time she gets all coughy we have to bring her Into see our doctor and get her air way checked while she Is being affected by the cough. Then we would be able to rule It out. Now, I know my grandfather had asthma and Marks brother does from allergies, so this could very well be a possibility. I was only pissy about this for the first moment when I thought about Kayes reason to still breastfeed, and that was to decrease her babies chance of asthma since she has It. I felt really bad for about twenty minutes, but It passed, and I am sure she will be fine and me deciding to feed her Instead of starving her was the best route. I just needed a moment of clarity.  I also had a strange and awful day at work yesterday. I was being jerked around by two managers, who were fighting between them selves and getting me caught In the middle. Have I mentioned that I hate my job, and I hate people?? Ya. Anyways, these two Idiots, after fucking up my whole day had the audacity to start trying to tell me what to do and why their way was ultimately way more superior than the other… I don’t really react well to monkey In the middle, so I just put down my little clip board and said  “Listen, I have no Idea what your job Is, but I know what mine Is. It doesn’t Include listening to a couple of children fighting over who Is the boss and who’s Ideas are better than who’s. So I tell you what, you both can go do your own thing and leave me the hell out of It, I have work to do!!”  Well as you may have guessed this mad for a really bad afternoon, and I mean BAD. So when Joesephine came IN today and offered me a job at A&W I really considered It. Joesephine used to work with me @ Tim’s a few years ago, and Is now the manager of the A&W on the west end and makes a good salary with benefits. She told me she would hire me on at my rate of pay at Tim’s, and be eligible for a raise In three months. So I don’t know, It’s still the same shit, so I am hesitant. But I can tell you that I don’t need to be Involved IN the crap that Is going on at my work… and It Isn’t about to get easier there. I know this for a fact. Something to think about, and a way out If I need.  I went to Curves ® today too, and boy did I go hard on those leg pully-uppy-thingys. My thighs are so sore right now I feel like a jello mold. I was talking to this girl who works there though, and we had a really good conversation about music and just what life was like ‘when we were young’. I was telling her about these clubs I went to In Edmonton, and how fun It was just to dance and dance, no cares or worries. Now It’s like “hhmm… dance until 8am?? Who Is going to watch my child all day so I can sleep, then work to pay for the watching of the child, then do all the laundry all that other stuff requires..” lol. I am just too old for that now. I will just have to settle for listening to my music at a dull roar. Hahaha    The Silver Lining    Kira has three more weeks to go before she can get the chicken ox vaccination.. so this was a scare, but she might make It!!    Something Amusing To Me    The first person killed in an airplane accident was Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge. On September 17, 1908, Selfridge was a passenger with Orville Wright, in a demonstration flight at Fort Myer, Virginia, when the crash occurred. Wright survived the crash. The first pilot of a powered airplane to be killed was Eugène Lefèbvre in France, on September 7, 1909.  Everything bad seems to happen In September. I actually changed my birthday to November 2nd like seven years ago… never caught on. Well, actually a hurricane called hurricane MITCH passed through south America and killed like a ba-jillion people on the first celebration of my new b-day, so I just took It as a sign not to mess with mother nature."
V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind    Kira Isn’t drinking much formula anymore, but the doc says she’s fine. I just wonder how little formula Is really okay…    Crap of the day    Well today I remembered what the heck my job was, and fully outdid myself. I took over where ever, I pounded out orders, I fixed broken stuff, changed tills over and managed to stay In total control. Now my back hurts so bad I could cry, and my feet feel like I have run for a week. I desperately need to get back Into the ‘shape’ I was before I went on leave. I just don’t know how I did this day after day and not fall over from complete pain. Or maybe I should just say fuck It and get a desk job heh heh .  Mark Is going through ‘discussions’ with his boss about promotions and transfers and stuff… so I have no Idea where we sit now. We might end up here for a while longer, we might not. Nothing has really been said one way or the other… but we have always been aware of the possibility of a transfer Into the city. Well Into either cities really (Calgary or Edmonton), both have district office headquarters. I am not so crazy about Calgary though, so If we were to go anywhere I would prefer to go to Edmonton.   Now that we have a child though, I just don’t know If we are city material. I mean nothing against big cities, but the scare the bejesus out of me. I just know It has advantages In some ways, like big cities have a ton of resources and different mainstreams of educational facilities. More clubs (children’s organizations), more events, more everything. And later It would be better for self esteem (this Is totally a theory) because she wouldn’t be scared to go out Into the world because she grew up In a big place already. I just find that I diminish a lot of opportunities (or I had In the past) just because I was scared… and that came from small town thinking. But everything Is still way up In the air, and we are just talking In ”what If’s”.  Tonight I have a few loads of laundry to tend too, and I think It Is Thursday… ya.. so Big Brother Is on. That Diane, what a fucking moron!! I wanted to slap her the other night for not stuffing Jaces piggy FULL of those coins with her face on ‘em!!! Man, that guy just pisses me off, he’s an Idiot and an ass, I would like to see him go. BUT Adria and Natalie should both be IN the house after today… hahaha… that’s going to be great!!! Yet another little bend In the horseman plot!! OH!!! And Diane putting Marvin up?? Did she not HEAR Adria tell her NOT to do that because she would indeed be doing EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED??? Idiot. She deserves to go to.  Other then that, I can’t remember what the hell else Is on TV…. I know I will be In front of It ALL night though, lying down resting my poor broken back. Maybe I will call It a night with a few perkacet and Traditional Ale…lol.  As If… but I might try and find the robaxacet, Seriously people, why do we do this to ourselves???     The Silver Lining    Ummm, I’m not working right now, and I get to go to bed. That’s all I got.    Something Amusing To Me    Computers and hard drives aren't as fragile as they were a few years ago, but you're asking for trouble if you move your PC around while it is running. While your computer is running, its hard disk is very vulnerable. A tiny magnet literally floats less than a hair's breadth above a platter where data is stored. A minor bump can send the magnet skittering into the disk's surface. The damage can't be repaired. Not only will you need a new hard disk, but you'll likely lose the information the disk held.  ~I never knew this, I guess I just figured my mom was right and there were a fleet of tiny little elves doing all the work transcribing and whatnot… ya, I like that version better."
V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind     Two more weeks until I go back to work... feels like a sentence in the electric chair...       Reminds me of...      urlLink http://www.aetv.com/global/listings/series_showcase.jsp?EGrpType=Series&Id=11013914&NetwCode=AEN    This link goes to the A&E site.. I was reading in someone else's journal about this.. It is about polygamy and the roles the people take in the Mormon societies that the polygamous people take... I thought this was weird for two reasons:   a) I have never heard of morning doing something so outland-ish (and I am sure most don't practice this) and,   b) polygamy in any place is just a hastle in my head.  Back into my point... I thought It was funny because It reminded me of a conversation I had with my youngest brother when he was around 6 years old (I amm 11 years older than him, so life was interesting), this is pretty much how it went:  ""Mich, what's a lesbian?""  ""Well, It's two women who love each other like Mommy and Daddy do.""  pause for a minute.... ""I don't get it..???""  ""Well what don't you get about it?'  another pause... ""Well I don't get why any man would want to marry TWO women instead of one.. that sounds like trouble...""  I just about lost it with laughter... "" No, no, no, that is BIGAMY!!! No, they are only with themselves, no men there, just two people""  ""OHHHH.. like you and Amber?""  ""Oh my god no!!!!... MOMMMMM WARREN NEEDS YOUUUUU.....""   Seriously, this was one of the best examples I can show to NOT let your teenager answer life questions!! It was funny as hell though and my mom was in a whirlwind of questions after that one!       Crap of the day     I spent most of the weekend with my stepfather and brother. We went to the exhibition on Saturday and got eaten alive by the hordes of mosquitoes that love my nice Caucasian blood. Baby was totally safe within her net and bug spray (on her clothes), so I t was like they came to feast on the 'new' blood and settled for me!! I hate mosquito's... they serve no purpose in this world, we should eradicate them. Really. I read somewhere that If we lost three species of bugs It wouldn't change the ecosystem one bit because of the number of other bugs that other things eat... nothing eats mosquito's exclusively (which sucks), so they should be the first to go in my book. I am trying desperately to not think every time I feel a little queasy that I have not contracted west Nile disease, and that I am just being a hypocondriac. This is not working of course, and I go around saying I have this disease even though I would SO be dead by now.   We also went for a long drive yesterday.. we were suppose to go and visit my aunt in St.Wahlburg, but she ended up getting her days crossed and was out in the afternoon. So we decided to drive to the town monuments that were around us.. In  urlLink Turtleford  we went and saw the big concrete turtle, and in  urlLink Paradise HIll  we saw the huge Ox & Cart. I just like to see these things.. plus I getto take pictures of my baby next to strange objects!! I have to take her to  urlLink Vilna , they have the worlds largest mushrooms.. and they are so cute!! There are three mushrooms colorful painted, you just feel like Alice in Wonderland and think you should be seeing a pot smoking caterpillar!!! Awesome. Among some other oddity's there is  urlLink Glendon  with the worlds largest pyrogy,  urlLink Vegriville  with the worlds largest Pysanka (Ukrainian Easter egg) and  urlLink St.Paul  with their U.F.O. landing pad!!! I love these weird places.   This morning I was woken up by a HUGE thunder and lighting storm!!! It was so bright outside and so loud I was freaked... but the baby? Slept all the way through!! Weirdo. I went downstairs to check the weather warnings (paranoid much?) and luckily there were no tornado warnings for the area. I was a little skeptical because although there was lots of thunder and lightning, there was NO rain at all. Dry lightning scares me big time, especially since this one day when Mark, Ken and I lived in Edmonton off 118th Ave somewhere... we were watching this nasty storm of no rain and funnel clouds when this bolt of lightning struck on the road right infront of the apartment building!! We were thrown back from the intensity of the light and the thunder crack.. and when we (and about a hundred other people) went to look out our balcony, there was a huge crack in the pavement and smoke and scorch marks!! It was the scariest but coolest sightings I have ever seen!       The Silver Lining     I have to buy another fan, so I gt to go to Wal~Mart!!

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind       You know what i hate the most?? When I have a really good story to tell, and I go to my keyboard, and it just vanishes from my head. I really really hate that. I was talking to Kaye on the msn messenger and I specifically didn't reply to something she said with the the beginning of said forgotten story.. and now I can't think for the life of me what the hell we were talking about in that particular moment.  Bitch about housework.. check.  Bitch about lack of time... check.  Bitch about barney... check.  See, I have no idea.          Reminds me of...    ""You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.""  Joe E Lewis.  This reminded me of the 'good ol days' when i used to think my drinking was a normality.. you know because you should logically be able to down two two-sixes before you are completely hammered..       Crap of the day       So I decided after talking with Brian that I actually didn't like the previous format for this page.. so I am trying something else for headers. I don't know If I like this one either... but maybe It will be more relevant to the topics I choose to discuss. Then again It could make things look too choppy and non-interesting.. so we will see.     Oh my goodness, I actually remember the story I was going to tell that I totally lost in the nether regions of my brain!! Kaye and I were talking about her mother-in-law coming to town and all the cleaning she has to do. Well I was going to tell her this little story that gave me a good laugh :  It was September of 1998, and as you may or may not know my birthday is on the 18th. Well my mother had told me that she was going to send a large-ish parcel down for my birthday, and for Mark to go and pick it up for me because she was unable to wrap it and wanted it to be a surprise. So I had agreed and put Mark on the phone to iron out the details with my mom, and basically forgot about it. Well it was two nights before my birthday and I was fast asleep when I heard this really loud noise... I woke up to Mark vacuuming the living room, and the apartment looked SPOTLESS. As you can well imagine I was in a state of total shock and disbelief..  so I asked ""why are you cleaning the house at 1am?""  ""um.. i couldn't sleep..""  ""you couldn't sleep.. and you chose to clean??""  ""...um, ya... um... right""  So I stood there, jaw on the floor, until i figured it out. My mom was coming. At that moment I was laughing so hard I thought I would pee all over Marks nicely moped floor!!! I kid you not, Mark had never met my mother before this so it was a first time meet PLUS, he knows how angry I would have been if my mother showed up and my house was a disaster!! That was the day I decided I was concrete on marrying that man! Anyways, it was really funny to me & just thought I would share.     What else did I want to talk about?? I lost my train of thought again from remembering the thing I forgot.. and now I am forgetting the thing I was about to share because I figured out the other story... grrraahhh!!! Well, maybe I will remember and tomorrows post will be that much better to enjoy!!             The Silver Lining       The dog stayed outside ALL day today and didn't bark at every little thing that moved!!

Poof! God gave him a rowboat and strong  arms and strong legs and he was able to row across in about an hour after  almost capsizing once.     Seeing what happened to the first two men, the third man prayed, ""God,  please give me the strength, the tools and the intelligence to cross this  river.""

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind        We went to the fair today, and I actually saw a 'slight of hand' trick but couldn't get my brain to register it for almost half an hour... I tell you, those carnies are quick and evil.                       Reminds me of..      Michelene: Your writing style reflects that you like things to be neat and orderly, and that you generally follow the rules necessary to keep things clear.   hmmm.. no way!!!LOL.. Like that was a big secret huh!!   Michelene: Freud would say your strongest unconscious conflict stems from events that happened when you were a Toddler.   He would also conclude that relative to others, your personality today is moderately affected by the events of your childhood. It appears that your biggest unconscious conflict that still afflicts you stems from what Freud defined as the anal stage of development that occurred when you were between a year and a half and three years old. Freud would say that this conflict can manifest in your personality by giving you a tendency to be especially orderly or clean, or ""retentive."" You may also harbor a strong rebellious streak. This normally happens when parents toilet-train a child on some kind of schedule, rather than at the child's natural pace and the child naturally reacts by struggling for their autonomy and the legitimacy of their needs.     Freud defined five psychosexual developmental stages that everyone goes through on their way from infancy to adolescence. And each of those stages is associated with adult personality traits. At each stage, we all had to overcome certain ""conflicts"" or hurdles as we learned new skills and developed relationships with others. No one gets through all five stages without having trouble with at least one of them. And it's this unresolved ""trouble"" that Freud encouraged people to travel back to, recognize, and overcome.   For all these tests you can get a free membership and get the gist of things here : urlLink http://web.tickle.com       Crap of the day      Well.. So the consensus seems to be that the on-line test world thinks I am neat and orderly!! Well I admit I am a bit freakish with that.. .but not totally neurotic! I swear!! Although I have been getting worse and worse In my old age.. hahaha. I found the hand writing test to be hard, It was like not close to my writing really so I just sorta said none of the above to a lot of categories. I write pretty much straight up and down, no slants and kinda big-ish. I also prefer to print than to write.. but writing is so lazy and flowey that I end up doing that instead!! I do like my signature.. Especially since I have been married. I think my name change gave me more confidence in my identity (screwy I know, but hey with a last name like Rasch - you can see it), so my signature became more ledgibile and pretty. I mean, It's not like the best in the world.. okay maybe I think it is.. but it is good now!!   When I first got married I was always conscience in  making the effort to sign my name with Marks last name.. and it was rough, but I was diligent and it worked. However.. I overlooked on little detail that I didn't catch until someone pointed it out to me TWO years later.. when ever I was required to initial something, I was still initialing MR, not MK!!! A girl I worked with asked me If my K's just looked like R's.. but no, it was a slip up! I couldn't believe it! So I went back into things I initial all the time ( I had to initial my pay check to say I got it from Smittys, and I also used to initial bills that I had payed so Mark wouldn't pay it twice). and sure enough, there it was, MR. I laughed and was so embarrassed!! I asked Mark why he never bothered to tell me, and he just thought they were messy K's too!! SO this whole time I was making what people thought were messy K's and I had no clue!! I felt like such an idiot.. and sharing this story actually doesn't help that.. but hey, It was a story.        The Silver Lining        Kira watched her first fireworks show!

How can one little girl come with so many accessories?? hahaha     Something Amusing To Me     The word ""toast,"" meaning a wish of good health, started in ancient Rome, where a piece of toasted bread was dropped into wine.  Those Romans always knew how to make everything theirs... Even the booze!     Crap of the day     Well, It has actually cooled off a fair bit here. Thank the gods, I was really getting sick of the melting weather. I mean, I like nice weather, but I am satisfied with a nice comfy +18 hahaha! Most people still consider that spring.. But hey, If you lived north, you know that is summer!!I am glad It was nice enough for Kira to go swimming in her little wading pool though, she is so cute crawling around in there and splashing!! Next year Mark and I discussed we would buy ourselves an above ground pool for our six year wedding anniversary. We were going to buy It this year, but where we had JUST planted the grass seed and whatnot, we just didn't think that the ground would hold up. Plus we didn't have a patio set yet, so we bought that this year for our anniversary.Sure we bought it in June, but hey, who buys patio furniture in the end of August?? hahaha   My dog is certifiable today... She is pacing back and forth, back and forth. I have no idea why.. I ask If she wants out, nothing. I ask If she wants a treat, nothing. I ask what she wants, nothing (heh heh). I'm telling you, she has gone crazy. Wonder If the pressure systems in the air are changing.. that I heard makes dogs all funny because It pops their ears. I don't know... she's just nuts. Marks turtle is being stranger than usual today too though.... hmmm, maybe I have like mercury leak or something.... I should probably look into that!! HAHA     So I was surfing the web and just random journals, when I came across this page on  urlLink Borderline Personality Disorder . I almost shit a brick. Did you know what the symptoms are on this?? I will tell you ;  Individuals with BPD have several of the following symptoms:    marked mood swings with periods of intense depression, irritability, and/or anxiety lasting a few hours to a few days;  inappropriate, intense, or uncontrolled anger;  impulsiveness in spending, sex, substance use, shoplifting, reckless driving, or binge eating;  recurring suicidal threats or self-injurious behavior;  unstable, intense personal relationships with extreme, black and white views of people and experiences, sometimes alternating between ""all good"" idealization and ""all bad"" devaluation;  marked, persistent uncertainty about self-image, long term goals, friendships, and values;  chronic boredom or feelings of emptiness; and  frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, either real or imagined.  You know what I called this unknowing that it was a disease?? Teenage-hood. Yep, that and just learning to be your own person. I couldn't believe this... Seriously I was taken a back by this because I was, oh I don't know, eight out of eight for these things at one point in my life!!! Of course now all the voices in my head have merged so that I only freak out on occasion... But seriously, this stuff is all just life... Right??

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On the recommendation of another person’s journal ( urlLink Nance ), I am attempting to make an appropriate ‘about me’ section. Instead of having all in the little side bar there, I decided to make an entry and just reference It In the side bar, much cleaner.  SO with that, I will start with the basics:   Name : Michelene (no last name, I don’t know you If you don’t know this, so forget that!!)   Age : 27, soon to be 28 In September   Sex : Female   Children : one daughter who Is 11 months old, will be a year In September   Marital Status : Definitely Married to my husband of five years, Mark.   Residence :  urlLink Alberta , Canada (my town is WAY to small to mention.. something like If you asked where I lived they would give you directions from Tom’s house)   Occupation : Well right now I am a stay at home mom, but that will be ending very shortly, as a matter of fact this Tuesday. Then I will be back at work,  urlLink Tim Horton ’s, where I am a supervisor.  So there are the bare bones, nice and simple. Now for the rambling.  My life Is really quite relaxed now. We (my family) don’t tend to do any really outlandish things, we like to stay home and watch movies or TV. Occasionally we will go on a small road trip Into the city and peruse the mall and visit friends or family (they are weird though and usually worth a mention In the pages!). A few of our favorite TV shows are: Big Brother, Survivor, Nip/Tuck, CSI, Gilmore Girls, Sex In the City, and Becker. We have a whole list of favorites that don’t air anymore, and I know Becker Is one of those but we have only started watching It this year so It’s new to us!!  Being a first time mom, there Is always something new to add In any post. Kira Is my joy, and she fills my days of laughter and tears!! She Is almost a year old now, and we are just starting to see the little person Inside of her. She Is definitely making her mark on those around her, and becoming a curious toddler. Right at the moment we are working on her walking skills, she can walk around things and crawl really well, but she hasn’t mastered walking on her own yet. Something I think she will get Into from daycare, seeing the other kids walking around will motivate her.  I am married, as mentioned above. Mark and I were married In August of 1999. We didn’t want to wait until the year 2000 because It was a different century… One of those oddball things about us. We generally get along really well, but like all people we have our quips. We enjoy spending time with our friends, playing D&D, and a game called Talisman.  We also love the  urlLink Outback Restaurant , and would choose  urlLink McDonalds  over any other fast food. Some of the things we don’t do together are: Play cards (Mark hates them), Read the same magazines, Dance at  clubs (though I have not gone to one since I was pregnant, and trying to find an age appropriate one Is becoming to much of a hassle), and Play computer games (He is an  urlLink AC  junky, I like to play regular not on-line games like the  urlLink Sims  or  urlLink Age of Empires ).  I have a roommate, have had this same roommate for YEARS. Longer then I have been married actually. He Is really a nice guy and has his intricacies,  and I bitch a fair amount about him. I do value his friendship though, and just get squawking about stuff around the house, which Is totally normal. Right now I guess technically we are his roommates, he bought this house last year and we pay half of everything so that It Is a co-ownership. He Is totally trustworthy though, so you don’t need to e-mail me about how doing business with friends Is trouble. Plus, he knows If he screwed me over I would just introduce him to my uncles friends, Smith & Wesson.  I have graduated high school (ten years ago now) and I have attended college. Never completed college, I had to work and was way to broke to continue. Then by the time I was able to go back I was to Involved with my personal life and just lost Interest. Now I regret not doing anything with my education, but I have no regrets on what I choose to do Instead. I choose to work my tail off, and have a fun whirlwind of a life, which I think was a needed venture for me to grow as a person. A lot has happened to me/around me In the past ten years that I have changed my whole life I’m still the same person, just happy about being me. I guess that’s all you can ask for In life really.  Now a few other miscellaneous likes and dislikes:    I like to read, but haven’t had the time In the past little while (having a baby will do that to your time).  I like to scrapbook, and have one finished for Kira’s first 6 months of life, on started from 6months to 1 year, and another of general stuff and family.  I love to type,  so keeping an on line journal fits right Into my life.  I love to dance, but not to country *shudder *, I think country Is vile and should be eradicated.  I  hate politics, but find I am gaining more Interest In It as the years go by.  I hate doing dishes, that Is the one chore I will bitch about on a daily basis, and never get tired of bitching about.  I love my family and friends, and they are all very supportive of my endeavors and me.  I generally don’t swear a whole lot, but once or twice In a post Is typical. I don’t swear at all around my baby, and obviously that means I need a release now and again. I think It’s more appropriate to type my venting In a journal rather than take It out on my daughter. I don’t find It difficult to cut out of my vocabulary, but typing It sure seems to get the point across a lot better than saying ‘darn’ or ‘friggin’. So I won’t apologize for the verbal bashing, but just a warning for those who don’t like It, It’s here, deal.  I am not all that witty, nore am I deep and profound. I just type stuff when the mood strikes me and just like to backtrack on my thoughts some times. You may find that some days I just don't make any sense at all, but trust me, In the end It will make sense to me and I will answer any questions that aren't too personal.   I think that’s about It for me, I suppose If you want to know anything else, or think I should add something to this you can e-mail me at  urlLink xmichra@hotmail.com  ."
V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind    I am wondering If the new dental office In town bills the patient or the insurance company.. I have a gaping hole In my tooth now (lost a filling) so I am In agony but can’t really afford the extra bill this month since the drivers ed thing was $420.    Crap of the day    I suppose I will start out on how my drivers training went… and I even made a bullet of points during the time there so I wouldn’t forget to mention anything lol!!! The first thing that I feel I MUST start out with Is this: how the hell do pre-pubescent boys live with their stench?? Please help me out on this one. I sat IN that damn room for TWO DAYS smelling that onion crossed with gym sock smell!!!  As a responsible parent you should not let your child walk out of the house smelling like an unearthed creature. You just shouldn’t. Now, having said that about the boys, the girls are just as bad with their seven dollar bottle of perfume practically Oozing from every pore!!!  I tell ya, I do not miss being a teenager for a second.  Okay, a few other annoyances (man am I ever getting old!!)… gum smacking!!! I HATE HATE HATE that constant crack of gum from behind you.. It Is so hard to concentrate! I swear, If Kira ever does that while I am In her vicinity, she Is getting the gum tore out of her mouth, scrubbed onto a very dirty surface and shoved back In!!! Well, I probably wouldn’t do that to her… but she will have to get out of my car and walk, which might actually end up being worse punishment anyways. Along with the nasty gum smacking hoodlum was the vibrating skitterish shit head RIGHT BEHIND MY SEAT, so of course he was fucking up my chair comfort!!! Then next to him was this creepy dude that should not only be way far away from any roads, but people too… this guy was seriously screwy and was telling his mother to “Shut the fuck up mom, I need to drive your shitty car so I can get the hell away from you and your fuck buddy”. So sweet. Rage issues will most certainly not be In his future… oh no…!!!  But enough of the bitching. I was amazed at how freaky-similar this was to every day high school In my teenage-hood. I walked Into the classroom, and immediately I went to the third seat on the right hand side of the room. Felt like the first day I walked Into Mr.Bowden’s English ten class.  It didn’t really strike me as something ironic until I started to look around at the “type”  of kids In that class and where they were all sitting. The idiot guys who had no buddies were all staggered In the class, the four guys who were friends were In a group off to the left hand back corner, there was a shy long haired girl up In the middle front taking notes (the only one besides me doing so), a brother and sister who were on opposite sides of the front of the class, and a girl who sat next to me with the awful bottle of exclamation or other such perfume on.  And all I could think was this was really normal. It has been twelve years since I was In Mr.Bowden’s class, and It felt like It was yesterday. Freaky I tell you.  All In all I think I have learned a fair bit. A few things I wasn’t aware off, but for the most part It was like a refresher of the stuff I studied In my learners. I am a little anxious to get the driving part out of the way (another 10 hours), but I am not as apprehensive. Mainly due to the fact that the car I will be In Is a Ford Focus 2003, and my Mother-In-Law owns one of those and let me drive It all weekend!! HAHA!!! So I at least know where the heck all the controls and gauges are!! Still a little freaked about having to drive Into the Cold Lake area because I don’t know It at all… but I am sure I will be fine.  The deer In that area are really bad though, and I saw quite a few In the ditches (both alive and dead). The worst thing that could happen to me on that road Is to hit another deer. I would never drive there again. Mark and I hit a deer On that road a few years ago, when we still had the Mercury Topaz… man did that ever do a ton of damage and hurt like hell. You never know how fast those blasted things can run In front of your car, right from a ditch you could have sworn you should have been able to see a seven foot tall creature In!! I hate wildlife, It scares me. This other time we drove   thru   this deer that had been hit by a semi and was severed In half on either side of the road. I puked so bad from that… the squishy noises and the bones..***EEWWWW **** I am getting nauseous thinking of It.  BUT, I did get to spend some time with Kira not having to worry about supper or cleaning or anything else!! Mark’s parents took really good care of us this weekend, and I feel much more relaxed then I think I would have had I’d taken the course In town next month. Also, Mark’s mommy cooks WAY better than I do!!! * Yum!!*    The Silver Lining    One step closer to a license, and didn’t do a single dish for three days.

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"On my Mind     It's only Tuesday, and I am already having a really shitty week.     Reminds me of...     ""Imagine if every Thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them the usual way. This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of complaining."" Jeff Raskin.   AS you can well imagine I was having computer troubles *shock* and stumbled upon this one. Oh, and Brian, thanks for the virus scan link, worked wonders!!!     Crap of the day     I spent the better part of yesterday morning calling around to registry offices and driver education facilities to be told essentially that I can't take my license yet without it costing a few thousand dollars or not till September. Let me explain. See, I was all gun-hoe about getting my license and yadda yadda yadda, well Mark thought It would be a good Idea to check with the insurance company If our Insurance would be jacked up to an absorbent amount of money. We were Informed that If I didn't complete a drivers education couse I wasn't even insurable with our current company... which Mark has works really hard at getting his premiums lowered for the past 6 years. Anyways, we ask If we can go through a different company, and call around only to find out that If we switched Marks rate would go up another 50 bucks a month, and I would end up paying almost 340 dollars in insurance because I don't have the drivers education course that is now required in Alberta. SOOOO, I call the driver education places in the area and find out that they don't offer courses until the high schools start up and then they wait until enough students want to take the course to fill the class. SO I have to wait until all the kiddies get their shit together ask mommy and daddy and then I can go learn how to turn on a signal light and change my own fucking oil. I was so impressed.... I almost killed someone today. I was talking to my mother-in-law though, and she has hooked me up with a number for another driving school in Bonnyville. It is out of the way, but hey, I will do it If It gives me my license.     *sigh*... so in other more happy news, Kira did two things that I am totally proud of!! She is waving hello/good-bye now, and she figured out the shape blocks and putting them in the right holes!! She is a frickin genius I tell ya!! I was so proud, we have been working on these things the past two weeks and she totally gets it now. I am really happy that she did this before daycare too.. so I get to see It and be the one who taught her. She also learned something not so cute.. she bit me today. I gave her a smack on the bum (which is of course layer with diaper padding) which shocked her more than anything.. but I hope she doesn't become a biter... or I might have to resort to mean and nasty things, I have no idea what those things are, I just know It can be done!

V0ZIU4L,female,27,"Just a pic of the road to Bonnyville. I enjoyed the sun being red, and not burning my retna's out.        On my Mind    I had a dream last night, I had another baby (a girl) and she was on the change table at the daycare Kira attends. She was all alone and undressed, waiting for someone to attend to her. And I couldn’t move, and as soon as she saw me she started to happily coo and scramble her way off the table to me. She fell off the table Into the biggest pit I have ever seen and vanished. I know I was crying because I could feel my chest throb, but I was Immobile. What do you think this means??    Crap of the day    You know what I value now that kids just don’t get?? Quiet time. It’s so funny, I would really like to know what age kids are before they learn a quiet room and a book are like “gods” way of saying life Is good!! For me I simply can’t remember when that age was. I am not sure If It was an evolution of thought process on the matter, or If It just happened In one fell swoop. Another thing I value now that wasn’t so big on the priority list? Reading. I am so happy that I get my measly half hour of reading time all to me. I don’t care If It has to be at work, and I am glad that It Isn’t taking away from my baby fun time, so I can honestly say this would be the one thing I love about my job. Of course It’s not a paid break, that would make It 100% better… but hey, can’t win ‘em all.  So I went for my first two hour driving session today, and It actually wasn’t bad. I thought I was just going to be a nervous wreak and fuck things up royally, but Instead It was fairly calming, and I did well!! I was told, by a professional driving Instructor, that I drove very well!! YAY!!! So I guess I wasn’t all that bad. I do however need to learn to parallel park (haven’t EVER done It) so I do that next weekend, and I had to learn not to “dry steer” , which s turning your wheel when you are not moving the car. Apparently she has never met a person that didn’t do this, and that’s one of the marks on the driving tests that 99.9% of people get a point deduction for. So I have to work on that.  I also have my next four sessions all next weekend. Saturday and Sunday at 10am and 3pm for two hours each. This will take care of my whole ten hour requirement, and hopefully after that I will have my certification and get my damn license. I am also trying to book my drivers road test for the Monday (the 23rd), so I MIGHT be running over pedestrians next week! YAY!! Ohhhh.. the power of the laminated license!!!  Kira had a rough day today.. well so did we all. We got Into a “mini accident” today on the road between Bonnyville and Glendon. This dump truck ( I think Is what It was) had a malfunction In It’s back door, so all this gravel came POURING out of the truck INTO MY WINDSHIELD!!!! It sounded awful, couldn’t tell you what It looked like cuz I did the whole duck and cover thing (good thing Mark was driving heh!). But, our windshield was pelted with rock punctures, splits and sniggers, PLUS one went right through, and there was glass on my dashboard!!! SO Mark went and got the guy, talked to the boss of the company and we are getting all damages paid for by them. Thank god, because I was livid, and having Kira IN the car while this happened was not fun. She freaked because we were screaming and saying “fuck” a lot… so It was a trauma to us all. I swear, the more I drive that particular road, the more I don’t want to be there. It’s just nuts. Deer, gravel, country bumpkins, tractors, quads. It just sucks on that road.   .  The Silver Lining    After forgetting the name of a book I wanted to pick up for my step-father this Christmas.. I finally remembered It and I would recommend It to anyone!! It’s called Villains by Necessity by Eve Forward. But don’t try to get It at Amazon.com, apparently one guy has a copy and It Is selling for 85 bucks cndn!!!    Something Amusing To Me   Another thing I saw that was funny:                                               If women ruled the world        Myth:  The Vikings believed that the Northern lights which are seen from time to time in the north sky were caused by the flashing armor and spears of Odin's handmaidens as they rode  out to collect warriors slain in battle.~ This was just a nifty little stumbling, since I lived amongst northern lights for so long and never knew this particular Myth on It. Funny how you take for granted things you have all the time. I miss the lights…"
MMSPFVE,male,23,"Today I had enough time to spend some on creating this new weblog. Inspired by Gary and Piyush Sarode, I decided to open my mind in public. Coincedentally, last night i was watching a movie or some series ""Ed TV"", in it that guy Ed has signed a contract with some TV channel to allow them to live telecast his day-to-day life...and how this whole stuff turns into a nightmare for him and his family.       I was just thinking, isn't this weblog a kind of very initial stage of the same mentality? I am seeing how making personal things public is in trend nowadays, specially in the advanced countries. I will not criticize it, but would try to understand the psychological process behind that.... oh oh yes, you got it right. I have an inclination towards psychology and always try to find a rational behind each and everything happening around me, related to human behavior in particular. You won't believe that I with one of my friend Maneesh spent days in identifying and quantifying the factors affecting human behavior, and as you can imagine very soon we realized that its beyond our scope, and with that realization the modern civilization had to continue without a biggest breakthru in this field. Don't get disappointed its there in my todo list after my retirement. ;-)       Now, lets bring our focus back to the rational(s) behind the weblogging. I am trying to list a few very obvious ones first, with the course of time we'll get many more. 1. To see my name in the website. 2. Get an hit while searching in google. (though it doesn't happen currently) 3. Time pass 4. Displaying love to latest trend 5. Showing off my writing skills 6. Showing off the breadth of knowledge 7. Sharing my thoughts with known friends 8. Nobody listens to me, thatswhy I have to write it somewhere 9. Oh man its boiling inside me, better I flush it otherwise it may burst. 10. This world deserves my opinion to stay in place....  blah blah blah..."
MMSPFVE,male,23,"I had been waiting for this movie every since I heard that Farhan Akthar is making a new one. After  Dil Chatha Hain  I had a feeling that there was going to be something different about  Lakshya  as well.   The movie got released in Bangalore on the 18th (Friday) and the first thing I did after getting up on the 19th was to go to  Innovative Multiplex  and book the tickets. Lucky me for when I reached the theatre the tickets were only available for the night show.  The show was at 10:00 in the night. When I reached the theatre with Kalpana, Asif and Chetan (Asif's friend who is studying at IIM-B) I found that they were screening the movie in all four screens. For a while I thought the people at  Innovative multiplex  were damn rich guys to have the courage of buying four prints of the movie. Later, after talking to one of the gate boys, I found that they actually had one print but they would be running it in all four screens. For a while I could not make any sense of out it so I kept bothering him for more details to which he gave me the following explanation. The four screens of the multiplex were at the four corners and hence the central projection area for all the screens was same. So, the reel would be fed to the first projector and then to the second, followed by the third and fourth. This way all the four screens would be showing the same movie with a delay of just about four to five seconds between them. Amazing isn't it. Well, I wondered if this was legal? Anyway, due to the arrangements the movie got deferred by 20 minutes.   About the movie  Lakshya is a movie about the Kargil war but is completely different from the regular ""Sunny Deol"" stereotypes. Its is all about a boy who is not sure of what he wants to do with his life till is joins the army and ends up becoming a captain at the LOC. The movie is about the transformation of Hrithik from a confused person to a focused individual and the gifted director has handled this change in an outstanding manner. The cinematography is awesome especially the ones at Kargil. One nearly misses a beat in the rock-climbing scene that talks loudly about sheer professionalism. I was literary in tears in the scene where Hrithik talks to his father before going for the mission. This movie is worth the 120 bucks spent and I am going to see it again even if Kalpana sits on my head and bangs it.    urlLink Read more"
MMSPFVE,male,23,"Sometimes I wonder why I still haven't renamed my blog to something like   l'estomac affamé parle   [The Famished Stomach Speaks] but then I can't help but write about yet another dining-out adventure I got into this Saturday when Kalpana decided that she wanted to have something Punjabi.   Owing to the fact that both of us are pretty bad at our culinary skills and that too coking Punjabi food at home would have been more of an exercise in itself, we decided to hunt for a good place to hog.  As I have mentioned before, hunting for a good place to eat in Bangalore can sometimes become quite annoying. We took the Bangalore Times which has a special section on food on Fridays where the restaurants throw up ADs in the anticipation of the fact that all the IT people in the city would definitely want to move out of their daily boring schedules and dine out on the night of Friday as Saturday happens to be a holiday.  So, Kalpana jumped ahead of me to grab the paper and was pretty fast in finding out about some restaurant by the name ""Chandani Chowk"" in Koramangla which happens to be 'the' place to have Punjabi food (well according the AD at least). Directions Madame??  ""Oh, its on the Koramangla 80 ft road next to Microland "", she said.  Only after reaching Microland and knowing the fact that the 80 ft Road was no where near to this so called landmark, I knew for sure we were lost but still, to try our luck out, we went as far as Asian Sports Village and found nothing. What next?  ""Well, now that its getting late and we are hungry too, lets go to the Feast of Asia "", she said, a little disappointed though as I knew she wanted to have something good. (not that Feast of Asia is not good)  So, we started moving back to where we came from and were all set to park our Honda 'Activa' (can't we make that invisible) when I saw something just opposite to Feast of Asia that made my eyes sparkle. No No!! It was not  ""Chandani Chowk""  but another Punjabi restaurant called  ""Dal Roti"" . :)   Dal Roti  At first I thought this place would not be as nice as it turned out to be. Situated on the first floor, just opposite to the Feast of Asia, this place is really 'the' place to go if one is looking for a break from the daily dose of South Indian delicacies. The menu is in English but reads Hindi. So, one can find the name of the dish in pure Punjabi iStyle, ""Sarsoon da Saag aur roti"" and what more it also serves some Chinese dishes and the section in the menu for those delicacies reads ""Chini Chini"" .. I thought that was really cute.   So, what did we have? Before I answer that I would like to add that this place serves both vegetarian as well as the other kind. Well, we started with the Veg Clear soup, which was really well made, no additives, no sticky business, plain clear soup with whole bunch of vegetables. To accompany that we went for the ""Dandi Veg Kebab"", something really delightful, and came as five kebabs rolled on small sticks served with Pundeney ki Chutni.    For the main course we went for Karela Masala (wow!), Rajma and can you believe it, these guys serve you plain atta rotis, the one your mother would make for you. Though they also have the regular variety of breads usually available in any restaurant these days, I would definitely vouch for the plain ones.   Well, the food was tasty (no doubt) and quite in the budget too but then there were so many other things to try out, looks like I would have to pay these guys a visit again :)   Till I find where ""Chandani Chowk"" actually is, its ""Dal Roti"" all the way."
MMSPFVE,male,23,"If you are a fan of Kashmiri food and would do anything to have the delicacies at home, well you just have to click the mouse button, as  urlLink http://koshursaal.tripod.com/  is that one place where you would find all the recipes for all the delights.  Well, you just need to follow the instructions and you are there. Guess what, once you would have made a couple of dishes you would realize that its pretty easy. Don't worry if you get confused by the name of the spices, there is a glossary at the end to help you out.  So, if you are doing nothing this weekend how about a ""Koshur Saal""  -+-"

MMSPFVE,male,23,"Talk about 'corruption' and you can find it written all over in any Indian Office.  This time though I had a taste of it at the office of the registrar where I had to pay a visit to get my marriage registered.   The deal  The deal was simple. One fine day, I went to this office to enquire about the things which need to be attached with the registration form and I was not amazed to find a person being too polite to me. He was even kind enough to come all the way down to the shop where I paid 30 bucks for the registration form.  Next week, while Kalpana and I were leaving to get this job done I asked her to carry an extra bit of cash as we might find it handy. Needless to say, she was already ready with it in the anticipation of what was coming our way.  On reaching that place, I was asked to see this *Madam* on the first floor who would be helping  me out with the next level of proceedings. She was also very kind and at that time I had a  feeling that this endeavor is going to cost me a fortune.   Not to my surprise, the *Madam* asked the same old chap, who I found the other day, to  accompany me towards the ground floor where I was supposed to pay the *official* sum of  15/- bucks. While I was coming back, he asked Kalpana to take a seat, thinking the 'poor girl' need not know what's going to happen next. Well, I must say that was a  blessing in disguise for her. She was already tired pushing one corner to another with  me and I could see that she was more than happy to take the seat.   Climax  While in the middle of the staircase, the chap told me. ""Look sir, when do you want  to get this done. I understand this is Urgent, Right!"", putting a little more emphasis on the 'Right'. I knew what was coming and I did not want to get into any verbal disputation, so I placed the 150 bucks I had in my hand quietly into his. Needless to say, I was a way too nervous as this was the first time I was doing anything like this. I assumed the story would have an happy ending here but something he said drove me out of the imagination-loop. ""Kitna Hain (How much is it)?"". ""150"", I shot back. ""Well, Madam  ko bhi dena hain .. who manegi nahi (you need to give some to Madam otherwise she  won't agree). No need to mention as to what I did next.  So there I was, in front of *Madam*, with the registration form and other stuff in my hand and the money tucked under them all. I was so nervous that I just did not know what to do.  *Madam* stared at me for sometime and then started to look into the case of another couple. Then she asked another person to look into my matter which indirectly meant that I had to give the money to the new guy. What a network!  Nervous I was, I did not move, did not even say anything. The new guy waited for sometime and I feel he understood that I was new in this trade. He told me in front of  everyone, ""You have to give a fee, Sir"". There you go! I handed him the cash in front of all told him that I wanted to take the certificate by evening and bingo! my job was done.   After thought  If you look at it now, there are approximately 5 people coming every hour for getting  the registration done. So assuming that Madam works for her full quota of 6 hours, she can expect 5 * 6 * 200 = 6000 bucks everyday. Lets assume she donates 50% of that to the other shit heads, she still earns a healthy sum of ~90,000 untaxable income per month.   What does the Govt Loose?  The rule is that with every marriage registration an NSC for 2000 bucks from a post office needs to be purchased by the couple. So, going by the same logic, 30 registrations per day would have given the Govt a revenue of 2000 * 30 registration  = 18 Lakhs per month. As this is just a small office, 200 to 300 bucks per registration is peanuts. I fail to imagine the stakes involved in the big *Page 1* scams!  Well, I never wanted to get involved into all this and by paying a 'fee' I count myself as a criminal too but then do you think with a system where corruption creeps in from the lowest level of authority, I would have wanted to wait for the next 'n' number of years just to prove to the authorities, which happen to be the same kind of people, that I  have married Kalpana Palaniswamy!!  I feel that's a waste.  Anyhow, God bless *Madam*!!"

Life becomes hell and you helpless. You can't wake up coz your GE radio-cum-watch is hung, even microwave's watch is blacked out, yeah but without AC the heat outside due to rising Sun will not allow you to sleep any longer. Even if you woke up, neither you have cold water in shower nor your fridge and electric stoves are working... that time you appreciate the low-power consumption keyword of ""Centrino"" from Intel and neighbouring hotel's free wireless connection.  Its an irony that, you are connected to the world thru most latest technology inspite being in miserable condition caused by the habit of living in technological world !!!"
MMSPFVE,male,23,"There has always been one thing which I have wanted to do and  that is to make a game like Quake. Guess what, I even started  looking into tools like SDL, OpenGL and even made a simple game Snood 21 but then I could never complete it which is something  I really hate of myself.   I can understand why I tend to jump from one state of mind to  another without even trying to finish what I started. If I look back now there are so many unfinished things in my life that even if I start back to finish all of those, I don't know when I  would be done with them.  So, my tryst with finding out that one thing still continues. I need to keep working, keep studying and keep myself busy until  I don't find it out."
