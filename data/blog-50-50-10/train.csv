THEY MADE FUN OF HOW HAPPY I WAS ... PPL WHO DIDNT GO ON FULL SERVICE JUST DONT UNDERSTAND !!! okay and after church ryan and marc came over for a bit,   lol they left and we went to Target ... bought an 80 pack of tampons and a 20 pack for the gentler conception ... is conception the right word?? i dno lol lets just hope ... then natalie had to leave and ju and i went on a bicycle ride down to the skate park to check out the skaters which ended up bein real fun cuz like nico, seth, kevin, and brian were there (along with jake and many others)   so we hung there for a bit till we finally came home (really hot) and went over to natalies where timmy (my architect italian husband) and erik (julie's whore) came over to watch little mermaid with us ... we tried teachin natalie how to dance at least the tiniest bit normal ... key word tried. and   now ... well now im home !!! and i'm goin to sleep cuz we have an early mornin at the skate park tomorrow! ;) haha fun times fun times. oh and if the person who pranked my cell today is readin this it didn't phase me and it never will okay?  xoxo ~meri~"

MAFI9ZH,female,14,"im so so so so so SORRY! i haven't blogged in so long! i mean ... i know that to some people my blog is their life ... and to those people ... well they haven't been living ... and im SORRY! but im back and i wont forget again! (thanks twiggy for reminding me) so at the moment im listening to my favorite song of the moment. i dont know wut its called but it goes a lil something like this :  ""i'm tryin to keep my feet on the ground .im gettin to like this feeling i've found. i'm gettin to love the thought of having you around . and i will never let you down."" do any of you know that song? see i kind of love it to death . and it stops like half way through cuz bri SUCKS at burning cd's so i have to keep pressing repeat and listening to the same 2 minutes and 25 seconds of it over and over and over. not that i mind at all though! so did you all know that i got dumped? im not sure if i've told you yet. well yeah nathan dumped me so i better change my profile . [sigh] he claims it was because im a homo. but what i find quite ironic (and im sure you all will too) is that he dumped ME for being a homo ... but the girl he has a fancy for now (lauren) is know for making out with her girlfriends ... hmmm ... now humor me people ... WHOS THE GOSH DAMN HOMO ?????????? sigh ... sorry had to vent a bit there. whooo. lalala. its amazing how good that made me feel. stupid boys. wutever. i dont neeeeeed a boy. although some of my close gallies know that im already looking at someone. however i would like to stress the fact that i am in fact JUST LOOKING! like a rich woman window shopping for her children at khols .. shes just looking ... shed NEVER buy it. see wut i mean? lol i know im great at analogys. i must go now im afraid of my life. wait ... is it supposed to be afraid FOR my life. wutever kisses ~D~"

DOOM !!! the closet says naughty things lol ... it says wut me and my friends truly think about people.   and ofcourse since i am infact meri anderson and i do have the worst luck of anyone i know - my mom is going to look at the closet.   when she gets home. in 2 hours. to me - the closet is a work of art - the thoughts, drawings, and love portrayed through the closet are   truly moving. to mommy - she'll freak. so i guess you could say i'm a bit worried. but i LOVE the closet i love love love it.   and i'm quite positive that if you asked any of my friends they in turn would say they love the closet. so maybe i'm wrong - maybe mommy will see the closet as a work of art as i do -   or maybe she'll freak out the butt. we'll just have to see. lololol. cleaning the closet is actually fun. i'm just clearin out the crap and vaccuuming it ... i'm also   re-setting up the candles and making a ""signing station"" so that we will never be without a writin utensil while in the closet.   sigh. i am going to go now though ... to clean the closet ... o beloved closet. please everyone pray for the closet ... or that mommy has dust in her eyes and doesnt read the walls.   amen.        ~Dee~      *****       :-D"

QWLJY8F,female,26,"Called Yvonne in the afternoon to tell her that I couldn’t go to her Cosmo party tonight. Been nursing an infected eye. I am now re-enacting my school years with my geeky look No. 1.  I was also too disorganised to dress up on that Friday.  I was in the office till 9pm. Met Jelts up at the cow for a gratifying ale after work and that quickly became like eight or nine (I actually tried to count). Shazam came through later. Eric was supposed to come at first at 7pm. Then it became 10.30pm, then at last we met him after midnight. By the time Sandra arrived afterwards, we decided to go home. By then we were suffering from alcoholic/ toxic poisoning. Off our postal codes. Big John and Mann turned up at a later time. I joined Jelts in kissing the ceramic throne on more than one occasion. We had guests till around 7am.  Blasting night."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Finally the phonecall to Indonesia Embassy actually met with a ring rather than be automatically diverted to the voicemail service, after half an hour. Unfortunately, Jelte DOES need to get an Indoenisa visa done even if it's to go to Batam for 24 whole hours. Cloggies need to bring their passports (minimum six month validity), a passport pic and SIN$70 and wait three working days before approval.   I am so disappointed!!! First Pangkor's cancellation, now even Batam is not happening. What an unlukcy weekend to plan anything for :(. I hope he is not badly affected by this. I still have my two days off on Monday and Tuesday. Guess I will help Cora clean the house on Monday and go meet my sisters on Tuesday.   I am so blooming disappointed. But Jelte & i will have fun on our own, I am sure.   TGIF"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"It’s my niece’s 4th birdthay today:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY PUMKIN!  Forgot to buy wrapping paper yesterday and today I got the prezzie slightly wet. It’s rainy season again. The family is having dinner tonight at – I suspect – Monkey’s. Goody, I feel like having the spicy Punggol Mee Goreng. I wonder if they have this noodle dish in Punggol itself.  I realise that there are no real birthday venue options for toddlers to tweenies. They are from the age when they are too young to have anything fancy but already understand the concept of ‘birthday party’; to too ‘old’ to have clowns but want to have a birthday party that classmates and friends will be impressed with.    For expatriates, they usually live in big houses, sometimes with swimming pools. Their kids have that extra option to have a customised party at home, daddy as clown negotiable.   Most locals live in pigeon holes called the HDB. By the Housing Development Board. Basically, cement and steel squatters. These residences were built with practicality first in mind, to ensure that everyone has a small roof over their heads. These small roofs cover small houses. Small houses cannot accommodate kids’ birthday parties – the littlies need places to run amok in.   Even worse is birthday parties for local Muslims like us (at least when we were younger and cannot have secret, ehr, ‘progressive’ Muslim parties). We want to go do something special, we go to Monkey’s Café, the only ‘halal’ restaurant in town. Funny, it’s located in the midst of discos, KTVs and bars. The four floors of whores is in the same building.   Heidi is lucky though. I wonder if she is a Generation Z. She gets to celebrate her birthday at McDonald’s. This Saturday, we have party there. Got Cowboy Charlie. Cowboy Charlie can make balloon sculptures. I want to ask for balloon flower.   Anyway, she is lucky because at the ripe old age of four, her guest list reads longer than my upcoming one. Yes, I have already made some ideas about what to do for my birthday and for those whom I know reads this Blog, you are invited too. Especially Patrecia coz she got the same birthday as mine.   So, Heidi is lucky also because, back when we were young and stupid, we can only wish about having our birthday at McD’s. ‘Halal’ foods weren’t the rage then and we only ate fish burgers. My, how Time has changed. The Generation Z is so lucky. Generation Xes like me, we had to make do or, even better, made things adapt to us (i.e. break the rules!!! Bring on the bourbon!). Generation Zs (I am still uncertain if she is a Z-er) get to have birthdays at both McD’s and Monkey’s.   I will be having a secret beer to toast to Heidi before dinner. My big and strong boyfriend will not be joining us for dinner because at dinner, my Mum will be there.   Thank you for the lovely surprises, auntie Liana!  urlLink     Monkey see, monkey hear & monkey presenting the balloon and cake.  urlLink     Happy birthday to you... croak.. croak..  urlLink"
QWLJY8F,female,26,I bought a black dress today! It’s a halter dress with A-line short skirt that is extra-long on the left front side. The back is waist-less. I also bought Biotherms’s sunscreen for my face so I won't have wrinkles when I am 28. I spend most of the time barefaced and in the sun. It was a rather flamboyant buy: $62 but I think it’ll last forever.
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I think I am gonna be sick. Got caught in the rain yesterday morn and have been sneezing fantastically. Last night I dreamt that I have the fever and I woke up thirsty as hell. Jelts ran down to get me water and when I woke up this morning, I was under the weather. So weak.  We argued all night yesterday about the virtues of him giving the ring to me now (me) and how much more exciting it would be if I got it when I least expected it (him). Basically he ain’t gonna give me my ring now. I have to wait for my birthday and even then, he wouldn't tell me when.   So after dinner with his dad and their friend/ colleague, Twan, I decided to sulk. They were talking shop and discussing hierarchies during dinner anyway so that kind of tired me out. Besides I believed we stole a taxi from someone else who was by the road first and I felt bad about it. So I went upstairs as soon as we reached home to contemplate the order of things in the grand scheme of life under the shower.  When I came out of the shower, I saw Fondue my pet mouse wearing my ring on his arm! He gave me the ring! So happy… I squealed and ran downstairs to tell him how right he is – I didn’t expect it and I was very happy. Asked him to come upstairs with me so I can ‘thank’ him properly. He had to finish something on the computer so I went up first.   I waited in bed but I was out like a light in under five minutes.   So useless of me.   Oh well. He can wait :o)."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I just got back from a grumpy lunch with Sarah, my editor. She was grumpy about working till one last night only to find out today that the magazine goes to print on Friday and not tomorrow. She was annoyed that she slogged for nothing. No one tells you anything in this office. Everyone has their own schedules. I am just glad my Weddings story is done, and I have done a MUCH better introduction that is more than just me saying that marriage sucks.   I wonder sometimes how we manage to produce a  urlLink stylish rag  every month. I was just an innocent bystander at that point she found the news out and though no one twisted my arm for it, I found myself sharing her grumpiness in our 'boardroom' that is SODs (Shamus O'Donnel, Irish bar downstairs from work). Now I've got a pint and a cheeseburger 'behind my teeth'. She also bought me a pack of fags.  Anyway, I've had a nasty cough/sore throat - or if you ask my better half, he'd say cooties - and I hope to God I only get really sick on Thursday. The whole office is suffering from this cooties epidemic. Must be something in the air conditioning unit. I think someone throws in a bag of germs in our cooling system each night.   But looking at this 'new schedule', I can take the morning off tomorrow. Gotta finish my Elvis and Heineken Music reviews today. Going to Bobo's to have dinner with Mum then go to Shazam's for... I don't know, whatever we go there for. Tonight I am joining the Cloggies watch the Holland team play soccer against another team, I don't know what, in the Dutch Club. I even got a t-shirt made by Cora. She said it's got Dutch words (probably swear ones) and a picture of a Dutch player who spat on a German player taken off the newspapers some time back.  Sandra's in Hong Kong till Thursday. Thursday we invite ourselves to Hooker's for his housewarming. He's moved to the fourth floor of Shazam's block. Fourth floor of Hooker, Jelts said. Today he sent an e-mail telling everybody his housewarming is on the 9th floor. Ha, ha. That's Shazam's house. We are not going to Batam anymore. I don't know. After that cycling bit, everyone including me seems to just wanna chill and not break any laws."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Today is Sunday and I have got to finish  Weddings  by today if I want to enjoy the next two days of slacking. But it’s hard to concentrate on work. I have only just begun to recover from Friday night. We were drinking and partying at Jason’s this time round, until yesterday at 5pm. Without any sleep, at about 1.30pm Hooker and us decided it’d be grand to hit town to keep the alcohol/blood equation unbalanced. I tell you, I had stars in my eyes! That’s what lethargy combined with sunlight does to my sunglass-ed eyes. I missed out seconds of my memory – one moment I was on top of the stairs, next moment we were across the road. Scary shit. I was turning delirious. Couldn’t finish my frozen margarita at Muddy Murphy's, it was all too intense for me. I needed to rest.  So in between keeping me upright, Jelte bid Hooker goodbye as he went off in the opposite direction to locate another drinking hole (how does he do that?!). I had a tiny panic attack when blood drains off my palms and my lips started feeling pins and needles. We headed back to Jason’s (we left our bags there) where I was commanded to go take a kip. After an hour, we called a cab to go home. This time we slept for 14 hours! Oh, Hooker sent an SMS to Jelts at 11.30pm. He was at Cow, still drinking!!!  Today I found out why I was so average yesterday. I got my period. Periods always make me go weak; I also often get anxiety attacks at this glorious time of the month.   At least, that’s what I’d like to think. Imagine, what will I do if I had to stop partying?  Okay, I’d better shovel some work now. Then we might go to Shazam’s for beers tonight ;o)"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I am 26.    One and a half hours later    Um. Jeez… I have been walking around touching this and that, replying to people’s birthday greetings, been on the phone with Mum for half an hour, talked to Jelte on the phone, had a cigarette, sat down, stood up, looked in the mirror. Cooked pasta. So hungry. The last meal I ate was more than 24 hours ago with Bobo and Heidi, a picnic lunch on Jason’s rooftop.   This was what happened in my bubble in the last 24 hours.    At this point, kindly refresh your memory by referring to two posts ago entitled Happy Pseudo Birthday before reading on. But only if you think this might help in your enjoyment of my blog. If you don’t think so, then you don’t have to do it. In any case, to find out what happened to me in the last 24 hours, read on.    So when Loobz left my office, I went back to work. Oh, the rag went to bed yesterday – as planned. I can’t remember the last time we went to print on time. I now declare myself the new editor. I can do that because today’s my birthday and I am 26.    This is really hard to do right now, this typing my blog in. My thoughts together with my hand-eye coordination are not synchronising effectively. And my pasta is not going down too well either. Plus I kept thinking about which shoes to pack.    So there I was happily at my desk when I heard some familiar noise. I turned around and saw two pussycats standing and smiling at me. Bobo and Heidi came to surprise me. They had a bag (which looks awfully familiar but never mind) of makans and goodies. ‘Let’s go picnic’, Bobo said. My colleagues were milling about and they all told me that I am the stupidest person ever. Oh, no wonder I am stupid. I was the last person to know that my sister had planned a surprise lunch for me with my office peeps.   Jason tossed me his keys and we made our way to his house that is like five minutes walk away.    Fuck it’s 3pm. I have to finish this soon if I want to get anything epilated and packed. I’ll have another cigarette to aid in my erh, writing.    So we spread her Spiderman picnic mat on the floor of his rooftop and us three ladies shared a meal of egg mayo sandwiches, roasted chicken, chips, crackers and chocolates. The weather was nice and warm – not too hot – everything was chill. I was still not quite sure I deserve such a lovely surprise… and all her efforts, lugging a tot and two bags uptown to feed me. Aww…. I glow inside out just remembering Loobz coming to the office to give me the personal alarm (so I can bring it to Bangkok) and now, a concrete picnic my sis and niece.   After about an hour, we all piled into a cab and she dropped me off at work. Some time later, again I was at my desk when I heard silence behind me, at the back of the office. I went to investigate and I caught my colleagues by surprise as they were trying to surprise me with a birthday cake. It was funny seeing about 1,700 people huddling around the small glow of candles trying not to let me know that they were hiding my cake.   I grabbed my cam and snapped some pix of them and they gave up trying to hide anything. Now I got evidence you’d better give me my cake. So we all sang the happy birthday song. I popped my own bottle of champagne for the first time in my life.    Whoo-hoo! Dickhead just arrived to pass me my pressies. A g-string with a cow in front, a soccer design panty (don’t ask), a pair of shorts-knicker thingy and a PINK wallet. I will bring all to Bangkok later. I really have to hurry now so I can entertain him.    So it was a Wednesday afternoon and we were having a party at work. They gave me a Lulu Guinness bag! Wowwww.   Then Sandra called me to say that Shazam was going to give me my Levi’s today. Shoot. I was not wearing it so I have to go home to change into it. See, about a month ago after he said he wants me to have the Levi’s for my birthday, I kidnapped it from his home. It’s been sitting in my wardrobe, waiting for the time when he will give it to me and that should be when I am already wearing it.   So I went home to change. Finally decided what top and shoes matched my new Lulu bag and Levi’s. I know; very busy ah. Went back to the office and it was time to go for drinks. Eda was still having her hair washed at the salon downstairs so we waited for her at Cow.   At cow I was given some flaming bday cocktail and another bday song.    Are you tired of reading this already? I am already tired writing about it! Okay Cora had just came home from Holland. I think I better get away from this computer and talk with people. Don’t be a stranger! Will see you again when I come back from Bangkok on Sunday."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Jelts & I and the two Ss caught Pitch Black on DVD last night before sprinting to the nearby cinema to catch the sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick. I am already very busy one day after the magazine went to print. It’s usually two weeks of loafing around. Because after next week, my editor goes to the UK plus I have got almost back-to-back people to interview (tonight, Hossan Leong, Joe Augustine & my twin, Kumar), shows to review (Moscos Circus on Saturday!), and stuff to preview (like ‘chi’ water spa at Shangri-La, Friday).   I’d better get some work out of the way now."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I have been 100% since Friday. It feels wunderful not having toilet rolls as my constant companions.  We partied pretty hard on Saturday. There were thousands of bare-bodied men in all shapes and er, bra sizes. I noticed that they have spent more time in the gym, more money on steroids. And they have practised to be submissive at the same time too. Pouty, feminine, soft. I feel pretty manly myself there. A lot of gay men came up to tell me I looked good and I was given a Military Ball dog-tag because I am that cool (?). Whatever that means.  Jason came and stayed over after the Military Ball at Suntec City. On Sunday, we just hung out, dicked around with the computers and I read a lot.  I have finished the trilogy of Clan of the Cave Bear and have started on the book that follows, Plains of Passage. This hard cover is the size of a mattress. It is hard to wield and it hurts my lap when I read in bed (I can't possibly bring it out with me to read on the trains in the mornings - it would be like opening up an umbrella in an elevator!).  So I am on to the Da Vinci Code now and it is mesmerising. There are some apparent facts in there that I'd like to read more about on my own. It's a history/ religion/ thriller and of course, the religious institution in question is Christianity.  A couple of years ago, I found out about the freemasons and some other top-ranking secret societies founded by the Europeans. The ang mo's secret societies are so different from our Ang Soon Tong, Sa La Kao (sp?) etc. Their influences reach all the way to royal bloodlines and the very existence of religion.  In the Da Vinci Code, the papacy (the Catholic church) is so powerful that history is rewritten in such a way that the world is as it is now. When women and feminity used to be revered in the beginning of time, when sex was sacred and the womb a sign of fertility and power; the Church had turned those on its head, the fear of men of women so self-engulfing; and so it made women the weaker sex, and that copulation is now the work of the devil, and it now became that a woman was the one who made that perennial mistake and succumbed to temptation by eating that apple in West of Nod (Nod is actually a cursed land, east of Eden)...  Then the three of us watched Man on Fire - that made me cry. It's well put together and the music well chosen. The cinematography is a little artsy, making its visuals interesting. The storyline is a tad predictable. But Denzel Washington has a new fan in me.  So Jason left us at about 1am Sunday night. I kept reading till two. Woke up at about noon. It's National Day today - happy birthday Singapore and happy 'being able to ' come out of the closets without being arrested, all you homosexuals! I am sure you - and us two, if we manage to drag ourselves out to Zouk's closing party tonight - will be having so much more fun now that Singers has loosen its collar on your sexual preferences and birthright. Again this has at least a slight political/ economical hindsight to it but hey, when is it ever not anymore? In this complicated, two-faced modern society?  Jelts made us some very delish chicken fried rice for lunch. Shit. He had now even beat me in making yummy Asian fried rice; this used to be my specialty but he hasn't tasted my beef rice yet."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Since our cocktail tasting with Morton’s GM was canned, I remained in the comfortable climes of my pajamas. After finishing some work, I met up with Jelte and Hooker (our new 'recruit' Richard Hooker). We went to Sandra’s for champagne & wine and dinner together with Yvonne. Our tummies suitably lined, we moved on to vodka shots. Drunk as skunks, around midnight we got restless so we trooped to Shazam’s, half a klit away. There, they had cheese sandwiches and more vodka shots with Ribena (which were not that well-received btw). I was sleepy at 2am so I played the xbox. After two fourth places in Burnout 2, I snuck into Shazam’s room for a kip. I was in the right outfit so might as well act the part. Boydie and Big John turned up later. When I awoke later, an xbox party was in full swing and the house’s population had increased by 30%. That’s what professional adults do on Saturday nights at 4am. Play computer games together. I was refreshed but it’s past Jelte’s bedtime. We shared a cab with Hooker. There was a police stop near home. They stopped our taxi and asked Hooker who was seated in front, “You all come from where hah?” Hooker said, in his very English accent, that he comes from Clementi. We had no more problems after that."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I bought six ships last night.  I got myself THREE pairs of shoes, hurray hurray. Now I have a pair of red ballet flats to go with my Levi’s jeans that Shazam still does not know he has given to me (I stole my pressie from his room, remember, O loyal readers). Now all I need is a funky top (and today I realised that I do not have a black bag)… for my ‘birthday suit’. Anyway I spent $200+ last night on that red flats, a bronze strappy heel and a fucking kuniang beige slippers with kitten heels; got ribbon in front some more! Hahaha… I have to buy them because it’s near impossible to find protective gear for my soles. Yes, I have extremely humungous feet – size 12 or 42 if you need a laugh – and buying shoes for me has all my life been a big deal. Yep, pun intended.   My toes have always been subjects of attention. Women get stared at all the time be it because of their boobies, asses or faces. For my case my southern digits get all the fixated gazes, often with passing glimpses of fear. I think people get scared of things they don’t recognise. My toes are long and gnarled, to suit the rest of me.  When I wear covered shoes, which is often because I hate scaring people unwittingly, they still show beneath the leather or the canvas. It’s as if I keep mice inside my shoes. They look so bumpy. When I was young, about seven, I used to entertain fantasies about chopping them off with a parang. I believed I wouldn’t bleed because they are so dried-up and bony – it’d be like crushing dried twigs. So I hate my toes."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Yippie beedoobaaday! Jason is back from Koh Samui but it's not why I am happy (hee hee) - he brought me a FROZEN bottle of Absolut Vanilia and an orange scented candle! AND we are going to eat Peranakan food again, ayam buah keluak yummy yum yum yum."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Rolled out of bed at about 11 and packed away. Our flight was at 2.40pm. Big John came round to bid us farewell (he's on the 7 o'clock flight).   We should have stayed longer. We'd only discovered the virtues of the BTS, we haven't  done any shopping (except I bought a 10 baht cat figurine for Cora), and there were half a dozen large bottle of Heineken, instant noodles, juices, soybean milk and everything still left in the fridge!  We were tired though, we'd been drinking steadily for many hours everyday and sleeping late since Weds. We had some bahts left so we pigged out on fast food. All that talk we had about the film Supersize Me had at last reversed our brains. Or was it alcohloic poisoning that has killed our brain cells?   Cora met us at the airport where we bought more alcohol- vodka and tequila and beers. Came back home, had a shower, unpacked, had dinner, and crashed! I snored so loudly, I woke myself up!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,I have spent much of today literally sucking people off.
QWLJY8F,female,26,"There is a bunch of girls who work in the same industry as I am. We are all in the lifestyle, food and beverage, fun and games business. It is not all glam and handbags. We work hard. If you happen to catch us having fun, it is just us balancing the equation of working hard with equal amounts of partying.   All of us except for one are also dating full-grown men without what that is commonly known as ‘good’ or ‘stable’ jobs.   My partner doesn’t even have a job.   Or rather, he is in between jobs. Take my word for it – he tried, oh lord he did. But this is not about his inability to score an employment worthy of his talents and time.   Most women in eras as recent as 40 years ago can only dream about getting out there, going to school and earning a rightful living as well as a place in society.   They dare not even venture out in skin-tight outfits, go to clubs, meet members of the opposite sex, have drinks and smoke cigarettes.   I know, it can get tiring, bringing up the battle of the sexes issues, the past versus the present again. Especially since this is not the Adam and Eve Revisited.   But I do like to waffle on that the bunch of girls and I, we wear sexy clothes if we want. We go out there and drink like men, we smoke, we pay for our own stuff, we put ourselves in cabs, we go home and go to work again the next morning.  There I’ve said it.   Yes we do all that and more! And I am happy, I am proud and I feel very fortunate to be here, doing my bit and having fun while I am at it."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"True to our promise, Jelts and I spent some time with Cora last night. BTW I didn’t realise that Joris had gone to Holland.   But first, an amazing experience. I was supposed to meet with Jelts at Orchard MRT after work. He said he would wait at the exit leading to our bus stop. So I got out of the gantries, picked up three rum balls to eat, and I took the escalator up.   From the escalator, I looked up and saw a tall, young man leaning against the staircase. He had a leg rested over the other, reading intently. His longish hair flopped down and I couldn’t tear my eyes away from him. He was damn attractive. My heart skipped a beat as I reached the floor. I walked quietly up to him and then, I kissed him.   It was Jelte.   After dinner, as usual when the three of us are alone, especially after we have had a couple of cocktails, Cora asked us if we wanted to play ‘Rummikub’, a tile game using numbers and a good memory.  I always win this game so Jelte wasn’t interested:o). Then I said, let’s play for money. Everyone put their books away.   I went up to grab my piggy bank and the table was set. At first gambling 10-cents for each point lost, we then increased that to 20-cents. ‘Because don’t have challenge’, Jelte said. I lost all of rounds. I lost $7.50 of which most went to Cora.  I don’t want to play anymore."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"So you have read about me larging it on Friday night. Saturday night was even bigger than large. It was uncontrollable debauchery. We were the 24 Hours Party People. All in the name of offering a friend our shoulders to cry on. Though he didn’t actually cry. We haven’t seen one of our mate Shazam for years and years (actually just two or three months but it felt so) ever since his gf moved to Singers. Saturday afternoon saw a flurry of SMSes sent to Jelte that finally relayed the message that his relationship has ended. He had even helped her pack up her bags–which wasn’t hard considering she hasn’t actually unpacked most of her belongings. So off we went to the Cow after my chicken rice dinner not really feeling like leaving the safe, warm and dry confines of home with full stomachs (I had two helpings) and our alcohol stream still filled with too little blood. After all those lost time Shazam admitted to actually being shy to be coming out and have a few cold ones with us. But as time went by, he threw caution to the wind and managed to just bare his soul little by little. And more and more… till the following evening. After 20 hours of being awake and drinking copious amounts of beer at his, stepping out of the scene of crime as we walked into the light again to grab a taxi home hit us pretty hard in the face, longing more than ever for a good wash and the fluffy bed. Suffice to say that Cora looked more than a little bewildered to see us stumble home with bags under our eyes looking like The Simpson’s characters (for some reason lack of sleep and too much alcohol make one inherit a yellow pallor). It was a good long sleep and we are both at work today, feeling better than we thought we can ever feel again.   Next party – Pangkor June 5-7! I so crave the sunshine, sand and salty breeze… time to get new swimmies. I saw this nice little halter top tankini in electric blue. Perfect for spending 24 hours in!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I had just been introduced to the latest buzzword around – newstalgia. Meaning exactly what it looks like, as it’s happening, you’re missing it.   How much faster are we going?"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I am so fragile this past week. When Ayla, the heroine in the book I am reading, The Clan of the Cave Bear, was cursed with death, I wanted to cry. It’s Vesak Day public holiday on Weds, and I have four days off work from Saturday onwards.   Talking about work, I was in the office on both weekends. It can be quite the refuge on weekends. There is no one else but me. An escape from everything else. But yesterday I had the sudden urge to go home – the one with my siblings living in it – even before I had completely finished the work I set out to do. Probably because of the looming storm that I wanted to leave fast. Grabbed some junkies along the way (yes I picked up a few heroin addicts from Watson’s…) and cabbed it. It was nice catching up with Heidi who had a lot to catch up with me – ranging from Lion King to her birthday cake to her birthday present (a big Simba or was it Mufasa?), about how high heel shoes hurt and you can’t jump with them on. Dickhead looked a little down so I got him ice cream so he can cheer up. I didn’t even twist his arm for getting me vanilla Coke instead of the diet version. Loobz made me laugh when he sang a song with Heidi’s new plastic guitar from Uncle Jelte. Bobo was busy scurrying here and there. Wang was busy playing techno and then alternative and then pop… DJ Confused … all in all, the house was cheerful and smelled clean and delicous. Even my room hee hee. Bobo and Loobz fixed nasi lemak for dinner – it was what my stomach was waiting for its whole life! Bobo almost made me cry when it was time I left, hanging on the grille, sad to see me go (vice versa). It would have been nice if I came back for good but right now I am not sure what the plans with Jelte are yet. We have to talk about our savings, bills and travel. On Saturday we will open up a joint account.   I had a fantastic lunch today! There is a new Peranakan place downstairs from my office called Nonnie's. I had ayam buah keluak, fried fish with sambal belachan and rice. Cost me under $8 for the lot."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"This is the second day that I am being utterly useless at work. I have style and events to finish by Friday, an interview with madcap Jewish author Fran Lebowitz Thursday, a martini tasting tomorrow (appletini)… and my WEDDINGS story to finish next week! First my new editor sends me to s spa in Koh Samui, then she made me turn up for a champagne brunch on a Friday and now I am supposed to write a feature on holy matrimony. Or un-holy matrimony… I am sniffing out for the unconventional. But ack. I have lost two days’ of brain activity. Mblog was also down all day… like me. Watched Shrek 2 with Jelte after work and I highly recommend it! The Puss in Boots/ Antonio Banderas combination is one killer cocktail."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"So this party was better than the one that we had just left. It was the launch of a new magazine, set on the lawn of a charming old five star hotel. And this was no cheapo, low standard ‘do either. Chefs with their tall white hats stood behind their stations surrounding the guests, ready to whip out bacon risotto, crab meat temaki and deep fried golden cheeseballs. The bartenders poured us drinks from behind the ice bar by the water fountain. Our friends and some people that we know from the local theatre scene were there too so conversations were easy. I was chatting with my girlfriend and her partner, while my boyfriend wandered off to talk with other people.  Then Christian walked up to me and asked if I was enjoying the party. I said yes, and we clinked our martini glasses while we both looked around with smiles on our faces.   I have been drinking since I knocked off work, at that previous event. That place was half a minute’s walk away from my office so that had to be done. Five hours later, here I am, and I was getting a little tired and tipsy. I did contemplate about not going to work the next day, and then I decided against it. Oh well, I thought. I shouldn’t be over-indulging myself all the time. I must tell Jelte that we ought to go home.  “So where are you off to next?”, Christian prodded. I am known – and I am not proud about it – for going all out on parties no matter if they are on a weekday or a weekend.   But tonight has been a little bit strange for Jelte and I. Ever since he was ‘late’ in meeting me after work, which had kept other people waiting for me. Six months into being with each other, this evening had been a stage for a string of misunderstandings and miscommunications to happen. Although no one could be blamed for those verbal accidents, I was understandably upset. I can’t be blamed for unblamable mishaps.   “Actually, Christian, I am waiting for my Beacon of Light. We are going home”, I replied. “Where is he now?”. “Er, actually, I don’t knows I said. So we both looked around to locate my six-foot-two man.  And there we saw him, to our left, under a tree, clucking away pretending to be a chicken, as he chicken-walked towards a crowd of people whom I prayed to God were people he knows!  “Yep, that’s Jelte all right,” Christian helpfully informed me.   Bursting out in laughter, I remembered once again what made him so special to me. He is just so innocently clueless sometimes, and he does not care what other people think. And with that thought, I forgave him in my heart for his inability to be on time with me today (did I mention that I did not actually inform him of when to meet?), and I also chucked away all thoughts of pushing him into oncoming traffic on the way home."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I swear my colleagues were more excited than me when I told them that I can’t join them for tea time fried rice because I had to fit into rings after work. Everyone (actually just the two of them) got worked up and said things like how he should have surprised me, how he should have taken them instead to Tiffany's so they can help him pick. I could almost hear them make decisions in their heads about what to wear to the wedding.  The problem about it is this was actually for my birthday. They knew (as with, you lot) that I have been hankering for that Tiffany mesh ring. Because we don’t want me to end up with more sex toys and hair remover gadgets (my family reads this blog), I went along with him.   So yey!!! I finally got it! But he said I couldn’t have it until my birthday. Thanks baby, I will cherish it forever plus seventeen :o). Our table number at Takashimaya foodcourt (like what else can you afford after that) was “17”."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Skint Silly   I got suitably drenched this morning because I am broke. We are all broke. 'We' being my better half and I. 'Better' because he fixed me pancakes this morning, which is the reason why I can afford to skip lunch today as I am still full (OK, I lied. I am just broke).  I have $19 to my name, and he has $10 - but he doesn't know that. I’ve secretly placed one of my two $10 notes in his wallet last night. Good thing that we went to get groceries last weekend. That should last us for two weeks. But by then I should be home. Maybe. That also means that Mummy will go back to the Bug Woman Cave, hyeh hyeh hyeh. Hey, it isn’t that bad for them. They will have someone to cook for them all the time. They lead an easy life there as compared to me. All I get is sex on tap, The Family Guy, loads of Dutch cheese (I so like) and our occasional treat - Hello Panda chocolate biscuits. There is one packet left in the fridge, do you think he will know it was me?  So, it is all good except that I am broke. It’s not funny! Pass me $20, Someone. Yeah yeah... OK, fine. Be that way.  Also, all my friends are abandoning us now. Long story. Actually I also cannot be bothered with ‘friends’ like those."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I am still a little bit out of it these days. I find myself unable to finish off sentences,  I have lost the smidgen of eloquence I never had , I laugh at jokes about four seconds late every time… so I decided that I should… read. Even at lunchtime I take my book. So my plan for today was to go have some sunshine in me (since I seemed to have lost the one I was born with) so that’s what I told the crew last night. But today I thought, fuck it, it’s gonna rain on me anyway, I rather stay home to read my book (surprise, surprise). But at about 3pm my bouncing ball of energy Jelte said let’s go to the beach (I am beginning to think that it is him who has stolen my verve away...). Anyway he asked if I could edit his  Skype   piece before we went to the beach. Of course I said yes but I can’t go to the beach, my toenails need to be painted. So he offered to paint them whilst I edit. Can’t say no to that. Besides, the gang called to say they were on their way to Sentosa.   So he had a poo then he armed himself with Cora’s pedicure stuff. I don’t know where or when he learned how to cut, scrape, push, file and buff (like he knows the evolution theory, how to make a wicked creamy pasta and the words to the philosopher’s song) but  my toes look happy now . He even painted a smiley face on my skin, on top of my right foot :o). The shade of brown he picked is lovely too. I enjoyed placing my feet on his crotch. My first ever pedicure! What a sweetheart I got. I love him to death! My baby! This morning he went to work without me because I refused to leave the bed.  My alarm clock has been doing odd things lately.  It first went off at 3.45am and then it went of at  4.62am!!  Weird, weird, weird. Arrived work at 11am. Was famished so I bought fried noodles with egg, veggie fritters and iced coffee to my desk. I am so full and fat now.   And I miss him :(  Anyway yesterday, after Sentosa (where I didn’t even change into my bikini that I had underneath my clothes... because I was reading…) we freshened up at Shazam’s then buggered to  Coyote Ugly . The dancers were really so good, it was bad! That place is full of American sailors and dripping with sexual desperation. Alcohol was consumed in er, creative ways. We were promised hard-bodied male dancers as it was also ladies night but all we got were skinny Malay boys who danced like geckos. We had free plonk the whole time there and I had to meet with some people, the 50-something Singapore expat wives Calendar Girls to be exact so I did. I even got one of their calendars. One of them owns this godforsaken place. After about 45 minutes, we left for  Peter Kruder at Velvet Underground .  I managed to get six of us into Velvet with no problems. Dickhead were with us though Bobo and June did not. Kruder was pretty good, the first time I heard his music was the day before. But Jelte and I stayed till after 1. Dickhead at first wanted to go but he went back to my friends and stayed till 2. Today I heard from Yvonne that the crew stayed till close. They walked to Shazam’s and they were so drunk by then. Haha, along the way,  Sandra ate some leaves  and at one point they tried to steal a table from six bouncers eating supper downstairs from Shazam’s place. Everyone was all over the place en route to Kellock Road. Yvonne was going to order some food to take upstairs and woo hoo! – she saw  Kruder eating chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee ! She is now one happy bugger with autographed CDs. They didn’t leave Shazam’s till 6am!  Blimey!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"This was a somewhat languid day.  Met the posse up at Samy's for out-and-out Indian banquet complete with banana leaves and eating with (only our right) hands. I think our toothless Indian waiter likes me. Hee ole-wayz zmiled hiz toothlez zmile at mee and shoog his head a lot ad mee. He also gave mee many food many timez.   We had sambal prawns the size of my palm. We had chicken tikka, mutton dhal, fish head curry, fried fish, chicken korma, pappadums... many, many glorious types of sinful, fattening, rich, spicy, delicious Indian food slapped onto our banana 'plates'. Ohhh... the thought of them brings water to my mouth even now. So cheap, lah. We ate like pigs and only a hundred bucks for the five of us.  We decided to walk from Dempsey Road to  urlLink  Botanic Gardens  to settle our full tummies and for ginger tea. It was quite funny how that was entertainment in itself. First we ventured into a few warehouses selling antiques. Then we poked our heads into some abandoned colonial houses. Then as we walked down the road towards the garden, we saw a large spider building his web in the trees -quite spectacular. Then we saw another spider. We got to the garden, walked thru the purple orchids, sat down at Halia for frozen mocktails and to cool down. Meandered through the rainforest. Had ice cream at Café Les Amis.   Jelts and I went to Tanglin Mall after that while the rest headed home to rest. I need shoes! My shoes are all dead now. Need shoes for birthday! I already got a Levi's collector's jeans No. 769 (thanks Shazam!) to wear.. now need shoes. But, no size for me. Instead we bought Hooker a pet. A pet cat. A helium-filled pet cat with four paper legs that walks when you pull it along with its string.   Went to Hooker/ Shazam's. Oh, Hooker has already moved into his block. Four floor of Hooker, tee he. I got pantyliners but left it at Hooker's when we delivered the housewarming cat. We chilled, then we caught the 9.30pm Around the World in 80 Days which was crap. A no-brainer comedy flick with big names and tired clichés. But still brought a couple of laughs and Owen Wilson was a welcome cameo in my books. The funniest part was seeing Richard Branson (Virgin air) operating the hot air balloon rides set at he turn of the century."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"We had them last night :). Lame I know. But it's true, so…  Watched this characteristically bizzare Kaufman film with my better Jelte, Sandra and Shazam last night. What brilliant cinematography about memories, the mechanics of memories in relation with the mind, and with the present, and perhaps even love. It's the kind of film that leaves you feeling dazed, like you have to be pulled back towards the ‘real world’, when it is over. Though a little disturbing at first, the natural way the story is told becomes easier to perceive later on. Though graphic, the scenes were beautifully orchestrated. It was the visual collage of your mind. Or that’s what they want you to think anyway.   Moseyed over to Shazam’s after that for a beer. “One for the road”, we say. Had one, had two, then Sandra suggested popping open the Dom in the fridge. What occasion, eh? Hey, I signed my first PO today, Shazam said. What’s a PO, I asked. A purchase order, Shazam said. For when I get the contract to design DFS watch section. So, popped one… then a second one. Time flew. Oh, it’s 11pm, we better leave soon hey baby? Jelte said to me. Okay. He played one round of Burnout on the xbox, got first place, so played the second one out of five. Shazam nuked us some of his briyani from Sri Lanka. Can you stay over, he asked us. We teased him about the astronaut upstairs before that. He has a full-sized astronaut figurine upstairs. We told him that Mr Astronaut will walk down the stairs and ask to sleep with him. Hee hee. We didn’t stay. When the tandoori chicken (also from Sri Lanka) was heated up, we left for home."

QWLJY8F,female,26,"What a state the suite was in today. There were food everywhere! Big John came knocking while I was cleaning up, ready for some more food. The Two Ss were too tired to go and we agreed that Shazam deserved to chill for a little bit, so Jelts, BJ and I went lookin' for 'Kuppa'.   It was at Sukhumvit Soi. 16 and the cabby - classically - dropped us off way too far away from it to dare call himself a cabby. We had to walk back about 20 minutes before we found the place.   And what a place Kuppa is! It's a nice standalone cafe with a high-ceiling and open concept kitchen. And the food and coffees were divine! Real pastas, sandwiches and coffee. Nice ambience and very affordable. Each well-prepared dish was about $6-$8, a fraction of the price if it were to be Singers.   We packed some lunch for the lovebirds at the hotel and took the BTS (Bangkok's 'MRT') five minutes' walk away. It was Asok Station, and we took it back to the hotel, stopping at Ratchatewi Station, which was practically at its doorstep. It was only two stops away; it was about the same price as the taxi in 1/4 of the time. Fantastic. From then on, we kept taking the BTS.  All these while, Shazam got something in his bag that makes me go crazy. It's the tablet version of Clarinase syrup that I've got sitting on my office desk. I was royally annoyed with my stupid sinus when he finally realised to offer me one. Good thing he rested, now he was thinking clearly. After that, it was as if I had ten cups of espresso. I was bouncing off the wall. Parents: Keep Clarinase away from your kids and have them yourselves instead! Ha, ha... ha, ha!  After a rest, we decided to take a walk in the nearby malls: Siam Square, MBK, Discovery etc. It was so very crowded and there were so many shops! We even bumped into Chrissy who had just stepped out of Toni & Guy. We were to meet up at 8pm for dinner at Bed before partying at Mystique (hoping against hope this time round to bump into more 'friends').  Met Chrissy again but at Nana Station, near Sukhumvit Soi 11 where Bed (as well as Q Bar is). Dinner was fabulous! It was a set dinner thing where everybody was first asked for their dietary prefrences/ requirements. Then dinner, almost exactly the same for everyone, was served.   Starters were firstly, a very delicate and flavourful corn and crab meat 'cappucino' soup. It was a dream to have in your mouth! Then, we were served salad which was topped with what I believe to be basil and mint sorbet. What a delightful combination!   Before the (duck) main course which was served on a bed of what tasted like mashed sweet potato and pumkin, they did a re-enactemnt of Yoko Ono's piece-cut performance.   A 'geisha' walked slowly before finally settling on the stage right in the middle of the room. Then she placed a pair of scissors in front of her. Now, everyone was invited to come on stage to cut a piece of her black satin 'kimono'. Some cut out small pieces on her skirt whilst others cut the rest of her garment off (yep, a young man did that. How rude!).   Jelte cut a piece for me from one of her sleeves.   The whole set-up of the place was obviously, like a big bedroom. Unfortunately we booked just one night ago, so we had a table -  a table!  - and no bed in Bed. But after dessert we quickly took over someone else's 'bed' when they left. It was about 2,200 Baht per person (SGD$90), our one big meal in Bangkok which had to be done.   After that, we went to Mystique again. I pulled up my stunt to get in for free this time round, and it worked! The seven of us didn't have to pay to get in. We also had a table. I managed to convince them to invest in a bottle of vodka and I had fun! Jelte had ran out of steam by now and the rest were just bopping/ coping. Thinking about it now, I should have dropped Clarinase in their drinks. Hee hee.  I went out to look for Eric but I had to return soon enough to our table because I kept getting picked up. I was thrown the classic 'My name is Francesco/ Romeo, I am the director/ photographer of a modeling agency from Milan' lines, though this time it was for real. Their models were at the table right next to ours.   Again, it was a great night out which could have been better if blah blah blah, but I am glad we didn't as we had a plane to catch tomorrow and I want to look human when we board it.   Staying up too late and having baggages under our eyes are not good looks.   We went back to that coffeeshop below Chrissy's to eat again. I was drunk, as planned, and crashed.   Sad to know that we are leaving tomorrow :o(."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"This is a warning.  Should any of you see a 5'4"" Sri Lankan man with a chesire grin and who answers to 'Shazam', RUN.  He is known to make sick people go out.    [rewind to 12 hours ago]  I worked till 8pm last night and went to get Jelts from Shazam's after work. Shazam was going to meet Sandra, and her sis + brother-in-law later on, but we didn't want to go out.  I had been sniffling all day, using up a whole office-sized bog paper and turning my dustbin at work into a work of art called 'The Legacy of Dead Trees'. Washing my hair and then tucking myself into bed with a large bottle of water and my book after a long day's work sounds like heaven.  So Shazam wanted to drop us off at home before he goes to Attica to meet those people.  Bad idea.  He'd been trying to convince us to please join them. Something about him being lost in Frog-land.  But I already had images of me in Sleep-land.  I must admit that it didn't take much for me (since I was the sick one, I get to decide whether we succumb to the idea of socialising in cold places with loud music that serve alcohol) to tell Uncle Cabby to please wait for us at the house for five minutes while I change so we could all go to Clarke Quay.  Being sandwiched in the back of a taxi with these two men have the kind of effect that positive ions have on you. It's like you could do anything (I was wrong by the way).  So both Jelts and I changed out of our work wear and the rest, as they say, is shooters.  We want to Attica first then to the 1nitestand and Crazy Elephant before ending up at Liquidroom - it's been SO long! I'll tell you something funny; my nose stopped leaking somehow.  Was it because I was in my elements? A thought. Guess bright lights, friends and alcohol have the same effect on urbanites as greens, fresh air and birds chirping do on country dwellers.  Scary thought.  Anyway Chris is having people come to sanitize our air cons, carpet and phones coz the office had turned into a vicious cesspool of germs and viruses. I needed to get out of there and weird thing - when I left the office to work from home, I realised that I don't remember how I got to work.  Going home was a good idea.  Gotta get some work done now."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Ever since we got that great little unit, my mind had indulged itself in mental interior decorating. I find it highly distracting when I am trying to summarise feature length copies on topics like wines and Australian trains for the rag’s website.   A typical thought process goes like this:   … and the two-carriage Savannahlander can accommodate up to 120 passengers on the three-night round trips into outback towns…   Should we clean the new house up or pack our stuff first?    … and such double-lengthers can take you across one end of Australia and down the other in two or three nights…   Maybe we can do both first – but I’ll need the help of Linda the Filipino…      … all you need is two bottles of wine and enough self-control to drink only one of them…    Oh, don’t know if she is still wants to work for me… the last time she asked for work, I was never home enough to render her services useful.    … facelift that Athens is going through right now is reported to only be complete a day before the Olympics on August 13…     We need shoe racks.

QWLJY8F,female,26,"So it’s all set that the usual suspects a.k.a. Jelte and me, Shazam and Kro, Eda and Sandra, and Hooker & Big John are going to Batam tomorrow till Sunday. There was a minor melee yesterday when found out that Sri Lankans and Cloggies (Dutch) need to apply for visa at embassy, unlike the rest of us higher mortals. But then Shazam has got Brit passport and Kro has got Canadian one, so only Jelts is in the piss. And he was so looking forward to going… not after Pangkor’s cancellation that this is happening… So the whole crew starting asking people everywhere for advise/ favours. At the end of yesterday, Hooker confirmed that Jelts wouldn’t be needing any special visa after all. Well and good but Big John just told me over MSN this morning that his golf course contacts in Batam said he msut apply for visa by 3pm today. I have been calling the Indonesia Embassy since 9.45am… there are no more “we’re closed for holidays” message like yesterday but there is no reply, it is always busy… cross fingers…   Answer the goddamn phone, people!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I spent most of my Sunday reading  Cave Bear's  sequel,  the Valley of the Horses . These  Children of the Earth  series are pretty damn good. They must be, I spent a good part of a nice hot day with my nose buried in one.  We were invited to Shazam's last night, Sandra cooked boiled carrots as well as boiled leeks with mayo. Served with Mr Boon's chicken. Not bad. I ate leeks. I had to tell myself we were only going for pre-movie drinks at his place, with snacks. But it wasn't so bad. I didn't feel like running away from the table. Maybe we can still go to Big John's, if his offer to dazzle us with his culinary skills on Weds still stands.   After dinner, we hooked up with Hooker at Great World. Jelts and I surprised them with GV Grand tix for 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The crew was chuffed, it was great. They've never been, only I have. We shared a bottle of champagne before the film. Inside the cinema, we had top class recliner seats - great to sleep on, though for once when I should have, I didn't - and blankeys and we were served the nuggets, wedges, Cokes and popcorn that we pre-ordered. Wholesome decadence.   Cool epic film about the ruins of this young earth to watch on a lazy Sunday. Nice way to wrap up our well-behaved weekend."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"(a continuation of 'Misfit')   ""So I laid me down to sleep, Prayed the Lord my breakfast to keep; If I puked before I wake,  Prayed the Lord my head won't break.""   Yes, exercise did all these to me. I was kidding my existence when I believed myself to still be out of breath when we reached home yesterday. I went to the confines of bed to contemplate my sorry state but all I felt was how my head felt like it was too small for my - ahem - large brain. I felt nauseous, felt like hurling up the solo egg and four beers breakfast that I had all day, all day.   And those things for 'breakfast' was only the beginning of my mistakes. I began to wonder if I would ever feel okay again. When this morning I do, I feel like it's my duty to tell all you people what I did wrong in my heartfelt attempts to keep my heart performing at optimum level for at least once in my life.    1) Eat something substantial before or during the exercise:  I had a fried egg and a toast in the morning. Everyone else had lunch too (at the time when I stupidly drank beers!). No one else suffered from the nausea like me - I was practically starving by 5pm without realising it. Jelte explained, ""Since you don't execrise at all, you hardly have any muscles to be burnt when you cycled. Thus, the energy you used came from what you have eaten. You haven't eaten much so it has taken quite a toll on you.""  If you fail to have eaten and are suffering afterwards, pray that you live with people who'd fix a high-protein meal for you. Cora saved my life with egg salad sandwiches.    2) Do not drink only half a small bottle water plus four mugs of beer when cycling 20 kilometers:  Instead, take sips of at least a big bottle of water.  Only.  No beers - beers, like all alcoholic drinks, are diuretics. We all know it, including me but no one remembers it until its too late. That's what happened yesterday; even Jelte forgot to keep me in check when I was treating exercising like a night out clubbing. They sap the juice out of you and that's what causes migraines - when your body is dehydrated and the sun is slapping you from all directions. What I had was a minor heatstroke.     3) Keep up the fluid intake and eat small amounts throughout the rest of the day:  That evening, we went to the Dutch Club for dinner and there was an event happening. I still felt a little out of whack. I stayed away from all alcohol and stuck with water. Jelte's beer went down my throat like sandpaper! And I couldn't eat. Food made me want to throw up. I managed to stab at a few salad leaves, some chunks of beef, no chocolate mousse. Shazam & Sandra (who are now more or less an item, FYI), and Hooker joined us there later, and later we moved to the bar. Played some pool and after 12 glasses of water, I could finally down a G&T. That's all. We went to Adam Food Centre after that, not a club - what a healthy-lifestyle day - and there I ate more, half a mee goreng.  So there you go! If you are thinking of exerting yourself in the name of health, please follow these simple rules I have newfound respect for. I will try again two weeks later (going to Batam next week), and will tell you how that one goes : )"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Went home for dinner last night and Mummy has outdid herself again! The promise of pizzas was piled on with her mean chicken curry, sardine courtesy of Bobo, and fried eggs courtesy of Bug. And the apple pie! It looked good; am sure Loobz will concur, but I forgot to eat it. Mum made so much pizza - mine was the size of a table but we were going out so cannot lug tables around, lah.  After dinner we went to Post bar at One Fullerton. Shazam and Hooker were already there by the time we finished eating so I couldn't take Heidi to get her ears pierced. Actually I didn't realise that she wanted me to take her when she called me the night before. Anyway, after Post, we walked to Boat Quay and decided that curry was a good idea. It was during this time that I start to lose my voice. After curry we went to Shazam's to sit out the time before the Holland vs Germany game at 2.30am.  It was fantastic! Not the game - which was a little like watching octogenarians do the rumba - but the atmosphere at the Hollandse Club. At stupid o'clock in the morning, we were sprawled on the floor next to 8-year old boys (and girls), craning our necks up to watch the game on the projector screen. I was in my pink pajama pants and a Calvin Klein (I just found today) T-shirt that Cora got me; emblazoned across the chest with an orange rectangle of German news that carried a picture of a Dutch player lurching his spit in the direction of a German one. Hip hip, Hurray! I don't know how to talk about the game the sporty way.   The Germans scored one before the Cloggies did. It was Van Nilsterooy. Was at the 80th minute, it's a tie! We whooped and I knocked the beer of Monique whose legs I was sitting between, all over her front and my hair.   Guys - watch Channel i News at 8.30pm - we were chanting (I only did a Milli Vanilli lip sync act) the ""te de de  de de de... Aan vallen!"" I have never heard of before in my life. But I did it with the Cloggies at the Dutch Club. I am, from this morning onwards, an honorary Dutch Lady. We did with such gusto all for the television dah-lings. So catch us on the silverscreen tonight.   And Friday, we will do this all again."

QWLJY8F,female,26,"This cold goes round and round, I tell you. I ain't the only person who got it again after recovering from an earlier one. Dammit - my nose is falling off my face. Aaaaaaaaah.  I had a good laugh by  myself just now coz I remembered what happened at home this morning.   I was fixing toasts and I asked him what he wanted on his. The bloke ignored me - think he was walking around the house, thinking - and I was getting irritated, what with trying to feed us and getting my nose to stop flowing.  I asked him again, I might have yelled  by this time, and I had to smile when he said ""Toothpaste!""  Ha, ha... it's a little hard to be angry when someone said he wanted toootpaste on his toast.  Someone suggested that I put tampons up my nose. Grrr!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Just got keys to our new (doll)house in Toa Payoh.   It's so tiny - I love it! It's got one bedroom, a kitchenette, loo + shower, living room. I think if my mom wasn't around just now, Jelts would be as excited as I :o).   It's very clean and newly-renovated too. And the neighbourhood is filled with food centres and shops. Thank God we are ten floors up; the hustle and bustle is not a problem.   But it's smaller than I thought. I don't know where Dickhead can keep his stuff. He'd have to keep his personal belongings in the living room! My stuff would probably over flow out of the bedroom. Maybe it's better that I let him have it. Rather than us getting into one another's hair.   Will have to discuss this with him."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"There was not one type of alcohol that we did not drink last night. From champagne to beer to vodka to caiprinhas and back to champagne again. And then B52s and pina colada and caiprinhas and more champagne. Let's just say, the combined alcohol we consumed was enough to get a rocket going. And as if Thumper - which is a FAB club  btw - wasn't enough, we also went to INK.  Yes we are a highly irrational bunch. Especially considering that it was a bloody schoolnight.  Thank God I don't feel half as bad as Jelte (and Sarah and Jason, and I highly suspect also Shazam, Sandra and Hooker). I am only very sleepy now. I have already told my editor Sarah that I am going to sleep under my desk when she called just now. She had overslept from too much drinks last night (what are we like?) (it was The Queen's birthday yesterday).   But my heart goes out to my poor little pumkin kitten Jelte! He crashed out when we came home and I was fixing us a snack. I didn't wake him up cause I thought he was so tired. I should have. I feel so guilty now. Because I didn't wake him up, he didn't drink a litre of water before sleeping. The water is essential damage control against hangovers. Without it, Jelts get the Mother of hangovers. And that's what he is suffering from right now as I prance about the office laughing and joking with my colleagues, telling then how great last night was.   I will never let him sleep after a big night out without drinking a litre of water again. Seeing him this morning was painful for me. I think he is suffering from a hangover for the both of us. Jason just walked into office. The minute he saw me, he curled up into a ball and whimpered 'no'. He said I am evil, that he will never go out with me again because he is also hungover.   I feel so guilty because I did not let us go home after Thumper. I feel guilty because I am not suffering from a hangover : (.  I do reek of alcohol though. Light a match in front of my breath and you will get fireworks going.  And oh yeah - Ray Charles is dead."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I think my  belly button might fall off. Here I am sitting down at my desk when I had this urge to say hello to it. Then I saw that where the piercing was done, it's close to the surface. So I can see the stem of my stud through my skin. it's like looking at my belly button bone or something."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I have taken over the editorial side of things. So naturally, when my hair got on my nerves this morning, it was dirty, shapeless and in need of a trim, I had to book an appointment at the salon across the street.   Back to work, I am seriously shovelling. Liasing with a thousand people about issues of August to December. Sarah left vague instructions to all as she was in a great hurry and they have been calling, e-mailing, and coming to the office to sort things out with me. Fucking hell, I was so stressed out busy I had to take a Lexotan to slow down my heart rate.   So my day is indescribable because hey, didn’t I go to the hair salon during office hours? But people don’t realise that it’s because I am too busy to fucking even wash my hair. After showing my face at potential advertisers, Breitling, event at IndoChine, I have a fashion show to go to tonight. I cannot afford to look like what the cat dragged in. Yes it sounds glam and all, and it is, but they are both also work. I have to be at the fashion show to make nice to a Japanese fashion mogul Mr Shiirashi with Hiroko my colleague. What is really nice for me though is that they allow me to invite my friends. So no wonder people think that I am actually not busy and stressed out.   Please, please open your mind. Look beyond the pink bag and hairdryer-blown hair. I got to go places to be places. And who says champagne doesn’t help, especially with my friends with me? (remember my earlier blog about me being socially inept sometimes.. believe it or not).  Sigh.   PS. Heineken gave me two passes for their event this Saturday and guess what? I just won two more via email!!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I can’t shake off this uneasy feeling. It has made itself home on my conscience since Friday night. I am having nightmares as a result.   What do you do when someone at the party got too drunk? How much is too drunk? Too drunk according to you, or according to that person?  How long should you wait?  The reason I asked is because I initiated for someone be sent home from Friday night. And till now I’ve been questioning my own judgement.   It wasn’t that early, around 6am. For the past two hours, he was rather off his tree. My intentions were clear – I didn’t want anybody hurt. Particularly after he had broken one of the host’s photoframes. I jumped to catch his fall twice after that.   I sounded the host of the party for his opinion. He wasn’t too happy with the guy either but he was willing to wait and see if he would do any more damage.   But each time the guy swayed, each time he lost his balance, as long as he was standing up, he made me nervous.   It is fair to say that I wanted him to leave because I would feel better.  I walked him down to grab a cab. I spoke to him when he was lacing up his shoes. He asked me ‘why’ and I told him in that he was bumping into people and things and it was making us nervous.   Today I sent him a text message. I apologised about that evening, hoping to see him again soon. There is no reply. I am so worried.   What have I done?"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Five of us ladies at work reshuffled the whole office seating plan yesterday. We were sick of the unproductive lay-out which leaves us with less time for beer everyday :). The art director was sitting near the smoking area, I was pretty much sitting in the stairwell, the circulation manager was sitting beside the goldfish (the other one passed away), the sales team was sitting with the creatives, and the editor was sitting in a box.   The publisher is still in the red-carpeted mezzanine laced with large dark wood furniture.   So for three hours we heaved and we hoed, we went on all fours pondering about the destinations of multicoloured wires, we argued about who owns the pink chair (I do). We did a pretty good job considering that the only two other men - the publisher and the gay boy - were not there. The publisher er, had to go, and the gay boy is still in Koh Samui (having spliffs and riding a Vespa with his soft toy in his backpack, he told me).  After work we celebrated with pints and pool of course (my boy arrived to join the celebrations even though he had little to do with our moving of heavy furniture and removing doorways...).   Came in this morning having to dodge out of the electrician and IT guys' ways. Glad to leave for lunch with a gal fren at noon. I was made to believe that I was attending her office warming but in the end it was beer lunch with her and my renegade ex-boss at BQBar. Apprehensive at first, I was glad to meet up with him after almost half a year. I am still working in the magazine he was fired from. Now I am in her office waiting for us to go to the second floor of this building for a game of pool - the other thing she promised.   It's Friday and there is a Cartier-do to plonk champers at later, a CD launch at Embargo, Fly Entertainment's anniversary at Centro (upstairs from Embargo) and a MediaCorp party at INK, where her boy deejays. My boy will be meeting us at Cartier.  Am I dressed appropriately? I am wearing a white muscle tanktop and dark blue jeans and heels. And my shocking pink handbag. Great! Come on girl let's go!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I haven't had a cigarette since, what? 11.30pm last night? As if that wasn't bad enough, I didn't manage to have coffee at home this morning. I had to chew on Jelts' head a couple of times. Then, it was a torture to go to the coffeeshop near work to order iced coffee without asking for a pack of Marlboro Lights as well.   In the office niw. I need to poo. But can't poo without a fag. It's like having coffee without sugar, lime juice without vodka, a bar without pool table, life without Jelte's head to gnaw on. Ah... Eda has just walked into the office. She will give me one. She walks over to me, ""Beb rokok ada beb?"".   My anticipation deflated. ""But Maria is buying, she's in soon,"" she continued.  There isn't hope yet :)"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Yesterday I felt the worst I have felt in a long time. It wasn’t the machine-gun sneezing. Never mind that I was producing litres of freaking snot. It wasn’t the nasal congestion. And so what my head felt as big as Jupiter. It wasn’t the fact that my Jupiter of a head was blocked. What the hell, I still did my work.   It was because I left at lunchtime because I was so sick and my boss yelled at me. He yelled at me!? In front of the IT guy who’s got a funky body odour! Why didn’t he yell at HIM for smelling so bad?   I was so flabbergasted. I had been stressed out at work, juggling the work of three people. But today, when I know I can't keep my steam up and I had to go early, I made sure people could carry on with their work in my absence.   But when I am as sick as a dog, he spat the dummy at me.   You are so fucking welcome! Thank you for making my life miserable you C-U-Next-Tuesday!  There. But I still don’t feel better. In fucking fact, I am back in the office today, yessiree on a damn Saturday to – you guessed it – do more work.    I haven’t felt this forced, this immense tearing apart from the inside in a while now. The last time I was ever made to feel awfully like shit no matter what I did was when I was in my first relationship. And that lasted a good three-and-a-half years. I thought I am already over and done with my quota of letting people make me feel absolutely the shits.   So I met Jelte after being chased out of the office and you can ask him, I wasn’t a nice person to be around at all. I tried to suppress my unhappiness. But my mind was filled with worry and stress the whole time I was supposed to be getting better.   I was edgy and short-tempered. I was very, very unhappy. I wanted to go back to the office so many times. I struggled with myself. Didn’t I leave the office in good condition? If I went back, it’s as if I was not that sick. Wouldn’t I be demonstrating that I didn’t really have to leave in the first place?  In the end and after a few phone calls to office comrades, I didn’t go back. To show him how fucking dedicated I am, I came back today. To do what? The fucking content page which I had already done, with only the page numbers to be filled in.   Another thing I want to get off my (stuffy) chest is: why do men always say that women nag? Case in point, on weekends, we’d do the housework. Since I am in this godforsaken office now, I reminded him about the laundry he was doing. I had already swept the kitchen floor, cleaned the stove and washed the kwali before coming here. Now he said that I was getting good at nagging.   But I am not upset with him because it may be true. But isn’t there is a reason for everything? (I still don’t think my boss had a good reason for yelling at me though). I may have nagged because he may have forgotten to do certain things. It is a type of reminder that is used more often in dealing with unpleasurable things. But say, I keep badgering to give him a blow-job. Would I still be doing the action of nagging?   Actually, I might still be. If I don’t give a good head then my victim would consider that as harassment. This would mean that, that…. I have entirely derailed my train of thoughts. I have forgotten the whole wonderful point that I had in my head.   Oh well. My happy thought for today is going back home to pick up my guitar.   With what I am going through now (complete and utter confusion?), I may come out with some pretty good stuff this weekend."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I still have not figured out a way to put up my piercing vidoe clip up here.

It was supposed to be spinach pasta in creamy mushroom sauce topped with sausages and onions (I was too lazy to thaw the chix).  But it turned out to be a green slimy monster.  Even the suasages were slippery. The whoel thing was just a big mess.  I wouldn't go near it but sweet, sweet Jelte ate it.  I had Nutella on toast for dinner.  Aaah... have to do some more work now. Have got the damn flu again too, the one I have just recovered from, and the same one my colleagues Hiroko and Shalu are at home because of.  Sarah my still editor - the publisher and her had a fight this morning...  and then they went for lunch!  - said I shouldn't take Clarinase, when I told her I might get some. She said Clarinase made her hearbeat race.  I told you before that it made me go loopy. But I got the fun symptom, she got the scary one. But we decided that perhaps people with anxiety attacks get weird symptoms.  So I thought okay, I will go get some Clarinase when I meet Patrecia at HV later. Alas, she was already home sick.  Everyone is sick.   We all got bird flu - leaky beaks, Big John said."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"It was my birthday and the night before Jelte & I were out celebrating. So we were both quite tired, the party has started and my friends and family were there. But he didn’t show up for my birthday party. He was elusive and unreachable. No one knows where he was. I saw glimpses of him but he never stayed to talk. We went to Tiffany’s and he didn’t really want to be there buying me a ring (I don’t blame him… he he). He didn’t say much; his head is always down and I felt like he was looking for ways to leave me. I was confused, I was at a loss. He refused to talk to me, refused to answer my questions. I was almost begging. I didn’t want the ring anymore; I didn’t like all of this anymore. So I picked the ugliest, the cheapest ring – it was spiral and looked like a normal key ring. Back at the party, Shazam rang me. He was having fun with a girl from upstairs he just met. He was in the toilet. He said ‘this will sound crass, you won’t like it.’ I said tell me please, Jelte been behaving awfully odd! He said Jelte wanted me to know that he has left me. Aargh! I cried and I cried. I threw away the blue Tiffany box and the fucking key chain ring!   I felt like dying! I woke up and Jelte was there beside me and I begged him not to leave me like that! Not on my birthday! Cannot, cannot…   [end of fucking nightmare]  I slept for a grand total of 25 hours this weekend. Last night from 8pm-8am today. The nightmare must be because I slept on a super full stomach. We went to have beers with Joris and then seafood. I ate and I ate. Thai fried chicken, garlic prawns, beef with spring onions, omelete with chicken char siew and shrimps, rice. I couldn’t stop and when we reached home, I had to lie down. I ‘lied down’ till today morning.  And my tummy hurts! Felt like a rock. I think the food is still indigested, all rotting in my stomach. I feel so disgusted. I will drink Yakult later, when I can find one."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"That’s the clock ticking very loudly in my head. Not the biological variety, you purists, I am talking about deadlines. My sitting on my arse have finally brought me to the day that all my deadlines have conspired for. This is the day when I have to file in MUSIC REVIEWS, GALLERY INTERVIEWS, WEDDINGS and lastly and this is the best part – a wedding A-list. For the best money can buy, a Vera Wang dress, a Tiffany ring, shoes by Stuart Weitzman, a limited edition clutch by Lulu Guinness… aaargh! I don’t even know what to wear tonight!  Tonight we are going to the media opening of a swank new joint uptown called – fittingly enough for me – Thumper. Should I don that new black waistless dress or should I just turn up in this white T I just bought last night that I am wearing now? It’s got a pleated shoulder and pretty tribal decoration in pink all over the front. I can just go home and change into my gold heels and pink bag. If I were to wear that dress, I’d have to shave my legs first. And my hair! My hair! I slept on it wet last night and it’s grown all crumpled.   Deadlines! Shit! Have to write Mahen and Nadia’s wedding story first – damn! Where’s my tape recorder?!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"He sat me down when I got in and I told him everything. He was rather amused by it all (well, he actually told me 'you amuse me' last night when I managed to burn our dinner potatoes with our daging masak kicap). Then he ran up to the room to get us cigarettes to smoke while we try to flag down a cab outside (we didn't manage to score a freecab) but when I was waiting for him outside the house, I got a cab instantly.   Arrived at work, 10.20am."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"We got home at almost 7am last night, from football. Woke up and found text messages from Shazam. They were at Substation and asked us to join for lunch. Jelts was ill from alcohol/ wan tan noodles poisoning. I fixed him eggs and toast to soak up the bad stuff from his tummy. But my slimy egg yolk (the way he likes it, actually, what have I done wrong!) encouraged vomit to projectile out of his guts. And thus, he did not feel nauseas anymore now. But he did have a pretty bad case of diarrhoea for most part of the day...  There was a Punk Rock music event at Substation. I felt liberalised just looking at their outfits. The geek/ corporate look is in, according to the punksters. The girls were decked in shirt and jacket over mini skirt. Hair pulled back with scrunchies and a clip to tuck fringes away from faces. Fishnet stockings and white socks with Doc Marten’s (I didn’t realise you can still get those) finish the look. Boys had thick glasses on, skinny pants, bomber jackets, fur even!, on tartan – another favourite design – with black boots. Everyone danced like ronggeng like that. It was Ska Society. The music was part ethnic, part tribal, part screams part synthesizer. I was flabbergasted to see the young uns on stage, singers screaming words out and a full brass band playing along. Trombones, trumpets, cornets, saxophones.    Sunday brunch at Substation   urlLink     The kids drank Coca Cola while they danced to punk rock while we stood around taking pictures and drinking frozen margaritas. Because we can hee hee. I tried jumping like them to the music but my tits almost fell out of my singlet so I had to stop. After lunch we left to eat, err, another lunch at Great World City. We wanted to book Gold Class tickets anyway.  Walked around GWC, followed Hooker look at sofas. Six people enquiring about the one chocolate leather sofa. Heh. Walked around furniture some more and Jelte waited for us at cinema. He hates shopping. Me too but I was having fun getting lost in mock living rooms.   Wanted to watch Hairy Prata 3 but they had no 9pm tix and Gold Class is shwoing crappy Around the World. So we settled for Troy in Normal Cinema Number X. Went to Shazam’s to watch the rest of Sex season 6 and wait for 9pm (have to return to Jason tomorrow)(fuck! I forgot to remind Coxi to buy for me from Jakarta!).   The guys and Sandra laughed at Troy but I cried. They thought it was overtly dramatised but to me, it’s mythology so more than a little exaggeration is in order. Actually I think Hooker likes it too. Jelte found it okay. Shazam thought Brad Pitt is too pretty.   Took a cab home. I got no more money so Jelte paid for everything. At home, I finished reading Valley of Horses! Now, The Mammoth Hunters."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"DONUT DRAMA   You know that you have been together for awhile when you have little arguments over everything.  If I say black, he says white and vice versa.    Last night we drove up to the  Krispy Kreme Donuts  on Ponce De Leon.  I'm not a big donut person, but since I did not find tiramisu last night, I wanted something sweet.  (Doesn't tiramisu sound like a giant drag queen that should cha cha through downtown Tokyo and battle Godzilla?) I decided a chocolate-frosted cake donut would be perfect.  Jeff can always be talked into going to  Krispy Kreme .  On entering the building, they had a picture of their  Donut of the Month , which was a strawberry shortcake donut.  I decided I must have one, but alas, there were no strawberry shortcake donuts at the inn.  Why would you be out of your  Donut of the Month?  In fact, there were no chocolate-frosted cake donuts either.  I ordered two chocolate-frosted regular donuts.  We decided to get half dozen.  Jeff ordered two glazed and one jelly-filled.  I ordered a caramel-filled donut in addition to the other two.    Upon arriving home, I discovered that in place of my chocolate-frosted regular donuts, the guy behind the counter gave me some chocolate-frosted cream-filled donuts.  YUCK! I just wanted a feral chicken to fly in the kitchen and peck my eyes out.  Could anything possibly go right?!  I ate the caramel-filled donut and went to bed.  This morning I got up and was going to eat my donuts, which I really shouldn't be eating anyway since I'm on a quest to have a stomach that I can grate cheese on by this summer.   Jeff offered to give me one of his glazed donuts after the previous night's donut trauma.  I asked him if he wanted one of these chocolate donuts.  Jeff didn't answer.  He asked me if I wanted a glazed donut again.  We went round and round for a few minutes.  It reminded me of the Georgia State Legislative session all over again.  I eventually decided to eat both of the chocolate donuts since Jeff really likes the glazed donuts and it wasn't his fault they guy gave me the wrong donuts.  Then Jeff is put out with me because I didn't eat one of his glazed donuts.  I know he meant well and offered me his glazed donut out of love, but I was already feeling out of it as it was and now I just wanted to stick a donut up his butt and spin it on my finger.    I took a deep breath and let it go.  I looked at him and said, ""I appreciate your offer, but I just decided to eat the donuts that the guy gave me.  I know how much you enjoy the glazed.""  Then I brushed my teeth and went to church.    Later after lunch, we were sitting around the dining room table reading the Sunday newspaper.  He got up and I said, ""You know even when everything is blah, thinking about you still brightens my mood.""  He got up and hugged me and I felt better.    If I have learned one thing in six and a half years, it is that you always have to keep working at relationships.  Sometimes just saying little things can go a long way.  You may not always be on your best behavior, but if your partner knows you're doing the best you can at that moment, they'll usually work with you."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"BEASTMOMMA SPEAKS   Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, asked me to call her tonight to get the information for her pre-qualification for a mortgage.  I found it interesting that Adam from The C-Blog will be visiting in a week or so and I was about to speak with Beastmomma, both of whom are people I would have never met without my blog.  Jaspreet and I had a wonderful conversation.  We took care of the loan information first and then discussed her first boyfriend from the eighth grade, George Walter Booth.  Isn't that a great name?  She met him in Catholic school and they carried on a torrid hand-holding affair behind the nuns' bad habits.  She admitted to not being an outdoorsy girl.  We laughed a lot and discussed some deep things but never got too deep in anything.  I'm looking forward to lunch on Sunday.  I have to figure out what her rising sign is for horoscope.  Oddly enough, I never read horoscopes.  She told me that I had a slight southern drawl, which is interesting.  Most people don't think I have a southern accent."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"GOOD WRITERS GROUP MEETING TONIGHT   We had a great meeting tonight.  A new guy named Charles showed up and shared a very interesting story.  He only read the first three pages, but I'm dying to read the rest of it.  He has the most interesting writing voice.  It sounds very classical or like literature.  Tim and I went on and on about two minor characters, but they introduce us through their words to one important character in the story as well as the main character sitting behind them.  I like the main character.  She's a saucy bitch!  I shared the next installment of my piece entitled ""Exfoliation.""  I put it of and put it off and finally I banged it out in about an hour before the meeting.  It actually turned out quite well.  So what was the big deal about?  I guess I have had my mind on my change in the work situation and little else as of late.  One of the characters uses some profanity, which doesn't sound like a big deal until you are reading it out loud to someone you have never met before.  I have been known to swap a choice word or two as of late, but I know a lot of different words and I like to use them.  It's rare to hear me cuss that much anymore.  It sort of bothers 2F's too.  Then I went on to write a sex scene, which is always a bit awkward too.  You wonder whether you should write ""penis,"" ""turgid member,"" ""dick,"" or ""throbbing cock.""  It's a fine line that I walk between literature and pornography.  Charles gave me some very positive feedback.  Since it was his first meeting, he had not read the first part of the story and I didn't want to make him a prisoner of my story for half an hour.  Technically, it has some rough spots because I haven't had the opportunity to go back and edit it.  There was one part that I had a tough time getting down on paper.  I had the beginnig of the argument and I knew the ending so I wrote the ending and then the middle was easy to write.  I'm cocerned that I am so easily manipulated by myself.  Tim arrived a little bit late.  He was at a neighborhood association meeting or something similar.  (See my post from this morning.)  I can always rely on Tim to find technical typos.  It's definitely one of his gifts. It's also interesting how sometimes we can be in perfect agreement on feedback and other times we think as different as night and day or interpret something exactly opposite from one another.  I am thankful for that because then we are able to give a variety of opinions to other writers.  Utlimately, it's up to them to decide what to do with the feedback anyway.  Afterwards, we talked about our favorite writers and books that we hae read.  We challenged each other to do a book report on a book we have read within the next month.  We discussed having a Atlanta Gay Writers showcase of work related to gay pride on the Thursday before Gay Pride.  We also challenged each other to write a piece of no more than 2,000 words that has something to do with testosterone.  This should be interesting."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"""NO MORE NASTY NOSE HAIRS!""   I received an e-mail from Kathleen Williams wth the above caption in the subject line.  I do not know Kathleen, but she got my attention.  Today was a long day.  I was in the office by 9am and out by 9:30pm.  More loans are coming in.  Robert and I did the power struggle dance today, but we ended today on a good note.  Telemarketing did not go so well.  Tomorrow is a new day.  2F's was out tonight having dinner with a friend and arrived home at 11:30pm.  I think he had been drinking because he was being exceptionally silly.  He asked why I was watching the David Lynch version of  Dune  on the Sci Fi channel.  I replied, ""Because I can.""  I had just been flipping channels, but I just wanted to watch it through from that point.  However, I need to rent the movie and and watch the whole thing one day.  Ironically, the Sci Fi Channel showed a very good miniseries of  Dune  a couple of years ago.  I did some ironing tonight while I watched  The Go-Go's: Live At The Greek .  Boy, 1984 seems just like yesterday.  Jane Wiedlin looked perturbed a lot.  I guess it was the same time she was planning to leave the band for a solo career so she could finally sing her own damn songs.  Afterwards, I went online to see if I could find the video for  Totally Go-Go's , which is a much better concert.  I found three, but they were of dubious quality.  Before Bananarama, there was the Go-Go's.  I've almost finished the weblog book and then I will move onto the book on how to host a salon.  The DSL modem arrived today... at my former job.  Why?  I don't know.  I did not give them that address.  I wasn't asked either.  I guess I'll try to go by and get it tomorrow.  D. came by today.  He's a pretty courageous guy.  After many years, he is finally embracing recovery from alcohol and prescription drugs.  He made a close friend with another guy at the group.  They went to movies and played sports together.  They guy called him on Friday to tell D. that he loved him like a brother.  A few days later, D. went to pick up his friend to take him to their support meeting.  Come to find out, the guy shot and killed himself.  He had been struggling with depression.  If you have a moment, have a kind thought for him."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"TEMPER, TEMPER    My friend, Steve, sent me this and it's a gentle, but funny reminder to keep our cool at all times.   A stressed-out woman on a busy boulevard was tailgating a man. Suddenly, the light turned yellow, just in front of him. He did the right thing, stopping at the crosswalk, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection.  The tailgating woman hit the roof, and the horn, screaming in frustration as she missed her chance to get through the intersection with him. As she was still in mid-rant, she heard a tap on her window and looked up into the face of a very serious police officer.  The officer ordered her to exit her car with her hands up. He took her to the police station where she was searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a cell.  After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door. She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with her personal effects.  He said, ""I'm very sorry for this mistake. You see , I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping the guy off in front of you, and cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Follow Me to Sunday School' bumper sticker, and the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk.  Naturally, I assumed you had stolen the car."""
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Another day, another dollar, another headache. Today is my 3rd and final day to sit in for the president’s assistant. This morning, he gave me a box of 4 chocolates that he got at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington DC last week. I’m saving them for dessert! No leftovers for lunch; Subway instead. It’s double stamp day!!    So what else is new? They say that today is an “Indian Summer” day – which for us means that the high for today is 69. I’m all for Indian Summer days!   In today’s HEADLINES dept: A man is suing Wheel of Fortune host, Pat Sajak, over a hug he received on the show that he claims hurt his back so bad, he needed surgery and months of rehab. A Michigan man survived a plunge over Niagara Falls. He wore no protective devices, etc., just the clothes on his back. Amazing, but now he’s wearing handcuffs and is sitting in some holding cell somewhere in Ontario. I’m currently reading a story on the Times Picayune website about this bacterium that appears as a small bump and then swells and is very painful. As it turns out, this mysterious little bacterium is resistant to penicillin, etc. It’s very contagious. I’ll let you know how it turns out.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"PERFECT DAY   Business has been picking up and I'm glad.  I've been focusing on the positive, setting new goals and trying new things.  It seems to be paying off and I have already surpassed my goals for the month.  It's a bit overcast today, but the temperature is so pleasant.  Buddy has decided to spend the day inside in her little cat bed. I think she's just trying to throw me off.  She's plotting something.  I started the South Beach Diet again yesterday.  I got a bit too crazy after the Canadians came and I was having trouble settling down.  Needless to say, I wasn't feeling very good physically.  Processed foods and refined sugars make me feel awful after I eat them.  It's amazing how much better I feel already.  I bought the South Beach Diet Cook Book with one of the Borders gift cards my sister sent me for my birthday last year.  I also picked up David Sedaris' new book too. They were both on sale so I didn't have to pay a dime.  I'm always amazed at all of the delicious foods you can make from other things.  For example, you can make mashed potatoes out of cauliflower.  It tastes just like real mashed potatoes, but without all the startches.  I was shocked to discover that my BMI is right at the top of what it should be for my age and height.  It's the same situation with my height.  I'm in good shape, I just want be in a little better shape.  We're supposed to go to the beach sometime before the summer's over and I would like to look a little more fabulous than I do now and maintain it.  Why is it that people in general find it so hard to eat in the way they should to take care of their bodies?  We brush our teeth.  We go to the doctor.  Why is it so hard to try to eat the foods that are good for us and eat only the other foods in moderation?"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Ah! Elevator Episodes! What are Elevator Episodes, you ask? Well, you see, at work I go down for coffee every afternoon around 2:30 pm with some friends. When the mood strikes us and there isn't anyone else in the elevator we work with, we start these louder-than-usual conversations about random things - can't get into details. We like to stay covert in our operations. It's funny when one our lips are quivering because we're having a hard time keeping a straight face or we're counting floors because we're about to pop a stitch. I wonder if we're really having as much fun as we think we're having or if we're just delirious by that point in the day. Ah, who cares.  My Dad sent me the following today and I just had to share: Southernisms  Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit.  It's been hotter'n a goat's butt in a pepper patch.  He fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down.  It's so dry the trees are bribing the dogs.  He's as country as cornflakes.  This is gooder'n grits.  Busier than a cat covering crap on a marble floor.  If things get any better, I may have to hire someone to help me enjoy it.  I'm bout as nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  Busy as a moth in a mitten.  Happy as a clam at high tide."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY   We're having a progressive dinner party on Sunday.  Somehow I ended up being in charge of it.  Maybe it's because I had all the e-mail addresses and phone numbers.  It starts at 6pm and lasts until 9pm.  Four of our neighbors' homes will be opened up for a different course.  The first course is drinks and appetizers, followed by soups and salads, the main course and side dishes and then desserts and coffee.  It was a big success last year and we live on a fun block.  Almost everyone is either named Jeff or Susan.  I'm still trying to get the final head count.  We have more people being added to the list each day, mostly from outside our block.  The more the Maryier I always say.  The more the Rhodaier..... No, it's better the other way.  Anyway, it seems like we have more people waiting until the last week to decide what they will bring and Jeff and I are deciding what we will bring based upon where we are short items.  It should be a lot of fun.  I think I'm going to make something out of my  1001 Chocolate Delights  book.  I bought it earlier this year when I was on the first two weeks of the South Beach Diet.  I was holding the book sideways and looking at the pictures of the desserts as if they were porn.  It's a great diet, but I'm glad I'm beyond the restrictive phase now.  I telling Jeff the other day that there are lots of opportunities for businesses to cash in on the gay market.   I said, ""You know we could make a killing off selling custom penis cakes over the Internet.""  Jeff looked at me wryly and said, ""Don't you think someone has already taken that market?""  I threw my head back and laughed.  ""Oh Jeff, you're such a card.  Why you make it sound like gay men think about sex constantly.""  Hahahahaha!"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"I WAS ASKED TO SAVE THE CHILDREN, BUT I SAID THAT I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT    A girl representing Save The Children came to my door and spoke with me about sponsoring a child.  I believe she was on the up and up, but I wanted to think about it.  I don't like to make financial commitments off the cuff.  Evidently you had to make your decision right now.  She had halitosis and I found it distracting.  I wanted to offer her gum or a breath mint and wondered if that was why she had not signed more people up.  I told her that I would go to the Web site and research the information.  If I felt inclined, I would sign up that way.  She thanked me for listening to her.  I guess some people just close the door in her face.  I admire her for getting out and doing something she believes in.  She doesn't have to do it.  Still, what if she is getting paid to do this?  What if she is doing it for community service for getting caught drinking and driving.  I think I'll choose to believe her intentions were of the altruistic variety."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Another busy day! After I left work 35 minutes late yesterday, the plan to get these presentation books copied & out the door (via overnight to L.A.) was for me to walk the book about 5 or 6 blocks to Kinko’s and have them make the 27 copies over the course of about 2 hours. Then I would have to go pick them up, bring them back to the office, hole-punch and then spiral-bind each one. Oh, and insert dividers for each of the 3 section. Not too bad, except that I wasn’t going to get the presentation until around Noon. Now, all of that has changed. Our Production Dept. will be able to complete the job on time for me to send them out today. However, I am now at the Production Dept’s beck & call for the rest of the day. Oh well, so much for a nice leisurely day without the boss.  On the laundry front, I was supposed to do them on Sunday; however, I kept Jackson on Sunday and didn’t get a chance to do them. Mondays are too busy to do them after work. So then my plan was to prep them and do them just as soon as I walked in the door from work yesterday. As noted, I was about 45 minutes late getting home yesterday so that ruled laundry duty. But today is the day!! I don’t care if I’m doing them at 10 o’clock tonight because we need our underwear back!! I’m trying to clear up my Thursday night so that I can go over to Amanda’s and meet her cousin. Friday night, Olivia, Chris and I are going to the Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden. We might even be able to score some backstage passes and party with the band afterward since Amanda’s cousin is a groupie and can get us in. This all remains to be seen since I haven’t actually met this cousin of hers. If we don’t party with the band, then I think Olivia and I will be going to Hogs & Heffers, which is the bar made famous by the movie Coyote Ugly. I plan on recovering Saturday, so that rules out laundry on that day! Busy, busy!  OK, now off to find some lunch and then back to the grindstone!"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"RANDOM BRAIN PURGE   I'm happy to report that I seem to have moved beyond the black cloud that had settled upon me last week.  I'm now beginning to pick up where I left off.  If I owe you an e-mail, please be patient.  I have a lot of deadlines this week and I will get back with you as soon as I meet those.  It was a little hard to concentrate yesterday morning, but by 1:11pm, I moved into hyper drive and seemed to finally have a break through with my Powerpoint presentation.  I'll finish that up this morning.  I went to the gym yesterday evening.  There was a new guy there who was certainly inspirational.  I think he was attractive.  Ironic as it sounds, I really don't pay attention to guys in that way at the gym.  I go to work out, do it and then leave.  Anyway, he was about my body type, maybe a little bigger frame and gave me a good idea of the direction I'm heading.  I've gained a lot of strength over the past few months and I'm lifting more weight now than I ever have.  I should really begin using some protein powder.  The interesting thing to note is that I seemed to have made more progress this time by just showing up and working out and not really having any goals to bulk up and have the perfect body.  I think there may be some wisdom there.  I'll continue to meditate on that and get back with you.  I read my chapter this week in  The Quest For Prayer , which is a book we're studying at church.  I'm actually getting ahead because they are taking more time with the old book.  As I was reading last night, I had the feeling that I really needed to be reading this book at just this moment.  I've always been confused about what prayer really should be.  In the chapter, the argument is made that we don't really pray to ""get things,"" we pray to experience God.  There explanation is somewhat like meditation.  The authors, Mary-Alice & Richard Jafolla, state that there are three phases to prayer: surrender; stillness and letting God.  It is through this practice that people and situations change, not because we have asked God to change them, but because we are ourselves have been changed.  The proof that prayer works is that we are exhibiting loving kindness.  Interesting!  So this morning I experienced the stillness and it was very powerful for me.  Then I opened my e-mail and had a big fat opportunity to bestow loving kindness upon someone I am experiencing frustration with on the volunteer front.  I think I did pretty well.  No blood was shed.  Jeff and I tested the shower upstairs and the leak into the den seems to be fixed.  We'll patch the hole up this weekend.  Some friends of Jeff are tentatively scheduled to visit in about two weeks.  As I look around the house with holes in the ceiling and boxes of books everywhere and my desk in the center of the den, I can only throw my head back and laugh like those little kids on the  Peanuts  cartoon specials.  It will come together.  One of my clients just called.  The closing that was scheduled for today has been postponed due to a stop work order from the city.  Evidently there is a septic tank issue.  I threw my head back and laughed again.  I'm glad I don't live paycheck to paycheck because this loan probably won't close for another few weeks.  Come to think of it, this is the loan that my boss encouraged me to use a 15-day lock on.  I should have used a 60-day lock.  In other news, I was able to borrow the photographs again from my neighbor that I had previously scanned and were lost in the hard drive fiasco.  I scanned about half last night and I should be able to get everything together for this year's historic calendar.  I went to bed early last night, about 11:18pm for me.  The windows were open and I could hear a dog barking in the distance.  The sheets were cool and soft and I leaned back against my favorite, fluffy pillow and began reading Steve Martin's  Shopgirl .  He is such a fantastic writer.  I so want to be him.  Here's a little spook fact for you.  Steve Martin lived in Waco, Texas and I lived in Waco, Texas, but not at the same time.  Weird, huh?  I've got a big day ahead of me.  Robert is coming down around 1:00pm and we are going to work on the presentation for the home buyers workshop.  Tomorrow is a meeting with a business networking group that has a mortgage seat open. I will vy for it along with a few others.  We'll see how it goes.  I need to review my short story and book review for tomorrow's writers group meeting here at the house and go to the neighborhood association meeting tonight.  Somwhere in there, I'm going to jump rope or run.  It's going to be a Golden Grahams day!"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Wow! Another fantastically boring Monday! Well, I guess that's better than being too busy to sit down at my desk. So I will try not to complain. At lunch today, I went over to The Gap to get my little nephew something for his birthday coming up on the 17th. So I'm at the cash register and the guy says, ""did you buy out the store?"" and I artfully reply, ""well, if the women's section wasn't done entirely in pastels, I would have bought something for myself instead."" Yes, I know I left him reeling in shock but sometimes you just have to put your foot down. I absolutely refuse to wear pastel colors so that I match a gazillion random kids walking down the sidewalks of New York. Not me, buddy. No way.  Speaking of fantastic days, I got the new Mardi Gras rice bag order form in today's mail from Bertrand Rice down in Elton, Louisiana! http://www.bertrandrice.com Check out their site and order something! The couple that owns/runs this little shindig are cousins of mine on my Dad's side. Every time we would go down to South Louisiana to visit, we would stay at their house. David & Lorraine have 3 kids: Jon, Andre & Julie. So much fun!! Jon is in school and is also currently in a band that travels around playing Cajun music. Andre is at McNeese studying hard, I'm sure. Julie is at LSU and running track. My oldest sister, Bridget, sees her from time to time, as Bridget is a grad student at LSU.   Well, I haven't been down to good ole Elton in about 7 years and I sure would like to go again soon. They do an old fashioned Mardi Gras run where all the men dress up and ride horseback along a predetermined route. They start (usually) at my cousin Todd's house for a little breakfast. The men ride their horses while a wagon follows that carries the musicians and the beer. At homes along the route, the Captain of the ""krewe"" will ask for permission for the group to approach the house. Once they have permission, the group sings a song, which asks for a little something to go into the pot for their gumbo. If the owner wishes to contribute a chicken, for example, then they release the live chicken in the yard for the boys to catch. Once the chicken is caught, its neck is wrung and it is tied to one of their horses to be brought back to add to the gumbo. This continues throughout the route and they acquire various ingredients for the gumbo. The ride ends at the local Catholic Church where the women take the goodies the men have brought back and they make their gumbo. All who have contributed are invited to attend and partake in some social gathering and mighty fine gumbo.  OK, off the feel good stuff for a bit. Time to get down to stupid political antics: Amazingly enough, someone (OK, any active Democrat about right now) out there is willing to spend hard earned money to look into whether or not our President went AWOL from the Alabama National Guard in 1972. Granted there's no investigation at this point, but as this is an issue now, it will certainly be an issue later this year during the campaign for the White House. I'm floored - who the hell cares?!? Do you? If you were going to vote for George Bush in November, would this newfound knowledge change your vote? Are we voting on what happened in 1972 (6 years before I was born) or are we voting on what's going on right now in this country and in this wonderful world of ours? Yeah to Kerry who received 3 purple hearts, a bronze star and a silver star in Vietnam. Congratulations. Well done. Kudos. That still doesn't tell me that he can run this ship any better than ole George W. F*ck it! I'm voting for Ross Perot.  And finally, the Grammys. I guess if you didn't know who Beyonce was before, then you do now. Other than that, the show left me hopeful that MTV's music awards will be absolutely fabulous this year because the Grammy's were slightly boring. The media has used the words: demure, downplayed, etc. They say the only way Justin Timberlake was allowed appear was if he apologized, which he did. BORING! I wish Janet had shown up - that really would have rattled everyone! And we'd all be happier viewers if SOMEONE - ANYONE would have gotten rattled. Thank goodness MTV goes over the top each year!

BYPG6W9,male,36,"I DON'T WANNA GO TO WORK TODAY   It's another beautiful day today.  I had my nose pressed against the glass as if I were small child delighting in the proof of snow and no school today, but it's actually quite sunny, warm, albeit a bit windy and the magnolia trees have opened their petals up to greet the world.  I don't think I need to go into an office today even if it is filled with ""fabulous women.""  I wondered if perhaps it had something to do with the fact that I told Robert that I wanted to work separately moving forward and we really haven't come up with much of a solution to do that considering that we have several clients and realtor partners that we have established relationships together.  I don't think it has anything to do with that.  I think I had a great relaxing day yesterday and I'd like to stay home and tackle my lists of projects  I'd like to grab my inline skates and head to Piedmont Park and skate along with Bananarama, the B-52's or Blondie today."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Today isn't as cold as it was this weekend (36 today). Thank you God! Unfortunately, it will get cold again this Wednesday. Darn. In order to keep our apartment at a comfortable temperature, I have to close off the bedroom to save heat. On top of that, I keep hearing a noise in our walls that sounds like something is falling. I think it's the plaster from an apartment above ours (I blame it on Sergio). I hope the whole thing doesn't come crashing down on top of us one day. That would suck a big one. Chris and I cleaned out our front closet last night. It used to have 15 boxes of things we've been lugging around from apartment to apartment without anywhere to display. We threw out most of it. We set aside 3 boxes of ""stuff"" and 2 bags of clothes to go to Goodwill. Now there are only 5 boxes left in that closet. It's so nice! Next weekend, we're doing the middle closet - only 3 boxes. I blame it on TLC's Clean Sweep marathon that ran on New Year's Day.  By the way, if you'd like to see a very clear picture of Chris's red fleur-de-lis tattoo, go to   and then click on the Tattoo & Press link on the left and then click on the Color Work link on the right. Chris's should be the first one up (he got it in July 2003). Hard to miss. It's a big red fleur-de-lis. If you're in NYC and thinking about getting a tattoo, I highly recommend Pon. His work is amazing! And he's worth every penny. And, no, it doesn't hurt a bit. And if you believe that, you're a dumbass. I have a 4x3 inch black shaded fleur-de-lis in the lower middle of my back. I got it on my 23rd birthday. Hurt like hell.  Today, Kathleen Blanco was sworn in as Louisiana's first woman governor. She took the oath in both English and French.   It seems that Martha Stewart is posting about her trials and tribulations on her website www.marthatalks.com  .  Now, I wasn't planning to comment on this story and yet, I really couldn't pass it up. This guy in Germany posted an ad on the Internet seeking someone who was willing to be killed and eaten. One such man replied to the ad. The only thing, according to his partner, is that he ""never expressed any desire to die."" However, according to Mr. Cannibal, he ""wanted to be stabbed to death after drinking a bottle of cold medicine to lose consciousness."" (courtesy CNN.com) Hmmm. It would appear we have a conflict of interest in this case. Mr. Cannibal was interested in eating willing participants, but Mr. Victim was only interested in being slaughtered after Robotripping.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"IS IT THE SAME KIND OF LOVE?   This morning, I woke up to NPR.  Well, I always do.  2F's sets his clock/radio alarm to switch Public Radio on instead of an annoying bleating sound like a Bo-Pimped sheep.  It doesn't usually wake me up immediately.  Instead, I flail around in bed awhile dreaming of the gas crisis, the war in Iraq and typically someone's murder.  It's very unsettling and as much as I like Bob Edwards, he just doesn't perk me up in the morning.  So I got up and made the bed and out of the blue started singing ""River Deep, Moutain High.""  It's an old Tina Turner song she recorded with Phil Spector and Erasure covered it in '88.  Well, I started thinking about the lyrics.  Tina sings about how she had a rag doll and loved it like nobody's business and now she loves her beloved like she loved that rag doll.  I thought to myself, ""I'm not sure that I want to be loved like a rag doll,"" as I carefully lined up the lines on the quilt the way 2F's has patiently instructed me to do.  One of the other lyrics goes on about how her boyfriend probably had a puppy and he probably loves her like he loved that puppy.  Now, this could imply beastiality if her intended grew up on a farm or just that he would like to get her on all-fours.  I don't know.  It still doesn't sound very healthy and just sets up an analogy to refer to her as ""his bitch.""    I personally don't think that fondness for a ragdoll or puppy is the same as the love one feels for boyfriend/girlfriend/lover/partner/wife/husband.  Granted, I think that the love a child has for a stuffed animal will generate a loving energy with the child's body and that's the feeling that they think of when they speak of love.  I do believe that pets are very much a part of our families, but I do not love Buddy in the same way that I love Jeff.  So what's the difference?  Is it the sexual component?  Probably to some degree, but passion fades in time and a deeper love runs through it. I don't mean to imply that I'm a victim of lesbian death bed in reverse, but in time, the friendship and companionship in a relationship takes priority over sex.  It doesn't mean that couples should not have passionate moments, but you don't find yourself looking at him in the middle of the Wal-Mart sporting goods department and saying, ""Take me!  I'm passion's plaything.""  In the end, I guess true love is the unconditional love we should show both ourselves and others.  Jesus had that right.  Regardless of how you feel about Christianity as a religion, the man had it goin' on.  He saw the child of God in every one and loved them equally.  Jesus didn't say, ""I love you all, but I especially love the good Samaritan with the big breasts by the well."" He did not love them to get anything in return.  He loved them because they were his brothers and sisters.  I really need to work on that.  I sometimes think we need to create new word for the different types of love.  I know all about agape, but I think we need to define it even further.  There is the love children have for toys.  There is a love for family. There is a love for friends. There is a love for pets.  There is a love for Bananarama.  There is a love for our first girlfriends/boyfriends, which is usually ruled more by hormones and psychological issues than anything else.  There is love for our significant other/wife/husband.  There is a love for mankind.  What are your thoughts about this topic?"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Stomach growling, feeling faint, must eat soon . . . so, I'm a little hungry and about to make some chicken alfredo pasta cause I'm a badass.  And Chris will love it - except that I forgot to get the kind of pasta that he loves, but tough shit.  I'm not getting dressed again to go back down to the store in the cold and the wind.  April in NYC - ain't it grand?  While I'm sitting here typing, The Rock is on Conan O'Brien and it reminded me to tell everyone: Chris met The Rock last week when he was staying at The Mandarin Oriental (hotel).  Interestingly enough, he checked in under the name of ""Mr. Cook.""  He only stayed like 1 night and then moved on.  I could eat him with a spoon!  Visitor update: Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah are coming up on the 15th for 4 days.  Becca & Trevor are coming up at the end of May for her 21st birthday.

That's it so far this year.    Oh!  The piece de resistance (of course) is our upcoming trip to Italy.  We've finally narrowed it down to staying in just Italy: 3 days in Rome, 3 days in Florence (with a day trip to Pisa), and 3 days in Venice.  I SO can't wait!  Chris and I have never been to Europe - hell, I don't think we've ever really taken a trip together by ourselves!  And that's saying a lot considering we've been together for 9 years (married 2 and a half years).  Ok, off to make dinner so I can EAT!!"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"WHAT DID YOU SAY?   I went with Jeff to The Home Depot on Saturday night to pick up some odds and ends.  Basically, I just go for support and to push the cart.    Why do they call it ""The Home Depot?""  You never hear anyone say, ""I have to go to The Home Depot.""  No.  They say, ""I'm going to Home Depot. Does my hair look okay?  No, I don't need anything, I'm just going to pick up a date.""  Well, The Home Depot is a very cruisy place for gay men.  ""Where are the work gloves?  They've moved them!  I'll never find them!  The world as we know it is rapidly coming to an end!""  ""Why don't we ask someone where they are?""  ""No, let's walk over to this section of the store together and retrace my footsteps in a place where I know they are not.""  ""Excuse me, sir.  If I were work gloves, where would I live in the store?""  ""Aisle 12.""  We reverse our direction and find the gloves on ailse 12.  However, I did let him down in the check out department.  It seems that I didn't get the cart close enough to the check out counter and put the items on the counter in the right order.  And it is so obvious to even a retarded person, you know!  However, he had a headache, so I cut him some slack.  Most people would just take aspirin.  However, Jeff kept forgetting to take aspirin.  I don't really understand that because if my head is pounding, I'm not going to forget the headache until it goes away.  Then again, we all function in different ways so I will not judge.  As we were tooling around in the garden department, a small black boy ran up beside me and wedged his way between my cart and a garden pond.  He peered down into the water with astonishment and then turned to look at me and said, ""Flah flof flah flah flah.""  ""Excuse me?""  ""Flah flof flah flah flah.""  At this point, it occured to me that he might be (a) retarded; or (b) have a speech impediment.  I admired his bright you spirit to choose to live with joy in the face of adversity.  About that time his parents showed up and his father said, ""Flof!  FLOF!  Flah floo fla fla.""  Then the mother piped in, ""Flu, fludda flu flu flu.""  At that point I was flabergasted at the kid's ability to mimic these people.  He spoke flah flah fluently... and without an accent.  I was impressed.  As I moved my cart away and followed Jeff over to pine bark, I remembered a girl that I used to work with back at TRW.  My friend, Susan, will remember her, albeit her name escapes me now.  She once made a comment about a vendor who called in that I didn't quite understand, but after hearing this little flah flah family, I finally understood.  This girl released her call, spun her chair around and said, ""She talk like she got shit in her mouth.""  ""Pardon?""  ""She talk like she got shit in her mouth.""  And she was right.  It was like this little family learned to talk with those sytrofoam peanuts in its mouth or was just too lazy to use their tongue to deftly whip those consonants off the back of their teeth.  I smiled as I pushed my cart on and we headed into the air conditioning supplies.  ""Where's the air filters?  Don't they believe any 24x60 air filters anymore?!""  I smiled and said, ""Let's ask someone."""

Regardless of who said what after the ""incident,"" it was planned. CBS might not have known about it, not sure if MTV knew about it, but Justin Timberlake & Janet Jackson certainly did - hence the huge chunk of metal attached to her nipple. And why don't we back up just one more step: why the hell was Janet Jackson even performing? She hasn't had a hit in like 10 years! All of the other performers have had hits in the last 1-2 years. Why Janet? Why not some Grammy award-winning performer from the last 2 or 3 years? If you ask me (and it  really doesn't matter if you didn't since I get to rant on and on and on, but), this was all a big stunt to 1) boost a sagging career & tat-ta and 2) take the media off her brother for a bit.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"SUNFLOWERS   The other afternoon, Jeff and I were outside in the backyard and he told me to close my eyes.  He led me over near the fence and told me to open my eyes.  He had planted some sunflowers for me and they had bloomed. They were huge.  I'm always so amazed at how tall they grow from little bitty seeds.  I had been asking to plant some for the longest time, but he told me we didn't have any space for them.  Then he plants them anyway.  He's a sneaky guy.    Sunflowers remind me of one of my favorite summers.  It was 1980 and we lived in Waco.  I was going into the seventh grade in the fall and I was breaking new ground in so many ways.  As a 12-year old boy, my bike was my passport to adventure and I had begun expanding my territory out beyond Bellaire Drive to include Topeka and finally the new subdivision they were building four streets over.  I never asked for my permission to ride beyond the boundaries my parents had set for me years early; I just did it.  My best friend, Kurt, and I would ride our bikes up to 7-11 and I would sometimes buy a treat that consisted of two cookies with vanilla ice cream in the middle. It had a particular name like a cookiewich, but I don't think that was it.  That was 24 years ago.  Yikes!  Where has the time gone?  Anyway, we would ride back home and we would take a short cut that led through the new subdivision.  The road snaked around the edge of the development and on the left side of the road there was a field with oceans of sunflowers that went off into the distance.  I would hear choruses of cicadas singing their otherworldly songs, which sounded like something from a science fiction movie from the fifties.  I should know.  I didn't live in that time period.  I remember that I often wanted to stop and wander into the sunflowers, exploring what was in the middle of the field.  However, if we left our bikes on the side of the road, they would have been stolen.  Plus, I could hear my mother's voice in my head warning of snakes.  Still, the appeal of wandering into the sunflowers that towered over me appealed to some primal part of me.  Perhaps it was the onset of puberty that pounded primordial, tribal rhyhms in my head as it pumped testosterone throughout my body.  It wasn't sexual, per se, but it was very powerful.  I longed to be part of a secret brotherhood that did not exist.  So many unknown things were being revealed to me and I wanted to know the answers to all of life's mysteries.  I can't explain it, but even now, I can still feel it."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"A new episode of FRIENDS comes on tonight! I’m very excited! And Chris doesn’t have to work tonight, so we get to spend some time together!! Today is a good day – so far. Tomorrow we get free flu shots here at work. Nice little incentive they give us here at my work. It’s free for me & Chris, but there’s no way I’ll be able to get Chris around a needle much less have him volunteer to be stuck by one.  Today I find myself stuffing envelopes with invites to each state treasurer for the National Association of State Treasurers meeting here in NYC. Our company is hosting a dinner and program for them, which includes Jeff Greenfield (political commentator and reporter) as speaker. Meanwhile, I’m also looking for flights home for Christmas. These airlines are really sticking it to us with these holiday fares! Normally, it costs me about $225-$250 to fly home roundtrip. For Christmas, I’m seeing fares anywhere from $285 on up. I still don’t know if Chris will get to come home for Christmas. I keep trying to get him to give me an answer so that I can go ahead and get tickets.  Little known fact: Tuberculosis was New York City’s leading killer in 1913. It was also known as consumption because of the way it consumed its emaciated victims."

BYPG6W9,male,36,"SHOPGIRL   I mentioned earlier that I began reading Steve Martin's  Shopgirl  last night.  Even now, I still can't help but marvel at how wonderful his writing is and what a witty and charming story he has begun to weave for me.  It's a short book, only 129 pages and I highly recommend it... especially anyone who may be looking for love.  I have posted a review from Amazon.com below.   From Publishers Weekly Movie star Martin shone in the comic essays of last year's Pure DrivelAbut can he write serious fiction? His debut novella gives fans a chance to find out. Shy, depressed, young, lonely and usually broke, Vermont-bred Mirabelle Butterfield sells gloves at the Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus (nobody ever buys); at night, she watches TV with her two cats. Martin's slight plot follows Mirabelle's search for loveAor at least romance and companionshipAwith middle-aged Ray Porter, a womanizing Seattle millionaire who may, or may not, have hidden redeeming qualities. Also in and out of Mirabelle's life are a handful of supporting characters, all of them lonely and alienated, too. There's her father, a dysfunctional Vietnam vet; the laconic, unambitious Jeremy; and Mirabelle's promiscuous, body-obsessed co-worker Lisa. Detractors may call Martin's plot predictable, his characters stereotypes. Admirers may answer thatAas in Douglas CouplandAthese aren't stereotypes but modern archetypes, whose lives must be streamlined if they are to represent ours. Except for its love-hate relations with L.A., little about this book sounds much like Martin; its anxious, sometimes flat prose style can be affecting or disorienting, and belongs somewhere between Coupland and literary chroniclers of depression like Lydia Davis. Martin's first novel is finally neither a triumph nor a disaster: it's yet another of this intelligent performer's attempts to expand his range, and those who will buy it for the name on the cover could do a lot worse.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"Ok, so I've been home for about 2 1/2 days and I'm just now able to post. It's been busy so far. I can't comment on any news this time around as I haven't stopped long enough to watch anything on TV. As soon as I landed in Alexandria, La on Saturday, we ate at Cracker Barrel. Then, we drove to Rayville to go see my grandparents and my in-laws. We did a little present swapping, ate some good ole deep-fried chicken and then watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour starring Jeff Foxworthy. Too funny! My sister-in-law, Cacky, recorded it from Comedy Central one night. Good work, Cacky dahlin, good work! I got all kinds of good stuff for Christmas already and it's only the 22nd!! I just want to point out that I haven't even worn my coat since I landed. It's been in the 50's or 60's during the day. Crazy!! Oh! And I held a couple of alligators just about an hour ago. I took a picture with them, too! Their snouts were taped shut so they wouldn't bite anyone. My little nephew, Bryant, was a little scared of them but he stuck it out for the pics.  This morning, Mom, Dad & I got in the car to go to Shreveport for a little shopping. The car didn't want to start, but Dad coaxed it and it came to life. We took it back to the dealership since they've only had it about a month. Turns out that a rat crawled up in the engine and tried making a nest. It chewed through a few wires, which had to be replaced. Ended up costing about $130 plus tax. And about 2 hours of our time. However, I must say that Moffit Mazda is just the nicest car dealership you could possibly pick. Alright, Dad's making some cheese toast which happens to be an old favorite of mine, so I gotta go. Until next time . . ."

BYPG6W9,male,36,"SINGLE STRAIGHT MEN AND THEIR CATS   Last night I spent about half an hour looking at other blogs.  I came across this straight guy who is into soccer, fast cars and has a cat named Ms. Sadie.  For some reason, this just stood out like a sore thumb to me.  I can't think of any straight guys I know who own cats without a wife or live-in girlfriend.  Strangely enough, a straight man living alone with a cat is like a girl riding in a truck between two guys.  It just has a scarlet letter written all over it.  Then I stopped myself.  I reprimanded myself for marginalizing a minority, straight single guys with cats, not crabs.  I sometimes wonder if the Senate Resolution 595 hasn't fixated my mind on gay-only issues and made me insensitive to the needs of my straight friends.  So I shifted my perception with an audible pop and imagined what my life as a cat would be like with a straight owner.  I imagined that there would be plenty of pizza to eat and beer to drink.  There were be lots of dirty laundry all over the floors and furniture to take little cat naps on.  I would probably be tossed around a bit as if I were a football.  ""Hey Jerry, go on out for a pass and I'll throw Sadie to you.""  I would dread whenever his friend, Roger,  would come over.  Roger is a punter.  I imagined myself cleaning myself one evening in the living room as I hear my owner talking on the phone to one of his buddies about his new girlfriend.  It's all rather trivial and I usually tune him out as I crane my neck around to lick my anus when I suddenly hear my owner say something about eating pussy.  My head shoots up and I stare at my owner, ready for his first move.  My claws are ready.  I am ready for my opportunity.  I'm not going to be feline mingon.  As soon as the door opens, I'm out of here.  No, I just can't imagine a cat living with a single straight guy.  It's beyond the realm of my imagination."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"PALM SUNDAY   2F's and I went to the MLK Chapel at Morehouse College today for a Plam Sunday Service.  Atlanta Unity was invited to hold their service there by Dean Carter.  I was happy that 2F's went with me.  It meant a lot to me.  Joan was on stage singing with the choir.  I always identify her by her tennis shoes.  The sermon was on religious tolerance.  Reverand Strickland told the story of how Ghandi read the Bible and then remarked that it was a shame that no one seemed to be putting it to use.  In spite of the marketing that the U.S. is a Christian nation, I often times look at our actions and have to disagree.  Why are we still living an eye for an eye and not turning the other cheek?  If Jesus appeared on the planet now, I wonder what he would think of the teachings that have evolved into Christianity."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"ATLANTA JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL   I apologize for not posting last night.  After telemarketing, Robert and I talked for a couple of hours.  By the time I got home, I sat down for a second and I was fast asleep.  I picked up the contact sheets from our photo session.  They looked good, but I'm not particularly interested in seeing pictures of myself.  However, I was told that I am very photogenic.  Whatever!  I attended a really good marketing session today.  I'm looking forward to utilizing what I learned.  2F's said that the creator of Cabbage Patch Kids was at the capitol today.  Ironically, so were the Right To Life groups.  Makes you think, doesn't it?  I met 2F's tonight at the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival to see Yossi & Jagger, which is a film about two gay soldiers in the Israeli army.  It was very interesting, but the Jewish American Princess (JAP) who kept talking and sighing through the movie was not.    There is one soldier that is very closeted in the movie and one that is not.  After the closeted one scolds the more open one, 2F's put his hand in mine and set it on my lap where people could see.  Either the movie influenced him or I had a date with a pod person tonight.  I opened a book up this evening and found a prescription for amoxicillian from last June.  I guess I should take it in."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"urlLink Primus  was awesome!   urlLink The Hallucino Genetics Tour !  It started at exactly 8 pm and ended at 10:57 pm.  They said something about having to be out of the building at 11 pm.  There was no pig, but the drum solo knocked my knockers off!  The concert was at Radio City Music Hall & I had never been there before.  It was like stepping back into the 30's with all of the grandeur of gentlemen & ladies - the building, not the crowd of concertgoers.  The bathrooms alone were divine!  The seats were velvet with carpet everywhere - in the seating area, not the bathrooms.  There were ushers everywhere and I even got patted down as we entered Radio City.  And even though they announced before the concert that there was no smoking, that didn't stop people from lighting up.  And we're not talking cigarettes here.  The ushers didn't stop anyone & no trouble, of course.  Most potheads are fairly harmless especially when there's live music 75 feet in front of you from the most awesome band in the world.  Unfortunately, getting myself going this morning proved to be difficult.  After I got up and got my shower & Chris-the-Great was out the door, I took an hour nap.  I don't think it did much good.  My eyes wouldn't even open until Noon today.  I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep standing up.  Still worth it.  Brad & Beth are coming tomorrow!  Chris-the-Great has class tomorrow night, but I'm sure we'll find something to do while he's gone.  I of course still need to finish cleaning the apt.  I'll probably finish up tomorrow morning.  On the other hand, I'm taking the bus to the airport tomorrow.  I haven't done that in a while and I'm kind of looking forward to it.  Buses really arent' my thing.  I just can't seem to get the bus schedules down so I never take them unless I absolutely have to.  I don't mind walking.  Ok, off to go clean something.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"THIS HAD BETTER @#*% WORK!  Okay.  Perhaps the third time is the charm.  I wrote a lovely entry and lost it twice.  The interface on this Web site is a bit different from the previous Web site.  My great aunt, Priscilla, called me this morning to tell me she loved me, was thinking of me and now has unlimited long distance.  Then she hung up on me.  Buddy threw up on my comforter.  I washed it and she seems fine now.  She's sleeping in her little cat bed that I bought for her at Target.  I would hate to think that I spent $7.99 in vain.  Robert and I met with Deborah today regarding investment opportunities.  I'm really excited about working with her because I believe she really wants to help people get into homes that might not have the opportunity without our help.  Our office went to dinner with the staff of our primary lender this evening at Stoney River.  The food was good.  What did I have again?  Oh yeah... orange glazed sesame trout.  Fish is good for the memory.  Fish is good for the memory.    Carol Lynn, our president, told us that the only reason her parents sent her to the University of Georgia was to find a husband.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"AFTERNOON MUSINGS   I'm sitting here in the late afternoon reflecting on my day.  I've been very productive.  The PowerPoint presentation for the home buyers workshop is almost finished.  It's at the point where I have to step away, sleep on it overnight and look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow.  I had lunch with Robert today.  It's amazing how his mobile phone rings constantly.  It's amazing to watch him in action as he speaks to someone for a few moments and then skillfully rearranges them to a later telephone conversation that may or may not happen.  It gives the appearance of productivity, which is best viewed through fun house-mirror eyes.  The perception is exagerated and out of proportion.  Still, he is closing two loans this month.  Robert is a fantastic people person, but I could never act the way he does.  It would come across as cheesey.  He is one of those rare, authentically cheesey people and he wears it well.  The house is open.  It's hot and I'm wearing a bluish-grey Polo T-shirt and some jeans.  The jeans barely stay on my body.  I have lost so much weight over the past three months, which is good.  I look good, but I'm still dismayed at the remainder of body fat still firmly bubblewrapped around my awesome abs.  How much running and jumping rope will this require.  Wouldn't be great if there was a little device that could tell you that?    I wasn't meeting with clients today and dressed comfortable to slay the PowerPoint dragon that has been haunting me.  I'm tooling through my mind on a tiny motorcyle looking for new avenues of marketing and lead generation that I have not been down before.  There must be some other stone I have not overturned.  The lead from last week has not returned my phone calls.  Things happen for a reason.    I've spent about a month putting systems into place that should begin producing leads and customers.  Money is not a problem at the moment.  I find myself eager to find some clients to work with.  I'm ready to work my magic so to speak.  However, when I'm slightly distracted, I catch a glimpse of a hopeful feeling in my emotional-intuitive vision that seems to say something good is going to happen next week.  However, when I try to turn and look at this feeling more closely, it's gone.  All that remains is a ghostly knowing.  I feel it is somehow tied to my shift in attitude about prayer. I didn't pray for anything last night or this morning."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"JEFFFIFER GOES TO THE ATLANTA AUTO SHOW   We went to the auto show today.  2F's wanted to check out SUV's for his pending used book store, but I think it was just an excuse to go.  The World Congress Center is huge.  You just walk for days.  I think it was just built as an excuse to have a lot of escalators.  I did not take any pictures with my cell phone, but I saw several buttocks that Troy probably would have taken pictures of.  We walked in and looked at the Ford vehicles first.  The Mustang convertible looked redneck sexxy.  It still has it after all of these years.  I was intrigued by the Ford GT until I found out it retails for $140,000.  I looked at the new Miatas.  Theyc ome with a Bose stereo sytem.  They are basically the same design, but more plastic.  We checked out the BMW section.  The Z4 Roadster is very nice and only retails at $35,000.  I like the Z4, but have questioned if whether I should step up to a 3 series convertible since I would have a back seat to transport more than two people.  It retails for $45,000.  However, the M3 convertible, retailing at $56,000 really spoke to me.  It was oslo blue on the outside with sort of a burnt orange accent on the interior.  It looke sharper than it sounds.  I wondered if it would feel bigger than 2F's M3, but it didn't.  It felt pretty much like when I drive the M3.  The minicoopers were pretty impressive. There is more room in those things than I imagined.  2F's seems to have his mind set on the Nissan Xterra for a work vehicle.  He likes the yellow one and I must say, I think it's the best fit for what he wants to do.  They are wide and have a lot of space in back and with the back seats folded down.  They look sharp too.  Plus, the price is very reasonable.  I saw a Dodge Viper and thought of Adam.  We came across two old model T's and I thought of aunt who recently died.  When my grandfather died, he left an old model T that he bought and planned to restore to my uncle.  The last time I heard, the model T was in his garage.  Upon his death, it was supposed to be passed on to me.  However, since my uncle mishandled my grandmother's estate when she died and we no longer talk to him, I wonder what will happen to my grandfather's model T.  I don't know where I would put it if I did inherit it, but I have strong feelings about it.  My grandfather died when I was four and I have vague memories of him.  In my mind, the model T connects me with my grandfather.  If I could restore it to the way he would have restored it, perhaps I could give something back to him.  A couple of years ago, I scanned some old family photographs while I was home at Christmas.  There were a few of my older sister and I when we lived on Kerry Drive in Arlington, Texas.  There were some of my mother and father dating when they were teenagers.  There was one of my grandfather and I playing a Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron game.  When I saw it, tears came to my eyes.  I have no idea why.  I'm not the teary-eyed type, but it just made me miss him and grieve the relationship that I never had with my grandfather.  I wonder what kind of man I would have been like if he had lived longer and we had developed more of a relationship?  After the auto show, 2F's and I walked back to the car through Centenial Park.  We stopped and sat on a bench to watch the dancing water fountain show.  It was still warm with a comfortable breeze in the air.  The water danced to the Theme From Chariots Of Fire by Vangelis.  I watched images of the Justice League of America on the video screen on the outside of the CNN building through the fountains.  I looked to my right out toward where the new aquarium is being built.  The sky seemed wide and big without any hills.  It reminded me of Texas and home.  I looked back at 2F's watching the water moving in time with music and thought how nice it is just to spend time with your best friend by yourself."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Last Friday, I honed by flower arranging skills once again.  The president of our company has a vineyard in Australia and at harvest time each season, he has flowers from the vineyard shipped to our offices.  My friend (and coworker), Laurren, and I do most of the arranging.  Another friend, Dawn, sometimes helps out - but she's usually busier than we are.  Anyway, we ended up making like 7 or 8 arrangements from these 2 boxes and these are some of the most exotic flowers I've ever seen.  They have this one flower called a protea, which actually comes from bush, and it looks like that plant/flower from  Little Shop of Horrors  that at any point could jump out and eat you.     Otherwise, not too much has been happening.  I was in one crazy ass mood this past weekend.  You know the kind when you've started evaluating certain areas of your life and you don't like what you see but you can't blame anyone but yourself?  Yeah, I was in that mood Saturday and Sunday.  Chris & I were supposed to be going to Peter Luger's Steakhouse again tonight with some of his friends from The Essex House (hotel), but those plans changed.  Now, I think we're going to slip out to a couple of shows at Upright Citizens Brigade.  Should be loads of fun since we haven't been in a little over a week.  Ok, off to powder the nose and then off to the show.  Later gators.  Oh!  And I knew I said I would do the links today - and I might still after we get back - but if I don't, tough shit.  You'll get them when you're ready for them.  Now behave!"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"We're finally doing our gift exchange with Cindy & Jackson today. We got Cindy a DVD player and a movie. We got Jackson a move, a game for his Game Boy Advance, a kit for his Game Boy Advance with: a magnifier, cleaner, case, extra battery. While we were at Best Buy last night, we (of course) got ourselves 4 more DVDs to add to our ever-growing collection. Last night's choices were: Underworld, American Wedding (the unrated version), Alex & Emma (my choice), and XMen 2.  I read on WNBC.com that a man fell asleep on the E train and woke up with a steak knife sticking out of his chest. Holy Crap!! I will NEVER fall asleep on the subway!! Not that I've ever been able to. And then I read a story about a couple of pranksters who tapped into the frequency used by a local Burger King speaker that is used when ordering in the drive-thru lane. When someone orders a whopper, for instance, they yell at the customer and tell them they are too fat and to pull up to the window. Though these guys are cussing at customers, I must admit that it's a little funny. Who would have thought of tapping into the speaker's frequency?   And now, a littly funny: 20 Clues A Woman Should Call It A Night  1. I have absolutely no idea where my purse is. 2. I believe that dancing with my arms overhead and wiggling my butt while yelling WOO-HOO is truly the sexiest dance move around. 3. I've suddenly decided I want to kick someone's ass and honestly believe I could do it too. 4. In my last trip to ""pee"" I realize I now look more like Tammy Faye Baker than the goddess I was just four hours ago. 5. I drop my 3:00 am. submarine on the floor (which I'm eating even though I'm not the least bit hungry), pick it up and carry on eating it. 6. I start crying and telling everyone I see that I love them sooooo much. 7. There are less than three hours before I'm due to start work. 8. I've found a deeper/spiritual side to the geek sitting next to me. 9. The man I'm flirting with used to be my 5th grade teacher. 10. The urge to take off articles of clothing, stand on a table and sing or dance becomes strangely overwhelming. 11. My eyes just don't seem to want to stay open on their own so I keep them half closed and think it looks exotically sexy. 12. I've suddenly taken up smoking and become really good at it. 13. I yell at the bartender, who (I think) cheated me by giving me just lemonade, but that's just because I can no longer taste the gin. 14. I think I'm in bed, but my pillow feels strangely like the kitchen floor. 15. I start every conversation with a booming, ""DON'T take this the WRONG WAY but.."" 16. I fail to notice that the toilet lid's down when I sit on it. 17. My hugs begin to resemble wrestling takedown moves. 18. I'm tired so I just sit on the floor (wherever I happen to be standing) and take a quick nap. 19. I begin leaving the buttons open on my button fly pants to cut down on the time I'm in the bathroom away from my drink. 20. I take my shoes off because I believe it's their fault that I'm having problems walking straight."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"THAT WAS GREAT, BUT THIS TIME, CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE MINTY?   Voiceover class was interesting. One of the instructors reminds me of the psychiatrist from Augusten Burroughs' novel, ""Running With Scissors.""  He looks like everyone's favorite Santa Claus look-a-like who is most likely to molest an altar boy that you know.  He's from Alabama and speaks magnificently.  The other instructor is a former voice talent agent and she played his 60-second demo.  It was amazing. This man has done so many commercials that I have heard on local radio and national TV.  He's the voice of Quick Trip, Ford, Valveline and Jag-u-ar.   The voice talent agent used the term ""money shot"" and had to explain it to a young girl.  I think I enjoyed that moment too much.  I sometimes think my middle name is diabolical.  Everyone in my class is a serious actor.  Naturally, I feel somewhat out of place.  I'm just taking it for fun really and feel much like a PTA mother who wandered into an A.A. meeting by accident and just feels too embarrassed to leave.  It's like I'm a fauxaholic.  We learned about blending on Wednesday. If you have a word that ends with a hard consonant followed by a word that starts with a vowel, you blend them together.  For instance, the phrase ""act of"" becomes ""ak tov.""  It sounds easy enough, but try reading outloud when you have never seen the script before.  The black guy sitting beside me did a fantastic job.  He read with meaning. I meant to do that, but I didn't want to miss a blending opportunity.    I'm supposed to practice for an hour each day, but I've already missed Thursday and Friday.  I'll have to make up for it the rest of the week.

BYPG6W9,male,36,"IS MICKEY MOUSE A WUS?   I stopped over at Andymatic for a visit and he is at conference for creativity coaches, C urlLink oachamatic .  He has created a new blog where you can read about his adventures in the Orlando area.  I think I may want to be a coach some day.  It's somewhere between best friend and a psychiatrist.  Andy commented on how Mickey Mouse is boring in comparison to everybody's favorite opera-singing, cross-dressing, carrot-crunchy wascally wabbit, Bugs Bunny.  I have to agree.  Cartoons have made me what I am today.  Every once in a while, I find myself singing to myself and I'll hear these words come out of my mouth:   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, abracapo-cus La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, pocus-cadabra   It's from the cartoon with the vampire who changes into a bat when he says abracadabra and back into human form when he says hocus pocus.  Then Bugs mixes up the words and turns him into a half human, half bat creature.  Inevitablly, I'll look up and see people staring at me in bewilderment, but occasionally I'll see someone giving me a knowing smile.  I know what song they will be singing the rest of the day."

On Thursday night, we had a going away party for a couple of people at work.  I would have done fine with my Corona beers until the shot of Yagermeister & the shot of Jack Daniel's.  It's the shots that kick my ass.  So I was late for work on Friday, but I get points for at least making it.  Right?  Yeah, well, points for me anyway!  Becca and Trevor came in Friday evening around 6 pm and then hit Times Square, Rockefeller Center & walked up 5th Avenue up to Central Park South.  We've also seen Battery Park, the WTC site, the Wall Street Bull, Chinatown, SoHo, the East Village, Central Park, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, and Grand Central.  And today:  HAPPY 21st BIRTHDAY BECCA!!  So today, we're obviously going to do a little drinking after we go to The Met (museum).  I made her some chocolate cupcakes for breakfast & her boyfriend, Trevor, just went and got her some flowers - she's in the shower right now so she'll be surprised when she gets out.  OK, gotta go!"

QID6QM3,female,14,"I know hand washing is the standard activity for many obsessive-compulsives and I like clean hands as much as anyone, but nothing soothes my neurotic spirit like brushing my teeth. It's actually been a little bit of a problem for me because I carry a toothbrush, brush vigorously in some mirrorless little public bathroom and end up with toothpaste foam stains on my shirt for the rest of the day.  urlLink Oral-B  had people like me in mind. The new  urlLink Brush Up  disposable toothbrushes are textured teeth wipes that fit over your finger like a giant paper thimble. It's coated with a non-foaming mint-flavored cleanser that freshens like mouthwash. They've been making these for dogs for years but always in bacon or chicken flavor.   I do like those teeth-cleaning gums like  urlLink Orbit , but if chewing a piece really gives you a ""just-brushed clean feeling"", then I don't want to look into the mouths of those people working at Wrigley. Brushing your teeth 12-13 times a day is time-consuming, sure, but I've never had a cavity. I kid, it's really more like 6 times a day, perfectly normal, maybe just on the high side of normal, don't you think?  Well anyway, these Brush Ups really do curb my urge to run to my  urlLink Oral-B 7000 Power Brush . The paper is tough enough not to fall apart in your mouth, but still gentle on your gums, and the textured little nubs really scrub away the fuzzy plaque that starts to build up  seconds  after your last brushing. The only problem I see with these is that they are about $3 for a package of 12 individually wrapped little wipes. That's like a day's supply. Where's the economy sized box?"

You could also, of course, simply do that on your own without putting a giant retainer in your mouth. I'm sure it makes you look really attractive too."
QID6QM3,female,14,"I have found that most writing software is either condescending to the writer (if you don't already know about the basic elements and structure of fiction, you should take a class rather than buy software that talks to you like you're a moron), or so cumbersome to use that you lose your creative drive and spirit in the effort to keep your jottings organized.  Still, I'm always hopeful that someone will come up with a program that can manage hundreds of scattered notes and vignettes, and can keep me from going off on wild tangents that have nothing to do with my story, all without making me feel like I'm cheating the artistic process by reducing it to an idiotic formula that would be an embarassment if anyone found out about it.  I'm trying out  urlLink newnovelist  software, developed in the UK and edited by the great great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens.  The program takes you through six stages of writing your novel by forcing you to think and write about each element of character and plot development.

QID6QM3,female,14,"You might argue that there's no noticeable time difference between rice that can be cooked in five minutes on the stove and rice that can be microwaved in just two minutes.

But I have encountered many situations where I have to feed someone in just three minutes, or have to pack a lunch on the run (we don't do sandwiches at my house, I don't know why), and on those occasions, I congratulate myself for having the foresight to purchase these little packages of Japanese microwavable rice at my local Asian market (you can also get them online at  urlLink Midori Mart ).

Wow, who knew?   What’s interesting is that women buy more electronics than men do. Even when the items are for men or for the whole family, it’s usually the woman who decides what to buy. Why then are magazines like Sync and Cargo, which are pretty much just about electronics shopping, targeting only men?

There are the  urlLink Nike Art of Speed  shorts by 15 young directors.   While not officially commissioned by Apple,  urlLink Cherry Sky Films  has produced a series of five shorts, all centered around the mighty iPod and collectively dubbed the  SkyPod Shorts .  Cherry Sky produced  urlLink Better Luck Tomorrow , the movie that launched the career of  urlLink Justin Lin .   Like the BMW films, the SkyPod shorts aren't really films at all, but glossy, extended commercials. The shorts range from arty and hypnotic ( Dream, Lover ) to silly (the straight-out-of-a Hilary Duff movie,  Glowsticks & Drumsticks ).   The SkyPod shorts are actually more like odes to Final Cut Pro than they are to the iPod. Although each filmmaker was given a budget of less than $4500, you'd never know it from the elegant production values. While I wasn't blown away by any of the films, it really hit me how much low-budget filmmaking has been revolutionized by products like FCP. These films weren't choppy or sloppy, they had all the technical grace of the ultra-high budget BMW shorts.   Hey everyone, go out and film your stories, make your movies. Anyone can do it now, it's incredible.  Ah okay, the SkyPod shorts aren't viewable online yet, as they're still being shown in festivals, but should be up at some point in the fall. You can get screening dates from the   urlLink Cherry Sky  site."

QID6QM3,female,14,"The  urlLink Bug Wand  may not be super high-tech, but it's going to change my life. I'm extremely bug phobic but also hyper-empathetic so while I end up drowning spiders that show up in my shower, it always leads to hours of sadly wondering if ants have souls or if beetles love their mothers. Also, number one on my list of reasons to someday get married is: husband = bug killer.  The Bug Wand lets you be squeamish and kind at the same time because it sucks up the bug, but doesn't kill it. You can stand several feet away from the little pest and the battery-operated wand will suck it into the tube, where you trap it only until you can get it outside to fly/crawl away into the great outdoors. Or your neighbor's house.  Get the Bug Wand or other  urlLink amazing products  at  urlLink As Seen On TV ."
QID6QM3,female,14,"urlLink Boing Boing  just reported that  urlLink Doug Rushkoff's  new graphic novel,  urlLink Club Zero-G  is now available at  urlLink Amazon .    The story follows Zeke, a gangly, unpopular, 19-year-old college student - a townie who also happens to attend the elite college in his community - who has discovered a terrific new club where he is accepted and popular. There's only one catch: everyone at the club is dreaming. It only exists in the shared dream consciousness of its participants. If at all .   Doug's a genius.

QID6QM3,female,14,"Soon you won't have your addiction to your Playstation to blame for your flabby body. Powergrid Fitness is coming out with the Kilowatt Game Controller late this spring, and it aims to turn your body into a fit, toned joystick.    Sensors in the ski machine-like device measure the force of your movements which are translated into game actions.  You won't even have to move too much, as this is isometric exercise which means you exert your muscles without using your joints. Yeah I don't know what that means either, maybe it's kind of like Pilates. PowerGrid assures that you will feel the burn, however, and the demo users in  urlLink Powergrid's funny infomercial-style plugs  appear to be sweating from their efforts while not discernibly doing anything at all.    The Kilowatt will be compatible with Playstation2, Xbox, and Nintendo Gamecube. Water and towels not included.  Just one question- is the world ready for gamers with muscles? If this takes off, be prepared for global ""Revenge of the Nerds"".    Pre-orders are now being accepted now at  urlLink  Powergrid Fitness."

3D8MI3M,female,33,"I picked one of the best ever matches to miss by all accounts. I'm sure it didn't compare to the exciting time I had checking through a particularly cheeky Lease, complete with a stunning Flying Freehold, a remarkable Chancel Repair problem, and a bit of adverse possession! Now you occasionally see a couple of these at once - but 4 altogether! Fantastic!!   It just kept getting better when I got home too. There were quite a few of my regular e-chatterers online - the beer and high-spirits must have got them in a friendly mood 'cos they all wanted to chat. I had to take it in turns to chat to them, trying to juggle each so as not to spend an unfairly long time with one, to the exclusion of the others.  The Strawberry Date Dish was on his new webcam as well - very brave of him - I of course, was very very sober (it being a school night, and having to be  aprofessional interviewer this morning) and therefore probably disappointed him by just sitting smiling, occasionally flicking my hair about and generally looking a bit daft and self-conscious.  The Dynamo was back from his holiday and had managed to edit all his holiday snaps so I was then treated to a slide show of various parts of European coast.  Just as I was about to go to bed, the Throb came online - he does it every flipping night - impeccable timing - always as I'm about to log off and get some kip - and yes, I know I could still do that, but there's just something about him - maybe it's that I know my mother wouldn't approve - I know I shouldn't approve! - maybe it's 'cos he's a bit different - exotic even - if you can call Northern Ireland that! I'm going to have to meet him sooner or later 'cos I'm starting to do what I've seen others do with me - and that's start to imagine it's real almost - I need to be brought right back down to reality! and I will be, I'm sure of it. Anyway, too busy for the next couple of months so it's not an option.  PS. I was asked what a scent library was - see my answer to the comment below - honestly! I would have expected a more discerning readership! but I'm flattered I have any beyond Eva and Rachel - and that's only cos they can never get through on my phoneline anymore - just like to check I'm still ok - not lying unconscious somewhere, being feasted on by my hungry cat - while the rest of the world fails to notice I'm missing."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"The week has started off well - my gnat bites are fading and don't make me look quite so much like a domestic violence victim, my bank balance has been refuelled, and all my friends are happy well and either expecting babies, recently married or about to be, even Marko has had a few days off work and has more lined up soon.  It's at times like this that I used to feel redundant - no-one wanting to pour out their souls or release vitriol, left me with time to ponder on my own shortcomings which would either cause me to take up knitting or spend even longer hours at work. I am now doing neither, although I do fancy I could knock up a rather stylish poncho if I set my mind to it.  I am actually enjoying the time to spend just reading, or dozing and even the opportunity to get away from work by 6.30! I left tonight with just 6, yes half a dozen, files to work on - it is almost unknown - ok - so I do have about 12 tapes waiting, all of which have about 20 files on them which will eventually find their way back onto my desk - but even so, it's pretty remarkable - hence I mention it.  I did almost have a confrontation with my Mum tonight - Jack had told her that I wouldn't go to Japan next year if her and John (aka Stepmonster) go - not quite what I had said - more that I had only expressed a desire to go when I thought they weren't - she wanted a chat about why - I was tired and can't get into deep mother-daughter heart to hearts at the best of times - I just denied it and smiled that of course I would love for us all to go as one big happy family - Lovely!  She didn't hang around so I think she was satisfied - I wish I could tell her that she isn't the problem - but where would I start? and how could I stop once started? Anyway - who will look after the cat and the fish and the dogs and the chickens and the ducks? Good job I persuaded her that I don't have to make a decision for at least another 9 months."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"You would think, given that I only live next door, my mother would have been able to give me a little advance notice that my new patio door was being fitted today - it's not a lot to ask, surely. But no - the first I heard of it was when Jack came in my bedroom at 7.15 this morning demanding the key.  I had to fly around the house with the Dyson, picking up half a rainforest of Sunday paper, empty wine bottles, clothing etc. I haven't done anything all weekend and the place was a tip. I've just shut the kitchen door and hoped the glaziers don't get thirsty or need the loo - they would have to battle through half-emptied weekend bags, shopping bags ( I found a fantastic underwear sale yesterday, it was a bit extravagant of me, especially as I don't get paid until tomorrow, but a girl can never have enough foundation garments, and corsets are definitely a fashion direction that suits my Jessica Rabbit-prone figure) and shoes to get to my en-suite, and then I dread to think what they might find.  I had hoped to be going home to new French doors, but the miserable Loss Adjuster would only cough up for one replacement panel - still it will be nice to have the scent of the garden wafting in of an evening - shame it also allows Darius to bring in ever larger mammals - many a night has been spent chasing him and a mole/baby rabbit/albatross around the lounge - which reminds me - I must pick up cat food on the way home."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Life has returned pretty much back to normal after my Easter Cyber-Fest! Thank goodness! I was in very serious danger of turning into a geek.  I was so pleased to pick CM up the following day - he'd not had the best exchange, he'd much preferred Japan the previous year, but he'd already decided he'd be going back next year - just not to the same family. He'd tried to buy me some Chanel perfume, my favourite - bless! - but it was too expensive so I got a Sausage and a bottle of wine. I was quite touched with that - he knows my tastes. Grandma got a bottle of wine too and Grandad got a packet of Fisherman's Friends!  The house was back to normal in minutes - trainers littered everywhere, clouds of Lynx hovering in the air, cupboards raided - and more importantly, no room for me at the computer, which was merrily pinging away as he quickly got in touch with his friends, no doubt swapping stories of holiday exploits that wouldn't get passed a parental rating - accompanied by a soundtrack of Gangster Rap!  Peace, tranquility shattered - bliss!  It was good to get back to work after the long bank holiday weekend too. I used to love bank holidays when I was in a relationship but they're not so great when you are single, no-one to play with! In fact, I think I probably only really want a boyfriend for bank holidays - the rest of the time I'm quite happy to get to choose what I watch, what I wear, what I eat, which side of the bed to sleep on! I wonder whether anyone would respond if I put that on my dating site - WLTM tall, dark handsome, intelligent rugby player for Whit and May Day initially - could lead to Christmas!  Talking of high days and holidays - today is my Birthday! I've not really enjoyed my birthday over the last few years - the rot started on my 30th! I always thought I'd be solvent and stable by then but I was not even close! I felt like that was it! Life over! No chance of finding love now, not now everything has started heading south - just my pension to look forward to and the hope that there might be a nice-looking orderly in my Nursing Home to change my incontinence pads! Last year was even worse - my Mum had booked a table for me and CM at my friend's new restaurant. How sad was that! Going for a candle-lit meal with your 12 year old! It actually turned out to be ok - typical type of date really - he insisted I choose the cheapest thing on the Menu, suggested we just had the one course, had 2 drinks (of Coke) for every one of mine, and wanted to go home to watch the football as soon as we'd eaten!  I feel a bit more positive this year - don't know if it's cos it's a beautiful sunny day and I don't have to go to work - or if it's an indication that my mood is improving generally. I'm even going out tonight - in public with grown-ups and everything!! I normally get loads of cards but I wasn't expecting many this year - new job, no-one knows me properly yet and my former colleagues won't be bothered now that I won't be buying them cakes for the staffroom anymore. I didn't get as many but I've been really touched by those that have remembered! My proper friends! One of my old secretaries even called round an hour ago with a bottle of wine and a card! I'm surprised she's still talking to me after I didn't take her with me to my new job - then again I'm surprised that the one I did take is still talking to me after sharing a room with me for the first 6 weeks! You always take it out on the people closest to you!!  And I got some fab presents - a DVD player!! How big is that?!! I wasn't expecting to be that spoilt. My video broke ages ago and I've been thinking of getting CM one for Christmas for a couple of years. It came with ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" (loved the book - saw the film set when I was holidaying in Cephalonia a few years ago) and ""Love actually! - I think I must be the only person who hasn't seen it! I'll look forward to that tomorrow night! Accompanied by the wine and the last of my solitary Easter Egg! And I got some CDs - Bay City Rollers Greatest Hits and Jamie Cullum! CM's going to hate car journeys to rugby training over the next few months!  And I've been getting lovely text messages from a chap I've been talking to on here - he even rang me earlier to say a brief hello - he's staying with family in the next town for the weekend - which is ironic cos I'm about to set off to stay with a friend who lives just round the corner from him in West Yorkshire. He wants to meet me - he's been wanting to for a few weeks but I still haven't plucked up the courage. It's not that I'm that afraid anymore - I was! I convinced myself he was a stalker and I was kicking myself for having revealed so many personal details - I didn't dare leave the office at lunchtime in case he was watching me from a bar or shop, following me, clocking me buying my Shapers lunch! Fortunately my imagination, and ego, turned out to be rather larger than his desire to boil my bunny!  I quite enjoy the attention and excitement, if we meet that might disappear! He'll realise my hour-glass figure is more an hour-and-half  and that I inherited Grandma's chin! And he might have awful slip-on shoes, and wear white socks! I'd hate him to see any disappointment register momentarily across my face. What could be even worse than that, would be if we actually got on - that might lead to something else - ultimately sex! Think I'd prefer to clock up a few more visits to the Cheese Nazi's scales before I run the risk of letting another man near my jiggly bits!  Any way, it's too late now - got to head for Leeds! Want to arrive early enough to have a glass of bubbly while I open the fabulous small beautifully packaged gift that Eva is bound to have bought me! She has impeccable taste and the luxury of being able to shop in the Victoria Quarter - the frozen food shops, poundstores and Gregg's on my local high street don't quite have the same appeal! Not sure exactly what we are going to be doing tonight! I've fought bitterly to stay in for the last couple of years every time I've gone over to Leeds but tonight I fancy painting the town red! We will eat somewhere - we tried to book a table at Anthony's, the newest hippest eatery to open - chef from El Bulli, the Spanish El Dorado which we both read about and aspire to - but it was full. Eva always persuades me to be a bit more extravagant than I might otherwise be - and I must confess that it doesn't take much doing! I can't help it - I'm a Taurean! I'm supposed to have a large appetite for all things fabulous, decadent, rich and exotic!  Might end up at a hip happening club later - fancy throwing a few shapes about the dance floor, may even meet a handsome, younger foreign  Adonis who I can snog to my heart's content, inhibitions anaesthetised by the champers, safe in the knowledge that I'll never have to see him again! Leeds is very good for that sort of thing - or at least it was the last time I allowed myself to be dragged out, kicking and screaming!  We've had some cracking evenings, and very early mornings being flung about a club or later Eva's lounge, by nimble nifty Italian waiters - they can all dance so well and enjoy the petting but understand ""no"", being good Catholic boys who wouldn't want anyone to disrespect their sisters.  Whatever, I'm quite liking being 33 so far!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I don't know why I bothered getting up today. Yesterday was bad enough - £75 at the vets before even 9am! - but at least Darius has still got his eye! Jack had a sleepless night thinking he'd lost it to a big nasty street cat! He was so traumatised he even asked to come to work with me! Spent the day helping with the photo-copying, filing and post and enjoying being asked if he was on work experience from college and watching everyone's reaction when they heard he was my 13 year old son - I got a bit fed up with the comments about our comparative heights, specially as he leans nonchalantly on my shoulder at any possible opportunity! He particularly liked the jokey m-pegs my boss kept sending him until I pointed out to them both that I had work to do and neither of them were there for fun!  Yesterday did end slightly better when we headed into the UCI on the way home. I managed to stay awake through 2.5 hours of Harry Potter - a recommendation for a film if ever there was one, given my extreme fatigue by that point.  This morning I took Jack and Luke rock-climbing, or at the least, that was the plan. I hadn't actually booked it so I was stuck with 2 boys, kitted out for extreme sports, in the centre of a rainy Hull with everything shut except the shopping centre. The did do a bit of ice-skating, but soon got fed up when they fell over too much and realised there were no pretty girls to impress so they went back to the cinema and Jack sat through HP again - poor Luke, hope he didn't have a running commentary throughout. They still managed to munch through money like there was no tomorrow -but if it left me in peace at work I figured it was worth it!  It came as only a mild surprise to me when the brand spanking new hire car made a small cough on the way home, just as I was approaching a very busy roundabout, at the height of the rushhour. I had heard how economical diesel engines are but even I was beginning to think there might be something wrong with the fuel gauge after it had apparently only used 1/8th of a tank after 432 miles! So we then waited patiently for half an hour, accompanied by teenage stereo farting, for the AA man to come and rescue us. I was just glad no-one passing would recognize my car - not a hint of mud, peeling Iron stickers or bent bumpers in sight.  I managed to get Jack home in time to go out for a birthday tea with his grandma while I headed off to a bereavement client, only 15 minutes late. That went better and my woes have now pailed into insignificance.   Jack's back now and screaming for the keyboard - so I'm going to have a very small glass of wine and then maintain my early to bed routine for yet another night! It's nearly the weekend!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I should have the mother of all hangovers today, as I was still chatting on the phone 'til a ridiculous hour. I was probably talking jibberish too. I smashed one of my favourite glasses - only 1 left now- I shall treat it carefully.Wonder I got up in time for this athletics thingy today. Jack told me it was 12.30 so I rushed about like a mad woman - got half way to York and realised it was still only 10.30 - the little sod had tricked me - so we pulled into Safeways at Willerby and had a big breakfast - nothing like it to set you on your way for the day./  Jack came 5th out of 8 - not bad given that he was a good 2 years younger than most of the other combatants. He enjoyed it too - much less nervous than last week. But he has a really swollen chin from his fight last night - looks like a lop-sided hamster. He's really embarrassed about it. It's just so typical of him - his form teacher had taken my mum on one side yesterday to have a quiet word about Jack - not a grumble this time - apparently he's a dream to teach at the moment and long may it continue - then he goes and does something stupid like fall out with the lad down the road. Kids!!! and me so young!! No wonder I have grey hair!!  Talking of which, Super Danny is putting some more blonde in on Thursday - move over Debbie Harry - Cheryl has entered the arena!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Martin rescued me from another late Friday in the office with a very well-timed call inviting me to the pub! I was happy to accept - I've not seen much of Martin since I started my fab new job and he makes me feel a little guilty about it - but then I did introduce him to Sophie, and I hope they both remember that in a few years time when they are choosing Godparents for their first born.  I had to let him buy my Diet Coke 'cos I'd left my purse strewn across my lounge floor along with most of the contents of my handbag, having left hastily this morning - v late for work and cussing a handsome tall Irish cutey who manages to get me into trouble despite being hundreds of miles away and my firm resolve to go to bed no matter how funny or appealing his messages might be! I really must learn to get some more will-power!  I collapsed on the sofa when I got in just after 7 - I managed to grab a few winks before the phone rang and disturbed my slumber - it was Jack- he'd fallen out with his friend and needed picking up. Normally by that time on a Friday I'd have poured the best part of a bottle of wine down my neck and would have had to send him home in a taxi - but having slept, the wine was slowly reaching room temperature and I was still alcohol-free - apart, of course from the remains of last night's excess still seeping out my pores. So I obliged, thinking he would be waiting meekly on his own near Kwik-Fit. How wrong was I!!  There was a mob - not kidding - with Jack in front - I drove around the roundabout and pulled up on the brow of the hill, expecting him just to get in and maybe give Torven a lift home too. I wasn't expecting a brawl to erupt over my bonnet and Torven to start thumping ten bells out of Jack - and then kick my car!!! He's so blonde and quiet - and Jack was not retaliating in any way - not that I imagine he was entirely blameless - but he's twice the size of Torven Cosmo! and is very aware of the damage he can do - he was ever so upset on the way home - crying, apologising - it all started over a daft bobble hat - see they are just still kids even if they are starting to feel a bit more grown up and don't know what to do with their testosterone.  Anyway, he's gone to bed after a bath and a cuddle with his mum - he's got a big athletics meeting tomorrow - and then he's hoping I'll take him to the Designer Outlet near York on the way home but I'm hoping it gets too late - I like having money left at the end of the month instead of the other way around. But I also like having a very lovely son, who really is maturing incredibly well - and just the best company ever - shame his friends are not all quite at the same state of development yet - glad I'm not a teenager anymore - just behaving like one!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"The French boy's Unibrow has more personality than he himself has! I have rarely come across someone so uncommunicative. It's going to be an incredibly long 2 weeks. He's polite and all that, but he just doesn't do or say anything - and it's not the language barrier, I'm sure - I can babble on about rubbish just as well in French as I can English.  He came with me to Presentation Evening tonight. Granted, it's dull, even I was beginning to lose the will to live, especially when the orchestra started up with Mambo No.5 and we were expected to clap along - I think that was just because they didn't have a conductor and needed help with the timing. To think what I must have put my mum through for all those years - and at least this was quite modern and upbeat - not Gaslight Gaieties and The Dambusters! We did The Winner Takes It All once - I had to do the Intro on the sax - took me weeks to get it right and once I had that's all I played (and The Muppet Song)for months, nay years after.  Jack got the Sports Prize - bless! He's supposed to be taking part in the District Athletics tomorrow but has suddenly developed a surprising desire to ensure that Le Brow doesn't feel excluded and has rather opted to go on the day trip with the exchange students - I suspect the fact that they are calling in at Meadowhall for a few hours has more to do with it - all his birthday money burning a hole in his pocket.  Just got off the phone from Eva - she's set a date - the Glorious Twelfth! And I'm invited!! She's already worried about what I'm going to wear - especially when I mentioned this PVC fetish site that someone had told me about. Well she said I wasn't to choose anything too pale to ensure she shines on her big day - what can be more different than a boned quarter-cup corset and matching spanking skirt! The PVC trench coat would prevent any embarrassing photographs! She's such a control freak! - lol"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I was reeeeaaaallllly dancing last night. I do love a good boogie, especially with a handsome man to swoop and twirl me about - and there was no shortage of them lining up to mark my card. The best was Jim The Gardener, mainly because it was the first time I'd met him (and his lovely wife) and I get a thrill out of being able to follow a new lead. But I can't forget Tomlinson, take a pinch of music, a large dash of wine and it's not long before we are cooking up a party of our own.  He is such a cheeky rogue and it's always a bit dangerous - I'm currently sporting the bruises to prove it!  Vickie must have been right when she told me over coffee yesterday afternoon that I had ""F*** me"" tattooed all over my forehead. I'll spare you the gory details, but let's just say I've definitely found my form and can count myself a hardened hedonist once again.  So today has been spent very lazily. Fortunately, no hangover appeared - largely soothed by the lyrical sound of Irish burr down the phone at lunchtime. Now there's someone I could do the horizontal tango with! and a bit of Throbbing never did anyone any harm."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"My week started well. Up on time, good tunes from Wogan, sunshine, a dividend cheque and a smile on my face from my chat with The Throb last night. Could it possibly get any better?  F*** me, yes! I had a huge pile of post in my pigeon-hole - always makes me feel good, sign that my insecurity still lingers. It took me nearly an hour to get it all asigned to the right files, what with all the calls and the need to use the new toaster. But the day went off well - all mail  answered, and even a few files from the pending pile dealt with - and then at a very punctual 4pm, I got an email from that sexy solicitor - I just know he waits til his post is signed and then sends me a note.  I had thought about not replying, but I've never been cool and a few short emails later, and we are chatting, and chatting, and chatting - 2 unanswered calls to Jack and an hour and a half later, I leave work, move my car and meet the girls I should have seen at 5.30, who have by then eaten, for a coke and a fulldown on life chez Chez!  It wasn't all Me! Me! - but it could have been - I am so brimming with enthusiasm right now - and I suspect from where they were sitting it was.  I will make it up to them in Knicker Exchange!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Horrible day! Yuk! Yuk! Started badly - didn't get out of the wrong side of bed, just got out too late! Thank goodness my secretary is trained to give me a wake up call when I don't appear within half an hour of my ETA!  I finally did battle with the dreaded Sasser worm last night and had a bit of a cyber fest into the bargain - well it was his birthday! and he is very cute! Anyway, the birds were up before I was even tucked up - must remember not to do that on a school night again! But it was fun.  Culminated in some awful bully of a client - someone else's, not my own - calling me to tell me how dreadful I am and that if he can't move tomorrow he is blaming me personally and expects me to pick up his hotel bill if he can't move into his new des res at the exact time of his choosing! I was incredibly calm, polite and expect a nomination for Customer Service of the Year award! I apologised that I had been unable to see my client ( his buyer) at the precise time that he had been available to come and see me, and tried to explain that my diary had been solidly booked - being a Dentist he might have understood! - I had seen him at the first available opportunity this week - 10.30 Tuesday - and promptly dispatched my final searches and cheque requests - the fact that a leading High Street lender cannot guarantee my client's mortgage money will be with me tomorrow is a result of the crazy state of the market - not my fault, nor is the fact that the undoubtedly-clever-and-talented bully of a Dentist has booked his van despite advice to the contrary from his own solicitor! He nearly got to me, just 'cos I was so tired - my instinct was to scream, rant, rave and cry - all at the same time - but I took a leaf out of Eva's book and she would have been so proud of me! My secretary hugged me afterwards, and the Law Grad who I'm training at the moment has started looking at me in awe - my boss promptly cancelled his registration with this guy's practice and supported me 100% ( he is so lush, my new boss!)   I'm over it now - and infinitely proud of my power to not cry when all I wanted to do was curl up in a ball under my desk and sob for England!  Tonight, Matthew (Peter, David, and Dean), I'm going to be Ali McBeal - but without the fab clothes, protruding neck bones, phantom babies and boyfriends!  Thank fuck tomorrow is Friday!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Everyone should have a Japanese exchange student - but only if they also have a Mum like mine. Not only did she pick him up for me yesterday, take him out for dinner and then drop him and Jack off for their trip to lincoln this morning, she also took them both out for dinner this evening - Giovanni's this time. It was supposed to be a night for the adults only, but there were 2 spare places and they both seem to have had a really good time.  Tomorrow they are going to Whitby for the day and then there is a party at ours in the evening - I did offer to help out but Mum has it all under control, she says. Even so, I think I might come home early, well earlier, and make sure she has chilled the wine and defrosted the sausages - menopause can have devastating effects on a hostess' ability.  Friday they are going to York. I might have to entertain them in the evening - pizza and a video me thinks - and then golf and rock-climbing on Saturday. My lovely clients, Mark & Becky, have said they can go free but only if I promise to go in trousers and have a go myself. The idea of a freebie certainly appeals but I'm not sure my confidence has grown sufficiently to relish having my arse strapped into a harness and raised 12 feet above one of my favourite client's head!   I will be saying Sayonara to my guest that evening as I have a pressing engagement in Leeds - Eva's hen night - she says she wants it low-key but I think she protesteth too much - I toyed with the idea of borrowing the communal blow-up doll ensemble from Vickie, but as Eva's not in that particular circle of friends and is unlikely to respect our unwritten rules, I might have to purchase new accoutrements - either that or get in touch with Hannibal Lecturer and see if he's available for a cabaret spot!  Cute Suit has been in touch again today, third time this week - and it's only Wednesday! I'm hoping he's holding back on the suggestion of dinner at San Pietro knowing how busy (!) I am with my foreign visitor (I have no idea how to spell or properly pronounce his name). He knows Jack is going to be away for most of August and that I'll be home alone - fingers crossed for a sizzling month!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I've got another quasi-celebrity claim to fame - but I can't really tell you about it - and it isn't really that great!  But do you remember Survivor - that reality show where they put a load of dreadful people in an even worse place to see who started to eat each other first? Well it turns out, a chap I've been emailing on a particular matter was part of the show! Gosh! I might have been even nicer to him if I'd known - you know how Starstruck I get!  Anyway, that brightened up an otherwise boring afternoon - I've had a pretty uneventful sort of day really, trough after the peak maybe - not that it was low in any way, nor that the last few days have been high! Mind you, I did like getting texts late from that cute solicitor - and I blush now when I remember suggesting we bunk off work for the afternoon and go to the park - I didn't think for a minute he would bite - and he didn't - good job, too, as I had appointments booked this afternoon - now I just pray something proper happens on this case so I have a serious rather than tenuous reason to make contact.  Got to shop for birthday gifts for Jack this weekend - he wants a motorbike - I was thinking more book tokens! Maybe we'll meet in the middle somewhere - like a biking DVD - or I could take him to Cadwell - now that's a thought - men in leather."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Ladies! There are handsome, sexy, well-mannered young men on this thing! I know! I just met one.  The Newton Bombshell!He was a little bit late,(only a few minutes but they seemed to go on forever) not his fault-accident-I managed not to run away but it did take a fag to keep me there and then I wished I hadn't. I was really nervous and wishing I'd chosen one of my fab new summer tops rather than my safe cashmere jumper- not a great choice for a hot early summer Sunday. I was really tempted to head back home and change - but the longer I dithered, the less of an option it became.  My trained teenage assassins were on alert and texting me for money for ice-creams - bless, this internet-dating is becoming as much a part of Jack and Boo's weekend as mine. I promised them a fiver to stay discreetly in the background. I spotted him driving in - and then didn't know what to do - should I stay by my car and watch him search? no - being a Taurean I took the bull by the horns and walked up, legs of jelly, hoped he wouldn't notice them, being all pale and not my greatest feature.  We lounged in the sun sipping champagne and munching on strawberries - very civilised. He was cool as a cucumber ( pointless apparently), not even phased when he poured half his fizz down his leg. I was really wishing I could suck it out for him but I'm sure I didn't give myself away. I can flirt like mad with someone I know is safe, but put a stud in front of me and I dry!  I would quite like to see this dark-haired Bomb again but doubt I will. I get the impression, without him actually having given much away, that he tends to go for tall leggy blondes with few brain cells - or maybe tall leggy blonde doctor types - either way, not short, chubby red-heads with teenage bodyguards in the background. The fact that he didn't give much away spoke volumes and I didn't want to keep asking questions in case it felt more like an interview than an afternoon in the sun. It was really a pleasant few hours and I can't wait for the day that I don't feel quite so inhibited by my weight and can actually flirt to my utmost ability - I'm really good at it and quite enjoy it but I am finding it hard to get back into the swing- and shy doesn't suit me!  I didn't go straight home but popped to see an old school mate and his wife for 20 minutes which turned into 3 hours and a pretty fab barbecue with his mum dad and 5 month old baby (he was 11 weeks premature so still very tiny). I noticed an ugly black bruise on my knee which I hadn't spotted earlier - maybe it was from when I kicked myself all the way back from the park.  Any way, all said, I'm feeling pretty optimistic about myself - sun and good company at the weekend has helped- a dancing date on Thursday, dinner the week after and a potential trip to Belfast in the offing all combine to keep me smiling and away from the cheese board.  Right - work!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"It's the weekend - official! Nadia has won - I wept - fuck knows why - but I did! I thought my days of weeping at Andrex adverts was over but I guess I'm still soft. I have made a conscious effort to stay away from BB this year - I really am not in the slightest bit interested - but Jack kept coming through with titbits and I eventually succumbed.  Do not think for one minute that the new TV has anything to do with being able to watch the Final Eviction! Fuck! No! The Olympics and Restoration Final only!  I counted up what work I had left on my desk tonight when I sneaked off at 6.20 -  7 contracts to check (3 of them are big 'orrible ones) and 2 files from hell. That is the lightest my desk has been in the last 10 years at least - wish my scales would match it. I used to get anxious at this sort of time - that nobody wanted me and that I would be sad and redundant within the month - but I have learnt from experience that this time of year is always a bit slow and that it soon starts to flood back in when the hols draw to a close -it seems to have started, I've opened 9 new files in 5 days  - that's far less than I was doing a few months ago - but much more manageable - especially with my super-duper Lisa.  So what do I have planned for the weekend? - absolutlely sweet FA - Result or what? I can sleep in without conscience - my wedding outfit is sorted and if worst comes to shove - I can always give Eva&Roger an IOU - I know exactly what I want to buy them - but having spent a few hours surfing the net and only finding the type of thing in the £150-800 price bracket, they might have to wait whilst I save up or think of an alternative. It will be fab whatever it is!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I took the hire car for a spin this afternoon - to meet a man. I was a bit nervous, Jack was also worried for my sanity and decided to come along with his friend as an unseen body guard. They were all set to cut holes in my Sunday Times and Boo picked a spot at the top of a very tall tower from which they could maintain discreet surveillance. I gave them a fistful of notes though, so they had soon forgotten all about me and were headed for the nearest record shop.  In the event, I was in very safe hands. He was charming and I think even more nervous than I! I'd changed the venue at the last minute - I didn't fancy waddling around a nature reserve in Shantung silk mules, plus I didn't relish the thought of 2 giggling teenagers peering at me from behind binoculars - so Lincoln seemed the better option - something for everyone to do. I recalled my earlier foray into this field and was careful not to repeat the mistake of aimlessly wandering and steered us quickly in the direction of a smart bar where we proceeded to sup coffee and while away the afternoon getting to know more about each other. Much better to have eye contact and the chance to use body language - and it seems to have worked - he's online now and still very keen to chat - even talking about meeting again. Phew! So maybe I'm not entirely repulsive to all except the care-in-the-community community.  So all in all a pretty good afternoon. Thanks, Peter - I promise I'll leave the Killer Teenagers at home next time."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"La la la! La la la! La la la! la la la! la la! England!! Wow! What a performance!  I watched it via my Yahoo! Sport online commentary and then listened to it in the car on the way home. I didn't dare watch it live, having turned on the match in the 98th minute on Sunday and given it the kiss of death! And my reticence was rewarded - perhaps tomorrow is a day to braoch the company car issue, given the good mood my Lovely New Boss will be in!  I've had invites to 2 posh parties today as well - one after the other - result! Just got the details for Jack's County Athletics meeting too - if he does well at this, he goes through to the All England Schools' Tournament - he's more interested in going to the Designer Outlet on the way home to buy some new rugby boots and deprive me of more cash - but I've agreed, what price future fame! Move over Jackie Stallone - Cheryl's entered the zone!  I can't get this horny feeling out of my head either - not eased by the fact that my favourite rugby player is back from holiday and emailing me again - and my Mister Sunday is being very attentive - Come on England!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I very nearly drove to Lisa'a last night for Vickie's hen night. In fact I did drive there, after waiting 20 minutes outside, my shiny smooth hair getting blown all over the place, for Vickie not to pick me up. We'd spoken earlier and I had thought I'd arranged a lift, but apparently not. I passed Vickie just as I got to Lisa's, having arrived without me and being immediately sent out to fetch me. After a bit of toing and froing, I was persuaded to take my car back, with Vickie following behind  - bless she'd done that short stretch of road 4 times already.  Lisa had recycled some of the gifts she'd been given on her hen night in Newcastle 4 years ago, including Blow-Up Brian who we'd handcuffed her to for a while wearing a flashing sash and Neil's leopard skin silk boxers(!)a whip and vibrator the size of a small child. Vickie is the new custodian of these items, to be passed on to the next one of our group to get married. I'm not losing any sleep over where I would have to store them!  We had a really good laugh and I took full advantage of not having to drive - particularly as I had today off work. I wasn't up too early though - managed to start cleaning by about lunchtime - and I have worked like a demon. I can now confidently welcome the French Exchange Student into my home later this evening without worrying about the state of the place. I needn't live in fear of anyone dropping round unexpectedly either. I am going to make a concerted effort to find a cleaner before it deteriorates into squalor again.  I am worrying about how on earth I am going to juggle work, school runs and all the other social activities that are planned over the next couple of weeks. Mum and John are going to Silverstone tonight to see the Grand Prix at the weekend, so I can't rely on them for transportation.  Tomorrow, I have to get both boys to school for 8.15am, then get myself to work across the Bridge, hoping my completion with the Cute Suit goes well, then head back for 3.30pm to pick them up, feed them , get them back into town for a Welcome Reception for 5.30pm and then over to the KC Stadium for a cricket match at 7pm, picking Sophie up on the way. And that's just the first day! There are 13 more to go like that! I can feel some more weight-loss coming on!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I've made it to the end of the week and I still have some energy left. Quite remarkable given the number of late nights I've had - that Pro Plus stuff must be seriously good - either that or my body approves of the tee-total evenings I've had this week.  It's been quite eventful, well, for me at least. I'm beginning to see the benefits of knocking all the extra-curricular committee-ments on the head leaving me time to either really crack on at work, or else start to have a social life again. I've packed as much into this week as I would probably have done in 3 months this time last year. That's not to say it's masses, but by my standards it is - I've had 2 social encounters with men, spent a few hours with 2 seperate lots of old friends , catching up on each others lives and tomorrow I'm going to a gig with yet more friends. I'll have to watch I don't burn myself out!!  And all this in a week when I should have been sitting a Public Law exam which I managed to wriggle out of on the pretext that I was still getting used to my new job. I don't feel guilty either - I couldn't have performed as well at work if my mind had been on that, nor would I have had time to revise, so each area would have suffered - and I'd have been mostly wanting to lie on the sofa under a blanket in a semi-inebriated state.  Instead I have had a cracking 3 months and will have payed for my annual salary in bills delivered by a week on Thursday - anything after that until February is sheer profit - so I feel I have rewarded my lovely new bosses faith in me - justified my miraculously cured bank account (if anyone had told me this time last year that it was anything but terminal I'd have scoffed at them - but this - it's almost biblical in its transformation, there are still a few old wounds but they are healing quite nicely and not giving me any pain whatsoever and the experience has humbled me into being much more careful with my spending habits - just a bit concerned that Jack is showing signs of the illness) - and have interviewed quite a few potential candidates for my Conveyancing Assistant's role with a few more in the offing - so there is light at the end of the tunnel.  The best of it is that people have started noticing the weight I've lost,(now that can't be good grammar - surely they notice the weight when it's there in the first place, and miss it when it's gone) and I'm beginning to lose some of my inhibitions as things like my waist reappear.  And all these great things happening to me right now cannot be more aptly-timed for I fear I am about to become THE ONLY SINGLE ONE in our small but happy circle. Yes! Eva has been popped the question - she hasn't answered it yet - well at least she hadn't as we were texting one another as I drove home from failed-salsa attempt in Derby (the Evil Forces had simply conspired to get me there too late to make the class, no other reason)but she must be taking it seriously because she's already thought about her hen night or at least Roger the Fiance's suggestion that I could go over, we could sit in her lounge all evening and she could wear an L-plate on her back! I could not think of a more fitting way to celebrate! Nothing too far removed from one of our ordinary social nights but with a passing compliment to the traditions the occasion warrants - and if we stayed in instead of going to Barcelona, Dublin or Blackpool - we'd be able to afford Cristal, so we'd feel that we were particularly stylish and happening girls about town - had we bothered to get ready and go out.  He clearly doesn't know what will happen as my confidence continues to increase and the true me starts to reemerge from my winter shell - he'd better tell his best man to watch out!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Well the eye mask worked. For the first time in a week my puffy, cold-affected eyes looked acceptable, my hair fell perfectly about my shoulders and I took 2 changes of top and a spare pair of tights to work. Jack thought I should wear the stripey blouse - he's obviously acquired a sense of the slimming effect of vertical stripes osmotically, and has an inate knowledge that fabric stretched tautly across the female chest is good. Jacquie preferred the baby pink scoop neck - I went with her recommendation.  I was on tenterhooks from about 12.45 - I knew his hearing was at 12.30 and being a simple Directions, wouldn't take long. It didn't - my mobile rang at 12.55 - he was on his way into Reception. And there he was, looking just as I remembered him, smiling eyes, lovely broad shoulders and a well-fitted Cute Suit!  I wasn't sure how to greet him. I normally sweep confidently through the door and extend my hand to my waiting clients whilst introducing myself - but he wasn't a client - and I wasn't brave enough to peck him onthe cheek - something which I would normally do on a regular date - so I just popped my head round the door and said "" Hi - are you ready?"" Doh! I hope he couldn't see I was shaking mildly.  He asked if he could leave his briefcase somewhere, I took him though to my office, wishing I'd tidied it up a bit more. My large fan was on, and I stood right in front of it, well it worked for Debbie Harry!   We went to Venn - the newest and best restaurant in town - just got mentioned in the Michelin Red Guide - and had a drink whilst pondering over the menu - we both chose sausages and mash washed down with fizzy water. Paul, the owner, wasn't there which was a bit disappointing - I had wanted to look popular and well-known - but the waitress did a sterling job.  Lunch was yummy, the conversation flowed perfectly, the body language was very encouraging, and the leather seats clearly impressed him.  It was delightful - we had coffees and chatted and chatted and then realized it was 3pm - we reluctantly sauntered back to my office and he lingered about, I think a little uncertain whether to kiss me. I hung back a bit, not certain whether Jacquie was skillfully aiming her handbag mirror round the filing cabinets ( I discovered later that she had cleared her desk in one leap as we'd left and positioned herself under the blinds to cop a glimpse).  I got a text just after 5pm - very good sign - I think I will be hearing more from him very soon.  So today I spent the afternoon watching Jack & Byron try their hands at rock-climbing. They loved it - 3 hours of extreme exhilaration - and that was just sitting watching - both of them showed a flair for it - and it didn't go unnoticed that the regular guys had rippling muscles and six-packs. They were exhausted when we left - could barely grip a bottle of water. They want to go again next week.  Tonight was a party at Jack's Headmaster's. He was the only pupil amongst a number of teachers, fortunately all the ones he likes and gets on well with, it rained, but there were enough gazebos and a large well lit garage so spirits were not dampened. I was driving so there was never any danger of embarrassing him in the hot tub with his DT teacher. It was a very pleasant evening, good company, lots of well-prepared food and a beautiful garden overlooking the river. I haven't felt this relaxed and happy in ages."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Work is crazy this week. I thought it was manic last week but all the people I couldn't speak to then now need me urgently - it can be nice to feel wanted but this is just daft. I'm taking advantage for a few minutes to write some drivel though, 'cos I can't get online at home - a chap from btopenworld thinks I might have been struck by this awful worm that is doing the rounds! The cyber version of genital warts! Yukk!! I'll try his gynaecyberlogical cure when I eventually get home tonight - hope it's earlier than my 10.30pm finish last night!  The ups and downs of the weekend are but a distant memory - my head is full of deadlines, restrictive covenants and the sound of phones ringing - someone even called my directline at 9pm last night! And were not surprised when I answered it! I really must pencil in time to get a life in my diary!  I've just seen Ian, the car park guy. He was relieved to see I'd survived the blind date. He made some very flattering comments, I think he's always had a soft spot for me, but then I was 25 and a size 10 when he first met me, and he does spend his working day in the basement of a multi-storey car park - think the lack of sunlight might have affected his eyesight - look what it did to Gollum!  Being offline seems to be having a surprisingly beneficial effect too - some of the chaps I might normally have chatted to are sending me very sweet e-mails, mind you they haven't met me yet! I do have a great face and figure for remote communication.  Anyway, I can't put off this pile of files which is threatening to collapse onto me any longer - nose back to the grindstone...."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I must be the only person not watching the England-Croatia match judging by the groans and cheers I can hear from the pubs outside the office - and they are all quite a way off so I dread to think what is happening out there. I was keeping up with it on Yahoo Sport! but it froze at 43 minutes - I think we've just gone into the second half having equalized. It sounds like I'm missing an exciting match -typical!  But then how many people will turn up for work tomorrow having polished off 4 client reports with 6 full tapes for their secretaries to get cracking on. I'm interviewing tomorrow so I need to make sure I'm on the ball (no pun intended, see above). I hope England take the lead, my lovely new boss might show his darker side if not, and I wouldn't wish that on the poor interviewee.  Right! It's 9pm - I want to get out of the office and back to the car before the ugly Northern yobs pour out of the pubs, braying for blood. and more importantly bafore my friendly little off-licence man shuts!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Yesterday was Jack's birthday. He didn't get the motorbike he wanted - had to make do with new aggressive in-line skates. He seemed pretty chuffed with them - and so was I - they were half price! And he knew it - so I ended up taking him and Boo out for a Chinese - starters, duck, main courses, skipped the puddings - Banana fritters don't really do it for us, coffees, I drew the line at brandy and cigars - he is still only 14, even if the tarty young waitress thought he was about 17! Flirt!!  We were the last to leave the restaurant - maybe I've created another hedonist in the family - we can even have a good time on Coca-Cola.  I was in sensible parent mode all night and even went to bed when I got in - sans wine, sans chatting, sorry, Throbbie! It did mean I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning - had a stupendously productive day today - both Ling and Lang were back at work, and one of my colleagues lent me a spare secretary so I'm almost up-to-date - think I may even have found a suitable assistant at long last - but I've got 2 more to interview tomorrow so we'll see what happens by the end of the week. I once considered HR as a career - don't think I would have been cut out for it though.  I also managed to exchange contracts on that case with the Cute Suit from North Lincolnshire yesterday - I was tempted to drag it out a bit longer so as to prolong the need to continue the flirty banter but then I'm secretly hoping he is being professional and waiting for it to finish before he invites me out - then again, he's probably just being professional and that'll be the last I have to do with him for another 10 years or so!  I had intended to rush home from work at 8pm tonight to start delousing the house before the french exchange student turns up on Thursday night - a fortnight - not sure my shoolgirl French will last much beyond Friday morning - but Sophie called and asked me round to her posh new pad for supper - (this must be how a midwife feels being invited to a christening of one of her deliveries). We had a lovely evening - the time flew by - it was 11.30 before we knew it and I had to say my good-byes - not before having a good old yarn about Martin - another of my potential successes bringing those two together - that was pure inspiration!  I've got Vickie's unexpected hen-night tomorrow - nothing ostentatious, but that's Vickie for you: self-deprecating, shuns any form of attention, patience of a saint, incredibly kind, thoughtful, and sensitive, wickedly funny,- I'm sure it will be hilarious - we all go back over 20 years and have been recent partici""pants"" in Knicker Exchange thanks to our host, Lisa (I'll save her description for another blog - and an update on my most recent underwear parcel).  And thus ends another perfect day when I have yet again managed to avoid any form of housework or domestic activity whatsoever."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Victor est arrivee! (if anyone knows how to type accents, please let me know - I can do it in Word but not sure on this site). He is very polite, if a little quiet. Jack and he seem to share a common love of eating and generally lounging about making my newly-decluttered house look positively hovel-like. Fortunately, they can spend their time in my Mum's lounge while she is away.  I managed to get them to school on time, I was a bit late picking them up again and then again for the meeting tonight but 1 out of 3 isn't bad for me. The meeting was over and done with very quickly so I needn't have worried aobut getting to the cricket. In fact, I really needn't as it was cancelled due to a water-logged pitch. I was looking forward to that too!  I dropped a card and some B&Q vouchers through Vickie's letter-box, she saw me and beckoned me in so I had a coffee, saw her fab dress and heard all about her day. Jack and Victor had originally not really wanted to go in, but after 7-year old Tom showed them his hamster, gerbil and the mini-fridge in his bedroom, they were quite happy. I swear I even saw Jack help Olivia dress one of her Barbies.  I've just dropped them in the next village so Victor can meet some of Jack's friends. Apparently a dozen or so of them are coming over for a party tomorrow night. They were meant to be camping but given the typical British weather we are having I imagine I will have a houseful of excited teenagers lolling all over the furniture instead. I can't argue, well, I could, but as Jack knows about the party I had when I was 15, which still gets mentioned to this day by total strangers and has featured on Friends Reunited, I have a very poor defence.  Oh, and the completion with the Cute Suit went very smoothly, all done by 11am - we had a very brief conversation to confirm it before he dashed off to court. That would normally have been sufficient, there was absolutely no reason for him to call me back just after lunch for a general chat. I felt a bit sad that the matter had come to an end and reminded him that we would have no cause to speak again but he reassured me that there would be some ""snagging"" issue that was bound to come up next week. I hope he thinks of one quick!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Why do the weekends go so quickly? and why do I never seem to achieve any of the things I plan to do? I just about manage to do the washing, give the place a very very quick once over, and then it's Sunday night again and I have to think about getting up early.  I love long lay-ins at a weekend - would be better if I had the Sunday paper delivered, and a handsome man to bring it to me along with a cup of coffee - he could read the Sport pages, and help me with the Crossword (but only if I asked him - I wouldn't want him starting it before me), and then insist I had another cosy slumber while he got on with the lunch preparations! Aaaahhh! To dream.  I did at least get over to see Dad this afternoon. He seemed thoroughly underwhelmed with his posh Penhaligons scent library, but little Emily was thrilled with her Beauty Box that I'd bought her as a special treat from her big sis. I was dying to get her to open it and try on the glitter gel and hair mascara but her mum had other ideas and told her to keep it for when she next had a party to go to - spoil sport.  I never did the usual girlie stuff as a kid - I always had my head in books - or wanted to play on the rope swing with the boys in the wood opposite, until the local farmer recognized me as one of the kids playing Chicken - swinging out just as he came down the hill, he told my Dad and that was an end to that for the summer - we had to decamp to the local river and swim off the slipway - until the local eel-farmer recognized me as one of the kids riding a bike off the jetty just as he was coming down stream...............  Kathryn was always the girlie one - she had a huge Sindy house - ex-display from the local toy shop - every single item of furniture and accessory then available - she used to get really cross when I snuck in and put Action man in very compromising poses with her dolls - funny - she never picked up any of my books, and she always hated playing Scrabble with me.  Emily's a bit of a girlie girl too - so I bought her some stilts for her birthday this year - boys toys were always much more fun - somethings we never grow out of!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,It's 5.30 am - just woken up on the sofa where I fell asleep about midnight - probably earlier as the telly was crap - I was determined not to be up all night chatting inanely to strangers so I've had a result - drinking water now and thinking about bed.  I've got a date today. I've bought so many new clothes lately I don't know what to wear.  Bed! Sleep! Worry about it later
3D8MI3M,female,33,"To add insult to injury I got stopped by  a random police check on the way home from work tonight. Had I been drinking? No!! I had not! It was 9.50pm on a Friday night so he can be forgiven for thinking I should have been! I'm sure he had a look of pity on his face as he waved me on.   That small delay meant my regular offie was shut so I've had to come home after a gruelling 13 and half hour day to half a bottle of poxy cheap mid-week Chilean Chardonnay. It's the weekend! I know it! You know it! Will somebody please tell my life that!   I'm still sneezing, coughing and spluttering. I was very tempted to curl up in a ball under my desk and weep like a baby at one point today but I'm nothing if not determined so I fought my way through it. I've actually had a very productive day - Ling has gone! I haven't taken a lunch break all week (who am I kidding - all year!) so I hadn't bought her anything - not even a card - but as more and more people started asking me how to spell her name - is it ""ra"" or ""orah""? I was finally shamed enough to pop out to M&S and get her a really stylish plant and card. I even splashed out on Vanilla Slices for the entire floor!   I was really nice to her as well - with hindsight I realise the whole experience would have been so much better if I'd tried that at the start of May instead of 2 hours before she left! Not that I was nasty - forfain!! I never am! but I can be a bit of a salty cow sometimes.   Anyway, my good deed paid off! I had an email from Cute Suit whilst I was away from my desk, followed by a phone chat ( I made sure the girls had gone home and shut my doors) and further text messages. It has lifted my spirits enough to decide to brave London myself with Jack and Le Brow tomorrow (I rang my Mum at lunchtime when I was feeling particularly poorly and sorry for myself and tried to bribe her into taking my place with the promise of lunch with my sister paid for by me, but she saw through the ruse and realised it would also mean traipsing around with 2 moody teenagers in the rain).    I figure I can sleep all the way there and back (I'll take my book just in case) and if all else fails I'll shove some cash in their hands, point them in the general direction of the Trocadero (hope they don't miss it and end up in SoHo) and Kathryn and I can head for a swanky wine bar.   Got to go! Up at 6!!!!! ( Lord! It is the weekend! Give a girl a break!!)"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I was in bliss for an hour and a half tonight! I cannot remember the last time I felt so relaxed.  I had a facial complete with head and shoulder massage. I think I dozed off a bit - cos Gianna re-entered the room just as Mum was about to tell me that all my Received Files had been sent to her PC too! That would have been a total nightmare - no expert needed to analyse that dream!  It's funny - you encounter all types on here - and some you accept, some you reject, some you are indifferent to - much like reality really, only easier - you can press a ""Block"" button and instantly all is well with the world- but I wonder how many of the people that you actually choose to correspond with would be chosen in everyday life! How many people do I dismiss as not clever enough, not witty enough, not interesting enough, not attractive enough? Would I gravitate away or towards them in an ordinary situation? Surely, we'd never meet otherwise.  I quite liked getting text messages from that sexy blonde (not my usual type) solicitor at 1.am this morning - I didn't reply - he needs to think I am wholesome and in bed at that time(as of course I alomst was) - it put a smile on my face and I didn't even mind being at work when he and Jack (seperately) had the day off to go and watch the Test Match at Headingley.  Now I'm just wondering what he will think of tomorrow as an excuse to email me! and also wondering if this is all just in my head and he really is just thinking about the particular case in hand. Time will tell."
3D8MI3M,female,33,Forgot to mention the biggest thing that happened to me today - i got into a 14!!!!!!!!!!
3D8MI3M,female,33,"This week is going to be a doddle! The Japanese boy arrived and was picked up by my mum. I called on Sally & Lee on the way home, ex-colleague and friend (& cheeky husband) who are  moving(by the grace of god and my superior conveyancing abilities) on Friday. They are coming over to the civilised, albeit 1950s civilisation, side of the river. Had a cup of tea, signed a few boring forms and caught up on the chinwag.  I got home just in time to limply shake hands with my new temporary Far-Eastern adoptee and wave him off for a meal with Jack & my mum. Hope she'll be this attentive all week.  So I have enjoyed a very leisurely night on the sofa - 2 hour telephone conversation with my Cruse Chair - she's lovely - and a brief snooze. The house is reasonably acceptable, the kids are sorted (thanks, Mum), my able assistant has everything under control at work, and work has started on decorating my new office, and Cute Suit is as prolific with his emails as ever. All is well with the world."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"It's my First Knickers Day!!!! The anticipation has been immense - what would they be like? who would they be from? was I wrong in ruling out dental-floss-esque styles?(anyone that knows me will be siding with my better instinct on that!)  So - white, lacy, hipster midi, French styley! Very nice actually - and as I haven't done any washing this week - arrived just in the Knick(!) of time! from Julie in Gloucestershire - I have a sneaking suspicion she might be a friend of my cousin Jennie - the lazy buggers in Hull haven't done it yet!  Gosh! I bet you are wondering what on earth I'm going on about! I know discussing my underwear is a bit extreme even for me. I've taken part in a Knicker Exchange. I was a little taken aback when I got the letter - very much like a chain letter - in fact, it IS a chain letter - but as it was from Lisa, who in turn had received it from Ali, I could hardly refuse - and it's hardly onerous.  All you had to do was send a pair of brand-new-label-still-attached-no-trying-them-on-or-letting-your-boyfriend pants to the persons name at the bottom of the letter. I sent Ali a sexy black and pink thong thingy - I think John would have liked it too. Then just send on the letter to 6 friends, with the instruction to do likewise.  Eva refused - think she was a bit embarrassed that she might not have so many friends - either that or she doesn't wear knickers when Roger is around and doesn't want to run the risk of him finding out that she does wear them normally - and will always be in large, tummy-hugging stretchy nylon numbers as soon as ever they are married. Better just not to open the topic!  I think everyone else is game! Kathryn was so keen, she sent out at least a dozen letters - I can't wait to get the knickers from her friends - they are bound to be posh!   I'm going to go and try on Julie's gift now. I'll keep you updated on how many and what type I get."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Another bank holiday. This one was meant to be different. I actually had plans. I was going to North Wales to see Jack's grandma and auntie (I do a very good avoidance of his Dad without appearing obvious) but Lisa called the other night and cancelled - uncle's very poorly and they are spending all their time at the hospital in Liverpool. I fully understood and we'll just go over in a few weeks time. I'm left feeling a little disappointed though.  I used to see my annual visit as a duty call- just so Jack would know who his father's family were - and neither of them could blame me for keeping them apart when he grew up. I didn't think we had much in common. I really enjoy going over now. Lisa, Jack's auntie, is lovely. She's a couple of years older than me, and much prettier. She's not well but you'd never know it from looking at her - she just keeps going. Kevin, her partner, is an all-action hero with a fab TVR and June and Arthur, Grandma and Grandad, are salt-of-the-earth types who'd give you their last ha'penny. Stephen's not all bad either, I just don't have call to see him anymore - Jack's big enough to go on his own now - thankfully.  We never do much apart from shop at Cheshire Oaks or wander around Chester. I had intended to spend a fortune this weekend, new clothes, new shoes, all for me for a change. Oh well! I can't seem to be able to get rid of it at the moment - a sure sign my mood has lifted.  Now what should I do? I have a brand new Astra to play with, on hire courtesy of the chap who ran into the back of me, or at least his insurance, whilst my rear end is fixed. I'm dead chuffed not to have a flipping awful Corsa. I've explored various options; Kathryn is busy so I can't go to London to see my sis; Eva is free tonight and will probably come over after she's been to wish her Grandma happy birthday but I can't leave Jack on his own so Leeds is out, Rachel is probably sick of the sight of me,and even Marko, my old faithful fall-back, is working and obviously doesn't want to accommmodate an ex from 6 or 7 years ago and his godson.  That leaves me with internet options. If I was brave enough, I'd go over to Belfast to meet a cheeky rogue who's caught my eye. My hunky rugby player is away on holiday so there won't be any scrummaging there for a few weeks. There are 2 or 3 cute guys in deepest Lincolnshire who I might meet. I'm certain there will be no romance but it's likely to be a lot more fun than cleaning out my kitchen cupboards, or mopping my floor, activities that I do not want to be repeating on yet another bank holiday, when everyone else I know is having a loved-up long weekend.  That's it decided! RSPB Nature Reserve it is! I always want to Hide on dates so it's the perfect choice. He'll recognize me soon enough. I'll be the rare visitor in summer plumage and totally impractical heels."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I wasn't sure whether Ian was joking when he promised to wear his thong to bring breakfast this morning. I was so relieved when Lynn, his recently-installed girlfriend knocked on the spare bedroom door and handed me a coffee and a plate of warm buttery crumpets.   I used to work with Ian. He's a real sweetheart, 56, ex-CID, came home one day to find a note from his wife of 35 years to say she'd left him for a younger man who she'd been seeing for the past year or so whilst he underwent surgery and chemotherapy for throat cancer. It gutted him as you would imagine, but he's turned the corner now and seems genuinely happy with his new lady.  We were all going to a party at Ian's cousin's. I now work with Neil and was looking forward to meeting some of my colleagues and their partners out of the office. It was a fun night - not as riotous as the one last week - and thank goodness for patio heaters. I think I was the only single one there but it didn't stop the women from talking to me - which was nice!   Thankfully, I had very little to drink, by my standards, so I had no trouble getting up early and home in time to pick Jack up from rugby training. We then had to hot foot it over to the Showground where Jack was taking part in the Athletics at the local agricultural show. He came third in his race - his school second overall and it stayed warm and sunny -result!  We've just popped home for him to have a shower and then we're going over to Rachel's. Wonder what room she'll have decorated this time? There's a different colour every time you go round - wonder if she'll hire Steve out? I might feel more inclination to tidy up if it didn't still look so grubby after I'd finished."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Was it really only Thursday that I made my last posting? So much seems to have happened.  Friday started very strangely - first time in over 15 years that I haven't been in control of my own completions - and I had loads - but my Able Assistant seemed to have everything in hand, so i started on my post about 8 hours earlier than usual - a good omen for getting away early that night for the Head's party.  I made the foolish mistake of mentioning to the boss, just after lunch, that I was in danger of actually getting caught up to date and that he might want to think about sending some more work my way. Classic error!  By 2pm I was frantically trying to trace money from Bristol bound for South Africa, had the possibility of 2 families sleeping in a van with all their belongings (one of whom was an old friend and colleague), and a very handsome but slightly deranged control-freak of a first-time buyer threatening to carry out Ozzy Osbourne style abominations on my favourite(!) estate agent. All was well by 4.30! I have the organised regimentary skills of Montgomery when I sat my mind to it!  I left just in time to get home to change and head out to the Head's party - picturesque riverside setting, flowing wine and a hot-tub in the garden - where else would a stressed girl want to be on an evening? A few people did sample the relaxing wonders of the tub - albeit in small groups - I joined Jack. It was fab! The result being that we are getting one - a family decision was made - my mum and step-monster are paying!  Saturday was supposed to be rock-climbing day - I made a token effort by putting on trousers, tailored smart ones, but that's all I have, and high-heeled mules - I dropped Jack and his Japanese chum off and then made off to the shops before my client had chance to haul my ass in a harness 12feet above him - not a facet of myself that I relish him seeing.  It was a frantic race back home to get changed into a bustier and new beaded poncho and then off to Leeds for Eva's hen-night - a very sophisticated affair made all the more traditional with the addition of a flashing ""Bride To Be Sash"", some handcuffs, a few sorry foam sexy(?) images and a pop-up willy disguised as a bottle of Instant Erection pills! Classy, tasteful, discreet enough to have at the table in Leeds swankiest eaterie - but still in keeping with the hen-party theme. I hope she was pleased with the result, and appreciated that I could quite easily have opted for the full-on mega-vibrator and blow-up doll experience!  Today was our final good-bye to Leeds shopping, or at least the experience we have enjoyed for the last 4 years -  get up late, take an age to have breakfast, hit the shops by about 2.30, get hot and tired with different agendas, find the Sunday papers and crash in a restaurant somewhere to sate our appetites and ease our feet - le Bistro de Jour being La Tasca, by the window in the afternoon sun.  I finally caught up with Jack by about 7 o'clock tonight - he's heading out to Spain in a couple of weeks  - later than I had expected and probably means I won't develop the sudden urge to book a last-minute holiday to relieve my boredom, by the time I've noticed he's gone, Eva will be back from her honeymoon and will be on the phone to tell me off for choosing to wear a corset at her wedding!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"My pleas have finally been heard by our super-efficient Office Manager - I now have a large oscillating fan keeping me cool. My request for a sun-bronzed bare-chested handsome mute with an ostrich feather fan standing behind me drip feeding me grapes was ignored but you can't have everything.  It's not arrived a minute too soon either, having spent most of the afternoon playing ever cheekier and flirtier email tennis with a cute, and I suspect newly-single, solicitor who I used to deal with a lot when I worked in my home town. Our paths have crossed for the first time in over 8 years on a friend's house purchase - it's so much more fun when you can inject some humour into what could otherwise become a dull legal process.   There are some boring old farts in this game - too stuffy and far too serious to be taken seriously - thankfully, they are a bit of a dying breed - even solicitors have to recognise that they are performing a public, client-centred service - not doing the public a favour by allowing themselves to be instructed and paid handsomely for it. The only ones that tend to get paid anything like a decent return now are estate agents!  Mind you, most of the agents I deal with regularly are really helpful, like Sarah, bless her, who spent all afternoon phoning removal companies to find a van for one of her sellers for tomorrow, just so my clients, who were further down the chain could move the day before they go away after a very stressful 3 month delay. It worked - contracts were exchanged by 3.30pm - client is delighted  - so much so he offered to take me on holiday with him at the weekend - if only I'd managed to find an assistant who I can rely on to cover for me, I might just have taken him up on it - I've got to know he and his wife quite well from our daily chats and emails.It won't see the same next week!  Oh well! What I can be sure of, is that there will soon be another to take his place!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"It's almost 8pm and I've just finished preparing my completions for tomorrow. I don't like to cut it that fine, there are enough things that can go wrong and cause enough stress for me as it is, without the prospect of having forgotten to request mortgage funds and not a hope in hell of getting them in time for the clients to move. I've never actually done that in over 16 years but there's always a first time, and I seem to be chasing my tail so much just lately that it could strike at any time!  Fingers crossed, they all look reasonably ok -  a couple of estate agents haven't got their bills through to me yet so they may have to wait a few days to get paid - so there are some benefits to being overworked! Cup half full, girl. me!!  My lovely boss and I have interviewed a potential new Personal Assistant for me tonight. I'm not sure whether she'll take the job - she is likely to see it as a step backwards given that she is currently running the show at another firm, albeit by default when the solicitor left and wasn't replaced immediately. She's probably not quite ready to be in the deep end with us big fish yet and is floundering about a bit, a few years under my expert fin and she'd have the makings of a good career - but anyway, we'll see what happens. She's very tall, slim and blonde - and did I mention 21? -but she's got massive feet - canoes for shoes -I like to know I'm better shod than my junior team players. Listen at me - Eva's coaching is beginning to play off - my first instinct was to say ""underlings"".  I'm off home now, still another 45 minutes drive but the scenery is really pretty and if I'm lucky I may just see the sun setting over the Humber Bridge. I've done really well the last few nights and more or less gone straight to bed when I've got in rather than sitting chatting to interesting cyber-hologram men. I've had a really stressful long day today and know I've got an even worse one coming up tomorrow - normally a trigger to reach for the Shiraz to help me forget about it - but I've got to be up early to take my car to the garage. I'm getting a hire car while it's in the plastic surgery unit. Not sure what but the lovely lad from the hire company promised me something of a higher grade than a bloody awful Corsa or Fiesta! I'll probably get an Astra! Oh well, I can just pretend I'm a Sales rep as I drive across the Pennines tomorrow night! It's got to be better than being a Conveyancer on the last Friday of month before a bank holiday and half-term!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I decided at 3.30pm today that I would resign from my Charity position - I had not even started to look at Friday's post, let alone today's and my in-tray was higher than my washing pile at home! Something had to give and my charitable indulgences seemed the obvious choice! I rang the new Chair-in-Waiting and told her I would be taking a few months sabbatical - I meant it! I came off the phone all proud of myself at having finally said ""no!"" - not an expression I've used often as a 30-something single mum!  I went to rescue my carat 6.30pm from the multi-storey with every intention of going back to the office but the further away I got from it the more I decided the work would still be there tomorrow - so I started to drive home and before I knew it I was in the car park of the Baptist Church - venue for the AGM! Well, I had invited the speaker, would be rude not to show my face!  I'm pleased I did - the proceedings started perfunctorily - I found myself agreeing to remain as Publicity Officer! (joke! - I write the odd editorial for the paper and run a Ball or 2!) I could have kicked myself after all my brave words on the phone about being too busy but then I never could say no!!  But my speaker! What a delight!! A localish-ish Funeral Director! Not your normal choice of bon vivant, but an absolute pearl!  Funny, compelling, witty, discreet, compassionate,and extremely respectful to the objects of his dialogue (and dialogue it was with audience participation encouraged)! He has a book out in a couple of weeks - "" Yours,Eventually"", 120 stories randomly collected over 30 years as a funeral director - if his delivery of half a dozen of those anecdotes tonight are anything to go by, he will have you in raptures and tears for the small price of £6.99!! Mark Tyack!! He'll be big - you saw it here first!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"He's gone! Ca c'est formidable!!! It was well worth getting up at 4am and standing around the council car park. I started to get a bit nervous when they still hadn't driven off after 50 minutes, one person was late (and for once it wasn't me - we were almost first there).  Victor had swapped seats so couldn't see us, so I saw our opportunity and Jack & I legged it back to the car and drove off at speed, just in case there was a serious delay and they tried to make us take him back again.  I went straight to work. The car park attendant was a bit surprised to see me pull up behind him as he was unlocking the gates, specially as my make-up was still in its bag and not yet on my face.   I always really like early mornings, I must try and see more of them at the start of a day instead of on my way to bed.  I had a pretty cracking day all round in fact. My new assistant started working for me, the decorator was booked and came and started measuring up my new office - I'm getting new carpet, paint, furniture and have been given the green light to go to IKEA and buy whatever I want to make it a bit more homely, and something else happened at the very end of the day that I don't want to say too much about just yet, in case I jinx it, but I am really really looking forward to tomorrow lunchtime.  Talking of which, I must get my beauty sleep - more important than ever. I have new shoes, eye mask chilling in the fridge for the morning, and I'm about to paint my nails. Zippadee do-dah, zippidee day, my oh my..............."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"One could be forgiven for assuming that my sallies into dating land are starting to pay off, given that I have spent the afternoon in the company of a very lovely member of the opposite sex with a swollen apendage. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth - I have been visiting my scrummy godson who recently underwent a little boy's operation and is now enjoying running around in the sun with the perfect excuse to go commando. He is such a brave little soldier!  It was a really pleasant afternoon, sitting in the garden, soaking up the sun, chatting idly, and then enjoying a delicious salad. Steve was a little anxious that Jack, being 13 and having a masters in computer games, would beat him to the next level of his latest excuse not to finish the 101 DIY jobs that Rachel finds for him the minute he gets home from his busy manual job, but he needn't have worried (Jack confessed in the car on the way home that he'd actually finished that game well over 6 months ago, so he had no need to compete).  I considered stopping off at the cinema on the way home. Jack was unusually willing to venture in with me, I suspect because he knows none of his friends go there on a Sunday evening so he was safe from being spotted unfashionably with his mum. In the event, my excesses of chatting on here over the past 2 nights caught up with me and I opted for the quickest route to the sofa and my paper. I've abandoned that safe haven now, after enduring 5 minutes of Hells Kitchen! I thought TV was supposed to be entertaining! Awful presenter! Awful chefs! Awful vehicle for washed-up sad old has -beens! (Amanda Barrie, you were great as Cleopatra and I really liked Alma - but pleeeeaase!)  I am absolutley not going to be on here for long! Busy weeks starts again in less than 9 hours and I want to be able to hit the phones running! But I might just hop onto my friendly website, just to see who's there and how my newly-posted photo is doing - I'm big on the Continent by all accounts."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I am despairing of my French ward. He has expressed interest in only 2 things - rugby and Lord of The Rings. Yesterday I took him into a Dungeons & Dragons type shop where they sold all sorts of models and battle gear - he just looked around, shrugged and walked out.     This morning he was invited to the rugby club for the training but he chose to stay in his room - all day! The boy is clearly bored at best, thoroughly miserable more likely. Ben came over with his motorbike this afternoon and he didn't even raise his brow! I was blagged into going and getting them some petrol and Jack & Ben disappeared off to churn up some field somewhere down the bottom end of the village.     Conscious that he hadn't come out of his room even for food or drink, I rustled up some Tuna Melt and a glass of apple juice and then invited him to Tesco with me - I know it's hardly the most tempting offer for a teenager, but I did explain he could choose what he wanted to eat in his pack-up tomorrow and that there were lots of things he might want to buy, cds, dvds, magazines,clothes, sweets etc. Personally I love nothing more than wandering around foreign supermarkets, I always come away with lots of exotic goodies and a few comics or magazines to look through. He swiftly rejected the idea and continued to make notes on Napoleon! I think he's still seething from Agincourt! Honestly! I cannot understand why on earth he got involved with this exchange when he obviously hates the English (I'm not so paranoid that I think it's just us - it really is a national thing). It's bothering me, but I do have to realise that you can't win 'em all.     He ate all the Lasagne I cooked this evening, left most of the salad (that was Italian, perhaps he just dislikes all things pas Francais) and did venture out long enough to watch some TV with Jack, although I'm not sure he ever spoke.     I watched a bit of the golf, just in case I bump into the Cute Suit anytime soon, helps to do a bit of homework sometimes, and I found myself strangely enjoying it - I didn't know you had play-offs in such an ambulatory sport - bet the ball would have ended up on the beach if Beckham had been taking a swing."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"What a strange weekend it's been! I really shouldn't be left unsupervised! My teenage son, fondly referred to as the Cashmonster (CM), has been away on a school exchange for the last 2 weeks and I've taken full advantage of the opportunity to get clicking on the Internet! My eyes have been opened, I can tell you!  I discovered Internet Dating recently! I'm addicted! I haven't really bothered with the opposite sex for the last few years!There is a story behind it but it is far too painful to reveal on our first meeting! Anyway, I've become somewhat of an overnight success!I'd never even stepped foot in a Chat room before - thought msn was just a place where kids get groomed by bogus sinister characters  - certainly not a place for an intelligent, moderately successful, independent working single mum from a back-water in Lincolnshire to spend her leisure time! Gosh! Am I a quick learner though!  It all started about 3 or 4 weeks ago! The CM was out doing what he does best - wasting my hard-earned money down the local High Street with his baseball-becapped spotty mates! I had a sinkful of pots and a kitchen floor that had more flora on it than a small tropical rainforest along the amazon! It was so awful in that kitchen that even the ants were starting to complain!I'm very good at multi-tasking so I decided to have a click about on the computer whilst sipping coffee and procrastinating!  I'd bought the new computer at Christmas for the CM! I'd had a bit of a play about on it when it was first installed - checked out the BBC - booked tickets to see Mastermind being filmed (? don't ask!) - subscribed to the National Trust newsletter - entered a few competitions - tried to find Martin Johnson's home number! You know, the usual! Well, a friend had told me about a dating site which was supposed to be very good with a high success rate of marriages to handsome, intelligent, wealthy doctors! Needless to say, I'd checked it out - even posted an anonymous profile but I wasn't prepared to go as far as subscribing to it! I wasn't going to pay good money to be ignored by men in my spare room as well as in the supermarket, bar, workplace! So I'd forgotten all about it!  This particular day I was merrily deleting spam from my Inbox when I came across a free introduction to a new dating site! On impulse I clicked on it and decided to have a nosy about! I was a little bit circumspect when I saw it was obviously very adult-orientated but I'm a broad-minded girl! (well, actually that's not quite true - I pretend to be but when it comes down to the nitty gritty Sunday school had a very strong early influence in my life!) Anyway, I ticked all the boxes so as to ensure I could see all the site had to offer! Who can blame me - everyone pretends to be what they're not on here apparently! What harm's one more 32 year old bored mum masquerading as a bisexual, dominatrix, swinger going to do? Anyway, within minutes people are trying to talk to me! I was terrified! There was a 22 year old couple in Burnley who obviously believed in share and share alike! A 39 year old guy from a South coast seaside retirement town who was clearly very proud of his satin bedspread! And then a guy of a similar age to me from an East coast resort not too far away from me! I decided to try and talk to him!   Me: ""Hello! How's the weather in Ethelthorpe-by-Sea today?""  King Kong: ""So you here to talk dirty then? How big are your tits?!""  Me: Gulp!   KK: Do you take it up the dark way?  Me: (delay where I wasn't sure if he'd be offended if I just left the room at a rapid pace, I'm new to these things remember! What if he could see me on the webcam I'd bought CM) I'm really sorry, Mr Kong! I seem to have stumbled in here by mistake - terribly sorry to waste your time! have a good day!  KK: (suddenly and strangely softer tone to his text) Hey, that's ok, Cherrypie69! (ok! OK!-I was just trying to fit in remember!) It's not really my type of thing either if truth be told! Much prefer a pint with my mates and a game of snooker! Why don't you try www.singlesaferand freetowomen.co.uk!  And it was as simple as that! I've not been back to www.hotrampantscarypeople.co.uk, not even to remove my profile! I bet I'm the biggest prick-tease on their! Some poor guy with a fetish about being ignored is having a rare old party, I'll wager!  But I have joined the tipped site! My ability to attract the opposite sex has mulitplied ten-fold at least! I got carried away after the second night - helped along by a few glasses of wine! Well, here's a woman who never had a shortage of admirers in her youth but had spent the last 2 years sitting on her sofa with her wine bottle and the remote control for company every night about as attractive as Waynetta Slob when she's not making the effort!! I'd suddenly got half a dozen men from all over the place wanting to talk to me! I even got crushed on by a very handsome, young Italian guy, so you can understand a girl's head can be turned! They all wanted to know what I looked like!  So you can perhaps see how easy it might be to have a momentary lapse of sanity! I posted my picture there! My gorgeous new friends shouldn't be deprived of being able to see the vision of loveliness that is this witty, edgy, feisty sex-kitten they're beginning to fall in love with! It seemed like such a good idea at the time! I really must start a campaign to fit breathalysers to computers ( and mobile phones but that's a topic for another day)!   You may or may not know that it usually takes a site-provider a few days to approve the profiles and pictures that people post onto it! Make sure it's not indecent, illegal, libellous etc. (not something www.hotrampantscarypeople.co.uk spent much time on!) So it was quite a surprise 2 days later when I check my e-mails during my lunchhour and see a message from the dating site proudly informing me my smiling mug was now being published to the world at large! AAaaaaaarggghh! Panic! It didn't seem quite such a good idea in the sober light of day! Particularly given that I'd used the only digital shot I had access to, my work's publicity shot - which was due to be published in the local daily paperwith a readership of about 250,000! That afternoon was one of the longest of my life! I was supposed to be going straight to my weekly Fat Club after work but instead I dashed home and sped into the backroom to quickly remove it before too much damage was done! I figured most people would still be on their way home from work before 6 so I might be able to remove it before too much damage was done!  Nnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooo! "" Your picture can not be edited for 72 hours!""   I was stuck up there, approachably grinning at hundreds of strangers and, even worse thought, people that might know me! Despair! Horror! I was tempted to collapse sobbing in a corner but I'd already paid my subsription to be routinely and publicly humiliated on the scales at the local Church Hall! And on the bright side - I'd not had a problem with constipation or water-retention that day! I'd worry about it later after I'd bounced about the community centre with my fellow salad-dodgers!  In my defense, I was probably already in a mild state of euphoria, brought on by the irritatingly pert Cheese Nazi declaring (in a far too amazed tone for my liking!) that I'd lost 2 whole pounds in a week! So when I eventually logged back on, the realisation that in the space of less than 6 hours 56 men had all been interested enough by my mugshot to click on my profile and learn more about me actually gave me a bit of a buzz! And as I watched they kept coming, from all over the place, Barnsley, Bristol, Ghana, Guadeloupe! These men were either all blind or I didn't look completely like Hattie Jacques and Bernard Mannings love child!   Anyway, I've not really looked back since! I did remove my picture after the obligatory 3 days by which time I'd had almost 200 hits and loads of men wanting to chat - some more successfully than others! I was lapping it up! I was a Cyber-Goddess! I've made new friends all over the place, I've started to brush up on my rusty school-girl French (with varying degrees of appreciation) and I have about 4 or 5 apparently intelligent and not-too-unattractive (if they are using their own image that is) eligible-sounding suitors vying for the chance to have the pleasure of accompanying me on a date!I've had a couple who are only there for the cyber-sex too! I was very good at dodging it at first, but then I came over all Mrs Robinson with a 20 year old postman from a town not too far away from me! It was actually quite good fun!   I've come to a bit of a halt though! It's getting increasingly difficult to justify chatting to these lovely male companions every night and not take that next step of actually meeting them, in a safe public place you understand! I've made a number of different excuses - all of which translate into ""I'm too scared! Let's just stay here where it's safe and you can go on thinking I'm the witty, sexy, glamorous, successful Woman-of -your-Dreams!"" I've also spoken to a couple on the phone! That can be a bit odd! How do you tell someone you've been flirting with for the last 3 weeks, who you had imagined with the voice of Barry White, that they sound more like Kenneth Williams!? Very disappointing for a girl!   Anyway - I'll let you know if there any developments! I'm gonna just log back on for a few minutes - just in case Colin Firth got connected!  ;-) x C"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I am doing cartwheels! Metaphorically - not literally  - though for the first time since I was about 12 I am actually tempted!  I HAVE AN ASSISTANT! AND SHE'S EXPERIENCED, GOOD, FAST, AND QUIETER THAN ME!!!!! Quite simply, she's perfect.  Can't talk now - got to write to the disappointed candidates - but you can bet I'll be back later tonight.  Happy Days are here again! :-)"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I'be dot a dold! I thought I was just in a crabby mood when I woke up yesterday but the sneezing started by about 10am and it was rapidly downhill, mainly down my nose in fact, and by last night I was shivering, coughing and could barely breathe - I just about managed to stay up to watch Grif and his ruins and then turned in for the night - wish I'd realized that the non-drowsy Sudafed meant stimulant! I endured one of those nights where you toss and turn and seem to look at the clock every hour and only 5 minutes has passed - I then fell asleep at about 6, just before the alarm went off.  So I felt rubbish all day, perked up a bit when I got some emails from Cute Suit ( I got one at the weekend from his home address too :-)) and then had to sit through almost 3 hours of boring meeting before waiting in the car for 45 mins for Jack and Le Brow to leave their disco - I utilised the time by reclining the seat and having a snooze - God! when did I start to turn into my Dad!  I hope I feel better tomorrow - I want to start looking for an outfit for Eva's wedding and nothing looks flattering when you have a big red shiny nose and puffy eyes. But then again, it's nice to have an excuse to look awful rather than the fact that you just do!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"4 lbs! 4 whole flipping pounds! That's more than twice the size of Tutty's premature young son! In 2 weeks! Olympic dieter, or what? and that's without any effort (throwing myself around Eva's front room in my pyjamas to the strains of Shang-a-Lang doesn't count - although I either pulled a muscle or my sciatic nerve is offended!)  Didn't work out tonight, on account of the offended Gluteus Maximus - but I skipped home - did I say skipped? I meant drove, very slowly 'cos I was so tired from having allowed myself to be chatted at for hours last night on msn - via the car wash - she looks so much better, and now I can see through the windscreen facing the sun, much more reassuring for me and other road-users - does that make me eligible for a discount on my insurance do you think?  At this rate I'll be raiding Eva's wardrobe again by September! Or I might just treat myself to a whole new one! and it will not be from George!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I did it! I pulled the rabbit out of the hat - again! God! I'm proud of myself sometimes. I managed to complete the nasty old down-in-the-mouth dentist's sale so he could move into his new hutch with his buck-toothed wife - I did it for my own client and the other lawyers in the chain - part of me was really quite annoyed that such a horrid bully boy got his way but then I'm a better, more charitable person than him, and the gratitude it afforded me from my colleagues and the agents was worth it. My lovely new boss even gave me a bottle of champagne as a reward for my stupendous efforts and forbade me from going anywhere near the office this weekend - much different to my old boss who would have taken the credit for it himself somehow - and then promptly asked me to spend my leisure time writing some banal report for one of his many pointless meetings.   I'll give you an example of what he was like - there was one night last winter when I was staying late trying to get some urgent things on tape. It had been snowing all day and there was no sign of it letting up. My old Scroogey boss popped back into the office, probably to ring a girlfriend or pull himself off in the boardroom and was most concerned to see me still slaving away at 8pm with the prospect of a 30 mile journey home along country roads. He was clearly worried I might not make it in the car (or indeed back again the next morning) so he kindly informed me that he had no problem with me......booking into a hotel? staying the night in the guest room given that he has a huge 5 bedroom house and there's only him and his adorable long-suffering wife left at home? go home straight away before the weather worsened? No!!! It was quite acceptable for me to put some of the chairs together and sleep in one of the backrooms! I could hardly believe what I was hearing!! And to think I stuck it out for 7 years!   So now the weekend is upon me again - I cleaned the house last week so I can't do that again for a good few months! CM is staying at his mate's so I'll pray they stay up in his room surfing for porn or something rather than getting themselves arrested! Saw most of my friends last week and I haven't done anything since deserving of an anecdote to amuse and entertain them. Can't think of anything I want to buy - (Christ! My depression must be lifting! never thought I'd hear myself saying that!)My ex, my safety blanket when I'm terminally bored, is working away so won't be around to play with me. So I'll just have to sleep late, lay in bed even later reading the new novel recommended to me or finishing the last one, and generally slob out - no phones, no demanding clients, no pushy pseudo-lovers! Singledom has its advantages!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I was up and at'em this morning and would have been an hour early for work,(think it might have had something to do with the endorphins released by chatting to Mr. Sunday, Mr Thursday-Night, Mr Next-Monday and Mr Weekend-Later-in-the-Month simultaneously last night - good job I'd stayed on the bottled water, wouldn't have wanted to get those messages mixed up) but I decided to use the extra time to make an 8-mile, half hour detour to the car hire place to pick up the gym bag and other stuff that I'd left in the Astra boot. I didn't think I'd have time tonight and didn't want to leave myself with an excuse not to go see the Cheese Nazi and her Scales of Fortune.  My conspiracy theory proved to be valid again! They'd only just gone to pick the car up, from the garage which I pass every morning on my way to work. They promised they wouldn't be long and suggested I wait - so I did - and I did - and I did - I rang my secretary to let her know where I was (20 minutes before she would have expected to see me, and made sure I stood where she could hear the traffic so she would believe me and not think I was just making up ever more elaborate excuses for having over-indulged on the internet the night before and overslept), I waited so long that another 5 minutes didn't seem to matter. I was so pleased to see the shiny car drive in, and dashed straight across to the driver as he got out. Sure enough, he knew I'd left some things in the boot, but he'd helpfully left them at the garage!!!   So I'd waited best part of 45 minutes for nothing! I'd been had again by the vicious Evil Force that prevents me from getting anywhere early ever, despite my best efforts - and it's not like I hadn't phoned them first thing Saturday when I realised what I'd done - I'd been so careful to ensure that I safely removed Jack's Gangsta Rap rubbish (which I've found myself singing along to a few times now - worrying) that I'd forgotten all about the stuff I'd put in the back.  Oh well! I got my £50 fuel deposit back and filled a Customer Satisfaction Questionnaire telling them about the dodgy fuel gauge. I don't think I'll be Customer of the Month somehow.  I made sure the payment slip fell out of my handbag when I got to work so my secretary could see that I hadn't been making it up. I feel guilty even when I know I've done nothing wrong.   And now I have no exercise clothes or trainers and time to make up at work so there's absolutely no way I'm going to Fat Club - guess I'll just stay here and drone into the dictaphone for a while longer - I don't want to go online tonight 'cos I'm interviewing with my lovely new boss at 9.30 in the morning for my assistant's position and I want to be all bright eyed and bushy-tailed. I've got away with it so far this week but I can't run the risk of getting lured in by one of the deceptively-charming, but probable servants of the Evil Force that delays me everywhere I go."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I've missed my secretary -she's been poorly sick for 3 days now - I've just had Ling to do my bidding - and she did great for the first 2 days - but today! I gave her my completions to do - only 10 today and all purchases (bar one which was a very straightforward sale) - they were all t'd up and couldn't have been an easier day to start - she did well - but she thought she did outstandingly well - she was smugger than ever this afternoon, and kept bustling into my office every 5 flipping minutes - I shut my door for a reason, being ""I'm busy - I vant to be alone"" - Jacquie knows that instinctively - Ling obviously sees it as a challenge - or an invitation to irritate me as much as possible - she was outstanding at that!  So, tonight I was home just after 8pm - had a good long chat with Eva - God! she gave me some great material for my book - then Jack came home and went online - I fell asleep - only just woken up (3.45am) - and I've missed the Throb - means I've got to wait til Sunday at the earliest now - and I'll need an early, pre-school night then! Bugger!  But I did have some fun with that cute solicitor before I left work - dinner is now just a few emails away - I can feel it!  Oh! and I went shopping in an extended lunch hour - get me! having a break on a Friday!! I could get used to Ling after all! - tried on loads of tops in the sales - and the only ones that fitted were 14s!!! and then some were a bit baggy! Didn't find the perfect corset-style top I was after, but got a very acceptable scoop neck chiffon number which will look great with my new leather skirt tomorrow night.  And given that the Throb is clearly sleeping, Imight even manage to be eye-bag-free for this party - so all in all, I'm reeeeeeeaaaallllllly looking forward to this party tomorrow!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I am The Last Single Person in Cheryl's World. Eva is officially engaged - ring, the works!  It's all been a bit quick,but I'm not surprised and I'm utterly thrilled for her - except she's talking about having the kind of wedding where no guests are invited! I always expected that of her - and I do respect it  - but I assumed there'd be an exception for me - I've picked evil black spines out of her feet on the first day of our holiday,for goodness sake! You would have thought that would count for something!  Anyway, I am quite looking forward to being the only one dating - now that I sort-of-ish am - well at least getting out of the house and off this toneless telex offspring. I'll have much more interesting stories to tell at dinner parties than how Rupert changed a fuse in just one sock - he was so brave! and what the interest rate hikes mean to their holiday destinations!  Now! I'm not bitter - just practising!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I feel like Julie Andrews. Last year Jack stayed with Soh, the year before that we hosted Koh - tomorrow Toh arrives. If my blog disappears, I may well have run off to Austria to be a nun!   I'm beginning to wonder about all this hosting lark - I stopped cleaning at 11.30 tonight- missed a double run of Coronation Street - and had no tea ( fantastic! diet slipped a bit while yon Brow was plagueing us). I might have to ring Cute Suit's cleaner and book her from tomorrow.  I also bought a dress for Eva's wedding - silk, lavender, corset style :-/ it looked good in the shop and was in the sale - which meant a larger budget for the shoes, handbag and pashmina - decided against a hat - I think it might be too flamboyant amongst 6 other guests.  I've made the bed, put out clean towels, cleaned the house, but forgotten the flowers - last weeks' lilies are looking very tired - I hope Toh thinks they are an avant garde Ikibana display. Roll on August - Jack in Spain - me out of pain!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"It looks like I'm going to have to go over to Leeds mid-week if I have any hope of seeing The Ring this side of autumn. Eva's following Roger around the country every weekend. She promises she won't be the type of girl who never makes time for her friends once they get a boyfriend - and I do think she means it - just not yet.  No doubt she'll be moving to Sheffield soon - that's ok - I don't mind going out there - although I do prefer Leeds - but as Roger quite rightly pointed out, we do invariably sit in Eva's lounge and get pissed so we could do that in any city. Guess we'll have to play Trivial Pursuit more too 'cos we will only need to go through half the ""why haven't I got a boyfriend"" conversation.  Right! I'm off to the Scales of Terror - wish me luck!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"stayed home today. got my hair cut, bought packing tape, and got my renter's insurance paperwork signed. Am is on her way over now to watch some tv with me and help me pack. seems she grabbed some boxes from work for me. oh and she sent me a picture of the flowers i sent her. she still really likes them!  click  urlLink here  for picture."
0M69NG5,male,25,"somehow i forgot to post the past few days. well i got my tire fixed. took it to big o tires and they fixed it without issue. the party was pretty good saturday night too. Am showed me some mild attention while there so that helped out my self-esteem. this weekend is a big trip to cali for a huge party on saturday and a car show on sunday. i reserved us a hotel room awhile back for saturday night at the host of the car show's hotel. its a 4 person room for Am and i along with wife-Al and her hubby, which are also riding out with us. i talked to Am last night on the phone which i only inteaded to be a minute and we ended up being on the phone for a few hours. she told me that she is getting pretty excited about the upcoming weekend which made me feel pretty good. until i started wondering if she was excited because it was going to be a fun weekend with me and our friends or because it was going to be fun weekend with friends. ugh, i hate not knowing. i guess i'll just have to see how the weekend goes. i'm looking forward to it."
0M69NG5,male,25,"so i had a huge party saturday night. bunch of vw people showed to drink from my keg of killian's and have slice or two from the 2 huge 21"" pizzas. good time had by all. about 20 to 25 people at one time were here. a guest and i drank from the yard of beer and a bunch of us took turns with the 3 beer funnel. i got completely toasted to the point were it took me a good 5 minutes to walk across my house as i was having to concentrate very hard on each and every step. and apparently i also had fun that i do not remember. i've been told that i was hold up in my bathroom with two bisexual girls for the better part of an hour, but i have no memory of it. i hope it was memorable for them. the remaining party goers still around by 2am ventured with me to the local denny's were we demolished silverware, shot toothpicks into the ceiling and i apparently picked up the $100 including tip tab. not that i mind. woke up today without, surprisingly, a hangover nor headache. and for the amount of beer i consumed that's really amazing. i spent the day watching tv after a half assed attempt to clean my home. the belt on my vacuum is broke so i have to wait until tomorrow to do the vacuuming. i really should get to bed now, i've work in the morning and probably should be mostly coherent as my co-workers will want to hear about the party."
0M69NG5,male,25,"is there anything better than a 32oz mug of guinness? well, maybe a free one, but beggers can't be choosers. met some ppl up at the vine tavern for a drink and a pizza. i think bullshitting is the next thing in conversational movements, really.  are you ready for the great guinness toast this friday?"
0M69NG5,male,25,"i got another hit via a search engine! my first one was done at  urlLink search.yahoo.com  with the words searched ""fucking in a car""...how the hell did that pull up my page? today's hit came from the yahoo search engine too but the search words were a little less exciting: ""car warrenty dealership"".  looks like i talk about my car too much. ;)"
0M69NG5,male,25,urlLink by far the most beautiful woman i have ever seen
0M69NG5,male,25,now  urlLink this  is sort of fun.
0M69NG5,male,25,"hello! i've been busy! i met a new friend! she's wonderful. sweet, nice, adorably cute, funny, smart, and into vw's! and as you've already guessed, i met her at a vw gtg. only one small, tiny, little problem. supposedly she has a man in tucson that she is head over heels for. or that's what i've been told by someone else who also just met her. i haven't actually brought it up, nor has she mentioned anything about him but that can be for multiple reasons that i don't even want to speculate about. so far we've talked about a ton of stuff, and almost everything we agree on, like, or even thoroughly love, like the rain storm we're having tonight! its great. but i'm biting my tongue. she could totally be a great girlfriend, but also a great friend so i'm playing this one distant and safe. until i feel otherwise, of course. i'm so giddy!"
0M69NG5,male,25,another week is starting. i am just overflowing with joy.    i sure hope something happens this week or i may just kill myself over the boredom.
0M69NG5,male,25,is it no sleep for the weary or no sleep for the wicked? either way i'm still up but feeling tired. i should just go into work now and call it an early day.
0M69NG5,male,25,"so i'm back from los angeles. i'm tired and think bed is the best choice right now. i'll write more about the last 2 days when i get up later, before i leave for colorado."
0M69NG5,male,25,"god damn fucking insomnia!!!   i sleep not, for the second night."
0M69NG5,male,25,"oh my fucking god!  after not seeing Am online all weekend i decided to see if she had blocked my screenname. i created a new screenname for aim and loaded up aim and added her screenname to it. both it and my trillian showed her offline so i set aim to sound off if she signed on. not more than 2 mins later aim went off. sure enough she was online and showing on my new screenname but not on my normal one. she had me blocked. so i picked up my house phone and called her cell knowing that she would be available to answer and remembering that she didn't have my house phone listed in her cell. she answered.  me: Am? Am: hello me: what's going on? Am: right now is not a good time. i've got something i'm having to dealing with. can i talk to you later me: sure. when should i call you back? or when do you want to call me back? Am: its just not a good time right now. someone hit my mom's truck while i was helping Bi and Bo move and now i have to pay for it. me: i'm sorry to hear that. we can talk later. just give me a call back, ok? Am: ok.  wtf?! so i im Bo and ask him what the hell is going on with Am. he doesn't know anything. and he's either distracted by school work like he says or he's conferring with someone else on his responses because it takes him a long time to reply. either way we have this long chat about what i've been seeing and how it seems like everyone is ignoring me. he says he's not, just busy with school and that if Am is why don't i just walk away from it. i tell him that i gave up already on her. i just want to know why she's pissed at me and possibly resolve it. i tell him that if Am is mad at me then wife-Al is most likely also. and since when wife-Al doesn't want someone to come by or hang around they usually don't get invited out then that would mean i would be outstead from future gatherings. he tells me that him and others wouldn't do that, they don't care, but that the wife-Al and household might and that would suck. now i don't know what's going on. i put in a call to my friend Mi that lives with wife-Al and crew and left a message for him to call me back. i haven't heard from him in awhile either but i figure if anyone who lives there would talk to me, it would be him. now i get to just sit around and wait for both Am (probably won't) and Mi to call me back.  god this sucks even worse than i thought!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"small update here. the dealership felt my pain and i ended up only paying $25 for all the service i had done and it looks like they may cover the charge for the rental truck. the tow company charged my card the impound fee anyway even though i didn't sign the slip or authorize the charge so i called it in to dispute it with my bank which means they cancelled my card and issued another one. now i have to wait 5-7 business days before i get a new card in the mail. i started shopping for a new digital camera since its all but hopeless that the police with recover my stolen one. i placed an order for one last night but since the store is closed for passover through today, they won't get to processing my order until tomorrow and since my card has been cancelled and closed that order is going to reject. so now i have to wait until my new card arrives before i can even buy a new camera not to mention the fact that i live off my card and will be s.o.l. for the next week without it. my new department at work has me swamped with shit to do and without my work laptop, i'm scrambling around trying to keep up. everything fucking sucks."
0M69NG5,male,25,"back from my pa trip! i had a blast. everything rocked (except the 7 hour delay on the way there). i spent almost every hour intoxicated, ate whatever i wanted and said/did whatever i thought of. wedding was cool, as were the people i met there. so very glad i went."
0M69NG5,male,25,"i haven't posted in awhile. nothing really extraordinary to post about. things with Su are still super great and i'm sure the day to day babble was getting old so i haven't posted any of it. we are planning a trip to disneyland for the near end of the month but the budget is tight so we may forgo it. i'm spending easter sunday with her family this year. oh, and i almost forgot! her best friend's birthday is friday so i'm going with her to the party/club thing. will be my first time meeting all of her law school friends. honestly, i'm a bit nervous. i'm hoping they like/approve of me. and i'll try and check back here more often."
0M69NG5,male,25,"uugh - i haven't been to bed yet. i'm getting hungry, i'm getting tired, i'm getting ready for work."
0M69NG5,male,25,"fuck!    so i decided to work the rest of the day from home. well i get here and as I go to pull into my parking spot i see one of the stupid golf carts that belong to the maintence ppl have parked in my spot. now by the time i realize that i am not going to be able to fit in the spot with that golf cart there i have already started to pull in. being frustrated that i cannot park in my spot i put the car in reverse intending to back into one of the uncovered spots behind me. i start to move backwards and bam! i hit some guy who was whipping around my half turned car using the empty uncovered spots as the road. the guy is pissed. we're talking tall angry (don't flame me for this) black guy, pissed at me. I move my car forward a bit and get out to see the damage. all i can see on my rear bumper are some scuffs the color of the guys maroon car. his damage is worse. the sheet metal on the forward section of his rear passenger side quarter panel is dented in. its possible that the edge of the rear door is also dented. he's shouting. he yells that i didn't even look, but it doesn't come out with the same authority that the 'damns' and 'shits' and 'fucks' have been. i say i didn't see him. i explain that i couldn't get into my spot since the golf cart was there and I had to back out. at this time the maintence guy comes around the corner. angry guy starts yelling at him for parking his fucking cart in my spot. then angry guy gets back into his car and drives down to his destination a little further down the complex. maintence guy moves his cart. i pull in and get out. angry man comes walking back to look at my damage. he realizes that i was barely affected and gets more mad. then he says something that makes everything better, for me at least. he says he doesn't have insurance and i can't do shit for him. he stomps off. i go inside. without being an insured driver he can't make a claim and since it was on private property he can't call the police to make a report with the idea in mind to file a claim against my insurance. i'm relieved, upset that it all happened, but relieved. now i'm only worried about some kind of 'retaliation' against my poor parked car. fuck."
0M69NG5,male,25,"hmmm...nope, haven't been to sleep yet. why? i've been up all night playing computer games with my neighbor. how geeky is that? anywho, its time for a shower and then breakfast. i've a full day of 1 conference call, 1 trip to fry's electronics, 1 lunch gtg, and an afternoon of nothingness. word."
0M69NG5,male,25,"wow, looks like i missed posting yesterday! i had a crappy day at work, some stuff got all changed around and my work 'world' got turned upside down. but today is a new day and i'm rolling with the punches and moving on.  i took my team out for lunch today to  texas land and cattle  steak house. charged it up on the corporate credit card. :)"
0M69NG5,male,25,"it was a good date. food was good, conversation rocked, lots of eye contact. we called it a night around 10 or so, she had work and school the next day. as far as first dates go, i thought it was perfect. nothing physical, lots of getting to know you talk, and everyone was still smiling at the end of the night. i'm so looking forward to the next, which i plan on asking about next week as we have lots going on this weekend. tonight is a going away party for a buddy of mine who's heading off to london to teach for 10 weeks. Su is coming, after her dad's b'day dinner. i'm going to get to introduce her to a lot more of my vw friends. she's excited, as am i. tomorrow is a vw gtg thing at the f1 race factory indoor cart track. there is also another day of the barrett-jackson classic car auction which Su has just expressed interest in going to. so we may do one or both tomorrow. then after a somewhat early evening, we're going snowboarding again on sunday! i'm really excited now because i'll get to hit the full mountain more confident this time. it also means that i'll be able to board with Su. its looking to be a very good weekend, again. yay me!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"ah...so i made it back home safe and sound. my flight was actually in early on sunday which was surprising since the weekend after thanksgiving is suppose to be one of the busiest for travel. the airport here was packed with people flying out, but almost empty of people arriving. that made getting my checked baggage pretty easy, especially nice since i was heavy one extra bag from when i first left. why did i have a whole other bag for my return trip? well, i didn't stop shopping is why. i dropped another $200 on clothes and $100 on dvds and cds. i don't know what came over me. if you add it all up and include the $100+ i spent on my sister for her birthday, i went through $700! my mom asked that i stop buying things or there won't be anything left for her to get me for christmas. i'm sure i could think of some last minute things!  first day back at work today too. had to drive the notch there since the people who built my exhaust needed to 'borrow' it while i was out of town and then they weren't able to get it back to me until tonight. the car held up to the now longer drive to and from the new office fine, but she's not the happiest of cars. i really need to rap up the jetta and get to wrenching on the notch.  and here's a bit of bitching. the people who live in the townhome above me have been fucking loud as hell non-stop since i got home. tonight they've been stomping around and i've heard yelling and crying. its really starting to piss me off. i have to go into the leasing office tomorrow and i will be mentioning it to them. it'll be the third time i've had to complain about it. is it so fucking hard to walk softly? have some goddamn courtesy for your neighbors, sheesh."
0M69NG5,male,25,"the weekend was nice. went to a bbq sunday, had a good time even though Am couldn't make it (spent the day/evening with folks for father's day). nothing new to talk about right this second 'cept for recieving an instant message from Am last night telling me she's not going to be friends with that annoying guy that i was talking about the other day anymore.  still waiting to here what that's all about.   ok so i found out. i guess he was just being more bitchy and she's tired of it and over it. bummer for him. one less annoying person to deal with though its too bad he couldn't get control of himself. it sucks when no one wants to hang out with you and you piss off the last person that could stand you."
0M69NG5,male,25,another movie that is always at the top of this list -  the saint . watched that tonight. good shit.
0M69NG5,male,25,uugh...insomnia. i'm too worn out to be dealing with this right now.  bright side is that i rebuilt my computer.  it had been acting strange for a few weeks.  fit as a fiddle now.
0M69NG5,male,25,"i'm afraid that the guy who made the offer on the mustang is going to back out. he couldn't 'get it together' today and asked to make the deal tomorrow. i'm a bit aggravated with him after the myriad of phone calls i received from him today. i even drove to the other side of town to get the title out of my safebox (which i would have to do anyway, but i did it in the middle of the work day because he was going to be giving me the cash this afternoon). ugh. i hope this goes through - i need to get this sold."
0M69NG5,male,25,"i think my last post was a little tmi. sorry.  btw, i haven't gone to sleep yet. dunno why. i have to be at the dyno in 2 hours and i still haven't washed my car for the bbq afterwards. i'm such a slacker/insomniac. you'd think not sleeping much would allow me to get a lot done. nope. i did take the time to shave my head again. and after spending an hour or so with a shaved head and beard, i decided to shave the face too. its comfortable.  here's something i just noticed. as i ran out of things to look at on the internet, i started looking through my blog and noticed i had a  urlLink comment  that i over looked. apparently An has noticed the link to this site on the old site. i thought that might happen when i put that up, but i took the chance in hopes of getting more readers/hits. i don't know how i feel about her reading this again. i don't know if i would have reworded some of my posts had i known she was reading. but i do know that i'm not going back and changing anything. not my posts nor the link or location of this site. i'm just going to deal with it and see what happens."
0M69NG5,male,25,"so i got invited to a suns game tonight. box seats. basketball isn't really my favorite sport, but it isn't the most hated either. actually, i don't really enjoy watching sports that much, except for the occasional hockey game, though i know nothing about it. its been a long time since i've seen the suns play. i stopped watching back when they blew the playoffs during thier 25th anniversery year. do i even know who is on the team?"
0M69NG5,male,25,"**previously i had some whiny stuff here but have since come to my senses and removed it**  on another note, i'm off to a vw gathering and some diner followed by some drinking and passing out.  have a great night!"
0M69NG5,male,25,i've wasted the whole day.
0M69NG5,male,25,"its finally raining here!! this is suppose to be the monsoon season but i haven't seen a drop of rain until tonight. i've heard that it has been raining all over the valley, just not up here on the mountain. it is so awesome. i love the rain!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"you know what the worst part about doing laundry is? folding socks. man i hate it. matching, pairing, folding into one another. grrr.   and yes, i'm still up. who needs sleep?"
0M69NG5,male,25,"so i've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off all week preparing for the fam's arrival on monday. at the same time i've been missing Su terribly regardless that we've been txting each other constantly since she's been gone. the good news? she's on her way back right now, only a few hours away i would guess. they decided to come back a day early so i'm just the happiest boy in town right now. on top of that, my new bed arrived today, which i purchased monday. tonight's one of those rare occasions that i'm excited to get to bed. should be pretty easy to sleep too as i've been doing nothing but cleaning since i got home and i'm a bit tired already.  and some news from earlier this week, i hung out with An for the first time in what seems like forever. met her and a couple of her friends at the st. patrick's day barenaked ladies concert in tempe wednesday night as she is in town for her brother's wedding tomorrow. honestly, i was a bit nervous seeing her again due to the length of time past and the outing we had mid last year. but that all faded away after the first hellos. ended up being a good night and we seemed able to just hang out and be at ease with each other. i'm happy about that. of course, now that i'm all for hanging out with her again she announces that she's moving to hawaii after she graduates in a few weeks. but she has a solution for that. Su and i are invited to come stay and visit whenever we'd like. free room on the island? i'm there!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"yup, still here. still awake. still bored out of my fucking mind."
0M69NG5,male,25,"still up, craving breakfast now. chatted with Am for almost forever last night. good times. i think she might actually like me, that way. dunno, don't want to speak too soon. keeping fingers crossed."
0M69NG5,male,25,"did i mention i love the rain?  i think i'm going to go home, open up the windows, curl up on the couch and watch some movies. any of you lovely ladies want to join me?"
0M69NG5,male,25,"why do all the girls i like have 'boy' baggage? seattle friend, 'boy' baggage. new friend, 'boy' baggage. friend from the summer, 'boy' baggage. arrgh!  on an upbeat note, looks like my new suspension is being delievered today so if i can get it installed this afternoon my drive up north will be super smooth!"
0M69NG5,male,25,i'm in a suedo good mood at the moment. the kind of mood you're in after you take a shower and put on new clothes for the first time and have a general feeling about yourself that you could take on the world. you dig?
0M69NG5,male,25,"i'm in the middle of buying this car:  here  &  urlLink here . the car is located in portland and so far i am planning a road trip up to get it, maybe as early as next weekend. i'm so fucking excited!  for those that don't know, its a 1964 volkswagen notchback imported from europe."
0M69NG5,male,25,"urlLink classmates.com , a for-profit who's who/where website, is about to get my money.  my  urlLink friend and fellow blogger  posted today about this site and about receiving an email from an old boyfriend. sensing that i may too have old flames/friends wishing to contact me, i logged into the site and checked. low and behold i have messages waiting!  a couple ppl i had almost forgotten about, 3 ppl i tried to forget about and 1 person who i haven't talked to in about a year.  on top of that, listed in one of my previous schools, is my best bud who my friends at the time and myself thought had gone missing over these past years. excited to see his name on the list i click the 'email me' link to send him a 'hi how are ya/where ya been' and i'm confronted with a pay or die page! i understand they need to make money somehow, but i remember when this site was free!  and at $36, its a little steep just to get the email address of an old friend. but as i sit here and think about it i'm starting to cave in. would be nice to hear how the old guy is doing..."
0M69NG5,male,25,"i think i'm finished with my shopping. didn't take me too long. i made a list, checked it twice. now i only have to wrap them."
0M69NG5,male,25,my heat broke last night.  i had to go out and get firewood to keep from getting frost bite. ;)  maintence guy let himself in at 8:30 this morning much to my surprise as i was sleeping.  nothing like the rush of hearing a stranger's voice in your own house when you know there shouldn't be anyone there with you.  heats back on now.  i went and did a quick consulting job today.  easy money for 3 hours work.  i also met up with my vw friends for lunch at tgi friday's.  now i'm waiting to drive out to that shop i was talking about the other day cuz my turbo kit is in!! yay!
0M69NG5,male,25,mustang is sold - i signed over the title for cash today. whew.
0M69NG5,male,25,"everything has been going pretty good lately.  'cept grandma died.  folks are in town now, will be spending the week with all the family and what not."
0M69NG5,male,25,"lets see, what did I do tuesday after my last blog entry. hmm, well i left work to go see  underworld  (great movie) and then went home about an hour after returning to the office. wednesday i woke up early for some odd reason so i went into work had some pizza around 11a and then took off for the rest of the day.  and now today. today i am working from home. well, i was this morning, up until 11 when i decided i had errands to run and then was a good time to do so. so i hit the bank to order some foreign currency (euros to be exact as i need them to buy some info on my notchback from the museum in wolfsberg, germany), stopped at the gas station for a fill up, and then cruised on over to the fry's electronics store in search of a couple specific model hard drives for my server here at home. that was unsuccessful, but since i had arrived to spend some money i stayed and browsed the store. at first i was shopping in the phone isle for a sleek, silver or dark gray speaker phone for my home office. i didn't see anything i liked. next i wandered over to the home theater department where i came so very close (as i always do) to buying a sony 60"" grand wega and a new sony dream machine home theater speaker package. then i found myself in the dvd isles (which makes sense since i already had home theater on my mind) were i proceeded to browse and purchase the following dvds, in no particular order: the fifth element, ferris bueller's day off, fast times at ridgemont high, love stinks, the princess bride, weird science, dead man on campus, and animal house. with my spending urge now taken care of i realized i was hungry so i swung through the carl's jr driveup and ordered a western bacon cheeseburger, crisscut fries, a coke and a small chocolate milkshake. now i'm home, finished with lunch and preparing to 'de-plasticwrap' my new dvds.  working from home is tiring."
0M69NG5,male,25,"i went to blog last night and blogger was down and now, for the life of me, i can't remember what i was going to post about.  i picked out my halloween costume for tomorrow night's party. i'm going as wt. that's white trash for those not in the know. i have a auto mechanics jump suit, wife beater tee, mullet wig, false beer belly, and i'm wearing a trucker style hat. i also haven't shaved in a couple days so i'll be nice and scruffy. it'll be classic."
0M69NG5,male,25,"no sleep for the wicked. or is that no sleep for the weary? either way, i never made it to bed and i'm about 15 minutes from leaving for the airport. at least i'll be able to sleep on the planes. 6 hours total flight time today. i'll be back monday night, catch you then."
0M69NG5,male,25,"fucking girls     nm, just forget it - not worth my time."
0M69NG5,male,25,"just got back from seeing the new movie  malibu's most wanted . wait for it to go to rental, that's all i'll say.  i was checking my sitestats referral listings and i had a few interesting search engine referrals. here they are in order from the other day to last week:  ""golf cart maintence"" ""andi blogspot"" ""'golf-cart' mistakes""  wtf is with the golf hits?!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"last night went well. sometime during yesterday afternoon i invited Am over for dinner and a movie and she agreed. i made us chicken over rice which is cut up boneless skinless chicken breast in condensed cream of chicken poured over top of steamed rice. it came out well and she liked it. we watched old school, which she hadn't seen yet and she thought it was pretty funny. afterwards we drove over to where my new townhouse is and played with her new remote controlled red mini cooper that i picked up for her while i was at the store and my old remote controlled truck in the basketball courts. she really liked the mini. once the batteries started to die we decided to head on over to wife-Al and company's house as the rest of our friends were over there after getting back from mini-golfing (neither of us were interested in doing that). we hung out there until about 2 am or so and then headed back to my place where we watched the first couple episodes of clone high (she had yet to see any of them). after that it was almost 4 am so we went to sleep. we got up a little after noon and she wanted to watch a couple more clone high episodes before she had to get home to feed her birds. so now she's gone and i don't think i'll be seeing her tonight as her and wife-Al and their other girlfriends are doing a girl's night out which i think is cool. tonight is a gtg/cruise of vw's starting at 7:30 which will probably end up being a party at someone's house in the end (not mine!). Tomorrow, besides being father's day, is a bbq at some friends' house which should be a good time. i'm hoping that this weekend continues to be a good one. it always makes monday more bearable."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"tHe MoSt ...    Suddenly got this impulse to record down the most significant incidents in every phrase of my life, from kindergarten (if I can still recall... which I doubt) till now. So here I am, tryin' franticalli to fill in to the best of my ability. Hope it won't turn out too borin'... HahahaX!   Kindergarten (Hope I got the spellin' rite, 'coz it's been almost 2 decades since I last attended.. Keke!)    Most memorable:  Muz haf been the time when we went on an excursion to the Singapore Zoological Garden. Then in the midst of the animal show, Johnny (I tink, wifout much confidence.. H33!) tripped & fell down a flight of stairs. Luckily he din sustain any serious injury except for a bad shock... n the rest of us mocked @ his acrobatic feat... so mean!! BwahahahaX!   Sweetest moment:  Can't tink of any... dun wanna damage all my brain cells for tinkin' too much. Keke!    Most bitter:  Probably the time when I couldn't finish my drawin' before the art lesson ended. (Dun be surprised!! I attended art classes when I was young!!) I cried so bitterly tt the art teacher promised to gimmi 3 stars juz to pacify mi. Of coz, i shut myself up lahz... 3 stars lehz!! HahahaX! Anyway, it was a potrait of cats, if my memory serves mi rite.   Primary skol    Most memorable:  Going to a junior class to get to know one of the gers call HuiNi. I alwayz ask JiaRui (Who was my best friend then) along 'coz I was too shy! H33! The relationship did not blossom for obvious reasons. But could realli c tt she liked mi alot!! Kekeke! ('coz I can say watever I want now!! H33!)   Sweetest moment:  There was this pair of sisters & the younger one was from my class. Well, I used to like her, n my brother liked the elder sister (juz my own deductions.. H33!) So the 4 of us used to play in the playground juz below where I used to lived. tt was so sweet!! Anyway, I haf alr lost contact wif them... n the playground is no longer in existence. Realli hope to c them again, after such a long time... H33! Yah... the elder one is call Weijun while my ""beau"" is call Weijia. ;)   Most bitter:  If realli haf to squeeze sumtin out, i guess.... erhmm... tink should be the day we received our PSLE results bahz. 'Coz was quite sentimental towardz my mother skol n we were leavin' skol soon.. *SoB* Realli hated to part wif my ex-classmates esp. Jialong, Zikai, Yingyan, Yinghao...  but, managed to get over it pretty soon... *Oops!!* lolX!   Secondary skol    Most memorable:  The most memorable phrase of my life wif lotsa thingz tt i can't seem to forget no matter how hard I try despite my poor memory... HahahaX! If onli can choose one incident... Mabbe it's winnin' the SPH 4 X 800m relay. 'Coz the rest of our relay teamz were completely wiped out n there was intense pressure for my team to win. Can say tt it was one of the most emotional competition of my life, involvin' both tears & perspiration. Could nv forget the exhilaration upon winnin' the race... n I meant 1st runner-up... H33! Thanx KB, guang & LingChe!! *MuaCk!!*   Sweetest moment:  The nite when I gave my precious 1st kiss away! H33! It was on the 30th May 1996 (aH WiNg'S b'DaY!!), along the causeway linkin' the then World Trade Centre & Sentosa, facin' the sea. All was calm & serene... the ambience was rite... I could feel the gentle sea breeze caressin' my face... then I fell into a moment of sweetness. Could never forget the kiss... not ever in my life.   Most bitter:  The day when we received our 'O' Levels results. Not 'Coz of gg on separate paths (We knew tt we would be palz 4ever then... WoaH!!), but 'coz of results. Mine's still ok, but KB & TY failed their English. Esp. for TY, he broke down in tears... & I fcuked a junior off for being overly inquisitive. I could realli feel their disappointment n I was in a foul mood as well. In the end, the 3 of us (can't remember if Kenneth was ard) went to Pandan reservoir (our fav haunt when we're depressed) to vent our frustration. Sad day. =(    Junior College    Most memorable:  Most memorable times are the times spent wif my ""Xian Ren Zhang"" clique, namely, Jiajia, Jiayuan & Vicky. Not tt I'm a buaya, but was on better terms wif them mahz. Anyway, dun tink we can be as good as we were now. So depressin'. *HaiX*   Sweetest moment:  Dun tink I haf any... Mabbe the amount of affection Miss Yeo showered mi durin' her Maths tutorial?? *YuCKs!!* =S   Most bitter:  I broke up wif my gerfriend of 11 months. Was terribly upset then n there was this period of time when I brought a teddy bear tt she gave mi to skol everyday (for companionship *SoB*). I was deeply traumatized by the incident n took 3 long yrs to get over the ""phobia"" of relationship. Did lotsa stupid thingz like waited outside her house for 2 full nites... witnessin' the construction of a road, from start till completion while waitin' for her... H33! But she nv did come out to mit mi... n tt was realli the end of this relationship. *WeeP WeeP* But hey!! We r still beri gd frenz now! Thank God!    Army    Most memorable:  Suffered from foot rot & was given att 'C' for 7 dayz!! Durin' tt period of time, there was an angel constantly by my side, takin' real gd care of mi!! She's such a carin' angel!! No wonder I was in love wif her!   Sweetest moment:  Definitely has to be this angel who bought mi a Braun Buffel wallet (which I lost less than a yr later... Keke!) on 09.09.1999. She was realli damned thotful & I was guilty to the extreme for not buyin' her anytin on this once-in-a-lifetime day. 'coz tt day signified 常常久久. *HaiX* No wonder our relationship was so short-lived... *Keke* Anyway, realli appreciate wat she's done for mi... *MuaCk MuaCk* ^-^   Most bitter:  Wat could be more bitter than losin' an angel? Dun haf to elaborate any further rite?   Uni Life    Most memorable:  I spent the most memorable part of my uni life in LT18 wif another angel whom I juz adored so much! We were both preparin' for examination n would mit up everyday in LT18 to study. It was also there tt she accepted my love for her... though not as romatically as I've originalli planned... all thanx to WK (Dun bother to find out who... H33!) She was a priceless gem in my heart then... n I could realli feel myself engulfed by intense love. So 幸福 then!!   Sweetest moment:  I was hafin' a realli bad cough n she was there by my side thru'out the nite, rubbin' my chest in order for mi to feel better . I was touched. Come to tink of it, she's realli one of the sweetest ger in my life, but too bad... Keke!    Most bitter:  I betrayed friendship for an undesired love. I was a bastard n I would nv forgive myself for tt. Wat's done cannot be undone. Hopefulli time will heal all woundz.  Well, tt's abt all! Dun look as if I haf a fulfillin' life, does it? lolX! Anyway, interestin' or not, u'll be the judge. I'm juz bein' too eng n decided to do sumtin more meaningful... GeeZ!! n i call this meaningful... Keke!!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"UoB iNteRVieW... ScReWeD!!~!   *HaiX* Dun tink I stand a chance after I went for the UOB interview. It wasn't realli a tough one, but then sumhow, I din manage as well as I've anticipated. It was carried out on a group discussion format and the rest of the pple performed quite well. All, wif the exception of mi, probably.. *HaiX* Mabbe I wasn't so articulative afterall... or mabbe I could onli crap... For thingz like current affairs which require sum degree of thoughts, I usualli screw up. Damn.. there goes my chance! Not in the least hopeful that I could be short-listed for the next round of interview. =(  Then accompanied Ken (he attended another interview by sum swiss bank... keep forgettin' its name though... Hehe!)to Funan to mit his Jolene for lunch. I excused myself to go to coffee bean instead in order to avoid unneccessary inconvenience (for watever reasons). Anyway, Simin went to International Plaza n joined mi in Coffee Bean shortly after. After their lunch, the 3 of us left for Cineleisure for sum pool actions while Jolene got back to work. *HaiX* Was feelin' quite lethargic today, so anytin goes lahz. Moreover din wanna go home so early, might as well join them. But realli could not stand the tiredness. I had difficulty even keepin' my eyes open. Tink it muz haf been the effect of overdosage of kopi on an empty stomach. The caffine juz erodes into ur brain and corrodes all the functionin' cells. Keke!! From my experience, there might be sum truth to it. Hee!!  Hafn't had lunch the whole day... feelin' 'xtremely sleepy + hungry now. Ever heard of the sayin' ""a lean and hungry man is a dangerous man""? So better not agitate mi now, otherwise I could realli bite!!! Then guoliang of all time arranged a supper session 2nite, therefore dun tink I would be able to get enulf rest. It's alr 7plus now. Guess if I realli mentally cannot tahan, will haf to call off the whole thing. *HaiX* Pai seh lahz.... let u all down again. Mabbe can invite mi out on my b'day (which is soon!!) and gimmi a treat.

Sumbody pls kill mi to end my misery!!! WAIT! I dun realli mean wat I say when I say ""Kill"", juz an expression to show how serious the situation is. The point now is, I know tt I haf had the easiest share of the pie, but all my arguements are so repetitive!!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"sCReWeD DaY   Been quite a screwed up day. Last nite slept late prior to the interview this mornin' 'coz I went to Wet & Whistle again. Left pretty late due to sum unforseen circumstances, so took a cab home in order to prepare for my interview today. Anyway, din prepare much 'xcept for the attire tt I was gg to wear. DaMN!!! Was supposed to sign the contract wif CitiBank ytd, but I had to work in Robinson's since Cindy applied for compassionate leave (her mum-in-law passed away). BoBian lohz, had to replace her. *HaiX* Sumtimes har, realli tink SnowDown is a jinx lehz... alwayz hinderin' my progress.

HuMpH!!!  Could haf been employed now instead of waitin' for the results... aRgHHHhh!!!  Not onli tt, if I dun haf to help out, I could haf gone for a hair-cut instead of invitin' condemnation (Gentle reminder on the surface) by the inviewer (dunno his name lahz... can't be bothered by his pig face!!). Wanted mi to go for interview, but nv kept to timin' n still postponed the timin' to 1130am when it was arranged to be @ 930am. Made mi wake up so damn bloody early and drank double shot cuppaccino for nth!! Fuck him!!!~!~!   Sibei dulan by his remark, so immediately went for a haircut. Told Nicholas to style a more versatile design so tt I dun haf to keep a nutty hairstyle when I go out on weekendz. Lookz quite ok (@ least to mi.. Hee!!) but dun tink can attract as many xiao mei mei alr... Erhmmm... or should I say, in the 1st place  I alr cannot attract any gerz *SoB*; now wif my new hairstyle, mabbe I may even turn them off to the extent tt they refrain from guyz for a few dayz...

GGCUFSP,male,24,"SaTuRDaY NiTe FeVeR   Not tt I partied last nite, but rather, did lotsa unexpected stuff. We had originally planned to watch soccer match b/w Man United & Liverpool @ Cafe Cartel in MS, but later decided to change the venue to PS instead, in order to facilitate our dear Mr. Kenneth Lee (he's gg Orchard, u c?) Anyway, we settled down in Piazza (a cafe b/w Atrium & PS). HahahaX. Was supposed to queue up @ the entrance to wait to be served, but aH WiNg unknowingly went to occupy a vacant seat and asked for the menu!! Keke! The waitress was oso quite confused then... but wat could she do?? H33!! Blur mi!!! Then was feelin' pai seh durin' my stay there but who cares?? We've got the seat!! tt's all it matters.. BwahahahaX!   In the end, Liverpool won 1-0. Needless to say, Ken looked quite disgusted wif the score-line; the same could not be said abt Kenneth. H33! He's an Arsenal fan, tt's y... Keke! Anyway, guess most of the pple dinin' there were Liverpool fans (or anti-devil. Watever.) They would groaned whenever the devils had a goal-scorin' opportunity n cheered whenever Liverpool delivered a goal-threatenin' cross. The moz obvious was when the latter scored their first & onli goal of the match. The crowd was utterly exhilarated and sum even applauded. Din know tt there's so many Liverpool fan nowadays, or shld I say anti-devils? Keke! Haf alwayz thot tt bein' a Man U fan is a norm... but it definitely din look like the case then. Ken was an 'xception perhaps?? Or mabbe the rest of their supporters were bein' suppressed by the majority... lolX!  After the match, we were @ a loss as to wat to do next. I suggested gg for a movie, but we couldn't reach a consesus wat movie to watch. I wanted to watch ""Into the Mirror"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"" (Kenneth onli wanted the latter onli), but KB & Huiyng(?) preferred sth ""Boxer"" (Can't rem lahz... it's a Thai show.. Nahz... no interest either). Therefore, we ruled out watchin' movie. Then Huiying suggested gg East Coast Park out of the blue.... n sumhow, there was no violent objection abt her proposal. Damn farnie... H33! Reached there alr oso nth to do 'xept sittin' down, tokin' cock, but realized there wasn't realli much cock tt we can exploit... HaiX! Once again, Huiying came up wif an absolutely brilliant idea (n dun take my word for it.. -.-) We left East Coast Park in less than 15min n proceeded to CHANGI VILLAGE!!! OMG!! I haf no idea y we went there but accordin' to a reliable source (Jolin.. Keke!), they wanted to c the aH gua's there. Aiyah, wat's the big deal abt ah gua?? Watever they haf, we oso haf... mabbe they're bigger onli lohz. On the other hand, watever they used to haf, we haf it now, so it makes more sense for them to look for us instead mahz... H33!! Another one of those WiNg'S nonsensical theories. I'm more interested in the Nasi Lemak instead... Hehe! But, to my disappointment, they were all sold out, n Huiying got the LAST PLATE!!! Damit! Wat frustrated mi even more was tt she din finish it... Wah lau, wat a waste!!! #@$@#!@$ She will get her retribution... bWaHaHaX! Eventualli, the rest of us onli drank n watched her eat. *sNiFF sNiFF* :'-(  Followin' tt, tink it was alr abt 2.30am bahz. Huiying drove Ken & Jolin back, n KB no choice had to drive Kenneth n I home. Was feelin' abit hungry, so decided to stop over @ Clementi Teck Hin Kopi Thiam for supper. Kinda feel sorry for KB 'coz he picked mi up from JW, drove to Orchard, East Coast, Changi, Clementi then gotta send us back home 1st b4 gg back to Woodlandz. Muz haf been damn tirin' on his part... *HaiX* If onli I haf a car. At least can share his burden. Hopefulli, sumone can buy mi a car soon. Mabbe my wish can be fulfilled this bday... beri hard to say wor... H33!!!  Nth interestin' happened 2day. Had planned to maintain a healthy lifestyle by hafin a soccer game, but RQ played us out. We went to the soccer court alr, but he called mi to inform tt Luchang, JianYang & he din feel like playin'. Oh well, so be it. In any case, tink I'm gg for a run later. Go sweat it out!!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"BUTTERFLY EFFECT   Oh my gosh, it's already March n I hafn't done even any single bit of preparation for my projectz. Now the deadlines are drawin' now! The best bit is instead of doing research for my damned IFM (International Fcukin' Module) n R&I (Ridiculous & Idiotic), I'm actually spendin' my time writin' this blog!! This guy (Read: mi!!) really has got no sense of urgency. Dunno whether he realises one small thing he does now can trigger a hella consequences. Speakin' of which, I muz say this show (n i meant ""tHe butteRfLy eFFeCt"", duhz!) was terrific! Could easily be my favourite movie of the year!! Great plot, superb cast (Ashton Kutcher + Amy Smart). Shan't further elaborate on the story though. Can juz abstract from any movie review webby.   Been rather slacked all this while. Spent most of my valuable (or izzit?) time online, downloadin' movies, updatin' friendster, check mails, log in icq, log out icq, log in again, look (n literally lookin' only) for online job application. Haix... Really pathetic life sia. BTW, happened to come across this girl, HuiShi, when I sent Guang to the airport. Really coincidental tt I bumped into her, coz nv did expect her to become an air stewardess (but how the hell I know, coz I haf nv spoken to her). Another more interestin' thing is tt the gal who went wif her was from Saints too! N she knows mi! (Though I din know her, but got to know tt she's Janice). Anyway, found her familiar then, but din dare to approach, coz scared later I malu myself (again??). Then dunno how she managed to find mi in friendster! I was so stunned when she messaged mi. It's like, it has nv come across my mind tt I would make an effort to find sumone, esp. when I haf nv spoken to tt person b4, though we used to be in the same pri. skol.   I began to realise one thing. If I haf made the initiative to know her when I was in pri. skol, wat might haf happened. The ""mystery"" tt puzzled the both of us is tt though we did not know each other personally, we still remember each other's name! (well, sorta. Except I got HuiShi n ShiHui jumbled up. She's even worse, onli remember I'm sum ""Yi""). But still ok lahz, at least we still recognise each other. If given sum other person from her class, I might not recognise him. Mabbe I was sub-consciously ""payin' more attention"" to her in pri. skol bahz. ttz the expaination I found so far. kekeke!  Okay, now to the point. This event set me ponderin'. If I haf the ability to travel back in time (juz like Ashton in the movie), wat aspect of life would I change? A. Get to know HuiShi? (which is pretty dumb coz of the vomit blood after-effect thingy); B. Do sth abt. my 'O'/'A' Levels? (then I can become a scholar, which I sacastically doubt); C. Hold back all the hurtful abuses tt I inflicted on a few individuals? (n I know there's quite a handful of them); D. Remain as it is? (it's onli a fictitious scenerio anyway... yah, i know, i'm a loser here); or E. Sum of the above/ Others? (n this option will look beri familiar to FM students. If u get wat i mean). My instinct would tell mi C. A rationale choice would haf to be D. If I'm dumb/crazy/stupid/lame etc, I would choose A. Lolx!  Being risk-averse (n I'm referin' to the typical kiasee type), D is my final decision (sorta expected). Dun wanna change anything, at least for now. Whoever I fail to know in the past, I will get to know them along the way. Thus, no use clingin' on to sumthing (be it anyone e.g. teddy bear on the shelf of Robinson's toy department or anything else) tt u yearned for so much (not referin' to anything/ anyone in particular. Any coincidences caused is deeply regretted) but not being able to get hold of it. I'm a strong believer of fate. Whatever belongz to u will be urs eventually; the more u hold on to it, the more it will slip away. I may not be a scholar, but at least I acheived the goal I made in sec. skol --- NUS Bizad. Here I m.... n the irony is, I din realli work towards this goal. Fate.   Comin' so far, I haf to confess tt I haf hurt sum pple. I do not dare ask them for forgiveness, much less to forget abt. wat has happened. Wat I want is to know the truth... coz I realli dunno wat was it I said tt inflicted such a ""catastrophic"" impact. I dun regret hafin said those thingz. An attempt to return to the past would be fruitless, coz I won't say it only once. Juz live wif it bahz. Juz like my philosophy in life: Live as the day passes. Everybody yearns for a perfect endin', but there isn't any perfect endin', is there? u can't please everyone, so f*ck it! Sumtimes, it pays to be selfish. A pity, I'm not. I compromise on the perfection. I'm not even close. Unattainable. Untouchable. Unlikely. Unimaginable.  I dun wanna go back in time. I scared of livin' life once more. I'm resistance to changes. I'm juz a traditional, old-fashion hermit livin' in a world of my own. Moreover, I found my life here. This dimension is where I met my best pals. Dun wanna lose them for anything. We haf come a long way n I really treasure this bond.  thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'......."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"tHe eYe... KtV   Watched The Eye 2 last nite wif Yanling. Actualli, I din expect the movie to be such a flop. The plot was far from average, the cast sux (n I'm referrin' to Hsu Qi), the frightenin' scenes were ... erhmmm... hilarious??). Anyway, din realli enjoy the movie n for a moment, I even forgot that I've juz watched this movie.. H33!  After movie, I went to join RQ n Luchang for a KTV session, together wif PS, ah Lian n Sisi. Sang till ard 3am. But Luchang n the rest left earlier coz they haf other committments (work n skol) the followin' mornin'. Subsequently, RQ sent mi home. Damned tired... fell asleep as soon as I touched down for my bed.  I woke up @ 2.30pm juz now. Still feelin' abit lethargic. I tink this is one of the syptoms of gettin' old? kekeke!  Watched TV, went for lunch, then finalli got my butt down to stay online. Dunno y I couldn't log on MSN but in any case, tt'z not crucial.  I went to check if TY has accepted the testimonial on Friendster tt i wrote him. It turned out to my dismay. Sighz... I dun tink we can realli go back to the good old dayz. Moreover, our character has nv been similar, 'xcept for the bit that we like to tok. In fact, our personalities r far from close. Different expectation of life, different attitude towardz life etc. I tried alr, mabbe not hard enuff... but I tink tt could suffice, juz to make myself more at ease n less self-reproachin'.  Then, I haf been tinkin' if I should drop Kiki a testimonial as well. Habn't been in contact for such a looo...ong time. Dunno how she is now. Not tt I still can't get over her. It's tt I alr gave my promise to her late-mum tt I will take care of her. I know I've failed miserably. Now, I'm still guilty for not being able to fulfill my promise. Of coz I can still take care of Kiki, like an elder brother does onto his younger sis. However, She gave mi no chance @ all. She juz shut mi out!! NEVERMIND! As if I'm interested to interfere wif her ""interesting"" life!! I dun give a damn. Now, wat I can do @ the veri least is to make sure tt her younger bro, JX, is copin' fine. He's quite close wif mi, so I can find out thingz from him as well as keep an eye on him.   Dunno wat else to do now. 2mr got a kanji quiz, then after I finish my kanji assignment, there will be nth left to do. Or rather, there would be nth I feel like doing, e.g. IFM & R&I projects. Tink of these 2 I feel sianz. Anyway, watever has to come, will come. C how it goes bahz. Mabbe thingz aren't as bad as it seems. It could be worse!! Hahahax! Guess I will be online for the whole day... though sad to say, HS will be away from town for a holiday in Phuket for the next 3 dayz. tt meanz she won't be online. *SiaNz* It'z been such a pleasant experience tokin' to her.... n even ting, 'coz they r @ least willin' to accompany an eng man to waste his life away...

Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart; but, if it doesn't, be content that it grew in yours.                                                                                                                                                 Maybe... happiness waits for all those who cry, all those who hurt, all those who have searched, and all those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of all the people who have touched their lives.                                                                              Maybe... you shouldn't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.                                                                                                                       Maybe... you should hope for enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, and enough hope to make you happy.                                                                                                                                And the last maybe..... when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.  Maybe...you should try to live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.                                                            _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Maybe there is a God up above....who may understand, and be merciful."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"WiNg   I haf no idea why I prefer ""WiNg"" over ""WiNd"". I remember when I was in JC, Yetty used to say I'm like the wind, alwayz on the move & nv seem to be able to stay put in one place. I guess tt's my personality. I dun like settlin' down. In other words, I love freedom. esp now, I do not wanna be tied down by commitments of any kind @ all!! Forgive mi if I've neglected anyone of u in any way. I can't even commit myself to the one & onli God, wat do u tink? Hee! Admit once again tt I'm a sinner.  But I nv like the nick ""WiNd"". Can't realli explain myself. Perhaps it's 'coz wind comes and goes wifout leavin' an impression (unless it's tornado or typhoon... Hee!!). I love attention. This might be the reason y I like to act silly or make a fool of myself. I would alwayz be the source of energy for my peers and loved ones. I dun like seein' anyone dear to mi gettin' hurt or sad 'coz I love myself more than anyone else. 'coz I know tt if they feel down & out, I will feel worse. I would rather give them wingz. Wingz to fly. Wingz to tide them over the troubled time. Wingz to help them overcome their difficulties. End of the day, all I want in return is juz regconization. Mabbe juz a frenly gesture to show tt I'm appreciated. tt would suffice. Realli.  In the proccess of growin' up, I've received a number of ""wingz"" from lotsa pple. I'm realli thankful for tt. One person I realli appreciate is Mel. I wanna thank her for being my first love, for all the beautiful memories tt we created together and for initiatin' the painful break-up tt made mi realised the importance of cherishin' watever I haf now. I've learnt to be more appreciative of thingz and be grateful to each & every moment in life. I've leant tt sumtimes to love is to let go of this love. More importantly, I've leant how to move on. Even when sumtimes I'm flyin' wifout wingz, I can rest assured tt I can still take off. I may not haf wingz, but I'm WiNg. My mission is become wingz for pple. @ the same time we soar 2gether. Isn't tt more wonderful than flyin' alone?  Durin' my selection camp earlier on last month, we were asked to write a letter to our loved ones. I wrote one letter for my mum, which is kinda expected. I've wanted to write one for Kiki, but decided to vanish the thot 'coz wat I haf for her is no longer love; juz guilt perhaps? Eventualli, I wrote sumtin for Mel and it goes exactly like this:   ""Dear Mel,  Nothing impt. Juz tt I'm attendin' my propective company's selection camp and we are required to write a letter to our loved ones and the third person tt comes to my mind is YOU!!! So honoured rite? & please forgive mi for my handwritin' k? 'Coz I've written 3 full pages to my parents b4 I'm attemptin' this one. Bear wif it k??  Hmm... How do I start? Erhmm... Juz wanna thank you for being my first love. I still love u.. n u know I dun mean those BGR kinda love. I love u for all the sweet memories tt we shared. I love u for all the thingz tt I've leant durin' our relationship. I love u for bein' so kind & understandin' whenever I'm down & out. I love u for makin' mi realise the importance of other aspects of life. Thanx!!! Btw, dun get mi wrong hor!! I'm not tryin' to relight our flame. Juz tt, I realli (to power of infinity) appreciate u as a friend... my soul-mate. REALLI!! n u r realli so dear to mi in my heart.  U know sumtin'?? In this world, there is no one who understands mi as well as u do. U can realli read mi like a book. Then everytime when I'm depressed, the very first person I would tink of is u. So u can safely assume tt so far everytin's cool on my side!! ('Coz I hafn't been creatin' any trouble for u!!) Hee!! Gettin' hard to find soul-mates nowadays, but thank God I've found u!! Thank you Mel!!  Know tt u r leadin' a hectic life now, so I seldom disturb u unlike possibly RQ. Keke!! But HEY!! When u're free, can juz jio mi out for kopi or sumtin'. Yah??  Words can't explain how grateful I m towards ur friendship. Thanx thanx thanx!!! If not for u, there wouldn't be an optismistic WiNg as others see now. Realli thanx lots Mel!!  Love ya, 'WiNg""          Yah this is wat I wrote durin' the camp. Sumhow, the letter could haf been more sentimental or touchin', but I decided to leave these elements out 'coz I wanted her to feel appreciated for all tt she's done instead of gettin' emotional and all. Keke! Anyway, the letter was not delivered to her for sophiscated reasons so thot of postin' it here instead.   Other than Mel, I tink I've sum other pple to thank as well. Pardon mi if I leave out any names k?? 'coz I haf a realli bad memory (and it's certainly gettin' worse wif each passin' day... lolX!), and not 'coz u're not significant k??  ok... now. first up, i wanna thank my brothers, for bein' there whenever i fall; my 2 other ex, for bein' 2 extremely lovely angels when we were 2gether; Meng Seng, Dennis, Hairul & Co. for spicin' up my NS life; Jiayuan, Vicky & Jiajia, for all the memorable time we spent in JC; Jialong, Jiarui, Yinghao, Yingyan, Zikai, for bein' the first of my best frenz in life; Guoliang, Xikai, Loon Kah, Guoxing & of coz Wenhan, for all the projects we skived thru (Hee!!); Mike, Rongsheng, Audrey & co. for the 100% anti-dustmites quilt jokes and others tt we cracked on sales floor; the rest of the world whom I've touched or haf been touched by mi, for contributin' to the otherwise incomplete WiNg. Thanx trillion!!  Lastly, wanna share this song by Wayne Lin (who coincidentalli was my junior in SAJC). The lyrics realli rox!! Enjoy!! It's call  > aka ""WiNg"" in English.      翅膀   同样的机场　不同世界  同样的咖啡　不同味觉  同样的我和我　都少了一些  看飞机划过天空　不见了   用你给我的翅膀飞　我懂这不是伤悲  再高都不会累　我们都说好了  用你给我的翅膀飞　我感觉己够安慰  乌云也不再多　我们也不为谁掉眼泪   空气中藏着　你的香味  回忆里躲着　你的眼泪  最后拥抱的温暖还有一些  我拖着行李往前一直走   看一看回忆  是云朵　一朵朵的飘过  若想要回头　就无法翱翔,    ""Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend - or a meaningful day."""

GGCUFSP,male,24,"b'DaY: HaS-BeeN   Quite relunctant to write a blog for my b'day ytd coz to mi, it's juz another day. Hee!! Not blamin' anyone or anytin, but realli, wat's the big deal abt b'days?? I mean, everyday is sumone elses' b'day, so wat's so unique abt tt? Moreover, I haf at least 3 other frenz whose b'day falls on 30th May. So wat's all the fuss abt?? Anyhow, I'll juz blog for sake of bloggin'. Keke!!  On the eve of 30th, dined @ Ding Tai Feng in Paragon wif Kenneth, Kok Boon & Junping. Ruiqiang wasn't there 'coz he went to sum ""Ji1 bu4"" island wif Sisi & Co. So be it lahz!! Now I know who my true frenz are... Keke!! Anyway, subsequently, we went to PartyWorld Orchard for a ktv session. Initialli Junping & Kenneth suggested sumwhere sleazy... technicalli known as LSK (Lup Sup Karoake)... but I rejected the idea 'coz I've been there far too many times. Ooops!! Kiddin' onli... Chill chill!! So yah, managed to ""pyscho"" them to make do wif the decency of the lounge. Damn!! Regretted my decision... Hee!! We sang till dawn and settled down @ Mr. Bean for sum light supper. Had an enjoyable time catchin' up on good old dayz, esp when we were in Track.. Keke! Realli enjoyed tt bit. Gosh... if onli we could do tt more often instead of clubbin'. Hope Kenneth reads this. bWahahahaX!   Ken, Guoliang & Jolene ""invited"" mi out for a b'day supper on the day itself. Waoh!! tt was the 2nd time I went to chomp chomp and I was realli surprised by how much it's changed since the last time I came 5 yrs back!! The food was yummy too!! Had sum bbq chix wingz, stingray, fried Hokkien mee and cockles. Yah... realli thankful to Ken & Guoliang for initiatin' this outin'. Told them to postpone the meetin' till Xikai they all r free, but i suppose they were too eager to see mi. HahahaX!! Anyway, thanx dudes!! For spendin' the remainin' hours of my b'day wif mi!!!~! Frenz forever!!  Speakin' of frenz... I may haf rcv quite a few b'day wishin' but the person whom I wanted his wishin' so badly did not convey his wishin'. *HaiX* Not blamin' him... but juz damned disappointed. 11 yrs of friendship... yet... *SiGhZ*    Being 24 and still being financialli dependent is a fact I find it hard to accept. All these yrs of education, is it realli neccessary. I'm sure moz of u muz haf peers who haf not even completed their dilploma or degree but are currently earnin' big bucks. In constrast, I haf frenz who graduated a few yrs back but are sloggin' everyday juz to make ends meet. While society places a high emphasis on education, we should oso question the value of certification. Does it propel us further?? Faster??   There is onli this much a degree can do for us. Mabbe sum of us are comfortable wif a startin' pay of $1.8K as long as the prospect of the job is good. I'm definitely fine wif the amt. It's juz tt how do u define ""prospect""? Earnin' $5k or even $8k per month 10 yrs down the road. Endin' up in a managerial level and receivin' peanut pay?? How would anyone be satisfied wif such so-called ""acheivements""... n may I remind u tt we r in Singapore!!! Face it!! tt's the cruel truth!! Juz a reminder to those degree holders out there including myself tt hafin a paper certification can onli show tt we can study. It doesn't reflect our level of success in future!! So dun be too full of urself esp those ""Honours"" students!! Hee!!! It's no big deal!!!   ""Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up."""
GGCUFSP,male,24,"FaCiNaTiN' FaCtS aBt. WoMeN!!   Wanna know how a woman feels? Wanna beat them to their own game?? Sorta got these facts (or opinions??) abt. women. Dunno whether they're true, 'coz I'm blessed wif a baton between my groin and discountin' the fact tt I can't langa pple wif my breasts (Read: Chest!!) nor can I long pang pple wif my butt. I'm a MAN!! How the hell I know how a woman feels?? Anyway, who cares abt women?? Erhmmm... actually I do.... Keke!! Ahem, Well then.... Presentin' ""35 THINGS ABOUT WOMEN!!!"" *cLaP cLaP cLaP* Those in italics are my comments... tink moz guyz will concur to those... Hee!  1. When a girl says she's sad, but she isn't crying, it means she's crying in her heart.  (Then go bloody show it lahz!! Is she retarded or wat??)    2. When she ignores you after you've done something wrong, it's best to give her some time to cool down before touching her heart with an apology.   (Moral of the story: Ignore her)   3. Never tell the girl you REALLY like about your ""crush"" on another girl just to get her jealous, it'll only give her the impression that you r not interested.  (Tell her abt ur crush on another guy instead. Mabbe thingz may work out. Keke!)    4. A girl can't find anything to hate about the guy she loves (which is why it is so hard for her to 'get over him'after the relationship's over.)   (n guyz will find every reason to hate the ger)    5. If a girl loves a guy, he will always be on her mind every minute of the day, even though she flirts with other guys.   (Erhmm... for mi, I won't even flirt... I beri devoted one lehz!!)    6. When the guy she likes smiles and stares deep into her eyes, she will melt.   (Yah, no wonder gers alwayz say they're meltin' on a sunny day when they're wif mi)   7. If you really like a girl, tell her, don't hesitate she might feel the same way. If it's just an infatuation, DON'T.  (n there's a higher chance tt she might feel otherwise. Dun bang urself into tt wall!!)    8. A girl likes to hear compliments, but usually is not sure how to react to them.   (Like wat I've mentioned, gers r retarded... :S)    9. When a particular guy flirts with a girl very often, a girl would start thinking the guy likes her. So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare ok?   (tt's y I dun alwayz  flirt wif onli one ger, get it??)    10. If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.   (but still screw her if she doesn't mind *eViL gRiN*)    11. If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.   (n reject her again!! HahahaX!!)    12. Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves (which explains why most girls like writing journals).    (Hey!! I'm a guy n I like writin' journals!! LCB!!)   FYI, LCB = Lao Chee By  13. Never tell a girl that she is useless in any way.   ('coz at least she can fuck b4 givin' birth, n milk after givin' birth. Can guyz??)   14. Girls might sound uninterested when you ask her to be your girlfriend, it's their way of  playing hard to get, she doesn't want to seem too available.So don't give up.  (Or mabbe she simply detest u. So give up.)    15. Being too serious can turn a girl off.   (n SEX is supposed to turn them on!! Weee~~!)    16. When the guy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call.  But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.   (I confirmed once again... gers are retarded  -.-'"")    17. A smile means a lot to a girl.   (n SEX means alot to a guy)    18. If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.   (n try MAKING OUT wif her friends as well. Wordz of mouth count alot here.)    19. If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.   (unless she's not a student... tryin' to smoke u nia.)    20. But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.   (in anticpation for some passionate moments... Hee!)    21. Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.   (n she'll give u a spastic look & a retarded ans)    22. Hearing the words ""I love you"" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.  (n sayin' ""u r beautiful"" is a great confirmation tt we want SEX!!)     23. After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him  before.   (Probably she doesn't notice the guy even now... *SoB SoB*)    24. If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl,read romance stories.   (Pornography helps too!! Mabbe even more!!)   25. When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.   (Told u they're retarded... now u get the pt??)    26. A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the guy she loves now stays in her heart.   (So juz be contented tt u get her body... it's hard to haf best of 3 worldz)     27. Girls love having fun!   (Guyz love havin' fun wif gerz!!)    28. A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.   (Similarly, a complicated 'Hi' can piss them off for the whole day)    29. A girl's best friends usually know best what she is feeling and going through.   (A guy's best frendz usually go thru wat he is feelin'... e.g. Drinkin' sessions when he's down n out... *HaiX* tt remindz mi)    30. Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.  (Then dun be so ulgy in the 1st place lahz!!! DuHz!!)   31. Most girls would wait for the guys to make the first 'move', so guys DON'T hold back.   (GO ALL OUT!! GIVE IT TO HER!! YEAH BABY YEAH!!)    32. Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in that order.   (Devotion, carin' and happiness means makin' love to a guy, in any order)    33. Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a guy who will love and care for them.   (But it alwayz happen tt those they chose r the rich ones... Keke!!)     34. Girls want nothing more than to feel loved  (tt explains y guyz constantly make them... So ill-fated hor guyz..)   35. Don't wait too long to confess your true feelings.Girls might end up moving on.  (Who doesn't?? Spastic remark!!)    So now u know how hard it is to satify a ger?? The root of it all is probably they r retarded moz of the time to notice wat u haf done for her, n usually take a century (or 2)to show u a spastic look to show her appreciation. No wonder pple alwayz say ""It's alwayz hard to please a woman"". I couldn't agree more. On the other hand, men r easier to please. Juz SEX n sum BJs, they will be totally in love wif u. If ever we leave u, blame it on ur poor skills n lack of innovation bahz!! HahahahaX!!   ""It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist"""

GGCUFSP,male,24,"LOST   I'm lost. After such a long time of searchin n ponderin, I haf to declare, I'm lost. I really can't find any direction in life. Initially wanted to get back my fitness, but gave up my exercise regime shortly. Intially wanted to stop clubbin for good, but discovered I'm already obssessed with it. Intially wanted to find my direction in life, but realised it was futile.  Anyway, I hafn't done anything much durin this period when I hafn't had any entries. I haf been tinkin wat might haf happened if I'm still attached. While it is true tt i couldn't stand being wif her anymore, I kept askin myself whether it was too rash a decision. I still dunno now. But in any case, I did not initiate the break-up. I was only a victim of circumstance though I was so tempted to initiate. Past experience had me badly hit. I did not wish to be a vilian; this time round, i want to play the victim. In this way, I won't regret my decision. In fact, I did not make any decision.  i watched the movie ""Turn left, Turn right"" on Wednesday. It was a great movie. Hafnt watched romance for a while since ""My Sassy Gal"". Actually I haf intended to watch with her but we broke up b4 the movie could even make it to the big screen. I think it must haf been a hint to mi. We are not fated. ""even 2 parallel lines might meet one day"", I dun tink so. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, all thanx to my companion, Yanling. Her giggles really added humour to the originally hilarious own plot!! HAha!! Come to tink of it, how could 2 parallel lines ever meet? I would concur wif the 2nd message though. ""The kite in ur hand might juz break n fly away"". Makes more sense to mi.  Hope everything will get better."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"cHiLL oUt!!   Been on the hunt for chill-out spots in s'pore & haf been to sum of them recently!!   Went to Wala-Wala last nite wif kok Boon, Junping & Wakie. It's an easy-on-the-pocket venue in Holland Village where an exceptional two-for-one happy hour from 4pm-9pm lets you pre-order as many drinks as you think you can handle, to arrive one by one... Icy cold!!   Oh, did I mention the live band rox too?? Hee!!  Followin' tt, sent Wakie off @ the airport in the mornin'. Realli sad to c her go. *WeeP WeeP*   I begin to realize tt...   I can't live wifout her!!!      Why the fuck did she leave so soon?!!??    Relak lah!! Juz kiddin' onli!! Dun wanna smash the dreams of so many innocent gers. bWahahahahaX!!  Juz feel tt it's a pity she din manage to achieve her objective in comin' here. It's such a wasted trip. No wish to elaborate on the details though. Arghhhhh....   After sendin' her off, joined Xikai & Wenhan for lunch @ NUS. It's gown collection day!! Time realli flies. Before we know it, we're already graduatin'. Kinda miss those dayz we hang out 2gether after lessons, esp when Loon Kah was still ard. *HaiX*  Anyway, I juz came back from AlleyBar wif both of them. As I mentioned previously, I'm on a bar-hunt. So yah. Apparantly I've out-grown clubbin'. Now I prefer sittin' down & chit-chat over a few drinks.   I've no intention to discriminate, but clubbin' is realli for kids. Or should I say it's for pple who are more energetic and vibrant? No offence, yah? I'm juz too old for these.  Juz to round up...    Ice Cold Beer   Very affordable, but can be very rowdy at times, usually quite crowded.    Alley bar   Drinks are all at least $13 and above. Nice place to chill, and talk. Has two areas, one is at the bar side, the other is filled w/ nice cosy sofas.    Balaclava   Suntec. Very nice ambience, you can't entered w/ bermudas/sandals. Happy hour, I tried before, 2 pints of Hoee at $20.     Wala-Wala   Great place to drink and good food to eat. They have nice food like chicken wings and pizza. Their band is gd too. Check it out!  tt's abt all for these few dayz. Hope tt I'll haf the time (& of coz money.. lolX) to exploit more uncovered territories. It seems tt Westin Stamford and this bar in Bugis offer great ambience too. But tink I nid to build up my capital pool first.     Financial plannin', anyone??   Hee!!"

GGCUFSP,male,24,"oRcHaRd oRcHaRd oRcHaRd   Hey! Juz came back from Orchard onli. Been out the whole evenin' jalan jalan @ Orchard. Tink I muz haf covered the whole of the area... Started from Taka.... then Centrept... Far East... then PS!!! WaoH!! Can't believe we managed to ""conquer"" Orchard all in half a day's work... H33! Anyway, I met up wif Michael 1st @ Taka... Initially was tinkin of treatin myself to sum gd food 1st, but he suggested waitin' for Jenny... so no food for poor starvin' Mr. WiNg... *HaiX* Ke Lian ar!!! Then as usual, went to Taka tried findin' Jasling, but she's on off 2day... so hung ard there for a while, then made our way to our Cineleisure. Din know tt Michael is realli one Transformer fanatic!! He couldn't keep his eyes off the toys displayed in one of the toy shop in Cineleisure... H33!! Got to c the kiddish side of him!! Keke! Anyway, I managed to get hold to one catalogue and he was like analysizin' ALL the different models!! Amazin' man! Now, tt's definitely one of those traits tt I least expect from him... H33!  Followin' tt, we crossed over to Centrept. Can't seem to give tt place a miss once we're in town... HahahaX! As usual lahz... tok tok for a while then left the place... this time wif Jenny. Then once again, Mr. WiNg came up wif a brilliant idea... go Far East makan. So off we went ALL THE WAY to Far East ON FOOT!!! *HaiX* This muz haf been my longest journey on foot in Orchard... But at least, we finalli got to sit down to enjoy sum realli gd food!! ^^ Went to the usual eatin' house on the 4th floor (I tink) for sum HK cuisine. It was spendid!!~! Even when I'm not starvin' as I was then, I've alwayz found the food there todemo oishi desune!! One of my fav. eatin' places of all time!!  Had turkish ice-cream for dessert... n once again Mr. WiNg proposed sumtin beri interetin'... go arcade play photohunt. -.-""' It so happened tt there's no arcade centre available in the vicinity, so we had to travel all the way to Plaza Singapura. Well, it's not tt there's no arcade nearer than PS, but Michael strongly recommended there... Oh well, he's the boss anyway... Keke! Yah... almoz forgot... met Doreen in Far East (Peishi's younger sis). n surprise, surprise... she could still recognise mi!!! HahahaX! Tink she muz haf a beri gd impression of mi, if not, she wouldn't haf bothered to remember mi... BWahahahaX! 小翼賣瓜，自賣自誇！Sumhow, I thot tt she's grown taller... tink ard 174cm bahz... realli damned tall for a gal... but I realli like her height! Hopefulli, my next would be sumhow ard tt range.. H33!  After sum painstalkin' walkin', finalli reached PS... played a few roundz of Photohunt, n completed one of them... Yipee! But unfortunately, we din even make it to the top 5 scorers... so it was not such a big deal afterall.. Keke! Anyway, Jenny left earlier 'coz she has had an appt wif sum xiao didi ard my age... so left onli Michael & mi to ""fetch"" for ourselves. Settled down @ Starbucks for sum kopi... n of coz sum decent toks... mostly abt life in general, love, attitude.... well.... can't realli recall wat we tok... (n this shows how serious my short-term memory is... H33!) But of 'coz I still remember sum of the crucial thingz we discussed lahz. To summarise, the moral of the whole conversation is ""As pple grow, problems grow too. The best way out is to get in; not to get out, 'coz they may juz snowball n the consequence would be devastatin'"" Soundz not beri enlightenin', does it? HahahaX! I juz came up wif this crap... can juz ignore this piece of thrash. H33!    ""When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments.  That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding."""
GGCUFSP,male,24,"JoB oPPoRtuNitY   Been tinkin hard & long whether to accept my destiny as a chartered financial consultant. The job title sure soundz glamourous, doesn't it? But a few months ago, I wasn't receptive to the idea at all. I was tinkin, wat the heck?? It's juz another insurance agent job... dun give a damn!!! In fact, I dun realli like those so-called persistent consultants who came buggin' @ mi to either take up a policy or join them. *HaiX* I tink this is wat pple call retribution? Hee! Anyway, the turnin' pt which made mi changed my perceptions was durin' the interview (I would call it discussion rather) wif Roland, Collin & Szer Khee. They made mi discovered tt pride is worthless if u r not even willin' to make tt small, little step to overcome ur fear. Yah, I'm a graduate, so?? Does tt make mi anymore superior than those who haf undergone a lower education level. To mi, it does. End of the day, it would be a total waste of time on education if I've chosen this route. It does not require u to possess a degree b4 u can become a financial consultant, does it?  Realli in a dilemma now. *SiGhZ* Actualli I've broken thru' my 1st hurdle. I'm willin' to put aside the pride in mi. I'm sure tt by doing so, my wing (Notice: not wingz... hee! 'Coz I'm aH WiNg, not aH WiNgZ mahz) could bring mi further & higher. I believe I could acheive much more if I'm able to let go of this ""burden"". Main issue now is, which agency? I was enlightened by Roland & Co. but then I juz wanna be sure. Definitely dun wanna end up in a NATO organisation. They've changed my perceptions to a great extent and I realli appreciate them for the amt of efforts and time they spent on mi. On the other hand, I hope to leave my options open to other agencies as well. I've had a not-so-good impression wif Peter Tan's Organisation but Meiqing kept singin' praises of it. Fact or fiction, I will find out on Friday. Now I haf more & more thingz to consider. While PTO is interested in makin' fast bucks & IN BULK (!!), Roland's vision of contributin' to society coincides wif my personal values. I've yet to find out abt PTO's culture... but to make a choice between money & values... aiyah... tough one there. On 2nd thot, the 2 nid not be mutualli exclusive rite? Yah... so c how it goes bahz.  Supposed to club 2nite de, but then 2mr got IPPT, so decided to dismiss tt thot. Hee!! Hopefulli, I'll be able to clear all stations and get at least a silver!!!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"PennY FoR mY tHoUgHtS   DEFENCE Minister Teo Chee Hean announced on Tuesday tt all NSmen -with or without A-level, diploma or higher qualifications - will now serve 24 mths, or two yrs.    He explained tt two key factors haf made this cut-back possible: One is the rise of the 3rd Generation SAF - a smaller but potent fighting force backed by technologicalli advanced surveillance and battle-field systems as well as wargamin' systems and trainin' simulators.  The other key factor is the anticipated rise in the number of males eligible for NS in the comin' decade followin' the mini baby boom between the Chinese 'Dragon' yr of 1988 and 1997.  Put aside all the jeerin' and cheerin' for this new decision. Be honest to urself. The  additional 1/2 yr tt we served was one of the moz carefree period of our lives. Dun u all miss those days wreaking havoc together with your army buddies? Nonetheless, I still feel that the extra few months wasn't worth it... one bit!  I guess it depends on wat u do durin' the 6 months. Sum pple chiong suah until the end, while others spent their time doing sai kang. I relaked one corner!! Hee!! So it was a complete waste of time.   Watever the case, since they have 6 mths less and still need to maintain the operational readiness, mabbe their outfield tempo will be higher. Ok, tt spells field camp every week! bWahahahaX!! They deserve it!! Still envy them?? Keke!  Now, change in topic...  Haf u ever wonder whether there's this ""sumone"" out there who is destined to be wif u?? If so, how can u know for sure tt he/she is ur destiny?   I'm a strong believer of fate and I advocate destiny. Sumhow, I believe tt in this game of love(if it's ever a game to start wif), u will come to a cross junction where u haf to make a choice between acceptance or rejection. Whichever u choose, it doesn't necessarily mean the both of u r destined to be together or not. It juz shows tt u r already arranged by fate to meet.  Destiny... hmmm... hard to define. Webster's Dictionary defines it as an event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future. Such a simple definition; profound implications.  Isn't it assurin' to know tt there's ""sumone"" out there destined to be wif u? Of coz it is. But moz of the time, or shld I say all the time, we can't even identify the missin' jigsaw from our lives. Even Sun WuKong can't tell!! Not to mention Piggy like u nor Sandy... erhmm.... like Sandy~!! Hee! (p.s. read previous post)  Take a step back and tink. Even if u know u r fated to be wif this person for life, wat happens next? Hafin' the assurance of endin' up wif tt ""sumone"" might not be such a fantastic idea afterall. Complacency would juz set in and relationship might turn sour. Couples would be takin' each other for granted for they know for certain tt the both of them would eventualli be 2gether.  How beri sad!! Good intentions of fate bein' abused by mortal beingz. Can't help it... this is human nature. We won't feel the pinch till we've lost it... Love inclusive.  I'm not tryin' to suggest tt readin' into the future is no good. But if u dunno wat the future holds for u, wouldn't it be alot better? Man fear the unknown. Not exactly true if u live everyday as though it's the last. At least u know tt u r makin' every moment of ur life count. Even if 2mr nv comes, u still exist. Coz u realli do. No regrets. No shame.  Like wat I alwayz say, there's onli a limit to almoz everytin' in the world. Love exclusive. It is exhuastless & bottomless for love knows no end. I din put this down to provoke pple who's currently facin' a relationship crisis. Neither am I a love guru. Juz tt I find it a depressin' to find love fadin' over time. The basis of love doesn't work this way... not to mi.  Fate brings 2 persons 2gether; love bonds them 2gether. Destiny has alr done its part, how abt us? R we still trapped within our own matrix? If we dun break free, we won't be free! Likewise, if we dun wish to be understood, we won't be understood!! Love and u'll be reciprocated.   There's no point in searchin' for the ""one"". Often, we took too long lookin' for the ""right one"" that we alwayz miss the ""one"" by our side. No one can tell u whether he/she's the ""one""... u haf to figure out for urself.   Hafin' doubt over whether he/she's the ""one"" is prefectly normal. Sumtimes it works out; sadly, most do not.    If love can be an economic equation, I will assume ceteris paribus- so tt love becomes alot simpler.  If love can be a mathematics equation, I will solve for a constant to the power of infinity- so tt love becomes eternal.  If love can be a scientic equation, I will create an irreversible reaction- so tt love can be treated seriously.  If love can be a language, I will choose hand sign- so tt we can use action to show this love.  If love can be a fairy tale, I will choose one wifout happy endin'- coz true love nv endz.   But we know that "" if's "" do not exist...  How I wish everyone can love one another. How I wish couples can hold on to their faith & prove destiny as a myth wrong. How I wish there is sunshine (not literalli though... Keke!) in everyone's  life and everyone can wake up happy. I was able to achieve these in my dreams, how abt reality?

Went back in together, had the complimentary drinkz, Gary came along, RQ n Sisi arrived shortly, then waited till 11 for the 1-for-1!! Eugene joined us, Ken came. B4 the clock struck 12, Kok was alr dipsy (or shld i juz say drunk??!!? lolX!). Kenneth? Needless to say, he was alr in his own promised land. H33! Luckily, Marcus was there to take care of him. I was in charge of distributin' the drinkz, so din haf much. Surprisingly, Qiuli turned up n both of us went home together 'coz she was complainin' of gastric pain; n I was too nonchalant to the atmosphere in the club. No drinkz, no babes, no motivation. However, I felt tt I had done Ken a misdeed. It was a mistake askin' him here... for obvious reasonz.  Dunno y still woke up so early this mornin'. Not sleepy? Nah... Slept for ard 3 hrs the nite b4... then last nite slept so late. *Yawnz*Tink gg to catch many-a-shut-eye later. Keke!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"CRoSS RoaDs   Oftentimes it is fear that keeps us form doing the things that we know we should do - fear of failure, fear of success, fear of rejection or ridicule, fear of intimacy or loss and fear of the unknown. Taking the narrow path is a journey into the unknown and it can be quite scary.   Action cures fear. Doing what it is that you are afraid of is really the only way to overcome your fear.   Fear is the great deceiver. Fear would lead you to believe that not taking action is the best route to take. After all, if you don't try you can't fail, if you don't take a chance you can't get rejected, if you don't open up and become vulnerable you won't get hurt, and if you don't move out of your comfort zone you will be safe.  What fear doesn't tell you is that if you don't try you have already failed, if you don't take a chance you will never reach your full potential, if you put up a wall you will never experience the fullness of love and if you don't move out of your comfort zone you will never live a life of abundance.   Remember F.E.A.R. as False Evidence Appearing Real.    ""We must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity.""

GGCUFSP,male,24,"All About Mi!!   Finally my first public blog!! I shall begin by analysing myself, though keep having the impression that I dunno myself much... which is a sad thing. How could anyone be so unfamiliar with oneself? But that is me. i guess this is also the case for many people, losing themselves in the process of growing up. Really dread having to grow up and endure all the adult shit! Ok, back to the point. I'm basically a typical S'porean male who is going thru' the typical education system, from pri skol, to sec skol, to JC, and finally ended up in uni now. Personality? Erhmm.. I suppose I'm joyful, cheerful, fun-loving most of the time. To the extreme end, I could be depressed, negative, pessimistic. Split-personality?? Typical of Gemini rite?  Life in uni sux! Used to love going to skol intacting wif all my skol-mates but find it a chore now. Hardly find anyone who can understand me nor anyone whom I can confide in. Going to skol now seems like a mandane routine, attending all the boring lectures, n worse, mentally-torturing sectional tutorial!! There is no motivation at all! It could be due to my recent break-up. But is that the reason? I'm still wondering.  I know it's ridiculous to sound so depressing on my first go at the blog. But who knows? Mabbe thingz may turn out different as time goes by? Hopefully that's the case. Dun wanna live in uncertainty and pessimism all the time. Currently trying very hard to find my direction in life. Well, I'm already in my final year in pursue of a degree in Biz Admin. Haf to figure out my way sumhow. Sick of being a student! can't wait graduating n get to know life as it is. Reality may be cruel at times, but we haf to get exposed to it sooner or later. I guess life out there will certainly be intimidating, but at least it's a new horizon I haf yet to explore. Isn't it rite? I may sound childish in saying so, but I really need a breath of fresh air. Been trapped in here for too long. Know for sure that I will regret my choice in future... Who cares? For one, I'm finally independent. Dun haf to weigh my parents down at the very least.  Sad to say, I dun haf any decent hobbies as yet. I used to like ball games like soccer and basketball, but this is all in the past. Been trying to figure out what other interest that I might haf now, but alwayz arrive at the same conclusion... DRINKING! Over the past 2 months or so, I haf been drinkin in tremedous amount. Never in my life haf I drank that much! I know some pple would drown their sorrows in alcohol. For me, I dunno yet. To escape? But I'm fully aware that I still have to wake up the following day and face reality again. Then what is it? Not sure... Dun wish to know the answer either. In any case, promised myself not to drink so heavily in future unless there is a special ocassion. I will keep to my promise. I always do.   Rite now I'm quite persistent on a healthy lifestyle. In order to acheive that, I will follow an exercise regime which I drew up myself!! Hopefully, I can strike gold in the coming IPPT!!

Notice the scarcism in the statement. lolX!  Followin' tt, nth excitin' happened. Got to know a tiNg tiNg from friendster... 18 yrs of age... beri ..... erhmmm.... articulative?? h33!! Beri spontaneous n intiative... tok to her over msn a couple of times and even thru' the phone. We r juz as crappy, mabbe she more, coz of age bahz, i guess. She dares to tok abt anytin under the sun... the moon in this case... n no topic is a taboo to her. n i was like a consellor mentorin' her... keke! Onli got the share of listenin to her so-called happenin' eventz.... e.g. catholic-turned-Christian-turned-taoist-turned-vegetarian; her enchantin' animal-lovin'-turned-scarifice story.... Bwhahaha! It was hilarious, but a pity, I wasn't in my rite state of mind. Too sleepy then... dun get mi wrong... the topic even extended to platic surgery, bust enhancement etc. Is crappy or is she crappy?? H33!!!  I volunteered to compile the IFM data coz I was too eng n I haf completed tt. Nth left in my agenda now, so I can afford to waste my time here writin' the blog... to help mi rem the events!!! Now waitin' for destiny to come onto mi... n I dun even noe wat I meant in sayin' tt. RoFL!! Anyway, juz waitin' for.... I noe wat.... She's online now. thump, thump, thump! WTF is wrong wif mi? Mabbe I'm infatuated... erhmm.. mabbe not. Juz empty?? Hahax! Loser!!  I nid a miracle, or mabbe wat I nid is courage? or.... ..."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"SuMtiN' sTuPiD   Ok, I haf to explain once again tt I'm not a sexist though I've been kinda condemnin' women in my blogs. Keke! Can't help it especialli when time and again, these women are proven less superior (notice tt I din use the word ""inferior"". Hee!) than us men.    This is one of the theorical example!! Hee!  urlLink     urlLink     But, still I nid to clarify tt though it has been proven (well, from above, at least.. Hee!) tt women are evil, most of us men still fall victim to their ""vicious traps"". Shit!! Mabbe tt explains y I'm so easily mesmerized by them!! Keke!!  Anyway, I dun ask for much in a woman. She juz has to be tall, rich, beautiful, nice, smart, farnie, sexy, voluptuous, honest, sincere, helpful, patient, kind, independent and of coz willing to feed mi beer & chips while I lay ard and msn other babes.   So any volunteers?? lolX!!  To tell u the truth, I've fallen in love wif myself. I juz can't seem to understand y I'm lackin' in suitors. *HaiX* I'm such a humourous, amiable, compassionate, pleasant, charmin', cheerful, jovial, likable, congenial, fine young man, how come nobody wants mi?? *SoB* Izzit 'coz I like to lie??

GGCUFSP,male,24,"Human Nature Undefined   It was today that I realised how weak a bond between humans can get. Man are not forgiving by nature, however they are forgetful creatures. Why is that so? In times of need, you may be able to give their your fullest support to guide them through the rough patch; however the moment they can stand on their feet, they will begin to take the care and concern that you once showered them for granted. They will forget all the enduring times when they needed attention most. Isn't it so? To err is human, but how many of us are willing and able to forgive a person no matter how grievance his/her mistake is? To forgive is already not easy, but to accept the person as if nothing has happened is even a more profound knowlegde. It requires the generosity and courage that many of us are lacking.  I'm just wondering whether it's worth the while to commit yourself fully into any kind of relationship, be it love or friendship. End of the day, you may not reap what you sow. I mean it's kind of dumb to say you dun expect anything in return for the the effort that you have injected into the relationship. No one's a Saint. In any case, I suppose we should alwayz observe the market first before making any investment. It may turn out to ur dismay.  One good turn deserves another? I haf yet to experience..."
GGCUFSP,male,24,"SLaCk aS UsUaL   Haix... spendin' the whole of Sunday @ home again. I haf nth against it... realli. But if onli there's sumthing I can do which is not so energy-drainin', brain-crackin', nerve-rackin', vision-strainin'. Keke... onli arrive @ one conclusion -- SleeP!!! On 2nd thot, dun tink so. I would rather hang ard, wait for thingz to happen. Watever the ""thing"" might be... H33!  Din haf the mood to blog for the past few dayz, so here I m to fill myself in agin!! Hahax! Had my Japanese Oral on Thuday. Initially thot tt it's gonna be hella a torture, but all's well, ends well. Still not too bad, considerin' my past performaces (But i reckon tt it's not gonna be gd either!! H33!). Anyway, din do much preparation prior to the test, so any score is acceptable lahz, as well as i dun flunk. After the oral, went home, zoubo... can't rem doin' anytin constructive though. Hehe!  Friday, stayed @ home till evenin' time, then kena jio by KB to go out. I approached kenneth & RQ out of courtesy. Knew they wouldn't go... 'coz ... erhmm... can't explain concretely, but it's juz an instinct. *NaNaNiPuPu =p* Then I din wanna mit KB n June together 'coz I scared of communication prob sia. So I asked Junping along. At first, it was fine. We were @ One Fullerton (suggested by Mr. WiNg!! H33!) chillin' out @ Baker's Inn. Btw, i din know tt Gloria Jean has closed for Biz... but should haf seen it comin' 'coz the coffee realli sux big time... Kekeke! Yah.. back on track. We were sittin' in the BEST location in the whole of the cafe!! Exactly next to the sea where we can haf a panoramic, breath-takin' view of the sea!! All was so calm and serene. *Geeze* If onli we can do tt more often instead of clubbin'. Followin' tt, we went to Dbl-o (yayaya, again...) Dun wanna mention much abt the events there 'coz it's pretty much standard. In the end, Junping sent KB n June to OT & then mi back home. Feel sad for him 'coz went pub can't drink & still haf to drive us back... *haix* I appreciate tt though. =)  Watched Miss Singapore Universe last nite (nth spectaclar happened b4 tt... *yawnz*). I was captivated by No.7, Laura Tan!! No doubt she got into the final 5. A pity she wasn't crowned MSU... T.T She din even makit to the top 3!! Tink her Q&A muz haf been atrocious, otherwise, she could haf proceeded on to the throne, or 1st runner-up at the very least. Such a pity!! Had been expecting Joan Seah to win, but eventually Sandy Chua emerged victorious! Well,  couldn't say much. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. This time round, the panel of judges din seem to mit eye to eye wif mi. Hey, Haf to clarify sth... Nid to mention tt Sandy does look stunnin'... in fact, Sandy, Joan, Laura & Marilyn were the few potential ones who caught my eye. Esp. Sandy & Joan whom appear so confident & elegant in their evenin' gown. But, dun tink the former derserves the title though. Thot tt she wasn't the best in each segment alhough she was fairly consistent. Whereas for Laura, she was leadin' the pack durin' the parade segments but stumbled durin' the Q&A... ArGhhhh!! Wat a waste!!   Then Ken rang mi up, asked mi wanna go Caesars or Eigos drink anot. He was rejected flat. 'Coz I was too preoccupied by the on-gg paegent mahz. He called @ the wrong time.. keke! Anyway, Kenneth jio mi go town shortly after the show ended, so we went Orchard to haf supper. Met up wif KB... we proceeded on to Mdm Sultan. Went to Newsroom bar.. the rest self-explanary. Din realli enjoy... but nvm... nowadayz, clubbin' is not for enjoyment; it's more like a default activity of circumtances. Nth else to do, then club lohz... *sianz*...

It was until I stumbled across a forum discussion in www.funkygrad.com tt I remembered I ""left sumthing behind"", so I'm back!!  Sum updates: Final yr, final semester in NUS. Got a bit sick (in fact, damned sick!! :s) of skol life but at the same time I know tt this is my last chance to be protected. Afterwhich, everything will be ON MY OWN. Currently takin' 3 modules onli n thot tt it was supposed to be quite relaxin' this sem, however it turned out tt the UE, Japanese Languge, tt I haf chosen is tremendously hectic- 3days,7hrs/week!! Initially, Xikai took wif mi, but he played mi out n as a result, I'm now strugglin' alone. Aiyah, mabbe it may turn out to be a blessin' in disguise. It has alwayz been my wish to learn another language and Jap is definitely top of the list! Hope tt it will turn out fine. Other than tt, the rest of my Bizad modules are still manageable, but I'm afraid tt I'll be lettin' my group down (again??!?) coz I haf no more spark left in mi. As mentioned previously, I find no motivation in skol... lolx!  Hafn't done anithing worth mentionin' recently. Last X'mas was ""celebrated"" peacefully. Watched Ju-On2, had a gd fright n spent the rest of the silent nite @ RQ's place. New yr, we partied @ Zouk. Likewise for CNY eve, we danced to the blast of retro @ Zouk (not again??!? But indeed it was!!). Anyway, I got to know Weiguang's Australian friendz n hit it off quite well wif Min (A Korean-French ger, soundz cool!~!). It was then tt my perceptions of Koreans not being able to speak gd English (or at least proper, juz to be fair) and discrimmination of permed curly hair changed. Hahax! Her English is astonishingly gd (even better then Kok Boon's!!! Bwahahax!!). I used to think tt straight hair is in every aspect superior to permed curly ones, until I saw hers. Looks nice. :) Of coz, I still prefer straight, silky har... Hee!  Kok Boon has a gerfriend now. In fact, their reationship started last yr. Despite all the skeptism (or mabbe objections??) from ""the rest of the world"", I still give him my blessin'. He has nv treated a gerfriend tt nicely b4 n I could realli tell tt he loves her alotz. Hope their love will blossom.... realli... coz they would haf a tough road ahead if they want to maintain this relationship. When the going gets tough, fierce Kok gets going!! Way to go bro!!  Kenneth is still pretty much the same old him. Still livin' like a vampire. Sleepin' durin' the daytime, n huntin' for preys at nite. Hafn't seen him in the daytime for the past 4-5yrs. Weiguang will be flyin' to Australlia next Fri n I will definitely miss his absence. He has been such a terrific companion especially for Kenneth, in moments of fun n crime... hahahax! As for Ruiqiang (hereby known as RQ), he juz celebrated his 24th b'day. Actually, I haf planned to haf a sumptous dinner out wif him, but as thingz turned out, it flopped n we partied @ dbl-o (what?? not again??!?) Enjoyed ourselves aniway, so it was okay. Bro who is MIA- Teck Yong. Dunno how he is copin' n it is pretty obvious tt we r driftin' apart (mabbe coz of his mass?? more able to float??! lolx!)

GGCUFSP,male,24,"WHaT iS LoVe aLL aBoUt   Love can never be so beautiful without friendship, one leads to another and the process is irreversible, the best of lovers is the greatest of friends!  When you love someone, don't expect that person to love you back the same amount. One of you will be ahead, the other behind. It's either you catch up or the other waits.  Never be afraid to fall in love. It may hurt a lot, it may give you aches and pains, but if you don't follow your heart, in the end you will cry even more for not giving love a chance.  Love is not a feeling, it's a commitment. Feeling comes and goes.  Love doesn't have to have a happy ending, 'coz love doesn't have to end at all.  True love hears what is not spoken, and understands what is not explained, for love doesn't work in the mouth, nor the mind, but in the heart.  When you love, you must not expect anything in return, for if you do, you're not loving but investing. if you love, you must prepare to accept pain, for if you expect happiness, you're not loving but using.  It's better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than lose that someone you love with your useless pride.  ""How can I say goodbye to someone I never had? why do tears fall for someone who was never mine? why is that I miss someone I was never with and I ask why I love someone who's love was never mine?""  It's hard for two people to love each other when they live in two different worlds but when these two worlds collide and become one, that's what you call magic!  Don't love a person like a flower, cause a flower dies in season. Love them like a river cause a river flows forever.   ""Love may leave your heart like shattered glass, but keep in mind that there's someone who'll be willing to endure the pain of picking up the pieces so you could be whole again"""
GGCUFSP,male,24,"tOwN oNe-DaY ToUR   Yah yah... went town 2day! Met Simin in RC for lunch first. I tink it has been quite sum time since we last makaned 2gether. Anyway, we went to Out-of-the-Pan in an Out-of-the-Place venue - the basement of Raffles Shoppin' Shoppin' Centre. Basicalli, the place there serves crepes. I ordered a korean pork crepes while Simin decided to go for the smoked ham. Both were juz as nice!! But the highlight muz haf been my stawberry milkshake!! It was absolutely fabulous (Woo.... Ahhhh!!!) n I hafn't had one for like... ages?? ^_^ Dunno since when, it has become my favourite drink other than iced lemon tea. Tink I prefer the former though.... H33!!  Then I accompanied her go shoppin' ard RC for her ""interview attire"". Wanted to look for Auntie Wee but unfortunately, she wasn't ard. Nevertheless, met my SOP platoon mate Melvin. He's workin' as Simmon's promoter now... Had a small tok wif him and left. As anticipated, we left the mall empty-handed... Keke! Followin' tt, we went to Funan to meet up wif her cousin (??) to teach her Econs. *Haix* Econs nid tuition one mehz? Juz memorise enuff alr mahz!! HahaX!! Speakin' from lame old experience. Initialli, wanted to give Jolene a surprise visit in Challenger, but later realised tt she's workin' in the office. Opps! Should haf asked Ken earlier... H33!  Subsequently, I went to Taka alone to return Jaslyn her vcds. The irony is, I borrowed for such a long time (4mths? 5mths?) but I watched onli the 1st two episodes. Keke!! Not my fault also, 'coz I dun like the plot n I haf no time to go down town previously mahz. Excuses again. =P Of coz alone in Orchard muz go CP visit all my "" ancestors"" lahz. I met up wif Micheal... and had sum casual toks wif Jessie(s), Ong peh peh, Cindy, DeLi, Mingfa, Irene(s). Tinkin' back, realli miss the good old dayz in CP. But I still prefer the time when RS was still ard... more fun, less politics. *sighz*  Feast of the day: I MET ROSALIND PHO IN PERSON!!! Oh my goodness!! She looks even better in person!!! Couldn't take my eyes off her. Tempted to take a photo wif her, but shyness got the better of mi... ohhhh.... Wat a shame! This was my 2nd time seein' her in Orchard. The first, she was wif the cast of Lightyears. Speakin' of which, dunno y it went off-screen. Mabbe last week was the finale of the season? This, I seriously doubt, 'coz it didn't look like the case!! *Haix* There goes my Elle... *Sob Sob* Always on my mind... gosh!  Watched the finale of Nezha... wasn't in time to watch but all thanx to my sis who recorded it!! H33!! Then now strugglin' to get my brains crackin' on the SIA case.

GGCUFSP,male,24,"tHaiLaNd tRiP!!    Hafn't been able to blog this few dayz 'coz I went to Thailand for a 4D/3N trip. Yippee!! Finalli completed my graduation trip! (which is kinda depressin' 'coz I can't afford to travel anywhere else.. *HaiX*) Had expected a trip full of booze & ""erotic"" encounters but those were held to a minimum. Well, sumtimez u juz can't expect thingz to go in ur way all the time. It's all abt compromisin' esp when gg in a diversed group. At least there are sum thingz I've learnt from this trip which would be quite important when I embark on my next expedition. I shall cover tt later. Now juz briefly go thru' the daily occurrence.    Day1:  I woke up exceptionally early this mornin' @ ard 0730am. Dunno y, but was not excited @ all over the trip. Mabbe 'coz I din haf much preparation prior to the trip and so wasn't anticipatin' a realli enjoyable holiday. We took flight SQ69 and to my disappointment, found the service quality of the air stewardesses of SIA pretty bad. First of all, they were not beri professional and u could notice tt they were usin' Singish moz of the time. More importantly, they dun look phyicalli appealin' @ all!! Realli yucky!! *PoUt* Reached the Kingdom of Sex @ ard 130pm. Our tour guide picked us up @ the Donmuang International Airport and drove us to Asia Hotel (tt's where we stayed!! Hee!).  YanLiNg & I oN tHe sTaiRCaSe LeaDiN' tO tHe LoBBy iN aSia HoTeL. DuNNo wHeRe sHe WaS LuKiN' tHoUgH!! Hee!  urlLink     urlLink     First day was pretty fine. Took our lunch @ a Jap restuarant and spent the rest of the afternoon shoppin' @ MBK Center. While shoppin', I made a phone call to Wakie (a Thai gal I know in Friendster) to inform her tt we've reached. The coincidental thing was, she was in MBK as well!! Wat a pleasant surprise!! Anyway, she's such a pretty, nicey, sweetie!! She pinpointed the various tourist spots in Bangkok and even volunteered to show us ard. No wonder Kok Boon said Thais are beri friendly & hospitable pple. Seein' is believein'... Keke! A pity she had to leave early for work, otherwise, we could haf spent more time together... *HaiX* Hee!  We oUtSiDe MBK oN DaY oNe!! NoTiCe tHe DeSCeNdiN OrDeR oF HeiGhT... KeKe!!  urlLink     urlLink     Forgotten whether we took dinner... dun tink we had bahz. Anyhow, we returned to Asia Hotel to deposit our belongings b4 proceedin' to Suan Luan Night Bazaar for another round of shoppin'. Geez, it's realli warm in there. Try to imagine bugis village and u add the humidity by 20%. Afterwhich, we settled down @ an open space food center (can't find a more appropriate term) for sum refreshments. Aiyah, I dumb dumb, went to order beer.. Shldn't haf done tt 'coz I was delayin' our own restin' time. Shld haf juz gone back to the hotel to prepare for another round of ""battle"" the followin' day. *SiGhZ* Juz wanted to liven up the atmosphere wif sum beer mahz... HahahaX... juz creatin' excuses for myself!  RTU (Return to Unit) @ ard 2am. Waited probably one & a half decade for Yanling to finsih bathin' b4 I could haf mine. By the time it was my turn, could feel the cobwebs ard mi liaoz. Women will alwayz be women. I dun blame nor mind her for tt.. Hee!!    Day2:  Took our complementary breakfast @ the restuarant in Asia Hotel. Goodness mi!! Can't imagine mi wakin' up so early juz for breakfast. This goes back as far as when I was in NS.. Keke! As planned, we went to Siam Center , Siam Discovery Center & Siam Paragon to jalan jalan. Reached there too early, so we had to wait @ Starbucks to wait for the shoppin' malls to open. Damn!! These places hold a strikin' resembance to those malls in Orchard, hence we juz chop chop took a glimpse of the shops and departed for Central World Plaza (their WTC, but I suspect sumtin else 'coz I can't find the sign anywhere 'xcept for ""Zen"")   Aiyo!! The walk there realli was a torture!! I could feel myself meltin' sia!! Now I measure 3 cm shorter than b4 the trip... bWahahaX!! There also nth much, juz shops like those in Isetan. In fact,there's realli a branch there.. MNC ne!! Then frenly aH WiNg met a SGaporean peh peh there, so he made the initiative to tok to him. Horrors of horrors, he's such an extremist!! Totalli condemned the Government for overchargin' us and degraded the prospect of SG. *HaiX* Tink not everyone as patriotic as dear aH WiNg one, so I pardon him for tt. But on a more serious note, y do the elderly haf so many complaints and discontentment when the robust workin' population hold their breath to such issues? Or mabbe I'm too ignorant to notice. OppS!! Due to ""fatique"", we had to RTU again for a nap. Aiyah, the heat had the best of us, wat can we do?? No choice... No choice...  Wakie picked us up in the late afternoon (if my memory serves mi right) to show us ard Bangkok. e.g. Chitralada Palace (The King's place), Wat Benchamabophit (Marble Temple)etc etc... Aiyah.. those names I gave are wat I agar one... mabbe not those. Dun expect mi to remember all the names of the places I went rite?? Hee! But too bad, we din stop over to take any foto 'coz Wakie was in a hurry to go to work. But realli appreciate her for all the thingz tt she's done for us. Ask mi to 以身相许 I oso dun mind wor... bWahahaX!!  Subsequently, we went to Khao Shan for a shoppin' sphee again. Woah! I was quite fascinated by the stalls there. It's not as packed as Suan Lum Night Bazaar and it's not as stuffy as well. Juz imagine Mohd Sultan wif mobile stallsin between the pubs and u will get Khao Shan. Got alot of stuff to shop there sia!! Totalli at a loss as to wat to get. In the end, I oso din get anytin though the thingz there were dirt-cheap. *tSk tSk* Then we took a tuk-tuk to Somdet Chao Phraya Market. Gosh!! This is one shoppin' paradize wif lotsa clothin', accesseries, ornaments sellin' at a fraction of the price sold in SG. But it was quite congested, luckily we went @ nite, otherwise, could haf suffered from heat stroke... Keke!! I tink women go there moz probably will become mad, 'coz realli too many choices!! Anyway, Jolene & Yanling survived the ordeal... HahahaX!   After a hard day's work, we decided to go for a massage to pamper ourselves. Bein' a highly communicative person, I volunteered to ask the policeman there for a good massaging parlour. He recommended Khao San, so we returned to Khao San once again. The Thai massage fell short of our expectation. Mabbe 'coz we cheap skate, went for a half hour session onli. lolX! Could sense Jolene & Ken's exhaustion, so we agreed to split up: The two of them went back to hotel for sum hanky-panky (probably... hee!), while Yanling & I went to Suzie's pub for sum clubbin' session.   *HaiX* Again, it was a disappointment. We din even get to enter the pub 'coz Yanling din bring her ID along. *SighZ* It's heng tt I'm a forgivin' person, so din blame her @ all. Not even the least bit. Therefore, the two of us resorted to drink @ the bar counter juz outside Suzie's. It was pretty sianz initially, but a bartender offered to tah whisky dry wif mi!! Hey!! He's such a friendly & kind soul!! Knew we couldn't go in hence kept mi entertained!! So nice!! Anyway, I told him tt I'm willing to pay for our drinks if he's agreeable to tah wif mi, however he declined my offer. Instead, he treated mi to 2 more drinks on the house!! Woah!! Had a realli good impression of Thais then!! :) Would never forget tt cute chap who drank wif mi on tt borin' nite!! Keke!! Highlight of the day: I ate fried scorpian & grasshoppers!! Dun say ""yucks"" 'coz they were oishii ne!!! Tink the next time I go, I would try more of those!! One thing I found amusin' was when the police came to chase the food vendors away, they were still takin' their own sweet time, relak relak pushed their charts away. One of them even stopped to bbq food for mi. Wat the heck!!! Realli damn farnie!! RofL!!!   Day3:  Had the complimentary breakfast as usual. Today was finalli sumthing different from the previous 2 days!! No more shoppin'!! Gheez!! Not tt I was sick of shoppin', in fact I felt tt I nided more!! But then, I din wanna spend my time in Thailand shoppin' onli; I wanted sum sight-seein', sum local delicacies... sum other thingz tt we won't usually haf the chance to do in SG. If not, it would completely defeat the purpose of us comin' in the 1st place, esp when it's our 1st time here. At least get to know their culture better from their daily lifestyle, habits etc. Today Wakie brought mi to the theme park, Dream World!! Yanling tagged along... bWahahahaX!! (No lah, she brought the BOTH of us there)Ken & Jolene went to Chatuchak Market instead 'coz it's onli open on weekendz. Can't afford to waste any chances. For mi... Relak lahz... still got time after Dream World, moreover still got 2mr!! Hee!!  Had lotsa fun @ the amusement park!! Woah!! Was realli thrilled by the rides man!! If there's one thing other than sex tt could turn mi on, it would haf been these gravity-defyin' rides!! Totalli enjoyed thoroughly... but wished there were more!! Hee!! Anyway, Wakie wasn't tired out nor in the least affected by these rides @ all!! She was still damned energetic & kept hurryin' us to the next venue. Could sense tt Yanling couldn't make it anymore though.. Hee! Even I was pretty dizzy after the Raptor.. tink Wakie can realli bite man!! Then we watched a 'live' performance of SWAT team in action. It was like watchin an action flick wif all casts 'live' in action!! I was quite amazed by the pyrotechnic effects 'coz the onli time I had a close encounter wif them was when I was still a NSF. *SaD* Anyway, they put up a remarkable show though not realli spectacular... HahaX!!  Followin' tt, Wakie drove us back to Asia Hotel for us to wash up & to fetch Ken & Jolene. Had dinner @ a pasta restuarant @ Khao San. Then realized sumthing realli coincidental!!! I was realli amazed by fate!! The bartender who drank wif mi the previous nite is actualli Wakie's ex-bf!! Definitely din cross my mind... but... how could the world be so small? Sumhow, I suspect a conspiracy... Mabbe by God?? Hee!! After dinner, she brought us to the no. 1 pub in Bangkok!!! It was a great place wif a fantastic band, however, wat lackin' was our mood. So din realli had great fun. Nevertheless, tt won't be my last time there!! I'll be back!!  So we left the pub and went to a night flea market to do sum last minute shoppin'. I can't remember where but it seems tt the market opens from night time to the followin' afternoon. Beri interestin' place wif lotsa 2nd hand (or perhaps multiple hand) pdts like remote controls, spare parts, electrical appliances etc. Din stay there long 'coz sum of us almost suffered from concussion... HahahaX... no lah... juz tired... so din carry on wif supper, as planned originalli. RTU then. ZzzZZzz Realli can't wait to come back to SG...   Day4:  Our last day in Bangkok. Din haf the chance to visit Chatuchak Market the previous day, so die die had to wake up early juz to appease Yanling (Oops!!) as well as to make a desperate attempt to buy sumtin to pacify my family. Hee! She bought lotsa thingz sia!! Eventualli she even had to buy a bag to carry all the barang barang she bought. I was more of a maid, helpin' her carry all the thingz. Anyway, it was a fruitful trip and once again aH WiNg saved the day!! At least we haf achieved the aim of visitin' the largest market in Bangkok!! All in a mornin' work!! Yah... and Ken & Jolene were sleepin' all this while... Keke!!  Took lunch @  MBK and did sum casual shoppin' b4 returnin' to hotel. Reached the airport @ ard 430pm Thai time. Couldn't bear to leave such a nice place *WeeP WeeP* Took flight SQ65 and played the games on Kris World. Tink won't haf many chances to travel in SQ in future bahz. Thus though exhausted, I stayed awake thruout to enjoy watever was left. 1030pm: Finalli HOME SWEET HOME!!!    Sum lessons learnt:   1. The service quality of SIA left much to be desired. esp. the air stewardess... if all are like HS, then alrite liaoz. Hee!  2. Women in Thailand are not dark!! In fact 70% of them are tall, slender and fair-skinned!! e.g. Wakie!!  3. Thais dun smoke as much as SGaporeans despite low cigarette prices. Take a look @ their pubs u will know. The air is so much fresher in there. n the onli time we saw a group of pple smoke, they were a group of SGaporeans (My friendz) -.-'""   4. Men & Women are animals. The former are tamed ones while the latter are fierce ones. The former are prey to the latter. Sum of these predators bite while others gobble!!! bWahahahahaX!!  5. Like wat sum ladyboys said, ""Girl more money"". tt is certainly the case there.    6. I'm easily amazed, fascinated and infatuated. For instance, I'm obessessed wif Tata Young now!!  7. Dun go Thailand wif gers... u will end up being their slaves. Go wif guyz instead... gers will be ur slave!! lolX!!  8. Dun buy package tours. U will end up payin' more; go for the cheaper guest houses instead.  9. Contary to common beliefs, Bangkok is actualli a beri clean place. Though the dustbins are located beri far apart, u still won't find litter all over the place. In fact, u wanna litter, u will oso feel pai seh. tt's the dulan part... HahahaX!  10. Mabbe the myth abt gong tao in Thailand is true!! Inspite of hafin' a less than satisfactory trip, I've fallen in love wif the place!! I will be back!!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"JuZ mY 2 CeNtS WoRtH   Juz sum thots which haf been lingerin' in my mind for sum time. How come we alwayz say 2 cents worth instead of 1 cent, 10 cents or 20 cents?? Beri hard to find 2 cents nowadayz u know?? Hee!!! @@ ok, tt's beside the point. Juz wonderin' y when men are faced wif setbacks in life, be it love, career or relationship, we will resort to drinkin'. Isn't it better to tink thingz thru' in a clear mind, so tt u can c thingz better?? At least for mi, I know I dun fall into tt category. Not tt I'm not a man, but 'coz I've learnt along the way. It's no use cryin' over spilled milk; it would be better to clean up the mess & get urself another bottle instead. Agree?  Seein' Mingfa & Co. in their 18's, 19's, I'm sorta envious of thir youth. When u're young, u can afford to do anytin. Even if u commit any mistake, pple will excuse u for tt. Reason: U r still young. Moreover, they dun haf the worries tt we haf (though they will haf to face it sooner or later). Career is wat's most impt to mi now; ALL OTHER THINGZ r secondary. Sumhow, when u r approachin' mid-twenties (like mi!!! omg!!!), u would be panickly over ur bread & butter. Esp for guyz, we haf alr deferred our establishment for 2 yrs, all thanx to NS. Therefore, in this game of career, we can't afford to waste anymore time. Mabbe tt's the reason y pple sign on. NS no longer becomes their liability; it becomes their buildin' step up the social ladder. On the other spectrum, though envious, I'm pretty worried abt. these teenagers. Mabbe it's the change in society which makes them more protected, but there's a limit as to when these protection shields will expire. No cerificate = No future in Singapore. True so far? Definitely do not wish to c them in Robinson's sales floor workin' as a promoter in 5 yrs' time. n there's onli so much I can do to knock sum sense into them. Obviously not much.... Keke!  Pardon mi for bein' paranoid, but I can't help hafin' this feelin' tt my social circle is shrinkin'!!! Guess most pple r juz caught up wif their own work. Everyone is runnin' their own race.   Dunno if anyone else has this experience. U suddenly get depressed over no apparent reason and u feel like breakin' down n cry ur heart out. Well, I alwayz experience this. Mabbe juz feelin' realli empty... even when God occupies a thirdths of my heart. But each & every time, I hold back my tears. 'Coz I realize there is realli nth... & no one I can cry for. This makes mi even sadder... lolX! While bein' a ""life-saver"", the person tt I wanna save most is myself.   I'm a blessed man. But blessed man has his own worries. He will question the reasons why he is so blessed. He will haf doubts over his existence. He will wonder if he's gonna be blessed in future like he was in the past.

Alwayz come up wif trautisin' stunts to terrify pple till they go bersek or kneel down to beg for mercy. Keke!! Birds of the feather flock 2gether, but I dun want to be associated wif her in any way...Keke... coz she would onli bring disgrace to our kind.. Hee!!    Then I thot she would haf sum form of dignity when I said tt she's a clown, but in the end, she rebutted in sayin' tt she's a walkin' joke. Isn't she freakin' farnie?? Cannot stand her man!! HahahahaX!!  Since I can't upload her foto (for dunno wat fuckin' reason), the link to her profile could be found  urlLink here . Check her out man!!  Okay lah. Despite all the humiliatin' thingz tt I've mentioned abt her, she's a damn nice gal. I realli enjoy her presence coz her behaviour is so comical!! Beri cartoon one wor!!  Classic joke of the day. We went to BK @ Suntec and ordered a Junior Whopper Meal to share. She requested for a knife to split the burger into 2. I obliged. Then she told mi she din wanna cut @ the place where we were sittin' coz it would be too obvious and she found it disgraceful.   Hence from the center of the restuarant, she shifted to the seat juz beside the glass panel facin' the main shoppin' mall. Dunno wat's on her mind man!!   Should haf shifted to the internal corner of the restuarant mah. At least those shoppers outside can't c us!! From the position she chose, not onli it's obvious to  ALL THE DINNERS , shoppers outside can oso look thru the  GLASS PANEL  as well loh!! Bird-brain!!  In any case, I personalli find tt the act of cuttin' the burger into halves to be perfectly alrite. And I have every reason to believe tt Maple is either a. Mentalli unsound or b. lame. bWahahahaX!!  But I haf to thank her for makin' my day so unbearably entertainin'. Couldn't stop laughin' when I saw her!! Keke!!  Yah, speakin' of laughin'. There's this Sandy in our company who's attendin' the same trainin' program as mi. Since I'm a hard-core fan of Sun Wukong, one fine day out of the blue...

And u know I'm not referrin' to Sha Wujing rite?? Hee hee!!  Oops... I was abt to describe how nice Maple is... but in the end, I accidentalli revealed more foolish thingz tt she did. *HaiX* Feel so sad for her. Keke!!   Hey hey!! Got one more!! While sittin' there har, she unintentionalli knocked her head against the glass panel! Sum more, sum more!! She almost tripped when she climbed up the stairs to find her friend! It's realli damned hilarious loh!!!  Dunno wat the hell is in her brain.. Hee!! But her ""gong gong"" nature nv fails to brighten up my day, though it nv fails to amuse mi as well.

GGCUFSP,male,24,"MaN vs WoMaN   I'm not a sexist in any way, but i do suspect my frenz r. So here u r, man vs woman once again!! However, come to read abt them, it surely makes a great deal of logic!!! Dun believe, then read on!!   1. NAMES   If Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara go out for lunch, they will call each other Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara.   If Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Peanut-Head and Scrappy.   2. EATING OUT   When the bill arrives, Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom will each throw in $20, even though it's only for $32.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back.   When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.   3. MONEY   A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he needs.   A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't need but it's on sale.   4. BATHROOMS   A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Marriott.   The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 337. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.   5. ARGUMENTS   A woman has the last word in any argument.   Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.   6. CATS   Women love cats.   Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.   7. FUTURE   A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband.   A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.   8. SUCCESS   A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend.   A successful woman is one who can find such a man.   9. MARRIAGE   A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't.   A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change and she does.   10. DRESSING UP   A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, and get the mail.   A man will dress up for weddings and funerals   11 . NATURAL   Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed.   Women somehow deteriorate during the night.   12. OFFSPRING   Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and romances, best friends, favorite foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams.   A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.   13. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY   Any married man should forget his mistakes.   There's no use in two people remembering the same thing.   AND FINALLY...   A couple drove down a country road for several miles, not saying a word. An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither of them wanted to concede their position. As they passed a barnyard of mules, jack asses, and pigs, the husband asked sarcastically, ""Relatives of yours?""   ""Yep,"" the wife replied, ""in-laws."""
GGCUFSP,male,24,"JoB-HuNtiN'   Woke up early this mornin' to apply for jobs @ the agencies in International Pacific. Now realli feelin' quite lethargic from all the walkin'... sleepy too.. *YaWnZ* Was supposed to mit Jean (The recruitment consultant of Supurous) @ 10am, so I went juz abit earlier juz in case I can't find her office. As expected, Ken turned up late. *SiGhZ* shld haf known tt tt was juz an agency, not potential employer, so no nid to be so concious of punctuality. *HaiX* Esp. when I knew Ken would be late... as usual. Keke!  Anyway, after tt agency, we went to several others as well, together wif Yanling & Simin. However, most of them required us to make an appointment or send our resumes to them. Obviously there were exceptions. A few consultants were more willin' to spare sum time sharin' sum of the job opportunities wif us . E.g. I thot tt Eryn (Nice name huh?) was quite helpful & approachable =) . btw, she lookz quite sweet as well, tt's y I was completely focused on wat she was tokin'... H33! Then the other 2 consultants from Adecco were pretty friendly too. But one thing I dun understand is y they started gigglin' the moment I toked abt. my career objective durin' the interview. They told mi it's their personal joke durin' lunch-time but still, dun haf to laugh thru'out the interview rite =(? Made mi look like a clown ('Xcept for the bit tt I dunno how to juggle ballz) ... *HaiX* Luckily, the prettier of the 2 (in fact, I was quite attracted by her... *BLuSh*) passed a flatterin' comment tt I'm a pleasant lookin' young man... otherwise.... otherwise... erhmmm... tink there's nth I can do either.. H33!! In all, went to approximately 10 agencies bahz, but like wat I mentioned, not everyone of them were keen on entertainin' us. Can't blame them either. So many fresh gradz recently... worse thing is we dun even know wat we r lookin' for... even lagi jia lat is, we r so damned picky!! Nevertheless, I feel tt the position of processin' officer in Citibank is a gd offer. Too bad it's in Tampines, otherwise, I would haf given it a shot. Currently I'm still considerin', @ the same time keepin' my options open. Hopefulli can get a suitable job soon. Prayin' hard.  Aiyah, now also quite troubled, 'coz my interview skills sux big time. I was even dumbfounded by sum of the questions posed durin' the interview... n I know tt they were the common yet tricky questions tt require sum ""preparations"" Anticipated these qns alr, but answerin' them is a totalli different story. e.g. ""Wat do u c urself in 5 yrs' time?"" DuhZ! I would haf given a one-word ans ""RICH!!"" or ""Charmin'"" if I wanna try to be farnie. But an interview is an interview. Being humorous doesn't gimmi the advantage over the rest. Neither does actin' cute... *BwaHaHaHaX* Tink realli nid to spend sum time evaluatin' myself. No employer would want to employ sumone who's not even sure abt his own strengths & weaknesses. tt I'm sure.  Went makan @ Amoy market after the job-hunt. Initialli was plannin' to stay out till evenin', but Dad called to inform mi tt sis not feelin' well n she's alone @ home. Therefore, being a totally carin' Bro (Sibei buay pai seh!! lolX!), I went straight home. Upon arrival, realized tt Dad came home alr. Guess his fatherly love also beri ""powerful"".... BwahahahaX! Fortunately, Sis alr feelin' better, otherwise, I wouldn't forgive myself for leavin' her alone @ home. *PheW*  Hmmm... tink I oso nid  change my image. Main thing is my hairstyle. I haf absolutely no idea how to style an executive look. Then my hairstylist specializes in onli funky designz juz like wat mine is... so dunno whether if I shld still patronize him for my next hair-cut. Forget it bahz, tink juz go n cut a typical crew-cut will do. @ the worst, onli kena condemned by Ken Lee nia... HahahaX!! It's not as if it's the 1st time... Keke!

Used to haf no difficulty achievin' silver standard one, but *HaiX*... Look wat alcohol & tobacco haf done to a has-been IPPT gold reciepent. Those were the gd old dayz... *HaiX*  Then now my greatest worry is tt I won't be able to clear sit-up. YES!! SIT-UP!!!! Can't imagine rite? Indeed, a few yrs back, I couldn't visionize anyone not scorin' a perfect 5 for sit-up as well, but this perception changed when I took my previous IPPT. I did onli 38!! N the humiliatin' thing was, I attempted to complete the last 2 usin' my hands to reach for my knees!!! *PoUt* Despise myself to the max!! tt was then tt I realized tt ""5"" is not a so-called ""default score"" for sit-up. So far, I hafn't been able to do 40 sit-ups in one go even wifout time constraint. Tink I'm gonna had hella a hard time tonin' up my abs again. Miss my 6-pack man... Now they r so united tt they wouldn't bear to stay apart. Whoever sayz tt united we stand... hmmm.. definitely doesn't apply here. H33! Anyway, can't do too many crunches 'coz my abs' still feelin' the strain from the pathetic 40 sit-ups I did last nite. Sibei weak lehz...  The rest of the itemz, I tink I shld haf no problem achievin' the required standards for silver bahz. Chin-up, I can do 9 now, as compared to 6 last week. It's amazin' how my body conditions itself... to my delight! 'coz it seems like my fitness can be quite easily regained after onli a few trainin' sessions! Now, tt's gd news! Even for the runnin' part, last week was like a suicidal act to complete 2.4km, however, now it's pretty much a piece of cake. Keke! Damned hao lian. Of coz I'm discountin' the fact tt I din time myself. Nevertheless, tink I shld haf the endurance to clock below 11 bahz... tt's juz a rough estimation. Can't time myself 'coz I dun haf a digital watch wif stop-clock function now n I haf no intention of buyin' one... H33!   Juz now kena disturbed by a sms from Yanling in the middle of my sleep. Asked mi if I wanna join them to apply for job @ an agency. Not tt I'm not free lahz. But I was sleepin', dun feel like wakin' up then. Moreover, I'm totalli unprepared. Dun wanna give the impression tt I'm there juz to try my luck. Appreciate her invitation though. =) After replyin' the sms, sleepy-head ah WiNg went back to sleep again. H33! But, I was disturbed by a phone call not long after. This time round, it's James. Asked mi if I wanna work in Taka this comin' weekend. *HaiX* I dun feel like workin' @ all, but I'm bad @ rejectin' pple tactfulli, esp. James 'coz he's helped mi alot in the past. Now still delayin' my response & hopefulli, I can find an ingenious excuse soon.   All JX's fault lahz, wanted mi to ask James if got part-time job for him anot, in the end, James knew tt I'm available for work now, so asked mi work. *SiGhZ* tt's one of the major factors why I hestitated callin' James when JX approached mi. *BiGGeR SiGhZ* =S  It's wednesday lehz... feel like gg Zouk, or Dbl-O oso can 'coz it's free entry 2nite. Long time nv go mambo alr... so feel quite tempted. Once again, the problem lies in 2 factors: Kakis & money. If go Zouk, tink can onli ask Kenneth.. the rest of the world tink either hafin' exam or not keen. Then the thing abt Kenneth is he's too ""task-orientated"" & he prefers Phuture, so nvm. On the other hand, even Kenneth wouldn't wanna go Dbl-O, who else would be interested? So, tt's out as well. Even got kakis, I'm oso lackin' in financial resources to thoroughly enjoy myself. Mite as well adjourn till a later date... Oh well... =I   ""Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering a single area of our lives."""

Earli in e mornie gt called out by Elanie to get e OARS cheque.. N moi first thinking is tht 'My hair is messy!!' Lolx.. So not presentable nehx.. Haha.. Den, saw Lindi and she din reali look good.. Hence, I went over to show moi concern.. ( Hello! I'm concern abt ppl de, u noe.. Stop qns-ing mi nehx.. ) Den, found out tht she gt some itchy rashes appearing lorx.. So, told MsChow abt it & accompained her all e way while e Upper Sec ppl were running.. Sobbiex.. I wanted to run nehx.. Nvrm.. Take it as I zhuan bahx..  Den, gone back to class fer lessons lorx.. Nth much either nehx.. After English was Physics.. Sigh.. Used to lik physics, but no more.. Wonder wad gt into MrKoo nowadays man.. So weird.. N he din seems to feel fer our MT results, noe? It's lik he dun seems interested at all sia.. Let alone tht, bell rang at 10 & still refuse to let us go whn he noe clearly tht MrLim is outside n his lessons has ended.. Gosh.. Tht's so barbarian lik man.. I'm not being baised.. I'm merely stating a fact nehx.. Isn't it so.. Cuz I'm not e onli one who sae this arx.. DiaOx.. Hao.. NEXT~!!   Results was announced.. 100% passes!! WhOox~!! !*Sup man*! 43% dist.. Almost half but not yet.. Sigh.. Cuz tht was wad MrLim wanted MORE than half a class dist.. We disappointed him nehx..

Well, mayb u can sae tht I'm jux being greedy fer wanting higher grades.. Who dun, ryte? Everybody wants e best fer themselves.. E highest grade obtainable mahx.. N i guess I'm one of them whn it comes to results.. B3 to someone who failed consistantly in Sec3 thru out & earli Sec4 is indeed a sense of achievement.. Guess I expected this grade but, jux dun wanna resign, u see.. Plus as a matter of fact tht I gt Dist fer moi Oral.. N tht's sth good, I guess? So, main prob now is to retake or not..? =X  I can sae tht I'm not confident enough to get a Dist.. I have to admit tht MT paper is easy to score but, It's onli a matter of HOW WELL? Sitting e same paper as those higher MT candidates simply drop moi confident.. Plus, izzit worth it to spend so much time & effort on a sub tht mite not have any improvement? Sigh.. So mani qns.. All ard a circle n back to e same point.. Will lady luck b wid mi den? Wun things b better if I jux concentrate on e other 6? Or do I have a higher adventage to score a dist wid my oral dist?

BUCZX21,female,25,"glorious friday morning  i dont know what it is about this morning that found me smiling; a light, calm, even happy feeling inside. i am Amelie, basking in an unnamed state of bliss both beautiful and pure. i don't even catch myself suspicious of some conspiracy the cosmos is setting up for me. this is good. there are so many things to do and i like it.  thank you, universe.thank you, God.        i love you, terenggoy   dear tere,  it's almost your birthday. last night when i got home, the lights were already off and you were deeply ensconced in your pillows and sheets. as usual, i tiptoed my way about the room because you hate it when your sleep gets disturbed even by the tiniest of my movement. i guess you heard the ruffling of the plastic bag i brought inside and you woke up, feigning annoyance but i knew,really, that you wanted to know what was inside that bag. i told you  this and you didn't try to hide it, we laughed. oh i know you very well, tere.  you are my baby. i dont exactly remember how it was when you were still in Mama's womb. i was a baby myself then. i didn't care about you; i even hated you because you kept making Mama's trips to the hospital more frequent than when she was carrying TJ. i hated you because i thought Papa wanted to leave us because he didn't like you coming. and i hated you  because Papa did leave us and the money was never enough after he left and after you came.  oh but Tj loved you. he kept asking if he could play with you when you get home. he kept squealing everytime your little fingers would curl around his. he beamed when Mama told him he would from then on be  kuya . everyone thought you were very pretty. they kept taking your pictures. Tatay even bought you a dress for your first birthday party and Nanay always slept with you tucked beside her. you had the softest curly hair and the cutest dimple, you know. and how you could dance! you were very pretty, i have to admit.  i took care of you and Tj. Mama said i am your  ate  but you didn't really like me then. we would always fight over the silliest of things; you always wanted to have my dolls, my roller skates,even my lunch box. soon enough, Tj, you and i would be screaming at each other but at nights, we would still end up with our i love you's and kisses. but it was you who always got to sleep beside Mama because you were the baby.  do you remember that we used to call you  baho ? you didn't like taking a bath, combing your hair or brushing your teeth. all you wanted was to play. and you did just that by yourself, talking to yourself, being all the characters in whatever scenario was in your little mind then.   i don't know how it happened,how i've become the Most Important Person in your life as you now claim. i hated you, see. but now, everything that i work for is for you, because of you.  people marvel at our closeness. they say it's a wonder how sisters can be really good friends. oh, you are my best friend, tere. nobody knows my heart and my mind like you do.   i know that you sometimes feel ""alone"" because a number of persons dear to you have gone: some to a place better than this world, some to seek happiness, and some just simply left. but i will stay. remember what i told you once? you yourself will go and live your life but i shall stay.   i'll be the proudest  ate  in the CHS Auditorium when you graduate in March. i'll be prouder than any mother or father there is. God gave you to me and i'm so thankful for that.  happy birthday.  love,  achi"

BUCZX21,female,25,"i want to be a twig    i woke up this morning smelling a nasty world waiting for me. it's not enough that there's so much brouhaha at work these days--my body isn't doing its job,too. i feel like im pregnant (of course,i'm not),having that so-called morning sickness except that this one is bound to stay the whole day. it must be because of lack of sleep as kulas and i talked over the phone til about 2a.m. before i went to bed last night, or shall we say this morning, i realized that i'm having ""real"" problems and doing some ""real"" thinking now. this is serious. kulas never stays up late on the phone much less if there's work the following day. the thing is, it's that hellhole we were talking about.my apologies to anyone from the office who'd get to read this. we are just on different seats,so to speak. i hope we could get a really good lawyer.  nina and sam met up with me last night.i needed their comfort and they didnt think twice to go all the way from paranaque to meet me at morato. we had dinner then all drove to intramuros for coffee. when i asked nina how she is these days, she answered, ""i'm a twig"". i want to be a twig,too. it's just a matter of following one's heart. very very soon.  oh and i've paid for tere's tuition fee yesterday and i realized that was the last i will have to pay ever. knock on wood. thank you, God. now if one would ask me what's the best gift i ever gave to somebody, the answer would surely be the college education of my sister.i feel blessed."

BUCZX21,female,25,sarcasm. disgust. everyone has a mouthful to say. everyone has suddenly become extraordinarily opinionated than when asked what-do-you-think-of-the-charter-change. funny how filipinos love making a spectacle of themselves. funny how we live up to what the world calls us. we love fiestas. and we celebrate it to mock ourselves.
BUCZX21,female,25,"this language   we say we love and when asked why or how, we try not to swallow our own tongues and choke on words disguised as reasons. we hope not to break promises clasped between fingers entwined, between the space of a kiss separated by our breaths.  we say we love and we feel it, chemical. but this yearning to define consumes us more than bodies taking in each other, like wildfire spreading too soon onto dry grass, leaving only parched earth and that burnt smell.  we know not the language of what we claim we feel but this we profess: we love, giving all things beautiful; we love like we live and that is enough."
BUCZX21,female,25,"In-Betweeness    It's an in-between day. You don't hate it nor do you like it. You just go along, not thinking, not thinking because you're tired of it. You don't do anything to break into this  in-betweeness  because there is nothing to find out, nothing else to discover when you finally allow yourself to go beyond this state. All is in your hands, in your mind, and it's stuck like some nasty gum you sat on. Don't hope for an epiphany. Nothing's there.  Nothing's ever there.   Now do not accuse me of pessimism. The universe just has a funny way of toying with my life. Sometimes I think of just staying still, as in literally not moving. I won't brush my teeth, won't go to work, won't eat, won't get off a cab, won't respond to somebody calling my name, won't budge even if the office is on fire--I just won't do, won't do a thing.  The world still turns. The world turns still.  ***   People understand...   Tere - that I can't give her everything she wants even if I try. I give her what I have, what I can and what I am.  Kulas - that I have my flaws; that the way I love him is the best way I know.  TJ - that I love him as much as I love Tere.  Mama - that I may not show it at times, but she is my source of strength  Nina and Sam - that my friendship with them will live up to a hundred years more  Ayvi - that my love for her and Isis transcends the days we are not together  Neng-neng - that I am always distracted and busy and tired but I will go to wherever she is when she needs me -- even when my hair is a mess  Tina - that I have bright ideas for work but just can't seem to hold it anymore and that our friendship is something  more than these cubicle walls can speak of  Tatay and Nanay - that I tried not to disappoint you when you were still around  Y - that letting go was the best thing we ever agreed on.  Ian - that I easily forget things and that I don't really intend to forget things  Jojo - that I love him for being the big bully brother I never had  Vlad - that I treasure our friendship so much  The Etnebs - that I miss you, damn it!  Papa - that I sometimes blame him for all the mess I've gotten into  God - because he does.  ***  Senti moment. Humor me."

BUCZX21,female,25,"Im back from Cavite. Work was quite overwhelming and it's bound to be so for the succeeding months. I dont feel like writing now; just want to do something before Kulas and I leave for Greenhills to watch Harry Potter. We were actually there earlier, after he fetched me from the office at four. We bought tickets at five p.m., I think, but we got seats for the 9:40pm screening. Went around the tiangge--nothing new. Went up to Shoppesville and got myself two perfect pairs of cotton pants in light blue and beige.   We're now here at Kulas' house, had dinner, Kulas taking a nap, me blogging away.  While in Greenhills, I got an SMS from Ninang saying my mom was in the hospital. I called my mom immediately and was relieved to hear her voice at the end of the line. She just had high BP, she said, but she's fine and Big Kuya's with her. I told her to ask Big Kuya to call me anytime if they need help. I hope Mama's feeling better now.  It's Tere's first week as a corporate girl. She works for Citibank as one of their Marketing  chuchubel --hehe, make that  chuchubelle . She'd kill me if she reads this. She's been getting calls from different companies still,and I think she really doesn't want to stay in Citibank.Whatever she decides, I'm so damn proud my little sister has a job already.  This is already a pretty lengthy post. And I said Im  tamad  to blog huh.  Im reading Oates' Ugly Girl,Big Mouth. Ang galing ng voice ng story. Ang husay ng pasok ng main characters. Im trying to read it slowly so I won't finish it yet.   Kulas and I will have a business meeting tomorrow . Funny namin, we could have discussed things earlier but we're waiting till tomorrow because we want it to be ""serious"". Haha. Meaning no lovey-doveys. Strictly business and coffee. Like real money-oriented individuals. Hehe.  Will it work? Being business partners with your lover/boyfriend/fiance?  Hmmm. I'll find out.   That's it. Off to Greenhills."
BUCZX21,female,25,"Woosh woosh          That's 4-year old Tintinspeak for ""go, go"". I started talking to myself when I was four, a year that's cataclysmic for me and my siblings, but most especially for me because that was when Mama told me ""you'll help me be the Papa to TJ and Tere now...""       And so I started reprimanding the little me whenever I'd feel too lazy to get up from bed to prepare my baby sister's milk, or too pissed at having to wash my brother when he shouts ""ateee tapos na kooo!"" from the john--I'll get pissed because I'm too caught up in reading People's Journal (I read them when I was four--strange,huh. A sign of genius perhaps.Teehee).       But of course no matter how many times I'd have to make milk for my sister or wash up my brother, I'd do them with a fervor, a loving fervor that's partly scared of my mom and sick of my siblings' whining. I love them more than anything in the world. And I'd say, ""woosh, woosh"", talking to little Tintin:        Go stand on that stool and get Tere's feeding bottle from the sterilizer on the stove. Go get the soap and wash TJ and give him a bath. Go put that tabloid down. Go call your mom's office to remind her to buy vitamins. Go ask Nanay to change Tere's diapers. Go Tintin, just go.        And now these people come into our lives, pretending to be helping us, but nailing us in the end. They don't have the single right.        They don't have the right to imply to my siblings' faces that I mismanaged the money Papa had been sending us. They don't have the right to ""give us advices"" even. Our father doesn't even have the right to do that.       He left us and it's his obligation to support us. Fuck, his money hardly stayed in the bank for a week. It's always never enough.        I wish my parents never married so then we'd have Mama's maiden name instead. I wish they could all read this. I am ashamed of them. I ashamed of this name we're carrying.        From this day on, I am cutting off all the connections I have with my father and his family. He left when I was four. He will be forever gone."

BUCZX21,female,25,"this song was playing in my head when Kulas was in New York   ""Mad About You""  by Sting  A stones's throw from Jerusalem I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight And though a million stars were shining My heart was lost on a distant planet That whirls around the April moon Whirling in an arc of sadness I'm lost without you I'm lost without you Though all the kingdoms turn to sand And fall into the sea I'm mad about you I'm mad about you  And from the dark secluded valleys I heard the ancient songs of sadness But every step I thought of you Every footstep only you And every star a grain of sand The leavings of a dried up ocean Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?  They say a city in the desert lies The vanity of an ancient king But the city lies in broken pieces Where the wind howls and the vultures sing These are the works of man This is the sun of our ambition It would make a prison of my life If you become another's wife With every prison blown to dust My enemies walk free I'm mad about you I'm mad about you  And I have never in my life Felt more alone than I do now Although I claim dominations over all I see It means nothing to me There are no victories In all our histories, without love  A stone's throw from Jerusalem A walked a lonely mile in the moonlight And though a million stars were shining My heart was lost on a distant planet That whirls around the April moon Whirling in an arc of sadness I'm lost without you I'm lost without you And though you hold the keys to ruin Of everything I see With every prison blown to dust, My enemies walk free Though all the kingdoms turn to sand And fall into the sea I'm mad about you I'm mad about you"

BUCZX21,female,25,"Intsik   ""Intsik, halika"". I would often hear them call her. The men in my neighborhood wore sandos usually holed and frayed at the edges, the lower half of it folded up revealing their potbellies. They converged by Mang Derek's store, sitting on the wooden bench the Kabataang Barangay solicited money for. On seemingly lucky days, beer bottles would be rolling by their tsinelas-clad feet. Mostly though, they would drink gin  bilog  and chase it with water taken from Barangay 4's  poso . Sometimes on luckier days, they would call Intsik and she would be sitting with them, fanning herself with her skirt, the heat always tremendously scorching for her to bear...  Mama said we should not play with her, with Intsik. She was not allowed in the house more so. Mama said Intsik took money from our neighbors and from people in the streets. Why didn't she go to jail, I asked.   Oh yes she did go to jail every time she got caught, Mama said. But the police liked her too much especially Capt. Guzman.   I have been to Intsik's house in Barangay 4. She lived with Lisa, her older sister and Aling Trina, their mother. Aling Trina did our laundry in the summer when Yaya goes home to Dipolog for her vacation. Aling Trina had never gone to a vacation, she told me while I was bathing my Barbie in the  planggana . But she had been on a ship before, when she was younger and her dentures new. Aling Trina said her uncle took her to a cruise around Asia. They were on the ship for a whole month. She loved the food, she said. And dressing up, putting on perfume and make-up. Her uncle bought her clothes for when the Chinese captain of the ship held dinners and invited his guests.   That was how I got to play with Intsik every Saturday in summer. Mama would ask me to fetch Aling Trina from their house and I would stay behind to play with Intsik.  Her real name was Rosanna, she said. Their neighbors called her Intsik because of her eyes and porcelain skin. You have beautiful China eyes, I told her. Intsik just smiled.  She didn't have toys like I did. We used the lids of milk cans for plates, the bottle of Clorox for our pitcher and their Nescafe glasses. We ate with our hands. I wanted to bring my tea set but Mama wouldn't let me take them out of the house. She said my playmates would just steal them.  When Mama found out I had been  staying  in Intsik's house, she blamed Aling Trina for talking me into it. Mama said Aling Trina owed our family a lot and that they could not afford to pay it up. Mama was screaming the whole time. Aling Trina just looked at her gnarled hands. Mama also said Aling Trina is a whore who pimps her own daughter.   I never saw Aling Trina in our house again after that. The men in Mang Derek'ss store said they had moved into a house in a subdivision in Cavite. They also told me Intsik likes policemen more than jeepney drivers...   - excerpt,  Intsik , an unfinished story."

BUCZX21,female,25,"A is for… Ate: this is what I am—to my akong TJ, to my shobe Terenggoy, and to my pinsans whom I dearly love.   Akong:  A is for Akong. Akong is what we call my brother TJ. That’s a Chinese pet name for little boys. He is one of the pinakamakulit little boys I have ever known. When we were kids, I and my play mates always tried to avoid letting TJ know what we were up to because surely, he would just turn everything into a disaster! He’s maligalig. Couldn’t keep himself from toppling down things, our Nanay’s figurines, heck, he couldn’t even behave and try not hurt himself. He would always tease my friends and would always insist on being the policeman or the daddy when in fact, we were playing school-school!  When we grew up, he remained makulit and pestered our bunso, Tere. Yet Akong is one of the most wonderful men the world fortunately has.   Antukin:  I have been known to have the ability to sleep whenever, wherever. I once fell asleep while sitting on the foot of a staircase in a friend’s house. I fell asleep for probably two seconds while biting on a lanzones (which I was eating to keep me awake during a training seminar); fell asleep while taking pictures in an interview job…    B is for…    Brilliant:  my mind is brilliant—or so I’d like to belive. Hehe.   Betchay:  my mom’s close friends call her Betchay. Her full name though is Elizabeth Leonila. All my friends think Betchay is the coolest mom a girl could have. Of course, we’ve had fights but Mama is one-of-a-kind. She is perhaps the strongest woman I know. When Papa left us, she wept, mourned for a love lost, grieved for her children who lost a father, then pulled herself together and went on living…  To this day, Mama is now happy with a man who loves her, Big Kuya.    C is for…      Crush :  I had my first one when I was eleven. His name was Arjayson and I didn’t even know that was “it”.  I always looked forward to spending summer vacation at my grandparents’ farm in Bulacan because Arjayson lived in one of the my family’s apartments. He would climb aratiles trees and would always tease me I couldn’t climb a tree because I was a girl. He was my crush, my first crush though.  And isn’t it nice to have crushes from time to time? : )    Chips Ahoy !:  My favorite is Chips Ahoy! Chewy and Stripes. I don’t see these in the supermarkets nowadays but I remember the first time I laid my eyes on a big blue Chips Ahoy pack: I was all gluttonous and didn’t want to share the cookies with anyone. I kept them in my backpack, forgot about it and the Mickey Mice in the house ate `em up—including my bag (bored holes).    Chinoy :  A lot of people ask me “are you Chinese”? whenever they hear my surname. Yes and no. Yes because my Lolo Julio came from Macao and my Lola Mommy is from Shanghai, only that her mother was a Cebuana. My maternal grandparents has 50% Chinese lineage too. And no, I’m not Chinese because 1) I don’t use chopsticks 2) I have a fear of seeing Chinese Opera live 3) I cant count 1-10 in Mandarin or Fukkien 4) because I am simply not."

Funny, Kulas has been complaining that I dont know how to listen anymore. How true, as my thoughts meander all the time. It's sad, isn't it? I am not like this. I was never like this.

BUCZX21,female,25,"I want to write something substantive for today; a good entry for the week,but I could only come up with mere ramblings straight from the top of my head. I am having such a bad time at work. I do not even want to think and write about it.  All I'm wishing for at this moment is that I could get out of here and finally do what my heart desires.  But there are bills to pay and a household to support, siblings to occasionally feed and pamper. No, I am not being hard on myself. I have grown living a life like this but I want to explore other lives now. A life of my own.   I can have it naman di ba?  I can do what I want. I just have to be brave about it and conquer what I fear most: failure. Everyone fears this anyway.  I am resigning from my job come December. I just want to finish my projects and other commitments here. I am not happy here anymore. Traveling (a perk really)doesn't even excite me as much. Hitting the snooze button at 6 a.m. again and again has become addictive. The boss, some people, the bureaucracy, and the sheer politicking drain me. The office has become an energy-vampire to me. Sad. I know I have to get out.  Impractical? But what is practical, really? Work is totally different from a job. I choose to have the former. Friends and even Kulas tell me not to resign until I find another job. Thing is, I don't want to be employed anymore! After saving (or trying) the seas for three years, I would be facing self-employment. Come 2005, I will be my own boss. Our House will officially open and teach art and creativity to kids and I will be doing ""regular"" freelance writing jobs. I will paint and mount my first solo exhibit. I will finally join the Palanca. I will teach writing and literature again. Best of all, there will never be a bundy clock for me. Ever.  Maybe I haven't done my best here. Maybe I have just been too selective of the times when I would do my best and show them what I can really do. I think that is just an indication that I am not cut out for this milieu. After all, I was not born to conform, be controlled. I need more freedom, space, choices.  This job is not bad at all. In fact, it has taught me things I wouldn't have learned from other jobs. It has brought me to places both literally and otherwise. It is for a cause I wholeheartedly support and adhere to. It helped me send my little sister to school (and she’s now a Swiss Air attendant).  But there are other things for me to do. I simply can't wait."

BUCZX21,female,25,"i know of a place that is actually a black hole i have consciously though grudgingly leapt into. it's like there are Dementors there--they suck all the happiness and cheerful thoughts out of you and you are dragged to misery, because they want you to be like them.  the only way to fight Dementors is to gather every happy feeling and thought out of your soul, no matter how difficult as they try to suffocate you by breathing in all the air there is in this cell, refuse to succumb to insanity, refuse to be prey.   life is funny: one moment you're skipping with delight, another and you're crawling like a lizard. as if you people didn't know this, no?  --------------------------  tere's birthday dinner at Pantalan was lovely. mama brought her Japanese boss and a colleague; tere invited her two best friends Arlene and She; Tj, Kulas and me.

Her blood presseure has dropped to 50 and her sugar is extremely high that she needs insulin. Our family needs prayers.   Sleep was disturbed last night.

BUCZX21,female,25,"i made myself a cup of coffee. (i like it black with a teaspoon of sugar.  i like the purity of things). the hot liquid first touched my lips with surprise, then i felt my tongue scalding, a singe-path forming down my throat.  instead of me feeling the sting, the pain, i uttered your name.  with the syllables coming out, my tongue barely touching the roof of my mouth as i pronounce your name, i closed my eyes and again felt that tingling sensation first in my mouth, my tongue, my throat, traveling down my body… down, down, down, and i imagined you sucking out the sharp pain of burning in my tongue, and i gave in to the feel of it, shivering, burning all the more…  and again i take a sip, awakening my senses fully, this time my body craves for more to sustain it.  a deep, aching pang crawls through me, the caffeine surges up, insistent, demanding.  like the touch of a hand barely touching the skin, my skin, sending me into madness.  with my mouth half-open, the softness of my dress seems to be touching me like a hand; i feel everything touching me like a hand… your hand. and once more, i burn with urgency, rendering me breathless… my mouth half-open, waiting for a kiss."
BUCZX21,female,25,"Breathe in, breathe out   I missed blogging for days and I am trying to squeeze this in now.   Our House Center for Children's Creativity is the art center/creativity school I have started late last year. Activities are now kicking off especially now that it's summer. I am organizing/facilitating art workshops for kids this summer, together with some artist, writer and teacher friends. Our workshops are meant NOT ONLY to teach the basics of art but moreso to instill in kids creativity, passion in discovering new things, and a sense of self particularly in creating things--working with their hands.   We are not your everyday art class. We are fun and exciting, too. :)  Oh, and we are also organizing an Art  Camp in Antipolo. If you have lil brothers or sisters or kids whom you think would be interested, please, please let me know :)  Meanwhile Project Brainstorm is a creative services and concepts group. The basic idea is this: interested people gather together in a meeting,  brainstorm  for projects and work on them. Everyone is welcome: writers, artists--graphic,deisgn,layout,visual,etc--,sales & marketing people, photographers-- kahit sino  who has the flair for creative projects and working with people.  How does it work? The group comes up with a list of potential projects e.g. a publication of a one-time lifestyle journal. Writers and artists will handle the editorial stuff; marketing people will sell the project to sponsors--and the work goes on.  Now, does it work? Oh yeah, oh yeah :)   However, PB is not for people who are after a lot of money. Equal profit sharing is the key here. This is because no capital is involved except for basic admin expenses that will be shouldered by the PB Board Fund. The PB Board Fund is composed of again, writer and artist friends--inlcuding yours truly. PB is also SEC registered.  My high school best friends and I also have a start-up business now. It's called  I'm Kikay . We package products for pre-teen, teen and not-so-teen girls. Our product now is a  Kikay Beach Kit --a pair of really cute flip-flops perfect for the beach, a wooden brush, a wooden massage roller, colorful hair rubber bands, and a make-up pouch w/mirror--all inside a powder blue or yellow mesh shoulder bag. It's pretty cheap, too :) 200 bucks is nothing compared to the prices of each individual product in our kit. Department stores sell them on a 300% markup even!  So with all these projects and my day job, I barely have time to pat myself on the back and tell me to relax. Oh well.  Those who are interested, just email me :)   To the bat cave."
BUCZX21,female,25,"I went to work with a quiet heart. The truth is, I have so many things to think about: my mom's love problems (yep, my mom's and she's 49), work, Ninang's health, my brother's baby (I'm going to be an aunt in eight months),and a lot of other miscellaneous things.  I have learned not to think about things when they're not yet jumping up and down my lap. So even if I know I'll be broke till the next pay day and till some clients pay up whatever they owe me, I do not care. It's not also because it's too tiring to care or too sickening to worry. I just don't. Life turns good in the end because no matter how strongly we bitch about it, life is good.  ***  I dreamt that my friend Shawie has given birth to twins and I was the only one with her in the hospital. This morning she called to tell me she's seven weeks pregnant.  I texted Kulas I wish I'd have babies soon. Now, there goes a rule out of your Cosmo. Wasn't I scared that it would drive Kulas scared to his butt?   No. In fact, if he showed the littlest sign of rejecting the idea of having babies soon, I would start thinking of ways to have mine--alone. Immaculate conception, here I come.   But anyway, Kulas and I are planning to get married next year--no killer-proposal though. I doubt if that would happen. I have asked for an engagement car, or an engagement condo, or even an engagement I-book. Cool, isn't it? I never liked wearing rings anyway.  My brother TJ is now a dad. Sad thing is, his situation is too complicated. Too complex, in fact, for me to blog about. The only thing I regret is that he didnt prepare for it. (Now I really don't like his girlfriend--people and family say she's bad news. But it's my bro's choice, still).  Then last night, my mom smsd that Big Kuya might be cheating on her. Well, she thinks he is, and their neighbors can attest to it. I told her to talk to him and get out of it if things dont get settled. My mom has sacrificed a lot already for the guy.   And then Ninang told us over dinner last night that her chemo doesnt seem to be working for her. Her tumor didnt change a bit after three chemo sessions. I think we need to look for another doctor even if her oncologist is her fourth already. We can't take any chances. Stage 3 of lung cancer isn't a joke at all.  Yesterday was Tatay's third death anniversary. I miss him.   If I didnt know better, I would think that these things are  karma . The categorically common Catholic would say, ""parusa yan ng Diyos"" (God's punishment). I dont think so.  I believe that my God is a loving, merciful and forgiving God. He will never hurt me or those I love.  But let's not get into that.  ***  taken from Naya's blog    Michelle Pfeiffer's character in White Oleander: ""You're doing it again. You're attaching yourself to someone who shows you the least bit of attention, because you're lonely.""   I have been guilty of this for so many times I deserve the death penalty.

""dude, christians can rock as well as the rest of us.""... ""uhh... ya, i guess so. sry guys."" to explain, dave and lane are keeping their relationship secret from the other ppl in their band, but when they were driving thru town, lane's mom stops them and mentions something about dave playing hymns for a christian group and about lane like him. the next time the band got together, the other ppl brought up the meeting with Mrs. Kim. luckily they thought dave was hiding his faith and not his relationship. it was funny. u had to see it to think so tho.

NWNZ2KK,female,15,"silicon graphics made my computer.   I have realized that my friends depend on my classes. For instance, do I ever talk to Chelsea? Nope. We have no classes. Well, we have one but there's an alienation between me and meredith which normally drives Chelsea to the Meredith side because Meredith's 1) smarter 2) cooler 3) easier to agree with as half the population just goes along with what she says. This bugs me. Esp. Barbara. Get your own opinions, jeez! Meredith honestly thinks I'm stupid. I normally avoid her but as I have more classes with her than people in my own grade, this proves difficult. Enough bashing other people.  I don't particularly like my advisory. I like about 4 people in it (sadly, this includes myself. I'm allowed to like myself.). Plus there's only one interesting person. Well, I guess me fighting everyone else could be interesting. Bethany, you're the interesting person if you would like to know, but you've probably already assumed this. Everyone is so girly. And Californian. Being Californian is ok, but being a valley girl and using like every other word is kind of too much. I know I use the word a lot, but compared to my advisory, I'm a regular tomboy.

Well lets just say that they're immune system sure didn't go up and the vitamins were killers. The fish were just lifeless in the pseudo tank while the real one was being cleaned. A scream from hell as my mom saw the carnage that lay at the bottom, only a few were spared. Miraculously as we were cleaning the tank we discovered 2 little baby fish, strange? I think so, 2 die 2 are born, hummm. I hate to be the creepy life analysis guy but damn thats a strange coinceidence if I ever saw one. It's sad to see my dad keep up his charade of not being effected but I know he is, I know that they were just fish and what not but he loved them.

VMR4HQ1,male,24,"last night was a damn waste of my time untill about 2 am when like clock work I found myself caught in the middle of another steamy debate about ghosts and what not. You see I wouldn't mind these particular conversations it's just that the people who usually bring it up say the exact same thing that they said 14 conversations in the past. So by now everytime it comes up I shut up and watch, calmly reapeting word for word in my head, but my post tonight really has nothing to do with that. While I was sitting there a person decided to get on the never ending conversation about GOD and religion, I never mind this conversation because I love to hear what people think on the subject and maybe they'll say something that would make me change my whole point of view. So blah blah blah we have the basics, then someone states, and right here is one of the best questions I've ever heard; ""When does a child stop being innocent?"" At first I thought I had the answer but after I would think about it for awhile I would retract it and start again. The rest of the night which was about 45 minutes after the question and the others were busy trying to convince me that ghosts can't hurt you if you don't let them and blah blah blah I was sitting and pondering that question. I have a vague idea of an answer but I dare not say."

There was some crazy drama at the bridge and we were stuck in a drunk hold up for about 20 minutes, getting to know your fellow drunkards sometimes can be a little mental test and sometimes you just wanna slap bleach out of the eminem look-a-like standing next to you and believe me you would have had your choice of which person to do so. I was actually let in to a club/bar that for some reason or another in the past has shuned me away and lowered my esteem du self, last night was different they actually let me in with no reservations and it was go time! 50 cent coronas, can't beat that no matter what time zone or planet your on, plans to indulge in the leaf were in the making and a late night laugh-off was eagerly anticipated. The weather put a hold on that little plan and the night was over around 3:30 am, I say that anytime after 2:30 is a good time to call it a night anything before that your just a sissy.  Work is calling my name in about 3 hours so I better get my lazy ass crackin, have somethings to do and people to hate.  hasta."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I had one of the best nights sleep I have had in farquin years! I vaguely remember some damn good dreams about the faceless queen that gives me such nocturnal bliss. Ok that little tid - bit kinda freaked me out. I now have a slight fear of the faceless freak I was once smitten by. Anyway besides all that stuff I slept like a....................damn sleepy person. My night, well really morning of undisturbed sleep, was ended by a phone call from the one I call MUM.  Of course this phone call had no importance at all, it was just a cruel trick by the gods of slumber to keep me in line. They knew if I had not answered the phone I may have slept forever. Then the world would be envious of my stature, as the king of nocturnus! Yeah I don't know either. When I decided to get my greasy ass outta bed I came to realize, that my ass was soaked to the bone, not only my ass, but half my got damn skin! At first a little embarrassed I thought maybe.........you know I had a little too much water before I hit the hay. That's when I heard the dripping noise on the wall to wall shag rug. GEE WIZZ! In my moment of pre pubescent memories, I had forgotten that I have this shitty ass, waterbed. I forgot that at least once a month this bastard of a bed decides he's had enough, he's gonna self- destruct. Boy did he ever, this little pin sized hole was pumping out water like there was no tomorrow. I wonder how long this was gong on? So by the time I awakened, the bed had lost half of its volume and it was in my shorts. I was damn waterlogged to the bone! My ankle is feeling a tad better , a little stiff but that's okay.  urlLink Andy  needs to drop some lines in the blogger form.   Peace....................................Oh Yeah my Dad got hit in the head by an air plane.....................HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"We are Wyld Stalyns! Damn that movie still makes me laugh after all those years of growing up and girls, I'm still a big ass geek that laughs at stupid stoner kids. I'm talking to Andy's arse right now and I must say it's good to talk to him, the poor fella has been sleeping on a couch for a month and he thought he was receiving a nice comfortable bed......... all he got was a cheap ass mattress. It seems Bubba likes to chime in every now and then to insult people, don't get me wrong I'm all about hurting peoples feelings but sometimes you just have to refrain from calling people clowns, especialy when your nickname is 'Bubba'. I saw Vanilla Sky last night, and I loved the hell out of it but I don't think I watched it under the right circumstances. My opinion of the movie........ I say it was the craziest thing I've ever seen and I was glued to the screen just so I could get some sort of grasp on what was going on. If you haven't seen it I say it's a must and if you never see it then your no freind of mine. I was just thinking right now about something that I haven't done in awhile, and that is attend a show of some sort. I haven't been to a really good show since Pheonix, you know Hey Mercedes, Saves the Day ..............day. Yeah well thats how long it's been and I'm starting to feel  the musical itch in my beat keeping foot. While were on the subject of Hey Mer and STD(as the queers in some places like to call them), why is it that everyband on that tour no has some bullshit video and Hey Mer dosen't? I'm pretty happy that they don't though cause I would hate for some poser as emo kid to ask me if i saw the video for 'Quit' and how melencholy he felt while Bob Nanna belted out the chorus. On the same subject, I was told by someone that they have lost a little love for Hey Mer due to the infactuation of another fan that this said person hates. If your confused go read a book........ I'm out.   Quit if your through with it you are gonna make me sick, sitting there with your hands in your hair.  Hey Mercedes"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Drinking some Dr. Pepper, really don't like it but I have a crazy urge for sugar and the pep is providing. Last few days have been the usual, fun; but the usual, lots of beer and lots of illegal psycotropics.

VMR4HQ1,male,24,"8:45 am............... My dad shakes my foot and tells me someone is on the phone talking about a trip to Pheonix, the man with the master plan is  urlLink Andy , greetings were taken and the question was "" are you ready?""..........................NOPE. I needed about 20 minutes to get ready and 20 minutes it was, a race against the clock ensued, a quick shower and a stroke of deorderant and we were on our way. A slight detour was in progress when we decided we needed to ingest in some donuts from the infamous Dunkin donuts, hot cocoa or coco as I would put it burned my sensitive tongue and the journey was on. 5 minutes into the drive I had already spilled some damn hot coco on my gear and burned my hand with the searing liquid, Andy, the man with the plan and the mouth of steel gulped his piping hot goodness in easy strides. The road was calling our names and we were speeding toward it, eagerly anticipating the events ahead. First stop.... food and an inerstate 'subway' was grabbing our thoughts and we participated in good humor, a few trucker jokes and a hot 'subway' employee later we were back on the road as JK would say. Later a game of "" who can make the most truckers honk by pumping their fists in the air"" began and at last count Andy was up by one truck, I was down for the count untill a truck weighing station showed her face to me and the trucks honked in my favor. One last stop before our final destination, a restroom break in the mother of all truck stops, they sold everything from candy to cd players, they even had an arcade room where I had to stop off and try my luck, after a few games of video hunting and a handfull of  urlLink hillbilly  jokes, the road had us. The last stop was of course the great town of Pheonix, Arizona, I loved it as soon as I caught a good glimpse, traffic was insane but tolerable since I wasn't driving, we met the lovely ladies that were letting us sleep on they're floor shortly after at one of the coolest apartments I've ever seen. After a warm greeting and a couple of dogs we were on our way to see the town and head for the reason we traveled so far. A slow trip to a rockin record store and a quick trip to a convienence store and we were on our way to glory and some just plain old rockin and rollin. The Nile Theater 7:30 pm, the presence of ""EMO"" and all of her stupidity was present as we looked for parking, the walk to the club was like none I've ever taken, I was just about to see  urlLink Hey Mer  and I was giddy with anticipation. The place was packed with black rimmed glasses, beatle hair cuts, tight pants and the worst part, I saw a few geeks wearing the're very own, home -made Saves the Day shirts, frankly I wanted to punch every last one of them.........but I digress. The first band showed their faces and I expected the worst noise ever to come out of the pa but boy was I wrong,  urlLink Thursday  showed me a thing or 2. Slow ballads laced with cruchy guitars and some serious drum work was the making of this band, besides the sometimes cheesy mic spin and the Cedric-esk dance moves, they ripped! The moment I and probably 3 other people were waiting for, yep you guessed it Hey Mercedes took the stage, the opening chords to 'Frowning of a Lifetime' reared it's head and I began to sway, the band hunched over with the force of music and I hunched along, singing every word and slapping the drum beats on my thighs I was in semi-heaven. The following songs would consist of 85% new record and the rest old, every song put me into a dreamy state while Bob shook his head to the beat of the song, watching them play made me see that they are insanely great musicians and they made it look effortless, Damon has to be by far the greatest drummer I've had the privalage of seeing, not only did he rip it up for Hey Mer but he pulled double duty and rocked it with Saves the Day. With my fist occasionally in the air and the words constantly in my mouth I shuffled my feet and slapped my thighs for one of the greatest sets in history, they blurred the line between humans and God. After the set I parted ways with Hey Mer, hopefully not for the last time. 9:30... Saves the Day takes the stage and the crowd loses it, I'm not to enthused to see them on the basis that they have idiots for fans and the whole time before they came on I could here them talking shit about they other bands, thats just not kosher where I'm from. As usual STD as the idiots called them by their handcrafted crap shirts rocked it, played some of my favorites and a lot of songs off the new record but all in all they ripped as well, not as rockin as some other band that played called Hey Mercedes but it was good. Vicky and Valerie knew the happs on a little after show hangout and we stopped by for a little look at what too much pot and too much beer can do to a person, ""The Flying V's""(Vicky and Valerie) had a few things to do in the morning so the stay in the crack house was abruptly ended and the coronas were tapped, the buzz came to me in a cigarett and hunger induced shock. An air mattress, a dog bitting my hair, and a few hours of sleep. Day 2 involved a late breakfast early lunch, brunch if you will at a place called "" The Cheba Hut"" which was a Marijuana themed samach place that had the names of pot for the names of their samacha's. The food was rockin and I want to go back right now, a stroll in the shopping section of town was induced and my love of the town grew, I was a little sad to leave but I will return one day, so Pheonix I hope your ready for me and my crew.   We have a new record out called ""Everynight Fireworks"" and this songs not on it............  Bob Nanna"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I went to the  urlLink Sparta  show tonight and I must say they put on one hell of a show. Watching those guys rip out crunchy melodic rock made me remember why I wish I were a musician. I think they might have done that for the rest of the crowd in hand. Even the musicians present wished they were as good as them. Watching the 3 guitar ambush created by this super group presented the fellings that make me love music in general, they had the crowd wrapped around Jim Wards's gashed thumb. The smell of smoke, the sound of breaking beer bottles and the decore of afro clad teens was the setting of tonights adventure in holy bliss. The sounds comming off the stage rivaled that of the majority of the members former band  urlLink At The Drive In . Im a definate fan of ATDI but Sparta made me question my loyalty. They ended they're set with Air and in my opinion is the best song they have out. Besides the occasional tall guy in my veiw the night was gee diddly great!"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I have recently discovered that I have this imense feeling of hopelesness. I don't know where it came from or maybe I've had it all along. It's this feeling of not knowing anything or knowing where anything is(hypothetically of course). I can't see myself going on feeling like this very much longer, because it's so nerve racking and down right depressing. Maybe I've felt like this all my life and just didn't notice untill now. If I can recall I've always in my short life have felt like I didn't belong and or I just didn't know where I belonged. If I have felt like this all my life and now I'm barely noticing it, thats a lot of pent up crap to be finally getting out. I'm afraid I may blow up at any time on anyone for any reason. I'll lose my usually calm demeanor and freak. Hopefully I'll figure out a way to let go and resume the position I once held as a person who was Inpenetrable by such feelings of being lost and not found. I do believe that I have just read something that might help someone in my position, its a prayer of some sort and it goes as is;                                                         God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change                                                                          Courage to change the things I can                                                                          and wisdom to know the difference  I saw this in my house just today and I asked my mom, ""when did you get that?"" It turns out she has had that little saying since I was a youngin. I saw it for the first time today, when I read it it sounded so familiar that I searched my brain to discover the origins of it. I just finished reading ""The Slaughterhouse 5"" by Kurt Vonnegut and I remembered that in the book he used that reference about a billion times. What are the odds of me being in the state of mind I'm in and then comming across a certain prayer that realates to my exact dilema. Maybe someone or something is trying to tell me to stop being a sissy and fight!........................So it goes.  Allison I'm waiting for my email.................Don't Make me yell!"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"That last post was inspired bt a little situation I had last night. 5 people sitting in a driveway chatting it up, 2 of those people living it up on some ganja. The Don decides he has some stories to tell, he ventures back the year 1992 and warms the night with a story that took place hours after watching  urlLink this movie . His little brother and himself had a little spat and decided to take the match outside to the grassy knowle of his frontyard. We must remember that in 1992 The Don was about 10 years old and his brother was about 2 years younger. Some way or another they end up on opposite sides of the grass and they're yelling battle cries to each other. Since the thought of ' Van Damme' was running rampid in their minds The Don yells out "" COME ON SLODIER!"" this infuriates his brother and he starts to charge. Running at his 8 year old top speed he lunges at The Don, he moves to the left catching his speeding brother in the gut with a swift knee. He dangles lifeless across it gasping for air. The Don see's he has won the battle and decides that it's his obligation to provide a finishing move and delivers a lightning fast elbow to his brothers limp spine. All of this inspired by one stupid movie. Man I love them don't you?  COME ON SOLDIER!"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,urlLink This cinematic peice of heaven
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Part 3 of "" THE DRAG OFF""   As James departed up the steps he took one more look at my half and half cousin and shook his head in the manner of, YEAH I WANNA PEICE OF THAT. Then he was gone. I can hear the water from the toilets flow through the pipes right above my head. My shiner was now all but gone,I was desperatly in need of another. By now its about 9:00 we have been in this basement for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Now I can hear the crowd growing. I can hear their footsteps on the ceiling above me, and I knew it was getting packed. My cousin is now putting the finishing touches on his gear. All that was left was the shoes and the wig. On go the shoes,these black heeled shoes.The heel on these shoes had to be at least 4 inches, so now he was towering over me. The final peice of the puzzle is being combed in his right hand. ""Dose it look ok?"" Yeah it looks good.  He bends over to place this monument of  dark brown ,streaked with a little blonde, synthetic fiber, false head of hair over his short, nappy, bleach blond hair. He tugs and pulls for a few seconds, stands upright. The hair is in his face,fiddles,moves it out of his eyes. ""There we go,how do I look?"" Good god man, the wig really puts it over the top. Before the wig I was thinking, man you are no good as a woman. After that wig was on I was corrected. I sat back and watched my cousin go from a 5'11,blonde haired,skinny black man, to a 6'3,brown haired,skinny black woman. I was freaking. At first I was thinking that this was a sad day in my family history, but then it got really funny. About now the ceiling above us was rattleing with the sounds of drunken, gay dancers.I was loathing the next step in this night. It was now time to go up stairs and reveal this finished product. We slowly climb the steps. The music slowly gets louder I belive at this moment it was ""What I like about you ."" from the Romantics. I open the door first, I step through first nothing out of the ordinary, but when my cousin step through that door it was like that scene in ""From dusk till Dawn."" when all the vampires started going nuts. In my version all the fruits started going NUTTS. ""Oh my God girl you look so good."" slap. ""Girl you look fabulous."" kiss. ""You go boy."" slap. Over and over and over. I heard these types of comments all night long. So now he has to do his victory lap. There were kisses on the cheek and ass slaps for years to come. "" Ok its time for us to get our pitcher of beer on."" My cousin announces to me. About this time I am more than ready for alcohol. Isacc/Diamond is bartending, my cousin orders a pitcher of beer. I down my first glass. Pour me another. Im up to my fourth glass and he's still on one. So Im starting to feel the sting of the brew. My cousin yells in my ear to overpower the music ""Im hungry."" Im thinking to myself........so! He tells me that there is food by the other bar. We head over, it was like a buffet but gay. When I saw a few of the items they had I started to laugh, cucumbers and meatBALLS. See. Everyone walking by me just had hillacious amounts of meatBALLS on their plates. It was about this time I realized why everyone was  into the T.V. They had the gay networks going. Just imagine a big wide shot of a beach, hey theres a couple laying in the sand ,lets get a closer look. WHOA! There dudes. That was all they showed, and drag queen competitions. My cousin taps my shoulder,"" I want you to meet Steve."" Hand shake, a nod of the head. ""Hi Cory so nice to meet you."" Steve spoke to me in a effeminate voice. Steve was cool and a tad funny. He was your stereotypical gay guy.A little chubby,recieding hairline, open shirt exposing chest hair, and he had really bright teeth. Usually that would'nt have bothered me , but Steve liked to smile ,,,,,,,,,alot. Steve and my cousin spoke for awhile and Steve explained how he was'nt going to stay long because he had to get up early the next day. ""Im sad I havent seen you in awhile and now I have to leave early, I really miss you."" ""Yeah I miss you too ."" My cousin replied to Steve. They embraced for a second. They part ways . ""We have to go back down stairs my dick is loose."" WHOA! At any other time or place I would have stayed up stairs and gotten drunk as hell. Not that night. I was clinging on to him like I was a small child. Everywhere he went I went. Now we are heading back to the pit. I hear a voice, ah good ol' Isacc, wait a minute your not Isacc. Now this suave mutha trucka's name was Mario/Verona. Just like the city in Romeo and Juliet. Mario was cool ,but what made this guy even cooler was that he had a loyal man servant. This guy did everything Mario asked. Get my shoes, find my wig, tie my shoes, comb my wig, get me a drink, everything in the book was asked of,""we'll call him Luigi"". Its now about 10:00 and im feeling the effects now more than ever, but instead of loosening me up I just got even more tense. By this time Isacc has returned to get ready for the show. Imagine a basement, drag queens, and a scared boy. This is the beginning of a skin flick, and truthfully I was thinking this. So Im freaking. ENTER JOEY, Joey was kind of a dick, but he was no queen, I found this out later as he swung his dick over my head at the bar I was drinking at peacefully. Thats all we need to know about Joey. My cousin is now behind the infamous black plastic changing into the performance gear. I shudder as I hear the tape being ripped from the roll. I know what this is being used for. "" Do you have a black bra I can use?"" Diamond askes my cousin. "" Im wearing it."" he replies. ""Oh SHIT."" Diamond is not happy with this. My cousin emerges a new woman. He is now wearing a silver half shirt and a matching pair of hot pants.Yeah yeah I know. Now Verona is now fully dragged and Diamond is the same. Joey is now sporting is finest rip away pants, and the man bitch is retrieving a drink for me andhismaster.""Ladies and gentlemen lets have a warm welcome for the beautiful VERONA."" The DJ announces. Mario walks to the dance floor,a BJOrk song begins and so dose the fun. Watching Verona flail on that dance floor was worth everything I had to endure that night.   I really did'nt think that this story would go on this long but it has. So stay in touch for ...Part 4 of ""THE DRAG OFF""   mabey the last part."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"In about 30 minutes I'm out the door and I'm on my way to some fun (hopefully), the plans for the evening consist of friends and booze, a personal favorite of mine. The plans have been etched in stone since yesterday and for the first time in my life the plans actually stuck. Usually if you or someone you know makes plans the day before the chances that they are going to fall through are pretty high, so tonight is a rare occasion. Right now in listening to some   urlLink  Deathcab for Cutie  and it's setting the mood for the evening, totally slow and relaxed. This of course is my favorite mood of all, and if the night persists to be in this nature then I can gaurantee the success of this mission. Yesterday was a test of my personal views at the moment when Nick was rubbing a bag 'o' pot under my nose for about 4 hours and roaming his house yelling pro-ganja slogans. If you really want to know I kept strong and clean. NO SMOKED THE POT FO ME! Till then...................................."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Okay it's official some bastard thug has stolen my soul. About a week ago while I was at bloodyknuckles' lab someone broke into my car and stole all of my music, that's right they took the one thing that meant something to me. These poor excuses of humans have stolen my kids and I can't do anything about it. Now I drive my car listening to the local clasic rock station and long for the memory of blurry rides home lost in the ""music"" that was once everything to me.

Yeah I sound bitter but SO WHAT! Okay now that I've gotten my anger out and the subtle thought of suicide out of the way we can get down to business. As  urlLink ass-ko  was aying earlier in the day about The Strokes, I say that they are a good band they rock and what not but I agree that the whole hype (aboot) them is just ridiculous, good band yes but jesus returned no.

I just thought I 'd share a few of my top creep lines from certain songs with you. Listening to back and to the left by a little band know as "" Texas is the Reason"" and I must say that this record just never loses it's flare and I must say that flare is sort of a drab and isn't a great word to describe anything let alone this record so I'll change it from flare to unpenatrable beam of Godly light that blinds only the weak and sterilizes the evil. Right now my self-esteem is just above the ground because a very beautiful girl walked by me, smiled and said hi to me in Mexico tonight, I know I know pathetic you say well I say your jealous and you wish you were as handsome as I was. I also think that the boys over in Austin are becoming heavy drinkers and are beginning to lose touch with reality and they think that it's cool to have a good time and drink with hot chicks in hot pants with hot freinds that have hot asses, you Bastards! I hope one or all of you have a severe eye injury due to careless drunkin dart olympics and you need eye prosthetics, patches, glass eyes, you know the works.

VMR4HQ1,male,24,"While I'm busy posting on everyones blog under the sun my own creation sits and waits for the return of it's master. It seems as if the blogger community has exploded and the walls are now comming down. It also seems as if Andy has a serious over-crowding problem at his little  urlLink vision . All is well in my area of the globe in fact I feel that things are better than they have ever been. I have this strange feeling that everything makes sense, even though there are millions of questions and millions of answers for those questions, I have the feeling that I have them all and there is no need to disect and evaluate any and everything. There is this guy that comes to work almost everyday and he sits in the window, drinks tea and water and he lightly talks to himself. Everyone thinks he's a crazy ass and he should be shot and I will admitt at first glance he is severly insane but, if you sit down and have a conversation with this fellow, as I did and as I discovered he happens to be one of the smartest people I have ever spoken too. He's like my own personal buddah and he guides me through life with his vast knowledge of what he thinks life is about. He once told me that all life is is one big mental trick, if you think that your winning then your winning, unfortunatly some people are so far in the hole that there is no possible way to trick the mind. If you think your winning then your winning.  Kelly we can't go on pretending................."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,What now ?
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"When I posted earlier I ment to tell about this horrid dream I had. If anyone has been reading this crap then they know about my faceless woman dreams. Well I had another, usually when I have them my faceless queen brings me endless happiness and love. Oh no not this one, this particular dream was probably one of the most disturbing dreams I've ever had and probably will have. Imagine your in a church, lots of people, you really don't know them but hey its a dream who cares. So you realize your the guy who's getting married and you walk toward your blushing bride, only shes not wereing a white dress, its all dirty and mud ridden. So I think ""hey maybe shes just protesting the norm of what a bride should look like. I like a woman with views. So I get to the altar or what not everything is fine, the preacher guy says whatever and .......you may now kiss the bride. I lift the vail and at this point I usually wake up,hence faceless girl, not this time I lift the vail and gosh darn it she actually has no face. She only has a pair of blue lips, and their all puckered ready for the lovin. At this point I freak and turn around to find that the wedding goers are now large bags of dirt. Everyone has turned into sacs'o' dirt, I turn and the faceless freak is still puckered up, the next thing I know I'm running balls out to the street then I wake up. I think this dream holds significance on any relationship I may have in the future, marital or casual. So basically I'm doomed to marry a sac of mud. Why does the dream god nocturnus irradicus torment me so?"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"So it seems that to fix my record player I need about 50 bucks and it's not like it has an electrical problem, the needle just broke! Well thats just another twist in the endless tale of my life, wow that sounded a little self-loathing. As I were in the past I must say no to that direction of self-abuse and self-defeation. I opened a bank account for the first time in my life and I am now in the proccess of saving, for what might you ask? I really don't know either there is talk of plans for the near future but we all know the way plans and I work out. I'll just wait and see for now, but it's always nice to have a little something for a rainy day or 2. I have to make another court appearance soon and I'm dreading it, I feel as if I'm going to walk in and the cops are gonna run my name through the doo-hicky and pummle me on the spot, I would only be cool with the beating if the fuzz actually used the word pummle or bludgent. listening to  urlLink The White Stripes  and I must say that they are setting the mood for this cold, empty night. On nights like this I have the urge to smoke cigaretts and sit in my backyard gawking at the sky in wonder and wishing I could see the stars up close. Right now the sky is a smokey kind of gray and the air smells like snow, I love it when you can see your breath in the air it gives me a kind of fresh and free feeling, sounds queer I know but I can't help it im a romantic.   This cigarette it could seduce a nation with  it's smoke, crawling down my tired throat,  scratches a part of me that's purring.  jets to Brazil."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"As of right now ""I'm reading On The Road"" by Jack Kerouac. So far this little piece of literature is a page turner. I haven't been reading as often as I usually do, but hey what can you do? I haven't posted in a few days on account that I haven't really had anything to say.  urlLink Nicks  old lady came back on sunday so I'm pretty sure he's happy as can be. I'm happy for the man cause we all know that he was in his own personal hell while she was MIA, and frankly I got tired of all the Canadian references. I'm just playing, I've been on the job hunt for a few weeks now and nothing has turned up. Hopefully something will soon though. I registered for a higher education today and also returned to the old stomping grounds known as high school. It felt like old times driving to school with my G. While we were there we were even mistaken for high school kids and it felt good, so maybe I don't look as old as I feel. It's pretty sad when you feel old at 21 huh? Maybe I'm making it out to be worse than it is, I know I'm young as hell and there are people who would kill to be 21. Maybe because I expected more out of life when i was 16. I expected 21 to be a crazy party and just nonstop good times. Oh how I long for the days of 16 when a little was a lot and a lot was not enough. Maybe the party has started but I'm still 16 and I'm missing it. Maybe the party isn't a party at all, maybe it's a party of the soul, if that makes sense? When I went to that school today it was like I had never left. Not many people have such fond memories of high school, but I do. It smelled exactally the same, I shed a mere 3 years off my age as soon as we walked in the door. I had the urge to go to my locker and grab a book I wasn't going to use. Figure out a way to be late for class on purpose. If I had the power to do high school all over, and was able to keep the knowledge I have know, boy 'o' boy would it be the same. I would just get better grades, and I wouldn't have thrown that girls phone number away, and on a certain day in a certain sophmore year I would have taken a video camera to school. Screw that I would take a camera to school everyday that year. I would kick some arses I should have kicked and love some ladies I should have loved.  I want the blindingly cute to confide in me."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"This is the run down of my 4th of July. Sure its 2 days late but ..........................SO! This was a night to remember in my book. It was a night I smoked way too much and drank way too much. A night that two lovers parted ways. A night filled with pyrotechnics and broken hearts. The evening started with a trip to good ol'  urlLink Andy's  house. There I met the crew for an eventful evening. This crowd of misfits included the following, The Don, Robert,David, urlLink Bubbs  myself, Hilla dilla, Andy, and  urlLink Nick . The majority of the group were engaging in a jam session of the sorts. Ripping out favoriets by the likes of Modest Mouse. Soon the session ceased and it was the infamous time of the night to figure out the nights plans. This is always a test of ones mind. Everyone always knows what they want to do but no one ever says anything. This type of heated discussion gose on for about 20 min, this dosent seem long but you see the two lovers were on a timetable and the BLACK hour was approching fast as hell. So finally we all agree on the same thing beer and the place to indulge it. We break up into two teams ...... Team 1.. you shall know us as Miller time....and Team 2 will be know as the lords of ice. yeah okay that one is lame but so what. So we disperse. Myself and the infamous Nick on beer detail and the rest on beverage coolage detail. We're OFF! Like a bat outta hell the golden bullet is catching ludacris speed. we are traveling a speeds unknown to man. the super market is still open, we rush inside to the living organism know as the beer isle. Nick says "" GOD damn they clean out this joint."" Bubba and I agree. The only cold beer they had in stock was Coors light and Natural Light. In my book I'd rather see death than those two beers. We parade around the corner of the isle to find our eyes blinded by the virginal pureness of the huge stack of unchilled Bud light. A sigh of relife immenates from our mouths. We have found gold boys, now to cash it in and be merry. We go through the preceding checkout lane we our bussiness and the usuall checkout with beer remark, "" Wheres the party"" the checkout lady proclaims aloud. Uh yeah. I reply. Once again we enter the time bending machine known as the urlLink Golden Bullet . We have to do a quik swing by Bubbs house, then to Hilla Dilla's. Now we are on our way to the PIT of DRINKING. Once again we have turned up the juice on the fluxcapacitor, we are making good time right about now....................untill we see the massive traffic carnage in our way to headquarters. The road was back up as far as the eye could see. Distant fireworks were exploding dangerously close to cars. I can remember think how I would love it if one of those fireworks had just blown up a row of cars keeping us from our destination but that would just be cruel. HA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. Well the 20 min in the hell fire of traffic we finally reach the  urlLink The Promise Ring . We arrive to find the rest of the crew already waiting in eager anticipation. We had in the hatch of the golden bullet a cooler of organs and the crew was the little girl waiting for her new kidney. We proceded to fill the ice chest with our luke warm beer and began to asened the hill of glory. The soft sand sinking benethe our weight, distant fireworks going off, some right above our heads. In the dark night our faces would light up with the colors of explosions. Then the dark would creep up to remain in the flow of things. We decided on a spot in the sand to partake in our festivities. We immediately began on our stash of alcohol. Our numbers were scattered at this point in time , no one was quite settled in. Someone spotted an oddly shape shrub and in great decor decided to set it a blaze. I had no problems witht this is was quite in favor . The plant gose up in a small but significant blaze. All cuddled around as it were the first time any of us had seen a fire before. The explosions were still going off all around us. you could here the occasional WHOA! from someone in the group. The evening was going on like usuall, a beer here , a toke there, after a few round of toke the beer I was on my way to farqued up town. By this time the evening was starting to turn. The BLACK hour was approching fast. The lovers time was almost up. Every now and then they would wander off into the night too have thier last moments together. I really dont know if anyone else noticed this but I did. While the rest of us were all huddled around the ice chest as if were a fire and were freezing in the arctic. the lovers were off to the side secluded from the group, if this were anyother night someone would have aknowleged this and would have asked them to join the crowd, but not tonight. Everyone understood. about this time everyone was feeling the efeects of whatever it was that they drank or smoked, Myself included. "" I have to take her home."" Nick anounced to the crowd. We all new it was time to say our good- byes. she slowly moved toward Bubba first, her longtime friend, and trustee. They embraced for what seems like eterinty, but not long enough. We all saw it the sadness, feeling of this person being already gone. Everyone saw this but everyone pretended not too. She moved from person to person we all told her to be carefull and good luck, but we all wanted to say more. The two lovers started their trek to the car. hand in hand they began one of their last walks together. It was downright heart breaking.Seeing the two walking off into the dark only hearing their voices trail off into nonexistance, and I swear as those two topped the hill, I swear a firecracker went off right above there heads and all I saw was their sillohetts in the distance and it was damn symbollic. The firecracker symbolized every relationship of all time. Think about it will ya. The rocket without a flame is a no useable object no use in the world. Add fire to it, sparks, flames, noise, the whole nine. the same as in relationships. You have the attraction to a person wich resembles a spark or what have you. The rocket shoots in to the sky, as the relationship becomes deeper, then there is the climax the point when the rocket explodes and colorful flames and noises light up the sky, the relationship has this also, the point when you are content with eveything at the moment, everything is beautiful and bright.Then there is a point in a rockets life when all the magic is gone and its nothing but a few shreds of paper hurdling toward earth. Its lost its glory and beauty. The relationship always has this par wether it happrn in a week, month. year or fifty years ther is always a point when it has to end all the beauty and flash just end."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Today was your usual shitty,boring day. Nothing remotely interesting or informative happened. Only thing I could say that was worth while was that hour I spent at 4am watching ROCKO'S MODERN LIFE. Man I love that show its the best and its been a dog's age since I've seen it. Other than that nothing clever or up beat to report. Right about now it's raining GOD'S fury in my neighborhood, mabey it's all those jokes about the beast(SATAN) I made last night. If so I'm sorry man. I was just fool'n'. There is this huge river of brown rain water creeping toward my door step and its a little freaky. Now I have to go a reset all my damn clocks cause the bloomin light went out. I wouldn't be complaining about the clocks but when you have about 7 of them it becomes an endurance test of the mind. My mom is preparing the first-aid kit as if the world was ending, sure there is a shiet load of rain but if you lived here you wouldn't worry your little head. By tomorrow all the water will be gone and the sun will be roaring at a whopping 124 degrees. So I'm not even worried. I'm just going to sit back and drink my frost glass of.......................TEA. Ummmmmm that's what life is aboot(Canada). Last night I repeatedly got the athlete knocked out of me in my constant failure as an air hockey player. I will have my revenge  urlLink NICK . My day will come when I am the worlds greatest air hockey player, I will rejoice and then I will realize that becoming the international air hockey champ is nothing to be proud of. Them the sorrow and self- pity will arise. Then I will call upon my dark lord to smite my enemies. Yeah right I don't own enough black to have a dark lord. I will just resort to good old fashioned roughing up.    we've only just begun.................The Carpenters"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Boy, has it been along time or what.Yes I have missed this litteral crutch know as ""The BLOGGER"".Well people its been a while, I have been out of the loop for a while.We have some catching up to do.Not now beacause I have lost my mind at the moment and mabey it will be back.So untill then...................."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"At this moment in time, I'm at  urlLink this guy's house . We acted like geeks and went to the comic store to purchase some reading material, I left empty handed but Nick left with a few ""DareDevil comics. right now Nick is searching his house for certain materials to create a device know world wide. Yes folks I am talking about a ""bong"" a device used to get your smoke on. At this moment Nick is roaming the house yelling ""WATER BONG"" and it's utterly funny, he's trying to persuade me into taking a toke but I flat out refuse. It's true peer pressure is a bitch and a half but I must keep strong and deny the bliss. While I'm typing this he's he's asking me if I'm nervous, why, might I ask? Nick says ""cause you feel like your going to give, you feel you wanna come to the darkside he yells. He constantly reminds me of goodtimes had under the influence, and the goodtimes we would have right now. I do believe that I'm not going to cave in and stick with my original decision. i'll keep you posted on the happs...................  Will he give in or will the good he really doesn't have shine through?"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Well it's about 6:30 am and I'm still awake pondering the meaning of life and all things that revolve around it, you know things like , love, money, comfort, warmth, lime green shag rugs, the massive amount of facial hair I have right now, the way the sky looks on a warm Texan night, the way my car shakes whenever I stop long enough to let it, how the sun hurts your eyes when you stare but if it were gone you would miss the little image it leaves in your eyes. The smell of a beautiful girl on a frosty winters eve, that shirt you have with a million holes and a million stains that reminds you of everything good in life, the sound of 20 pencils and pens writing frantically as a teacher spits out knowledge. The way you remember every note, lyric and beat of your favorite song, that first kiss or your last, a hand shake from your best freind, a good book or bad, the way your broken vcr only works for you, the sound of a lover breathing in your ear. the scar on your arm and the fresh gash right next to it, the way you feel when you just get a haircut, the first time you noticed hair under your arm, the first time you slow danced with a guy or gal, first day of high school, your first broken heart, the first time you broke a heart. The sound of your mom's voice when it was bad and the sound when it's was good, wanting to be like your dad, your favorite line in a movie, eating pancakes from ""ihop"", chico and his fucking tacos, chico and the man, 120 minutes, watching the sky turn from dark blue to pink, looking for patterns in the stars, sitting on the hood of your car, acoustic love songs, the way a certain smell can trigger memories good or bad, the sound of someones name bringing joy or pain, falling in and out of love, loose teeth, crooked teeth, fireworks and the dangers behind them, deep conversations with deep freinds, shallow conversations with a deep love, burned out light bulbs, unmarked Christmas presents, 7th birthdays, 17th birthday, strange rooms with strange girls, your first beer. first cigarette, first steps, first grade, first base, first record, first thing in the morning, the first time you realize your alive."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Friday The 13th, ohhhhhhhhweeeeeeeeeohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, damn this cursed day. I dont care what anyone says this day is bad damn luck. Last 13th I had a little incident with a large piece of metal and my head.  I still have the Frankenstienesk scar on my forehead. I can vaguely remember other 13ths when I have had some other injury inflicted on me. Not this time my ass is staying in- side till 12 am tonight. I will not suffer the pain again. On a lighter note ""The Johnny U"" is on a small tour across this great state of Texas. Their probably bitching the whole time but at least their out there. So if they come to your town go check them out.   peace................................."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Well as I predicted Halloween was a total bust. I could see it from the empty streets in my nieghborhood, and many others also. No candy seekers what kind of Halloween is that? Has this years Halloween come in a year where threre aren't any kids left, just angry, acne ridden teenagers, party seeking post teens like myself, or is it a deeper conflict? All I know is that I had a good thing going last night and gave it up for a test in bordome. I left free drinks and drunkin kareoke ballads, hot waitresses, hot friends and hot french fries. I left all that for a cold beer, hard cookies, silent hill, really loud surfer guys, peanut M&M's(well those are cool) and a scooby doo movie. Yeah you guessed it, a complete waste of time, I guess it could have been worse I was with good friends and around 2 am I started to have fun.  urlLink Nick  stopped by with some leaf and we had our own little party."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Just returned from taking the 'act' and I'm pretty sure I flunked the funk out of it. I think im my history of taking tests this was the worst, I was completely knowledge-less and unprepared. Lacking sleep and food I stumbled and guessed my way through 4 hours of unadulterated stupidity on my part. So I'm eagerly awaiting my results so I can ball up on the floor and weep, weep like I've never weeped before. Tonight I'm making up for my failer and lack of dignity by drowning my sorrows in a tub 'o' beer. Who's comming with me!"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I seemed to have forgoten how good it feels to have a job and then I remember how much it sucks. I've been working for 3 days now and it's an easy job and what not but......but.................... it puts a cramp on the life I love-d and worship. The life of sleeping till 2 and then doing absolutely nothing till 10, everyone has been there once or twice, I really miss it already and it's only been 3 days. Well today was a short test in embarrasment, here is the scene, it's 9:45 am and an evil little man that dosen't know english is mopping the floors,  I slowly walk to the top of a 2 step high platform do some odd jobs and proceed to walk down. I place my foot on the first step and I took  noticed that the step was soaked an I should be carefull, I step on the floor and my right leg starts to slide and I begin to do the splits. I try and keep my legs from parting in opposite ways and start to flail my legs and arms furiously, The thought in my head was that if I do the splits the odd's of my tight ass kahki's ripping and exposing my droors where pretty good so thats why I began to flail. I fall back on my hip and my knee slams into the floor, my head hits the floor as well. I lay there yelling ""OH GOD OH GOD"" for a good 20 seconds and then I realize that a few people were looking at me and gawking at my pain, at that moment I wanted to die and kill at the same time. As if slamming key bones on to the floor wasn't enough pain for me The fall decided to leave my freshly pressed and washed kahki's scuffed with some sort of black grime or something of that nature. I had to walk around the whole day with black streaks on my ass due to some watery steps. I should fake an injury and claim some workmans comp, free money cause we all know employment is for the birds.  ( In a cool  urlLink Bob Nanna  voice) Run for your life The ride is on fire All in tune All of this abandon I can barely stand it All in tune."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Boy ""O"" Boy do I have a story tonight.Shall I start at the top.Ok at about 6:oo pm my cousin calls me and asks me if I could give him a ride downtown at about 7pm.Of course i said yes.So around 6:45 he calls and says he's ready.I hop in my car and drive to his house,I get there about 7 min later I go inside and low and behold he's not ready.No problem I say to myself I have nothing else to do.Then I notice he's putting things into this huge duffle bag.See these aren't your run of the mill type things for a man to have.Wigs,dresses,hi-heeled shoes,and a gang load of make -up.Ok see there have been rumors that my cousin is drag queen,after tonight he'll be alot more.After about 10min of waiting we are finally on the road.Were chatting, blah blah blah,""are you going to stay for the show?""he askes me.Um yeah,I reply in an uncertain kind of way.So I change the subject.I forgot what that subject was but anyways,he asks me if he can smoke in my car I say sure buddy go for it.""But I dont smoke cigarettes.""He breaks out this pot pipe and starts tokin away.Ah dosent bother me.""Man I wouldnt be able to handle life if I didnt have this stuff.""Whoa! So after about a 15 min ride in the car we arrive at the destination.""Hey you wanna come in for some drinks?""Aw im broke.""Dont worry about it I got ya.""Personally Im not one to turn down free drinks so  IM OFF .We get inside and everyone indside has there glossy eyes strapped to the tele.My cousin says hi to some dude.Thats when I noticed the change in the atmosphere.They did not shake hands or even hug .They kissed each other on the cheek.Whoa! I have no problem with this at all I was just caught off  guard. As soon as the rest of the crowd noticed him,a group off seemingly regular people ripped off there maskes and revealed their limp wrists and chest hair.Whoa! Ok the shock is over now I know where I am.Heres a hint:the name of this place was the San Antonio  MINERS  Co.Get it?Ok Im still cool Im introduced to everyone as this is my cousin which Im fine with.So at about this time Im carrying a huge red duffle bag filled with these odd items.In my denile I figured they were for some on else,a freind,lover,co-worker. We are no heading into the basement area of this bar /club,we have a seat.The room is dimmly lit with two light bulbs swinging from the low ceiling.Like in a cop show.There are 4 mirrors nailed into the wall.A pieace of large plywood sprawled across a few chairs as a makeshift table.""Do you want a drink?""Sure I reply.Do you want something? ""Um yeah get me a glass of water.""I head back up the wobbling flight of stairs to find the bar crowd with there eyes to the tube again.I ask the bar tender,can I get a drink ?""Yeah sure what can i get you?""A shiner and a glass of water. Thanks alot.Whoa! A free beer.This might be good.Back down the shotty stair case.What do I see? My cousin sitting in a chair with some chick putting make up on him.Whoa! Ok I was caught off guard again.I desend the last remaining steps to realize that thats no woman putting make up on my cousin,ITS A MAN.FUCKIN  WHOA .Now how bout that shit?We are properly introduced.His/her name was Isacc/Diamond.Yeah I thought the same thing.Relax have a few and call it a night I said to myself,but little did I know there was to be no relaxing on this trip...............................................more to come ."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I think in the year 2002 I'm going to pull a  urlLink bob Nanna  and watch 365 movies in a year. I'm pretty sure I could do it. Well is was struck by the curse of the 13th again. This time thankfully no blood. I was casually eating my lovely, piping hot cup'o' noodle when out of the blue the back door swings open. AT 11:30 pm ok. the day was almost over. when the door swung open I freaked like a little bitch and spilled that searing cup 'o' death on my unsuspecting crotch. Yeah yeah it hurt damn bad, I even fell out of my chair, furiously rubbing my junk on the shag rug. Luckily nothing was severely damaged, I only have mental anguish."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Right now I was trying to get a little posting in on the SLV, but it wont let me post. Either the good folks at blogger felt my post's were no good, and decided to end the insanity. Or, Andy decided that he was the sole perpriotor of the site. Either way I'm content, I will lose no sleep over it. I will in return  SMITE  Andy if he has decided to rid the format of my graces. Anyway I just finished 'Apt. Pupil' by Stephen King, and I must say that he is an utter(crazy hand gesture) nut. Good boy gone bad is the plot, and I'm not talking boy slips in his studies, and inpregnates the next door nieghbor's daughter bad. I'm talk'n boy goes on a shooting spree and falls in love with a 80 year old nazi bad. Decides he's going to start his own holocaust by ridding the world of hobos and transients. In a lighter note he's an all-star baseball player. YEAH ! Thats what we need more of; nazi lovin, hobo killin, all-star baseball playin, white kids. Hey that sounds like someone  urlLink I know   sans  the all-star baseball, the only thing this guy is an all-star at is making  urlLink pizza ."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I think today was one of the worst days I've had in a long time. I wake up with a headache from the 7th ring of hell and it's not going away, the taste of beer and ""Parliments"" linger  in my mouth. The only thing on my mind during this trial was the jug 'o' milk gently chilling in my refridgidizer, I walk to the site of bliss and peer inside only to find a heartbreaking site, I really dont think I need to elaborate and it hurts too much anyway. So my vision of choco-love was shattered and left bloody on the floor of my heart. By this time I'm getting really irritated and I'm in a bad mood, I get a phone call requesting my appearence at my brothers school, (the bastard needs a ride) the fucking school is 10 minutes away, yet he needs a ride. I get in the car and arrive at the designated spot of pick up. I wait............and wait.......................and wait, a cop drives past me and makes a sharp u-turn. You guessed it he's comming for me, he parks behind me and proceeds to give me 2 tickets. The thing that made me the angry-er is the fact that my bastard ass brother had the nerve to call me for a ride and then decide he was going to walk while I'm in the process of picking him up. I get home and he's watching family matters or some shitty show of that nature. So I now have a hearty $200 dollars added to my devistating $300 odd dollars. Is there no end? I think my streak of bad air started last night while I was in progress of buying some gummy bears for a freind and began to get accosted by the customer service representetive. He accused me of being a theif, all on the grounds that I was looking at the candy and sticking my hands in my pockets. I stood in the store for about 10 minutes bitching at this creepy haired guy while he's walking away from the verbal assault I'm giving him. I wasn't cussing at him or threating his children, I was stating the fact that he was an idot and that if I wanted to steal something I would have. He throws my change at me and walks away, then he gives me a bag with a whole in it and my precious beer falls to the ground, like a gentleman I picked it up and threw it at him, ( Well thats what I should have done). I told him thanks for the bag and departed. I think I'm going to go again tonight just to torment him and taunt him with my pocket usage. See ya soon baldy."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"What shall I say about last night, pre- halloween halloween party, post pre - halloween party party. Confused ? Well don't be, it's harmless babble. Drunken, costumed people dancing to drunken costumed music, a singular fog machine pumping out ineffective fog.Someone dressed like an old woman refused to break character and hobbled around the party with a cane, I think I caught him/her dancing  sans  cane and limp. Peter Criss arrived a little later and gave all of us ' Kiss'  fans a real treat, hot girls with hot asses, sorry about that last one I had to tell about them. The scenery changed about 11 and we headed to  urlLink Andy's  house where we par-took in some festive drinks and festive laughs. I had the best teriyaki chicken of all time. All in all the night was worth the trip to hell and back."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"So it seems as if having a job actually did take up alot of my time, I see now that in the wake of not having a job I have ample time to sit on my ass and ponder life and all things that make it at this point in my young life stagnant and lackluster. After waiting about 2 months for the U.S. mail to work in my favor I finally received my drums, and after having them for a combined 14hrs I've already had the fuzz called on me due to a "" noise"" complaint due to Nick and myself rocking the fucking roof of the joint. So now I have to rock my kit guerilla style and pull some incognito damage.

On the same note if I have to sit through one more uninspiring and down right depressing conversation on how much sex one person has.Not only will I kill this certain person,I will lobb the head off the next person who decides to rub it in.So you better watch out lovers of America,Im looking for heads.I belive I am doomed to lead a life half thought,pro me conversations.Its a curse but someone has to do it right?All I got out of this night is a nice couple minutes of harassment by john law.I was being accused of the infamous beer run.Which I did not commit.After about 10 minutes and a slew of the standard questions,where do you live?have you been drinking?whats your phone number?is this your car?have you been drinking?What gang are you from?Blah blah blah.Ok you have a nice night now.I sure will dick.Not only has this situation ruined my taste for the barley and hopps.I now have to here the person with me tell it to everyone in the vicinity of the happenings.So yet another test of ones patience.  peace............................ How did the show go  urlLink fellas"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"This cough I have is starting to wear thin on my patience. Okay enough about my lung fluid let's get to the babble. I was reading the  urlLink Violence  earlier and I remember those late night B-ball sessions as well and damn were they the best. I wonder if you fellas remember the night we played in the pouring rain in Portland, Maine? That was a crazy right? We all freaked out on that last bolt of lightning that came dangerously close to our persons. Andy gettting smacked in the head with a soggy ass B-ball while tieing his shoes and what-not. Damn those were the times even though they were a few short months ago it feels like ages ago. So it turns out that Bubba's pride and waste of money was hit and now I think he's on the verg of a serious meltdown, so every chico's damn tacos be on alert Bubba's out to drown his sorrows with a mega helping of 'raton de caldo'. I really don't know what that means it just sounds gross. I was drinkin drinkin drinkin coca coca cola, I can feel it running right on down, right on down my throat-a.  I'm out like clear Pepsi........................"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I called into work today and told them I had a severe case of the vomits and now I'm relaxing in front of the comp debating on the coming events of tonight. I feel a little bad about the whole work situation because some poor sap that thought they had the day off is now pushing plates, and answering rude customer requests till 5. So it seems that Andy didn't leave yesterday, yesterday I smoked alot and ate alot of mashed potats, yesterday I made 56 dollars and spent 11, yesterday I realized that the live ""Fleetwood Mac"" record I have is the best live recording I've ever heard, yesterday Nick had a pretty horrible day and he's super bummed and I wish I could tell him something to make him feel better but I can't, because I don't know what to say, yesterday I fell in love with "" Maybe I'll Catch Fire"" by  urlLink  Alkaline Trio  again, yesterday was today yesterday."

To those who know me, if you ask they may say.."" well Cory really has nuthin up there but a few beans."" At some moments these people are right. Are they? Tonight was your regular night of youth misfortune. As per usual not a single person has any idea of what or where to partake in our nights festivities. One again we are forced into the never changing ritual of getting in the car and just going. Truthfully I actually like this part I have a blast of a time each and every time we do it. Only problem is with 4 18 - 21 males in one car you get your run of the mill ideas for the evenings arrangements. You get your choice of hitting the local bar/ venue. Your local taco dispensary, which is always a favorite among the weak. Or the never fail, ""Lets get some beer and drink in the desert!"" If you are wondering about the whole desert thing, let me explain. You see the circle of friends that I have most are underage, not child molestation underage, just about 2 years away from being a legal upstanding citizen. You see? Ok so the desert is really the only place I can have a few with my friends. This situation really sux in its own beautiful way. The whole sitting in your good pair of pants (cause you know you only have one) in a huge pile of dirt, drink once cold but now luke warm KEYSTONE LITE. Desert flying creatures are trying at any chance they get to end their brief lives inside your beer. One of your bastard ass friends is reeking havoc on your freshly conditioned hair with huge clogs of dirt. Now that I think about this it sounds really shitty. For some strange reason some of the most fun I have had in recent months has come from the barren wasteland know as the desert. Tonight it was door number 2. The taco factory. I don't enjoy the place myself but what the hell. We spend about an hour or so in. I go on a straw attack spree, wounding anyone in arms length with a straw. We saw cactus jack, either it was him or a lost mountain man who has just found his way back to civilization after many a year living the grizzled life. So in conclusion I myself had an alright evening.   Go check this  urlLink playa hata's blogger"

DEAD ?Almost.Was I on a spiritual journey into my soul?No.In my experience journeys of any kind are usually a waste of  time.Whether it be to the local corner store or a deep self-medicated trip into the mind.The results are the same ............nothing.I leave with nothing and return with nothing.Sure I return with that gallon of milk,but is that why I left?Mabey i was hoping to return with something else.Tangible or intagible.Did I forget the  TWIZZLERS ,could those tasty,twisted, red licorice strands really incite the journey-man in me?Doubt it.What was the trek for?Mabey I had found what I was looking for.Mabey it was in the crumpled wad of Washingtons I gave the cashire.So now she has it,or dose she?"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Today myself and 3 g's dropped and insane hour or 2 of b-ball (basketball) you know for the unhip. This blistering 2 hour marathon was in all forms splendid. I myself had one of the shittiest games in history, the bubbanator was ripping the court up with an unheard of fury. I think he may have took my advice and called upon the beast. He asked me for a better game and in return all I desire is free pizza for life, which in my case is all eternity. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhahahahhahahahha. Ok that was just a little uncalled for. I do belive when it comes time for my departure from this earth, and I'm at the gates to be judged by that guy who dose all the judging..his name has temporarily slipped my mind. When it's my turn he'll see my name and automatically replay every instance when I in some shape or form had joked about or around either myself or an aquaintence of mine being satan. He will refresh every moment when I said something to either glorify or encourage the use of evil to get what you want. All of these things are all done in fun, and petty attempts at making myself seem comical. I can only hope that the   urlLink ALMIGHTY  will see fit to forgive and forget. (crossing my fingers at this point). Back to the story, these games took place at the only place in town that has nets on the rims, a little place known as.................................some middle school I forget the name. All I do know is that the mascot of this school is the mighty mighty MOOSE. The night air was dry and hot as any day in the gosh darned sahara. Any type of breeze or gust of wind was nonexistant. So as you might know the sweat and bodily funk was rampant. So as the story goes all good things must come to an end, off to the running bear for cold refreshments and hot chick lookout. The refreshments were easy to come by, but the girls were not."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"This weekend has been a strange one.Nothing obscure or grief ridden,just strange. I have found myself  recently having the power of seeing through peoples happy, carefree, and other wise insightful facades. I can really see what people are feeling.They're not fooling me. The thoughts of giving up something so important for hopes for a great future show through on some. The feeling of being left behind and not knowing what the future holds for the both shows through. The thoughts of passed nights arguments and drunken words of betrayal and the true feelings of a trustworthy friend. I see them all, I know what these people are feeling and thinking. It's a clever trick to try and hide behind the face of grace and laughter. I have been the master of this skill for a many year. I know that at sometime someone was given the gift of insight, and they saw through my tricks and unloaded the same conclusion. Do I still have this wall of silence in front of me? In lesser terms I would say. Some days the wall is an impenetrable force only I can let down. Others its unlike a pain of glass easily broken and easily fixed. The only thing I have not been able to figure out is how to remedy these affections. Maybe that's the twist. Maybe its not for us to figure out."

The longer life is definitely due to all the love & attention we've bestowed upon him in the last 2 months.  And of course, the cake I made for him, the roast I crock-potted for him, & the beer I tricked him into drinking!

01L3YY2,female,27,"I remember thinking as I saw airplanes in the sky how ""weird"" it would be to see it suddenly crash. After 9/11 it doesn't seem that weird.  This leads me to the dream I had last night. I was living in our old blue two story house on Rising Hill Drive, chilling in the back yard when I saw a low flying plane. Okay, keep in mind this is a dream, one of mine no less, but on one of the wings there was this lady filming something with her video camera. The plane flew around, came back & crashed into the house next to ours. Apparently the plane ran out of fuel, which is why there was no explosion & the only house that had any damage was the house that got hit."

They had to have, I was shaking that much. They didn't say anything, thankfully, if they did. Thing is, I talked to them after the game & everything was fine, no body spasms, temperature went up again, but that's because it was hot in the office, but my voice stayed normal. Yeah, go figure. Sometimes I'm confused by myself. Once I figure out me, then I'll be able to move on to the opposite sex.

I watched TV for a bit, then decided sleep was a better activity. I was awaken around 10:45 PM to huge gust of wind & a stuffed up head & I might add, I was a little delusional (I was talking to myself.) I went downstairs to fiddle on the computer for a bit, see if Chuck wanted out, (of course he didn't) see if CJ was home & then headed back upstairs to bed. I was in & out of consciousness till about 1:00 AM, & thinking about things only a delusional person would think about.   At around that time the power went out. Most of the time the power goes out I have no idea, but this time, the entire neighborhood knew, because the electrical fuse or transistor, or whatever it is that sits on top of the telephone pole, blew, not once, but twice, causing a flash of light. I seriously thought we were under attack. (Remember I was a bit delusional.) I alerted the borough & when I hung up, it sparked, exploded, whatever, again. If I was cold before this, I wasn't anymore, I was sweating. (My adrenaline was pumping because I thought we were under attack.) The cops came by, checked things out & left. A little while later, there was a truck next to the transistor thing so I assume it was Duquesne Light fixing it. The power came on about 2. It flickered on & off once more & that's when I gave up on listening to music.   This morning, the wind was still gusting, as I headed down to the bus stop all bundled up. Before I left I turned on the local new & Ms. Bologna said it was 40 out, but because of the wind it felt like 28. It started snowing by the time I got to my destination & get this, while I was waiting for the bus & as the snow started coming down hard I heard a crack of thunder & then saw a flash of lightening! I've never known it to thunder & lighten in the winter.   Right now it's still windy, but I can see bright blue sky amongst the big white billowing clouds. All signs of our little snow storm have dissipated."

The events leading up to my second up by far was the most interesting.  I followed Dave, our pitcher who got M.V.P. last time. He got a base run & when he tag the base, he landed on the corner of it & his ankle bent in a way it shouldn't. It was quite disgusting & his face was so pasty white. He left in an ambulance. That was what I had to follow. I at this point decided I really didn't want to run & tag first base & I opted to walk. I eventually went home.  We lost our pitcher & really didn't have a second one, so our ""coach"" stepped up. We did very well the next couple of innings, then we lost it. Final score: 10-11.  I played second base for half the game & got someone out. Then I got to play right field.  My little brother attended! He saw Dave's ankle, not sure if he saw, or was interested, in the rest of the game, but I was happy he came.    Update :  Dave broke his ankle in two places.

01L3YY2,female,27,"Vanessa was adopted & brought to the United States from Honduras. I had know of her for a couple of years, through mutual friends, but it wasn't until the sixth grade that we were able to become friends, we had gone to different school up until then.  Vanessa's parents owned a horse ranch with quite a number of horses. At one time there were rumors to be around 80. Her chores daily chores consisted of riding the horses. She wasn't an only child, she had a brother & sister, but she was the only child living at home. At times I think the only reason she was adopted was to help around the ranch.  Because of her schedule, she wasn't allowed to socialize much. We talked on the phone often, but when it came to birthday parties, she'd be invited, but we all knew she wouldn't come. I think in the many years she lived in Temecula she may have gone to one party.  She was always the fasted girl in PE, which contributed to her getting a college scholarship in cross country. She hated her middle name, but we all loved it, Alexis, sounded like royalty. One of our field trips was to Tijuana Mexico & she thought for sure that she wouldn't be allowed to cross back over the border, so at times she would hide behind someone, if a Mexican Policeman walked by.  Her family moved to Weatherford Texas before high school. We corresponded on occasion, but that slowed down.  The summer before my freshman year at college I was on some boring church youth group activity & got to talking with one of the other girls. Somehow we got on the subject of Vanessa & she nonchalantly said, you know she was killed in a car accident. Surely you jest? I thought that because, it appeared as though this girl had a smile on her face. I learned later that she wasn't.  Vanessa had been driving when a dog ran into the road. She swerved to avoid hitting it & crashed into a tree. That's all I know.

So I had to get a new floppy, try to fix the problem unsucessfully with the CDRW, etc etc. I wont be on the next few days either as I have to work out the optimum method of networking my dads 30+ pcs which includes PIII500s, P4 1.4s, P4 1.7s, 2.4, 2.8, and many more, some on linux (different versions), some on windows 2k, some on XP!!!And then I have to build my dads new PC when it comes, which is good :) At the moment, the deadline is far too unreasonable for me, sorry folks, though if you really want, I'll send you what I have.

Testing...1...2...3  Right, the name ""Blog"" is about as random as this post is. The term, ""Blog"" generally makes me think of a mess, in particular mashed potatoes. This is *probably* what this blog is about, mashed potatoes, perhaps some of the games Black Ghost is making will include a mashed potatoe fight.  But I shall be writing articles, possibly reviews if James can get a decent flash game/movie up :P. Oh, and RPG designing, my specialty, ripping gfx from other games. Oh, and surfing the large large net for useful things to add to the site.

MTVR25Q,male,15,"Got a chance to post before I go and play footie with some friends. For the site, I ask Beckett to send me all the .html files in a zip to my gmail, I want to make a few minor changes, such as font consistency, parts of the writing, and some other shit. Dont expect it returned soon, though, maybe in 1 or 2 days maybe. I'll spend 5 minutes a day trying to fix that all up. Also, all the PCs are the QUB computational PCs my dad has, and he has decided to replace his old networking/try out a new one, with a new switch, so he told me (phoned from China) to look at possible configs. I also decided to reformat the other old athlon 600 pc and install a fresh copy of XP for no reason.   Anyways, theres a slight problem with the forum business. The forum was suppose to be for all 3 sites,  dragon-tail.tk, blackghoststudios.tk  and  dbeckett.co.uk , so it cant be just called "" Black Ghost Studios Forum "". It has to be for a name for all three sites' forum. Maybe like "" 3Fusion "" and the motto "" Synthesis of Dragontail's Lair dbeckett.co.uk Black Ghost Studios "" or something like that. Go to our current forum mentioned by Beckett below and post ideas. I also think if we combine the news/improvements/general talk section of all three sites into each main section, so instead of 3 news, 3 general talk, etc, we have 1 news, 1 general talk, etc and each section is for all 3 sites then we can get more posts in each section, thus making it more busy than each seperate one. Get me? Anyways, the forum needs to be split into boards and sub-boards like the following:    News ->  Whats new?, Future updates  General ->  General chat, Flameyard (ie spam can, no rulez), Recycle Bin (ie, all moved topics gets put into here temporarily)  3Fusion chat ->  Suggestions 'n' Comments, Content (talk about content, ie flash, games etc), Affiliation (sorta like where ppl post to affiliate)  What do yers think? Anyway, I'll email fish now for the forum and the extra webspace in a new account for ""bgs"" with a password which i will send to you via email. I'll ask for 200MB (which is well enough, considering an avg flash anim is around 1-2MB, thats like 200/10 anims), and I'll pay him a fiver for that and the new forum, if he is a bit unhappy. Unless you are all meanies, everyone pays a measily 50p and I'll pay £3.50, in the senario. actaully, I'll email him when I get back. Easier.

(I hope I won't get sued for this :/ )  Global Positioning Satellites are so cool that they reinforce one's belief in God. If one chip can communicate with 3 satellites that are orbiting the earth to tell you where - within 18 inches - your teenage daughter is and how fast - within a tenth of a foot per hour - her boyfriend is coming on to her, then all this stuff about sparrows falling out of trees and God in heaven being aware of it is probably true. Certainly its technically possible.

So it screamed some more. So I ignored it. And then my dad got out of bed to deal with him in it's usual grumpy fashion, after I had been distracted for 5 minutes : 2. James - If you are going to use French to get cross with me, at least use proper, gramatically correct French. ""Tu comprends"" - OK?  I'm going to stop ranting now.

MTVR25Q,male,15,"Just back from the caravan at Portballintrae. It was TIRING. Anyway, a brief synopsis and observations:   1) The sea  - Jesus, the sea is COLD. Even in a wetsuit!  2 ) Balance  - Balance is a wonderful possession, it's just that neither I nor my dad possess it. First of all, I, following the lead of others making fools of themselves, took a running jump from the harbour to land on the board. I landed on it, but not only did it tip over (like it did for everyone else) but it flipped up and hit me on the head :S Great. Then, on the donut with my dad behind the speedboat (great fun at 25 mph), my dad gets his toes stuck in the water and flies of the donut. Now, what happens to me sitting on one side of the donut if I suddenly lose 85kg from the other side? Splash. Great.   3) Sherbet straws  - I don't get how 340 sherbet straws can bring so much happiness to the lives of 3 12-year-olds.   4) Water pistols  - Long story short, girl with water pistol - with 5 nozzles, person annoying her. She shoots. She hits him with the right 3. Guess who's standing beside him...and where the other two went. :S   5) Random people  - The cousin of the person who owns the caravan 2 across for the one I was staying in was up to visit. Apparently she's in my year at Methody, yet we didn't recognise each other. Strange.   6) School of Rock  - We watched this last night. Is quite funny, especially James as the role of Laurence the keyboard player - ""now is not a time for reading Laurence, now is the time for rocking"" - hehehe. Bloody annoying Chinese subtitles on it though - why do they have random English characters in it though?  That was my weekend in a nutshell.  Simon - Don't laugh at me, don't look away (Keane)"

Anyway, if you should ever be in need of a good book, especially if its Science Fiction (note I didn't use Sci-Fi *shudders* evil term...) then Wydham will not disappoint...

The night before everyone in the world had gone out to witness a brilliant meteor shower display, but the green light had a strange effect on the eyes, the population had been blinded... If this wasn't enough, the mysterious plants known as triffids had flourished in the lack of human intervention, before, the strange carnivorous plants with the ability to move were just curiosities... now they were overrunning the country feasting on the vulnerable populace...

144R35I,female,24,"I think about what life would be like if one event was different.  I wonder how many times what I thought was a simple choice could have been a life changing moment, like in 'Sliding Doors'.  What if I had stayed in Tokyo instead of moving to Nassau?  Well, I might not have developed my love for chocolate men...hmm, that would suck.  But maybe I would have actually gone somewhere with that mini-modelling thing.  I would have been fluent in Japanese...maybe I would have had a completely different career.  I know I would have been more independent.  How would my personality differ?  I'd probably have a funny accent when I spoke English.  I'd probably be skinny and wouldn't even know about Dr. Atkins.  I'd probably really like cuttlefish.  What if I had gone to high school in Nassau and not moved to TX until college?  I'd have a weird accent, but I'd probably have gotten more ass in college because of it.    What if I had gone to G-town instead of UT?  I can't imagine not being a Horns fan, but how would I have been different?  Chocolate city...mmm.  What if I made a big mistake by taking this job and not going on the campaign trail?  I would have met more people, seen more things, and done something important.  I mean, I love my job.  I love that I'm learning so much.  I love the women I work with.  Most of all, I love the days I get to go to the Senate, because Senate cops and security people are hot as shit.    I'm feeling restless.  One of the reasons I turned down the campaign job was because I wanted some sort of stability for awhile.  I've moved 5 times in the last 2 years.  I don't want to leave again.  I think being so far away from Mummy's body is starting to get to me.  I can't wait to be home and visit her.  I know she's always with me, and every morning I wake up and see her smiling face, but god damnit, it's not the same.  No more phone calls for ridiculous reasons.  No more 'happy birthday' calls from wherever she is at the time.  No more cuddling.  No more 'elbow game'.  No more arguments.  No more 'aerobics'.  No more homemade chinese food.  No more advice.  No more silliness.    It's like a wound that scabs over, but won't ever heal.    I always believe that things happen for a reason, but that you don't fully understand why until way later.  I don't believe in fate, because of free will.  If it's fated, then you don't have responsibility for or control over anything.    I just wonder when I'll realize what ridiculous reason God had for taking away the most important person in my life."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"I speak Spanish. Not very well or anything but enough to communicate. When I was in Costa Rica this summer, I stayed for part of my time, with a family that spoke no English. It was great. I understood almost everything that happened, as long as they didn't speed up and go super fast.  But there was this girl on my team. We'll call her Jessie. (I like the name Jessie). Anyway, Jessie is a really nice girl, she's very pretty, and she wears all the right clothes and she says all the right things, quite unlike me. There's this boy in Costa Rica named Minor. Minor is practically in love with Jessie. At least, when ever we're down there, or his church sends a group up here, all they do is talk and flirt and hang out together.  Which you are obviously thinking, would be very hard to do if she didn't speak spanish or he didn't speak English. Yeah, that would be it. Jessie speaks Spanish to. I think I'm just as good as her, I just don't really like speaking in Spanish because I don't want to mess up. Totally natural, I mean they don't like speaking English for the same reason.  But Jessie likes to speak Spanish. Or at least, she does it every chance she gets. I used to think she was just showing off. I don't know about that anymore. Maybe she's just like me and she thinks it sounds so much prettier than English. Anyway, everyone always treats her like the expert on Spanish, which bothers me cause I'm just as good but I'm like last choice as a translator.  On the trip I had a really hard time with that. See I went down before my team and everything was going great but it was hard when Jessie came down cause I felt like all the people who had been talking to me were suddenly flocking to her in preference of her company to mine. So I got really jealous. I had a hard time not bad mouthing her and trashing her behind her badk. I did it once and my friend (we'll call him Will) got all mad at me cause he likes Jessie. And we were on a prayer walk and we're supposed to be praying, so guess what he does? He starts praying that God would heal my bitterness towards Jessie. MY BITTERNESS? He had no idea what he was talking about, and he was so doing it just to annoy me.  That's not my point though. See I've been okay for awhile with Jessie speaking good spanish. I think it's because I have a Costa Rican who likes me and he payed attetnion to me and talked to me and said I speak Spanish very well. I think that's all I needed, just a little self esteem booster and now I have more confidence. My point was that Will was writing an email to Minor and he was all 'oh yea it's in English (cause he speaks french) except I signed it ""en l'amor de Jesuchristo""' and I was all 'l'amor'?? because if you speak spanish you know that is not a word. And he goes ""yea it means in the love of Christ""  Wow. Thank you Captain I'm a Mean Person (but he's being nice now so I can't say anything too bad, because he usually isn't like that). But it kinda hurt and then it totally made me think of Jessie and I was like, 'he wouldn't have said that to her' So then I was in a bad mood for a while.  But I'm doing better now that I've shared that with you all. So if you wouldn't mind praying about that for me though. Cause I'm worried about when the Ticos come up here, I don't want to get all mad and jealous again. You know? Cause that's not who I want to be."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"I just found this really interesting website (all thanks to Sarah, I might add). The guy on there calls himself Jesus. I could totally understand that if he was latin or something, but I'm thinking he's not. Although, I could be wrong... but for my sake I'm going to assume he was being a moron who thought he was funny.   I clicked on his website after looking through people who have the same interests as me on their profiles. I thought it looked interesting because he had both Christianity and Atheism listed as interests side by side. Oh it was interesting all right. I just want to clarify a few things that he said about Christianity. I just want to point out what was right and what was wrong, in case any of you ever see it, you'll know.   And he isn't a Christian, so I think I'm a bit more of an expert on our beliefs. But hey, you don't have to believe me. It's your brain. It's your own screwed up twisted and brainwashed mind, don't let me tell you what to think.   He said that Christians believe homosexuality is wrong. Welcome to biggest problem in America 101. It is. For a Christian to walk around saying that being gay is okay, and then claim to know God's laws and commands is impossible. That person is a liar. Mentira. They obvoiusly have not read Leviticus. If you are a Christian, I'm talking to you.  Being gay is a sin. I don't think of it any differently than lying, because in God's eyes, sin is sin, there's no difference between lying and murdering. It's a hard concept to grasp, but it's the truth. So I don't freak out about homosexuals. I think it's kinda gross, just because I could never look at a girl that way, but I'm not going to walk around my school and tell people to turn for homosexuality or burn in hell. If that was the case, I would be burning in hell for all the times I'm disrespectful. Thankfully I've got Jesus to pull me out of that.   If you don't believe me that being gay is a sin according to God, well I'm not the one who came up with it.  ""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable"" (Leviticus 18:22) If you don't take the Bible seriously, and you don't believe that what it says is word for word the absolute truth, well honey you need to get a life. Estupido nika. (AY! lo siento) So it says right there that it's a sin, just like lying or cheating, although the consequences are greater.   Then this 'jesus' guy said that Jesus (as in Jesucristo) can save you from homosexuality. Well yea, that's true. Because Jesus saves us from our sin. He saves me from my lying, my cheating, my disrespectful attitude, my cussing, bla bla bla. So since homosexuality is just another sin, he saves you from that, and helps you to turn to God and the right way. In this case, heterosexuality would be the right way; God's way. In my case, using my mouth to be nice and encouraging rather than making fun of people would be God's way.   It's just sin guys. It's a little more visible, that's why some people are so bothered by it. But it's just sin. Hate the sin, love the sinner. Becuase if you don't love the sinner, how will he see Jesus in you? If a man says he loves God and yet hates his brother, he's a liar! God is love, we should be, too.   That's it in a nutshell. That was the one that really bothered me. I just wanted to set the record straight with everything that's going on in the country. How could I let someone tell the world what I  believe, and yet be totally wrong about all of it? I had to tell you myself. I just wanted you to know. Becuase this guy 'jesus' doesn't know what he's talking about. But my Jesus does. My Jesus always knows what he's talking about. Because my Jesus is the truth.     (Almost forgot, I'm really sorry if I keep saying stuff in Spanish. I even did it at Master Drive today. I don't know what's wrong with me.)"
DRT3HYS,female,16,"(For those of you who didn't know, I wrote an article against gay marriage and homosexuality in general for my school's newspaper. It was published in April, obviously during the school year. I am no longer on the newspaper staff, thank God. I'm just glad that I got the article out there for people to read and think about. A lot of the stuff under this is stuff I wanted to write in that article but knew the editor would never let it be published.)  I have been thinking about this for a while now, and it is time for me to go off. I have a friend (and yes, for future reference, we are actually very good friends, although it is beyond me how that came about because we are so different in what we believe) who is ""homosexual."" We argue about this issue frequently. He sometimes says that ""God is an invention of people in power to keep the people they wanted to control in check."" He tells me this almost as often as he tells me that the only reason I think ""homosexuality"" is wrong is because I have been told that by my parents who were told that by their parents who were told that by  their  parents, and so on and so forth until you get to some silly, old-fashioned, close-minded priest* somewhere who had somehow gotten the idea in his head that oh my goodness, ""HOMOSEXUALITY"" IS A SIN. Well, it is, if you take the Bible at face value, which you should. (Read Genesis 2:24 to see what God says a family should consist of and Romans 1:26-27 to see where God says that ""homosexuality"" is not natural.) But my friend doesn't like hearing that someone out there isn't afraid to disagree with him.   The reason I put the word ""homosexual"" in quotes is because personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as ""homosexuality."" There are no ""homosexuals."" This is because ""homosexuality"" is NOT something you are ""born with"" and it's not something you can't change. Sexual orientation isn't determined by your genes or an unbalance of chemicals or   The whole idea of more than one sexual orientation in the first place is something that was created by man to justify their actions. Different people have different stumbling blocks - some lie to get out of whatever trouble they've gotten into, some are kleptomaniacs, some succumb to the temptation to look at or watch pornography, and some gravitate towards members of their own gender on a romantic level and say ""it's natural.""  A ""homosexual"" is (and this will sound harsh) just another word for someone who is living completely in sin... much like a drug addict or even a murderer. Now don't get me wrong, I am in NO WAY calling people living ""homosexual"" lifestyles druggies or murderers. There are definitely some relatively ""good"" people who call themselves ""homosexuals"", I can attest to that. As many times as my friend who is ""homosexual"" threatens to run me or other people who occasionally irritate him over in the parking lot with his car, I know he won't. But murderers and druggies can change the way they are living their lives in the same way that anyone else can stop giving into the sinful nature of their humanity. I'm no better than anyone who says they are ""homosexual"". The only difference is that I have given my life to Jesus Christ, and through him I am rescued from any sinful desires I may have... and believe me, just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean it's any easier to resist them. But at least I can know for sure that God will provide a way to escape the temptations so that I can stand up under them. (1 Cor. 10:13) People who don't have that relationship don't have the ability to stop living in sin and are going to try their very best to convince everyone that their favorite kind of sin is a perfectly normal thing.   ""Homosexual"" activists constantly argue that ""if God says we should love one another, then why don't you? God loves me the way I am, he made me this way!"" First of all, yes. God loves you. God loves you so much that he gave his only Son to die for you. Don't ask me why, we're really special to him for some reason that I will never fully understand. But think of it this way. Your parents love you, right? But if they find out you're shooting heroin in your closet, they aren't going to be too happy. If they're good parents, they're going to try and get you into rehab and to get you to kick the habit. It's sort of like that with God. He loves you more than anything, and yeah, he will take you as you are if you're willing to come to him and worship him, but he doesn't want you to keep living in sin. Jesus didn't die on the cross so you can say ""wheeee, God loves me, now I'm going to do whatever I want because it's the way I am."" Yeah, it's the way you are, but you DON'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY, and if you don't want to change then you haven't really understood what it means to be a Christian. Jesus died on the cross so that you can have a way to escape your sin nature. He doesn't WANT you to keep living in sin. And he clearly defines what sin is in the Bible, so you can't get away with anything. He's going to forgive you if you ask him to, but if you just go and do whatever you want because you know you'll be forgiven, you are abusing his amazing grace. If you truly and honestly love the Lord, you will strive to obey him and please him. People who are not truly walking with the Lord should not be able to get away with saying ""God loves me the way I am."" God loves you the way he created you, and he created you to worship and love him. If you're not doing that, you are instead dishonoring God's intentions for your body. What ""homosexuals"" do is not what God intended for them, therefore the argument that ""God loves them the way they are"" does not apply.   Because some ""homosexuals"" are Christians who have fallen for the worldly lie that says they are ""born that way,"" the rest of the ""homosexual"" community believes oh, well THOSE must be the real Christians, because they love us for who we are. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves. The truth is so rarely heard anymore and frankly, I'm tired of being the only one defending what the  real  real Christians believe to my ""homosexual"" friend. We got in an argument during my science class one day and we were practically screaming at each other by the end of it, and all the other Christians in the room that I knew were listening were just sitting idly by, watching and listening. Maybe they thought I could handle it, but still, some support would have been nice. Or maybe they were afraid he was going to cuss them out, which could very well have happened. It happened to me practically every day. The world has been trying to get Christians to shut up for forever. There is always someone out there who is going to throw everything they've got at you. Get over it. It comes with the territory (John 15:17-19). There are worse things than being ridiculed for believing in God. Like, all your friends going to hell, for example. Keep that in mind.   *I'm not Catholic, but some of my ancestors could very well have been. My dad has researched our family tree for as long as I can remember, it's sort of a hobby. We're not Mormon either and he's not looking for names to baptize into the church. I think we had some Mormon ancestors though. This has been your useless Sarah trivia of the day."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"""O My beloved, abide under the shelter of the lattice for I have betrothed you to Myself, and though you are sometimes indifferent toward Me, My love for you is at all times as a flame of fire.""     This is the first sentence of the book  Come Away My Beloved  by Frances J. Roberts. When I read it, I almost started crying. Everyone's always told me that God knows exactly what I'm going through in every situation because he lived on the Earth and went through the whole human experience firsthand. But in my ignorance, I always sort of doubted somewhere in my mind that he knew what it was like to feel unrequited love, to know what it's like to be rejected by the object of your affection for whatever reason. Looking at it now it seems so  stupid.  Of  course  he knows what that's like. I do it to him  all the time.  We  all  do. He loves every single one of us so intimately and so dearly, but half the time we're off doing our own thing in our own little world. He loved us so much that he  died  for us, and any pain I ever went through because of a guy not liking me back is absolutely insignificant compared to the pain that Jesus goes through every single time we turn away from him, indifferent.     He  knows."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"By Dale Buss  ""When I'm teaching Sunday school, I'm encouraged by what I hear from the teenagers at my evangelical Christian church in suburban Detroit. They seem to understand - and, more important, to believe - the bedrock tenets that will help them hew to orthodoxy throughout their lives and make them salt and light in the world.  But the hard numbers say otherwise. It turns out that, while they may profess the faith and indeed love Jesus, the vast majority of Christian teenagers in this country actually hold beliefs fundamentally antithetical to the creed. The forces of moral relativism and 'tolerance' have gotten to them in a big way. In fact, some leaders believe that mushy doctrine among the younger generation ranks as the No. 1 crisis facing American Christendom today.  About one-third of American teenagers claim they're 'born again' believers, according to data gathered over the past few years by Barna Research Group, the gold standard in data about the U.S. Protestant church, and 88% of teens say they are Christians. About 60% believe that 'the Bible is totally accurate in all of its teachings.' And 56% feel that their religious faith is very important in their life.  Yet, Barna says, slightly more than half of all U.S. teens also believe that Jesus committed sins while he was on Earth. About 60% agree that enough good works will earn them a place in heaven, in part reflecting a Catholic view, but also flouting Protestantism's central theme of salvation only by grace. About two-thirds say that Satan is just a symbol of evil, not really a living being. Only 6% of all teens believe that there are moral absolutes--and, most troubling to evangelical leaders, only 9% of self-described born-again teens believe that moral truth is absolute.  'When you ask even Christian kids, ""How can you say A is true as well as B, which is the antithesis of A?,"" their typical response is, ""I'm not sure how it works, but it works for me,""' says George Barna, president of the Ventura, Calif.-based research company. 'It's personal, pragmatic and fairly superficial.'  ~~~  Some commentators produce even more startling statistics on the doctrinal drift of America's youth. Ninety-one percent of born-again teenagers surveyed a few years ago proclaimed that there is no such thing as absolute truth, says the Rev. Josh McDowell, a Dallas-based evangelist and author. More alarmingly, that number had risen quickly and steadily from just 52% of committed Christian kids in 1992 who denied the existence of absolute truth. A slight majority of professing Christian kids, Mr. McDowell says, also now say that the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ never occurred. 'There's a greater disconnect now than ever in the history of the church in America between what a Christian young person says they are and what they actually believe,' says Mr. McDowell, who has ministered mainly to youth for more than 30 years. 'Christianity is based on truth; Jesus said, ""I am the truth."" But you have an overwhelming majority even of Christian kids saying there is no absolute truth.'  Catholics have noticed the trend as well. A few weeks ago, in fact, Pope John Paul II specifically warned several U.S. bishops about the 'soulless vision of life' that seemed to be overtaking America, urging them to 'confront directly the widespread spirit of agnosticism and relativism which has cast doubt on reason's ability to know the truth,' especially among youth.  Indeed, the consequences of this theological implosion now pervade the thoughts and actions of believing teenagers, following the moral breakdown of the broader American culture. Here's one practical example: Only 10% of Christian teens believe that music piracy is morally wrong, according to a recent Barna survey, not all that different from the 6% of their non-Christian peers who feel the same way.  Then extrapolate the situation to other possible big-picture results. Nearly 60% of evangelical Christian teenagers now say that all religious faiths teach equally valid truths, according to Mr. McDowell. It's bad enough that they seem to have been co-opted by relativism from within our culture and even from within the church and family. But it's even more disconcerting to realize that  we're relying on this generation for the future defense of Judeo-Christian civilization  against the highly motivated forces of militant Islam.  Perhaps it's counterintuitive to believe this problem is as severe as that outlined by Messrs. Barna and McDowell. After all, we're told that spirituality is de rigueur among youths these days and that Christianity is right up there. But this zeitgeist largely reflects a pseudo-faith that is fed by a steady diet of pop-culture feints, from the allegorical 'Lord of the Rings' movies to the T-shirt that recently adorned Pamela Anderson saying, 'Jesus is my homeboy.'  The kids in my Sunday School class really do understand that. It's their peers I'm worried about.""  ~  Hey guys. Let's try to not give them reason to worry."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"Ever since I've gotten home from my month in Costa Rica I've felt this weird desire to just tell people what they need to hear. I was at Master Drive today and we watched this movie where a whole bunch of people died in a car accident. They were all teenagers, and they interviewed the parents, and it was so hard for me to watch. I just wished that I could have told those people about Jesus and how much he loves them.  I guess that's why I decided to start a website with out my parent's permission. I still plan on asking them, since after all I do live under their roof currently and they do buy my groceries and pay for everything, and they're going to pay for college in a few years.  But I kinda saw the internet as a free for all. You know? Some place where I could express my beliefs and someone might actually see them. Some place where my opinions and beliefs weren't being expressed in action, like they are day to day, and it wouldn't be like I was pushing my beliefs onto someone else. Because after all, it is your choice to be reading this.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against being open with my beliefs, my relationship with Jesus. I do it all the time. I just told my friend everything I believe the other night, and she was nice and listened and even asked questions, maybe she was actually interested. It's just that I'm tired of being yelled at for being narrow minded and judgemental. I think I'll still get that on the internet, but at least here, it is your fault to. You are the one reading it.  So be prepared. Because that's what my title is. That's what the address is for goodness sake. All the nails. Everytime I sin, it's another nail in Jesus's body. The title is from a Jars of Clay song called Worlds Apart. It's kinda become my motto since I got back from Costa Rica. I think it always will be.  So be prepared. Because I will be biased, I will be narrow minded. And I will tell you everything I believe; because I want you to hear the truth.  that is of course, if I talk my dad into letting me keep this."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"I got up this morning all ready for a stressful day, because it will be. I jumped out of bed, pulled on some of Josh's old gym shorts and ran across the street to water the neighbor's flowers and feed the cats. It was like 9:45. Then I came home, had coconut cream pie for breakfast and watched Saved By the Bell reruns. After that I took my shower, and then ten minutes later I was ready for whatever may come today. Yet, for some reason, I wasn't as frustrated as I was last night. And good ol' unorganized me sat down to make a list of my things to do today:  lay out clothes for packing hair cut ortho appt. discipleship with Daniella clean room clean bathroom meet for dance team (early with derek) FIND COSTUME FOR DANCE TEAM  The last one has been a major problem and issue of stress since about 7:30 last night. Ashley was supposed to find us costumes, I mean, honestly, I trusted her with my waist size... and then yesterday she told me that I was going to have to figure my costume out on my own. I wanted to lean over the bus seat and be like ""oh, and when exactly do you expect me to do that eh? Saturday I have to pack, and I'm busy from 2-10 and Friday I'm spending with my family and Sunday I have to spend with God so I don't freak out in Costa Rica (since, if you don't recall, I will be down there for a MONTH!) and tomorrow I have cleaning to do! would have been nice if you could have given me some more notice."" But you know me, I didn't say anything.   And I got up this morning expecting to run around like a little chic with her head cut off.

I asked the guy who led it a billion times, what are the dates, he FINALLY got me the dates and I said okay.  Then about the beginning of Summer I realized that I did not have time for this trip, so I have been calling him for hmmm may 18th or so trying to tell him ""Hey, I can't go!"" because the trip is about 11 days, which is fine because then someone else could just take my spot.  I left about 5 messages on his phone saying ""Hey call me!""  and he ignores them and then goes on vacation for 2 weeks and finally i get a hold of him today and he tells me that there is a meeting tomorrow, oh but not only that, but he is adding an extra day so it is now 12 days and I have to miss the photo party.  I want to tell him, ""well that is too bad, I can't go because I have a previous arrangement for teh night of the 16th"", oh did I mention that I have only paid 100 out of 450 dollars for the trip because I couldn't get a hold of him.  I want to say ""Too bad I am not paying, get someone else to go!"" but my dad would be mad because then I would make the guy angry and he might be on my eagle board of review, which is unlikely but possible, nd my dad doesn't want to be rude. (which is unusual because most of the time he wouldn't care and if it was anything but scouts he probably wouldn't) so now I am stuck going on a trip that I really don't want to go on for 12 days and then I have another trip after that and I am left with 14 days of summer in which I am home. gggggggrrrrrrrr. I rarely (like maybe 4 times a year)get angry but I am right now. I am missing so much more, it is not even just the photo party, I am missing a ton of stuff even when my friend from Rhode Island is leaves, and this is the last time she will come to colorado.

DRT3HYS,female,16,"Last night they had a comedian at church. My parents dragged me to it, but hey, the free dessert was awesome! But he said something last night about Unity in the church. I thought, finally someone who agrees with me! I've wanted a pulpit to preach from quite a few times. It's always about unity in the church.  It's so stupid to. I mean, why do I have to drive down University and see four or five churchs, and under their name is splayed ""lutheran church"" ""Evangelical"" ""Methodist"" I mean honestly.

""Ooo, I'm methodist, I can't talk to you southern baptist freaks."" I mean seriously, who does that?  I have to admit I used to be in on it to. I kept asking my parents what I was, and I finally managed to get it out of my mom, ""if you really want to label your beliefs, you're probably closest to a baptist"" But that ended in like eighth grade. I mean, why should I have to label my faith? I'm already a Christian, is there more to it than that?  I know there are differences between denominations. but that shouldn't separate us. Hello? We're Christians, we are apart of one body. How can a body be separated? If my eye pops out of my head, turns around and says 'hey, I'm apart of Sara's Body, but I'm also separate from everything else here, I'm Saran but I'm an eyeish-saran' don't you think that's going to hurt me? Like me in my basic self is not good enough for my eye!  I think that's how Jesus must feel. We were all the same back in Palestine. Yea, they had issues and doctrinal questions over things like circumsision and kosher. But they didn't separate and go, 'I'm a galilean Christian, are you a Jerusaleman Christian?' The few times that they did that, and started talking about who they followed (apollo, paul) Someone turned yelled at them and they got right back into line. I think Jesus sometimes must be sitting up there looking at us fighting over stupid things that don't even matter, and I think he's saying something like *sigh* 'my children, I love them to death, but they can be so stupid! Don't they understand anything? I died for them so that they could be one with me, and one with eachother. Now they're screwing it up again over dumb things. Was my death not enough to hold them together? It's no wonder they aren't getting anything done! It's too bad they aren't like the Muslims who actually have their act together when it comes to unification. How can they expect to get anything done, if they're fighting all the time!? Hello???!!! I DIED FOR YOU! GET IT? THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT!!! Now just try to stop fighting and see me again? Please?'  Because that's what we're doing. We're fighting over stupid things. And when we can't agree, when we can't stop fighting, how do you expect us to move and share Jesus with everyone else? It's impossible!  And there shouldn't be anything to fight about. We have to come back to the basics, because that is what got us here in the first place. We have to come back to Jesus. His death and his resurrection. Beyond that, nothing matters. Because beyond that, nothing gets you to heaven. Nothing keeps you out of hell. Nothing is worth living for. Worth dying for.  If we all believe that, why are we fighting?"

DRT3HYS,female,16,"The other day, I was thinking about how sometimes I just feel like I try to be involved in youth group for no reason. I know, I know, I haven't been back from Costa Rica even a full week yet and I already started feeling the old familiar pity party starting back up again. I felt like nobody really cared because no one bothered to call me when some people were going to go see a movie. Really childish, yes, because I do know better. It wasn't one of my better moments; I felt like convincing myself that the world DID revolve around me, I WAS the center of the universe, everyone should care about ME, cater to MY needs because I'M the only one that matters or who has feelings or wants to be taken care of. But then I realized how retarded I was being and moved on to being depressed about other things that don't deserve to be discussed on this blog.  Anyway, my point is, what really made me stop being depressed and start contributing positive vibes to society again is I remembered that it's not about ME. I'll admit that I didn't read all of The Purpose-Driven Life, but I definitely read the first sentence, and that's what it is: It's not about YOU. There's more to life than not being invited to see a movie with some people, there's more to life than not seeing your friends when you want to or missing out on something you thought you were going to get to do. Who knows what kinds of things you could end up doing instead of what you planned? God's in control of EVERY situation, and even if it pisses you off at first, the only thing for it is to make the best of what you're stuck with. God doesn't switch things around because you throw a hissy fit and whine about it for hours. He's happy to listen to you, of course, but he wants you to trust him that he knows what's best for you. And right now I'm even trying to convince myself to do this, because it's not the easiest thing. I'm still having problems figuring a few things out, and remembering how to act when certain people are around. And yeah, I'm a little upset at the way things have been going for me, and the stuff I've been putting myself through by complicating things isn't too fun either. But God is in control. He knows what's best for me, and I will love what he's decided for me.   Even so, it's hard to remember. After all, I'm only human."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"Every Sunday I serve my time in God's army aboard a luxury aircraft carrier. We move slow and we are rarely anywhere close enough to shore to actually see any of the people we are out to liberate. We fly sorties such as Operation Short Term Missions, Operation School Curriculum, or Operation Beth Moore Conference. Most of us don't fly in these important missions, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying the prosperous life of a soldier. Our ship has plenty of activities - putting greens, a sports ministry, restaurants, and even a special 'fright house"" on Halloween! We don't get a lot of visitors from the outside - but thats the benefit of being on a mega-sized luxury aircraft carrier - there's enough people around to pack it in without noticing the lack of outsiders (besides - you can't let just anybody on a luxury aircraft carrier - there's a war on!). Critics may say its more a cruise ship than a battle ship, but who said soldiers had to be uncomfortabe? Nope. We are going to win this war - and win it in style. God help the S.S.

DRT3HYS,female,16,"Well. It was one month yesterday. Sitting on the plane looking out the window, it was weird. It seems like years ago that Suzie picked me up at the airport, but then, I can't believe that I am already at home and it's over.  God did a lot on that trip. I learned a lot about myself, how God works (or doesn't) and boys. Which I know is weird to learn about on a mission trip, but I really needed to.   It feels good to be home. I just can't believe it's over. I can't believe that I won't go to the church tonight and hear Kenneth say something about his nipples (how did that start again?) and the leaders won't stare at us becuse they don't know he meant dimples. It's so weird to think that I won't see Brian again, and I won't drive with that maniac for another year, and hello? I can't believe the tping with Mary Jo is over. I can't imagine not going to the church tonight, I can't imagine not seeing Connor tell Jose what he's doing wrong with the mime tonight.  I just can't believe it's over. What do I do now?"
DRT3HYS,female,16,"Why I am posting this, I could not tell you, but the computer doesn't seem sufficent enough.  I don't know why you would want to read this unless you were terribly horribly bored beyond any reason.  I am not venting because I am angry, I just want someone to hear.   Sometime this week I was driving home from seeing Anchorman with people in my car, which was okay with my parents.  Turning on a Venneford, a residential street from highlands ranch park way. I slowed down to turn left and so that my friends could wave by  (bad decision I know) well my friend who is at least 10 seconds behind doesn’t notice that I have slowed down and runs taps the back of my car.  I pull off left and she right and I could go into a huge description of what happen from then but we will just say that that she hit me and I was not happy but told my parents and got yelled and her parents agreed to pay she even said that it was all her fault.  I talked with my parents and we yelled and then got sad and we cried and everything was better. Saturday I think I went to Red Robin and that was fun but nothing too exciting unfortunately since Jessica had left.  While leaving the parking lot my friend got really sick and threw up in the grass.  Kate from RI had to drive Jessamyn’s car home (Kate only has a permit) I had to lead her home the safe way and she was going about 35 which is smart but took a while.  I don’t remember the rest of Saturday. What has happened, going from Sunday, I set my alarm for church but being the smart person that I am, I hit the off button, well I finally woke up about 9:10 or so, which for those of you who don’t go to my church, it started at 9.  I run around a drive over and arrive maybe about 9:35 or so, (half way through the service) right when worship was ending.  I the next part was listening to a sermon by the seniors, which I applaud, but (and no offense) is not as good as an intern or pastor, and are not expected to be that good.  I continued by going to the mall and walking around for a while.  My feet began to hurt and since it was around 1:45 or so I wanted to go home because I was bored and was not doing anything productive (no offense to anyone at the mall I was very tired).  I continued to go home and ask my parents if I could not go on the canoeing trip and got talked into it.  Monday woke up and started off okay, was planning on running but that didn’t happen, got called by Kate, my friend from Rhode Island.  Went over to the park about 1 or 2 or so and I stayed there for a while before I decided that I just needed to go somewhere else.  So I rode my bike (my brother had taken the car) over to Phil Fisher’s house because I knew him and Kevin Berry were over there playing video games. Well they were down in the basement so I went over to the Lauren Pagnard’s house (2 houses down) to ask if I could borrow the phone and call Phil and make sure that Lauren knew that she was invited to the park with Kate.  (Note: this is the girl who the previous week hit the back bumper of my car.)  I came in and it was her mother she laughed and joked and I borrowed the phone and told Phil to open the door. So he comes up and opens the door and I play counterstrike with them for a while. I go home and get ready for Scouts that night, I have a meeting with the Canoe trip people and that goes well except I had a huge headache and I really didn’t want to be there. Turns out at scouts the leadership was gone so it was free night, naturally I left and went over to Walgreens because Monday nights Kate Meek from church works there so I buy cards for friends, 1 for a sick friend, Jessamyn and 2 for another friend Sara.  I stood there for a while and wrote encouraging notes. Got home, and did nothing productive.  Tuesday I wake up and want to go running again but I have to make sure Shane wakes up for work so I play video games all morning then my dad says write your mission letter so I don’t because I smart like that.  Later I want to go hang out with Kate and my dad gets angry (note* my dad gets angry very quickly)(note*my peeve is when people get angry very quickly) he had the right to say no but he didn’t, thank you.  I went over to the park and hung out with Kate and friends then we went down to Teresa’s house and I watched the first 15 minutes of School Of Rock but I went home at 9 because my dad had called and said that there was an emergency.  Naturally I was concerned so I came home promptly at 9 thinking it was my grandpa or something.  Well my dad was on the phone and so was my mom and they didn’t seemed to worried, then 15 minutes later they sat me down and asked everything that had happened during the accident (going back to the beginning) I was confused as to why they were asking again.  They had told me that an anonymous letter had come in the mail about the accident.  I told them the story about how I had switched in to the left lane on Broadway in front of her and slowed quickly to turn on to highlands ranch parkway and how I had sped up to 55 at the max just because were teenagers (stupid decision and I am never speeding or racing ever again) and then told them that I slowed back down and stopped at the left turn off of highlands ranch onto venneford and waited for a car so that I could go and she would have to wait that way we would not egg each other on and she would not follow to closely, I continued to slow down was I had turned and she didn’t notice and tapped the back of my car, causing some damage which she said was her fault and she was soooo sorry. Well back to my parents and the letter, the letter had come and said (from the point of view of a student in the car) it was all my fault and Kate’s fault for wanting to slow down and I should be ashamed and was a horrible friend and Christian for not taking the blame and making Lauren (the other driver) pay. (Note: my mom has a degree in psychology and is extremely good with people and understanding them, I take after my mother in this and we are extremely good and discerning, in fact I think it is one of my mom’s spiritual gifts, it is impossible to lie to her.  My family is one of psychologists and you don’t try to deceive us, especially not my mother.)  My parents and I had a very long discussion and I got more lecturing, we then wondered who might have sent the letter and I deemed that most people in the cars would be too shy or to lazy to send a letter and only certain people knew the info in the letter.  I had narrowed it down to Jessamyn, but my mom being the genius that she is knew Lauren very well, and Ms. Pagnard (her mother) and wondered whether it was Ms. Pagnard who had sent it in order that she would only have to pay half the cost.  I thought it back and forth (and you should see me and my mom do this, it is really quite amazing how we only using psychology to do this and my dad sits in the middle dumbfounded while we are like detectives.  We narrowed it down to Jessamyn, Ms. Pagnard, or Lauren telling Teresa and Teresa writing a note (which I don’t think was very plausible so I didn’t consider it).  I was extremely hurt if it was Jessamyn because I did not want her to think those things about me since we have been friends for 12 years almost and I value that friendship a lot.  Wednesday I went over to her house around 9 am (she was leaving at 10 to go to Utah for Jr. Olympics for her sister) I gave her the get well card and asked her in her honest opinion if she though the accident was my fault.  I realized that night before I went to bed that it wasn’t Jessamyn because I remember her supporting me and she doesn’t write in cursive and that was how the letter was addressed.  She very strongly said no that it was all Lauren’s fault and that legal it was her fault and that I should not have to pay, I ask about the letter and she said it was horrible and that she did not write it. So if it wasn’t Jessamyn that left one other person Mrs. Pagnard.  She had written a letter saying mean things about me and saying it was my fault and acting like she was a student so that she would only have to pay half the costs.  We are pretending like the letter was never sent and continuing with them paying for the damages.  I was personally offended, well I get back and my dad flips because he wants the letters finished and so I write them and address I still need to send them.  I finished them so I went to brunch with a friend and had a talk with that person but it wasn’t a very happy one because they don’t me that life sucked and they hated living and that they were cutting themselves and that the medication to bring them out of depression wasn’t working (they goes to a shrink). I tried to encourage them and get them involved with a church or something but I am still afraid. I then came home and worked on packing for my canoe trip which I had all my stuff together but it wasn’t packed enough for my dad so he started yelling at me.  I then asked if I could go to the mall with Sara and Sarah and there was more yelling at me. So I packed and slept and then my mom got home and I was still angry with my dad so she got angry at me.  More yelling and arguing.  I then ate dinner, which went well because Brent and Shane were home.  I then got online and was talking people and I accidentally angered a friend (note: I hate IM because I am a person who deciphers most of what is being said by voice inflection and body language, it is the psychology thing I was talking about earlier.)  Connor kept on calling and I was talking to him but so much was going on I couldn’t keep track and I was trying to get over to his house but I first wanted to work out the problem with this friend.  I didn’t quite know what to say at first and I felt like a kept on rambling on.  Finally I got the impression that we were okay and I had to go (yes I did get the last few sentences but had to leave) I was already late by 30 minutes for Connor’s, but things went better because Ryan was there and I hadn’t seen either of them in a while, and we watched Bourne Identity. The only problem is that I have had a headache since about the conversation with my friend and over IM and it was only getting worse, I was afraid that I might get a migraine and have to be picked up.  I was supposed to be home by 11 and didn’t get home till 11:40 or so because the movie ran over, luckily my parents really don’t notice when I get home as long as I check in.  I came home and checked the blog and received a very touching apology, which I accept humbly.  I am now helping my brother pack for his camping trip and just told him about the accident and he just gave me another lecture.  It is now 1:36 on Thursday, I have no idea what I am suppose to do with this writing, I have just been talking to my computer for about and 1 ½ hours.  Maybe I will post it. Hey I still need to get those 2 cards from Monday to Sara before I leave. Good night."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"the big prank thing at my youthgroup is TPing. If you're liked you get TPed and if you want to have fun, you do it back.  Today I had my birthday party. We were supposed to go swimming but it rained and thundered. And we were going to have more people, but they're all either out of town, at Super Summer or recovering from jaw surgery. But it wasn't all that lame really.   Especially when we decided it would be fun to go tping. Pretty much everyone here tonight (all except one person) went to Costa Rica on our mission trip. And we thought it would be great to go tp our leaders' house. But since it's been raining my parents were like please just fork it. So we agreed to that. But then things got weird. Cause Wayne and Rexanne live far away from everyone and curfew and Austin couldn't drive me and then Brittany couldn't drive me home, although she could drive me there... Yea. So my mom was like why don't we not do this tonight. I went and whined a little, because hello? Everyone was together and it was perfect. So they let us go.   We didn't fork it cause we didn't have time to get forks. Not to mention Opie had 24 rolls of TP in his trunk and a launcher. So we tped it instead. Let me say, for them only having one tree and a couple bushes, an hour and 24 rolls, it was awesome. We chalked the driveway and left two cones. Cause you gotta leave the cones. And then Brittany hit the window with a roll and we took off down the street to get in the cars. On the way back we all honked and suddenly someone runs out into the road. It was Wayne. He jumps on the hood of our car and just sat there. But finally he got off and we left.   I got home and got yelled at for putting my parents on the spot. Then I got yelled at for TPing when I said it was just forking. Then I was told 'well I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it cause that will be your last time.' 'my last time this summer?' 'Ever. Until you move out and are 18 and can get caught by the cops without us being responsible'   I can't go TPing ever!!! I mean, I love my parents and I respect them and try to obey them cause that's what God calls all children to do. But I feel like sometimes i put up with some pretty lame rules from them. I can't see PG13 movies without approval. I can't drive with other teenage drivers (except for things like tonight). I won't get my license until I'm 17. I couldn't date or go to any dances until I was 16.   And now I can't go TPing. Maybe it's because I went forking once already this week. Maybe I shouldn't have whined when my mom said no. Maybe I didn't make myself clear on how much it meant to me when my dad said yes. Was I ungrateful? Uncaring? Surly? I love my parents but this is too much. Way too much."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"I found a blog somewhere that mentioned this article. The New York Times ran it. The headline was ""Lives; When One Is Enough."" Now, let's think about that. What could that possibly allude to? What's the first thing that came into YOUR head when you read it?   I'm guessing that probably what you thought was a little different than what it actually is about. I don't subscribe to the Times (and frankly I'm not planning on it) so when I went to the website I didn't have access to the article. But there was a summary of it that was just as appalling as the story itself:  ""The Lives column in The Times Magazine on July 18 gave a first-person account of the experience of Amy Richards, who had been pregnant with triplets and decided to abort two of the fetuses. Ms. Richards, who told her story to a freelance Times Magazine contributor, Amy Barrett, discussed her anxiety about having triplets, the procedure to terminate two of the pregnancies and the healthy baby she eventually delivered; she expressed no regret about her decision.""  How would you like to be that kid? Think about it. I don't know what would be worse - growing up knowing your siblings were murdered in your mother's womb right next to you or growing up NOT knowing and then finding out that your mother is the kind of person who would do that to some of her children and not all of them.

DRT3HYS,female,16,"Today I got mad at a really close friend of mine. My brother has this theory about how a woman's brain works. There's a three ring circus with four men. There's crying man, all he does is cry and cry, there's Skitzo, and when he's up, you can never understand what she's thinking. Then there's conspiracy theorist, and no matter what you say, if he's got the mike, she's going to think you're saying she's fat or ugly. The last guy is a midget. He's in a straight jacket and he's all black and blue because the others beat up on him so much. He's logic man. The trick to understanding, and communicating with a woman, is to know who has the mike.  all of today conspiracy theorist was in control in my head. And whenever Logic man tried to take it from him, he got bashed in the head with the mike. And instead of realizing it myself, I just went all out and ate this guy alive. Poor Austin had no idea he said anything. And he even apologized a million times and I wouldn't take it. Because Logic Man wasn't in control. I finally told him I was sorry for being a freak and being immature. But he didn't respond.  Maybe, just maybe he wised up and realized that maybe I'm not worth all the trouble I give him. In some ways, I hope he did (for his sake of course). But on the other hand, I want a second chance, to not be such a moron.  All I'm trying to say, and this is mainly for the girls, guys don't process things the way we do. I know you've heard that a million times. But trust me, I just figured it out today first hand. And it's an experience you don't want to have. So just know when they're joking. And if you want them to be serious, you kinda have to tell them. And when you're talking to someone online, be careful, because with out the tone of voice and facial expressions, it is really hard to understand what someone is saying. Be careful.

DRT3HYS,female,16,"Dramaboy57: I had planned on telling you guys tonight Dramaboy57: like right now twentyfour4skies: you're always drugged up and about to sleep... and about that, we're girls, we don't just go ""oh, okay, it's fine that you're doing something instead of hanging out with us like you said you would, we'll just go do something else then"" it is more like we sit around overanalyzing why you said that and it becomes ""oh my gosh he hates us, he doesn't want to hang out with us and thinks we are the most retarded people in the world"" twentyfour4skies: so... basically, it's just a good idea to tell us up front why you can't do something when you already said you would, or at least say you'll explain why later twentyfour4skies: instead of making up a million excuses twentyfour4skies: i'm not mad, but sara is kind of depressed since she's leaving on monday  twentyfour4skies: and wanted to hang out with the people she isn't going to see for a while. i.e., you and me and connor  Good to know that I have friends who understand me. Like Sarah. And thanks to Austin for letting me chew you out last night. I'll see you all tonight!  (Although, Connor never seems to be available...)"
DRT3HYS,female,16,"The four of us (Austin, Connor, Sara without an H and me, Sarah) organized this mostly because we were bored, but because we (Sara and I, since we got this whole thing rolling) also wanted to start kind of an opinionated blog, where we could post what we think mainly about things going on in the world and in the church, but occasionally other various topics may arise (like Austin's brother's ""job"").  At any rate, our little motto is, appropriately, ""all for One and One for all."" This is not only a statement meant to unite us in our friendship, like it is in the story of The Three (or Four) Musketeers. It means more than that to us - all for One, as in Jesus Christ, the one we live for, and One for all, because Jesus is the savior of ALL mankind, and he is the ONLY way to get to heaven. That is what we believe - we're on this road together, and we're not afraid to stand up for Him."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"""If you hadn't been screwing around, it wouldn't have gotten stuck.""  Now what is the person really talking about, guess.  C-dub and I (the doctor) went bowling and i tried to be cool and do the ally cat strike thing where the girl spins the ball, but it fails and goes really slowly down the gutterlane.

DRT3HYS,female,16,"This is something else I've been struggling with lately. Well, not really struggling with, just thinking about. I have this guy friend at church who apparently likes me. I used to like him, but I'm not sure now because I lost somethings in Costa Rica, and I don't feel very sure about anything anymore.  Anyway, another friend of mine kind of likes him. It's hard because, I'm not sure if I like him (because I kinda like a guy in Costa Rica) and if that was enough to think about I have to consider this friend and how she would feel if anything happened between me and this guy.  I talked to my dad about it, because you know i tell him everything, and he was like ""well let me commend you for your loyalty to ----""  But it's hard. Because I really do like this guy, at least I would consider him one of my best friends and I could see myself dating him. I also really like his family, I love his parents, no matter how much he says his mom is anti-social. But I still like this guy in Costa Rica (stupid I know because nothing is going to happen but still).  And it's so tiring always trying to make sure that everyone is happy. I have to date someone that I could actually date (which rules out my other best guy friend cause we fight so much) and at the same time it should be someone my parents know, and trust, and it has to be someone that I could drag to hang out with my friends at church and school, and this guy fits all that. But I can't date him because my friend likes him. And I know it's not like she owns him or something, but still, I can't just date a guy my friend likes. How weird is that? How inconsiderate?  But I am really tired of being sure everyone else is happy before serving my own desires. I know I have to be a servant, because that's what God calls us to do, serve others. But sometimes, I just don't want to do it.  But, I don't know why I'm thinking about this, he hasn't asked me out or anything."

So if you feel like being sympathetic (which i know none of you do) then drop by, or if you can't spare the time call. Maybe my mom will let me touch the phone with my germ covered hands. Not likely.  Yay for me, a day to wallow in self pity."

DRT3HYS,female,16,"I have a job interview today at Old Navy! I am so excited, considering that this is the first application that is actually returning some results. I applied in late May I think, or maybe early June. They called yesterday and the guy was really nice and today I have an interview!! Yay for me! I just hope it goes well so I can start earning back some of the money I so recently spent on clothes!  Oh and I'm feeling better to anyone who was wondering. I can actually swallow and breathe through my nose! Great timing with the interview and all!! YAAAAAAAAAAY!"
DRT3HYS,female,16,"It has a lot of holes and is not entirely complete but it is still okay.  It is nothing near the quality of a school essay.  Of course I am right.  Everyone, at one point or another, witnesses the stereotypical kindergartener’s argument whether it is over equipment, rules of a game, or whether they scored or not.  It always seems to follow out the same way. ""Yeah huh,"" ""No!"" ""Yeah, my daddy said so!"" However, do we really grow out of pointless arguing?  It seems that no matter how mature we supposedly become, our arguments will forever remain either unnecessary or utterly pointless.  I will demonstrate that the majority of arguments are results of issues that could otherwise be avoided.  For example, pride, or the inability to admit you are wrong causes a multitude of unnecessary arguments.  Such as when we choose to not even consider another’s point of view; naturally assuming that we are right.  The argument at this moment is void, since no progress will be made toward influencing either of the individuals.  An effort must be made to at least explore the opposing participants case; at which point if the case is deemed valid in our mind, we must concede, if only part of the argument.  If, however, we find the person’s case true and continue to debate them, then we are simply arguing for the sake of dispute and are much like the children on the playground.  In the same way, bad communication, or lack of understanding other’s positions, causes misunderstandings that may develop into an argument.  I cannot forget the time in which a friend of mine and I got into a particularly fierce disagreement and after one of his remarks I looked at him and said, ""That is exactly what I have been trying to tell you.""  What we had not realized before beginning wrapped up into the argument was exactly what the other was trying to prove.  An easily fixable situation is neglected simply because people fail to take the time to understand one another, therefore causing a pointless argument that will always end in frustration.   The most viable reason for an argument would be conflict of interest, in which, because of differing personal beliefs, parties have different solutions to different problems.  Conflict of interest is the most understandable reason to argue, but may still be avoided if a calm discussion is enacted and a compromise is reached.  However, if parties refuse to settle the dispute in a tranquil manner, it will ultimately lead to a battle of some sort, whether in the media, with friends, or in extreme situations, war.    Consequently, most arguments are preventable by simply evaluating the causing factors.  Whether it is because of pride, bad communication or conflicts of interest, most are capable of being averted.  In addition, if we took more time as humans to understand what is the causing of arguments, and then prevented them, harmony as a species would be greatly closer than ever before in the past centuries."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"I have a really good friend; I think I mentioned him yesterday when i said I was a moron? Yea, that one. Well he apparently is okay with me and my stupidity. He came over this morning and gave me these two cards he'd picked up at walgreens. My brother thought he was a salesman and wasn't going to answer the door. And I was still in my pajamas, so I had to pull on a huge thick freaking hot hoodie to go upstairs and peek out the window, because I thought that myabe by some weird coincedence it would be him, after what I'd just read two seconds ago on the blog.  And it was him. Stupid brothers. So he gave me the cards and I let him in and we talked for a few minutes and then he had to leave. And then my brother made some stupid comment (after he was gone) like, ""he knows he has to come through me first, and dad. wow, that's like double! 'hey, you're in!'"" Which was totally lame because it's not like he likes me or something. But my brother is kind of a moron like that early in the morning...  But it was hilarious, because I was reading what he wrote in one of them and it was something about puting up with his shananingans. See, I wrote him this long apology last night (actually this morning at like 1:00 am) and I said almost the exact same thing. So, it was funny to me.  I'm just glad to know that I have such good friends who are willing to deal with my ups and downs and my conspiracy theorist.  And most of all, I'm glad I have Sarah and her 'couples therapy.' Even though, we aren't a couple, it was good to work stuff out with Austin. Because without her, I wouldn't be talking to him currently. Which would be really stupid because he's leaving tomorrow for some boy scouts thing. (speaking of which, why is he still in boy scouts? he's 16 for crying out loud!)  And it's been really confusing after getting back from Costa Rica. I've lost a lot of things and I've found a whole lot more. But I don't know what to do with any of it. It's good to know that I have friends that are going to sit next to me on the roller coaster and hold my hand when it gets really bad. Because it will eventually. Costa Rica changed a lot, and as much as I wish, it's not going to go back to the way it was. But I think that's okay. Because, as always, God has it under control. We're just here to ride along and make the occasional choice about which ride we're going to next."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Master   katy called me from her parent's house today.  They have met me several times, and approve of our relationship.  (We had some initial worries that they might disapprove of the fact that I am twelve years older than katy)  Today, however, katy's Mother crossed a line.  She called me, and this is an exact quote: ""A cute, sweet, small, teddy bear.""  I am 6', and 200 pounds.  My hairiness and shape means I will accept ""teddy bear"", but cute, sweet and small?  Normally, I would have spanking thoughts about any woman who sassed me to that degree, but my brain (quite rightly) refuses to entertain such an idea about katy's mother.  *long suffering and melodramatic sigh*"

P2XDNH3,male,43,"It's obvious to me what a wonderful and loving person my Master is.  So when I see someone who should know better treating him badly and accusing him of being uncaring and selfish, it makes me angry.

It makes me even more certain that I will never take his love for granted, or fail to be thankful for all that he gives me.  I love you, Master."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Katy:   Today is the last day of the book ban.  I had two serious tempations since the last time I wrote about it.    The first was on Friday night.  I had the worst headache.  You'd think that having a headache would preclude reading, but my headaches have nothing to do with eyestrain.  It's all in the back of the head and neck.  And reading something--escaping the pain for a few minutes--would have been heavenly.  An audiobook wouldn't have worked.  I couldn't listen to anything.  I was sensitive to sounds, not to light.    I didn't give in, but it was a hard thing.  My mind kept casting about, looking for something to distract me from the pain.  I would spot a book on the shelf near the bed.  ""Shakespeare--I've been meaning to read  Richard III  ever since I listened to the biography of Thomas More.  I could--no I can't.""  Then a few minutes later, ""My illustrated version of  The Hobbit .  I could look at the pictures for a few--no I can't.""  That went on until it occured to me to roll over so I couldn't see the bookcase anymore.  Finally, I went to sleep.  The second Hard Time was Saturday.  Grocery shopping.  I went to the big grocery store, which is always too crowded, especially on weekends.  I was in line at least 20 minutes, and it might have been 30.  I  always  flip through magazines in the grocery store line.  I compromised and only read the covers.  M was amused when I told him about it.  The headache is back today.  I'm going to have to see the doctor soon.  Whether I can read or not, I certainly can't go on like this."
P2XDNH3,male,43,A surprise for Master (who didn't know about the mask):
P2XDNH3,male,43,"It's when  urlLink communication between the sexes  gets complicated, that I'm glad not to be in a vanilla relationship.  See, when Master wants sex, he takes it.  And when I want sex, I beg.  We're never in doubt about the other's intent, and while we may occasionally have misunderstandings, they are never about sex.   Master's thoughts : katy, you forgot to mention that, despite our age difference (To readers: I am 12 years older than katy), I use you so often, that you have been known to beg for a rest, rather than more sex.  *kiss*"

P2XDNH3,male,43,"I only have to look at katy's lovely legs and they will bruise.  Her butt, however, is an entirely different matter.  It takes some serious effort to mark it.  Fortunately, I have canes.  I like canes. katy likes canes.     But, you know what?  An hour later, katy's butt looked like it hadn't been touched.  [long suffering, yet Domly, sigh]"
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Max:   I just got off the phone with Master.  He wants me to write about the punishment, and he also wants Beauty to write about the picture.  I want to write about those things.  I want to write every day.  But my mental illness makes me tire easily, and though it is not even 8pm yet, I am already so fatigued.    I want to do so much more than I am doing, and I don't know how.  Master helps me manage my schedule.  But he cannot give me energy when I have none.  I resent being ill.  And it was while I was writing the previous post that I realized that my compulsive behavior towards book is not caused by the mental illness, but my attempts to escape it.  When I am reading, there are no dark thoughts in my head.  No mania, no depression.  Only the words and people born of the mind of another.  Someone else who may also be mentally ill, but in a different way.  So long as I don't have to be in my  own  mind when it is troubled, it is an effective escape.  Even stories of fear and pain and death.  But... there is no reading tonight.  Sure, I could find something to read online.  Master did not forbid the internet to me.  He even allowed me audiobooks, which was generous of him.  But I am able to be a bit more separate in those formats.  When I am reading a book, I am wholely Other.  (Actually, I can escape quite easily into an ebook--I read Stephen King's  Tommyknockers  that way--but I am going to interpret my punishment by the spirit rather than the letter.  Websites or blogs are allowed, but I will not allow myself ebooks.  Do you agree, Master?)  So, given that books are a type of therapy for me, was my punishment deserved?  Yes.  It was.  Master had ordered me to be in bed by 9pm, informing me that that was a drop-dead limit.  He understands that I usually read for a few minutes after going to bed.  The error came in reading for 45 minutes.  We have agreed that once my punishment is lifted, I will prevent a recurrance by placing a bookmark in the book at the point where I must stop.  It will take some trial and error to determine how many pages I can read in 15 minutes, but after that, it should be easy.  We talked for a very long time last night about punishment.  I was concerned because Master had said that if I repeated the error for a third time, or more, then it would cause problems in our relationship.  This bothered me greatly because I know there will be slip-ups in the future.  If I sat up too late reading 6 months from now, would the punishment be escalated?  Master assured me that he will treat slip-ups differently than repeat offenses or rebellion, and that we will always discuss the error and the punishment so that we both agree on what occurred, and why, and what is to be done about it.  Which is good, because I can imagine by the time we're both in a nursing home, he'll have a hard time figuring out how to escalate the punishment for the 97th offense of staying up too late reading.  I offered to let Master schedule my reading.  He wants to train me to be able to put a fiction book down and go on to other activities, without feeling compelled to read the whole book at once.  I am terrified of having to do this.  The way I am now, if I am forced to stop reading in the middle, there is a part of my mind always on the book and trying to get back to it, to the detriment of whatever else I am supposed to be doing.  In a way it reminds me of a phobia I used to have about being in crowds.  I was afraid to get therapy for it, because if I was cured, I'd have to go out in crowds.  Even at the time, I recognized the logical phallacy:  if I was cured, I wouldn't mind going into crowds.  Likewise, if I learned to stop reading a book partway through, then it wouldn't bother me to do it.  The problem is, I don't know how I will learn to do it without actually having to do it.  At the time I made the offer, Master didn't realize how scary it was for me.  After our long talk last night, he does now.  So he made the decision to not accept my offer yet, and said that we will talk about it a week after my punishment ends.  I'm supposed to think about it more--something I'm not really good at.  I'm a fighter, not a thinker.  Especially during the week, when I need my thinking energy for work.  I saw two problems:  Master was unhappy with my reading habits, and I wanted to find a way to submit more, and the offer seemed like a solution to both problems.  But I will think about it.  At the weekend."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Master   I sent katy to work today -- I need a rest.  Perhaps I am getting old?  Perhaps not.  To say that everything is wonderful would be something of an understatement.  We had only managed 40 days together between the time we met and now.   We were as sure as we could be that we are One.  But, you never really know until you start trying to live together and make the reality work, do you?  Well, I know it's only been 4 days, but things could not feel more right.  We aren't just doing the giddy in love thing, we're also do mundane ever day things, like putting the trash out, mucking out the stove etc.  In other words: we're living a real life together.  No apologies for sounding mushy.  We are, of course, being perverts together.  ;-)  Last night, I caned katy's butt, hard.  25 strokes from each of 6 canes - two of them double canes.  i then told her she could choose a reward, for being such a good girl.  You know what?  She chose to have her breasts caned.  She's no masochist, is she?"
P2XDNH3,male,43,"This is katy playing with my favourite flogger.  Although there are many strands, they are lightweight.  katy describes it as feeling rather like a massage.  I love the turned wood handle.  What you can't see is the bronze claw end, which finishes it off beautifully.     katy's hair is much longer now - she started letting it grow when I told her I loved long hair.  Her pussy is now hairless - I like it that way."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"I feel like shit.  I'm angry at everything and I don't care about anything.    I took my first birth control pill last night.  Oh god, is that it?  blah  I had my period last week, July 6-9  Yesterday sucked.  I had to take Lionel back to the airport.  I took the Alesse with my night time pills.

P2XDNH3,male,43,"I am a slut.  I have an On button.  As you can see, it's small and tucked away.     It's a very powerful little button.  When Master called me this morning, he caught me playing with it.  Of course, he had to ""punish"" me for being caught being such a naughty slut.  It's humiliating being caught masturbating.  It's even more humiliating being ordered to continue for his pleasure.  I'm his slave.  His fuckmeat.  I was made to pleasure his cock.  One day, I will pleasure other men at his command, knowing that it pleases him when I'm a slut.  Even typing these things makes me hot.  Humiliation play is hot for both of us, and it is probably my favorite play for phone sex.  I'm still trying to understand why I crave it so much.  I can't explain what humiliation play  is .  But I can say what it is not.  It is not about me having a low self-esteem.  And it is not about Master having contempt for me.  It wouldn't be arousing if I didn't know that he completely accepts and respects my sexuality--in fact, loves me for it.  It wouldn't be arousing if I was ashamed of my own sluttiness.  If this is a little fuzzy it's because I'm still in subspace after playtime.  But if anyone has any questions about humiliation play and how it feels, please use the comments or email either of us.  In fact, that's true about any part of the lifestyle.  That's one of the reasons we write here."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"During my goodnight call with Master a few hours ago, I asked if he wanted me to do anything before I went to bed (he's 5 hours ahead of me in time).  He thought about it for a moment, and asked me to put away the laundry before I went to bed.  The housework has fallen behind, and Master is trying to help me catch up again.  He doesn't blame me for it, as I haven't had the spare time or energy to keep up recently, so there is no punishment.  Only encouragement.  But if there hadn't been extenuating circumstances, I would have been punished for letting the chaos grow, and rightly so.  The laundry is done.  I didn't have much energy left, but I spent a generous period of time carefully shaving my cunt.  My mons and labia get a quick swipe with the electric shaver every day, but I try to get all the nooks and crannies and the area around my anus at least once a week.  It was time.  Now everything down there is smooth and pretty.  Just the way Master likes it.    How do women with piercings down there stay shaven?  Or maybe they wax.  I don't have any piercings other than my ears, but we have two planned for the future:  My left nipple and my clit hood.  The clit hood is only a maybe, as it may be too small for a piercing, but Master wants to have me examined by a professional before he decides.  I am a little concerned about overstimulation, but I know he will do what's best for me.  But even a little clit hood ring would get in the way of shaving, so I will have to figure out how to do that eventually.  Master doesn't intend to put any more piercings in me down there, so at least I'll only have one piece of jewelry to work around.  I'm going to slip into the tub for a soak and then slip into bed.  I wish Master was waiting there to slip into me.  Ah well."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"katy is an exhibitionist.  She is also sassy.  I know, I know, reading this blog and looking at the piccies would never have prepared you for such a revelation, but there it is.  I told her to send me a picture of her hot and wet.     Yes, she had just stepped out of the shower.  Let the spankings commence.   Master"
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Since late October, I've known that I would be  urlLink denied orgasms  for an undetermined period of time before Master's arrival.  He arrives in 11 days.  He told me this morning that the ax has fallen.  That he has had ""December 6"" in his PDA for several weeks as the day when I would be told.  I wish I could say that I accepted it graciously like a good slavegirl.  But I didn't.  I'm not normally rebellious.  I normally want so much more to be a ""good girl"" than I want any particular thing I might rebel over, including orgasms.   The problem I had today is that I haven't been in subspace in quite a while.  A combination of things (mostly it having been 6 months since Master and I have been together physically) has kept me from feeling as submissive as I like.  Then last night, I went into an emotional Bad Place on the phone with Master over something very silly.  Master hasn't been ordering me ""Come now!"" as often as he used to.   I expected something... different.  I expected a phenomenal play session where he took me very deep before telling me not to come.  Or perhaps him giving me a mind-shattering orgasm and telling me that was my last one.  Or something.  I didn't think he'd tell me first thing in the morning after a bad night.    So, I rebelled.  Sort of.  I cried.  I told him I didn't necessarily want him to change his plans, because I want him to be in charge.  It was sort of a rebellion because I didn't accept his plan wholeheartedly at first, but it wasn't really a rebellion because for me to have kept quiet and pretended to be okay when I wasn't would have been Many Times Worse.  I'm supposed to tell Master when I have mental misgivings.  Actually, it's a little stronger than that.  I'm under orders to keep Master informed of my emotional state.    Master decided to take some time to think about what to do and I realized later as I was running errands that it isn't often that Master gives me an order that requires sacrifice.  Normally submitting to him gives me far more pleasure than I give up.  So I asked him to please not change his plans and said I was sorry for crying and not accepting it.  I love you, Master.  I hope I haven't diminished the pleasure you will take in denying my orgasms."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"We just added  urlLink Mistress Matisse  to our blogroll, and I showed this piece, from April 7, to Master:   So there I was, sliding this metal rod into his dick, thinking, ""What a magical thing this is."" And that�s how it seems to me when I'm playing � like it's magic. Like I'm magic. I love that I can do these intense things to people's bodies, and somehow, through some alchemical transformation, it's not a bad thing. Instead, it's wonderful. That's where the power comes from, for me. Not in making people endure something nasty � that's just bullying someone. No, the magic is doing fierce things to people and making them like it. That's the magic.    And asked him if that's what he feels when he hurts me.  After he finished cringing at the image of the metal rod being inserted (he's not even a little bit masochistic!), he said yes, that describes it better than he's ever been able to put it.  And that made me feel magical, because I've never quite been able to understand what he gets out of it.  I couldn't do to someone else what he does to me--not without great effort and very little enjoyment.  Master is incapable of getting any kind of pleasure out of receiving pain or being bound.  But together.... as the Mistress says, it's magic."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Master   Two posts down, katy said:    I asked him what would happen if the touch or even the scent of him at the airport made me come without permission. He said I would have to be punished. I asked how he might punish me.  He described the cruelest thing I can imagine. Tying me down with my legs spread, pulling back his foreskin, and fucking me with just the head of his cock. Not filling me up. Not touching my g-spot.    katy regularly asks me how I might punish her, usually during play.  This is exactly what happened last night.  She was in subspace as we played on the phone.  I long ago discovered that a quick way to make her dive deeply and enhance her orgasms was to answer with a particularly cruel punishment.  Last night it backfired as, despite her being in subspace, she interpreted my response literally and was very close to tears.  I can envisage doing exactly what I described, but to tease her, not as a punishment, and certainly not on the first night after we've been physically apart for six months.  My orgasms have also changed since katy and I became One.  Before our first 3D meeting, we played extensively on the phone and on ICQ - both of us having orgasms.  Since that first meeting, we play just as often when apart, but I rarely have an orgasm.  I have also found my desire to masturbate has reduced a little.  I wondered about this at first, wondering if my libido was reducing.  The next visit soon disproved that.  I suspect my desire to masturbate has been reduced by how overwhelming I find the reality of katy to be - 2D/cyber pales in comparison."

And since Master just pointed out that the last run of posts on this blog have been administrative in nature, I will write after dinner about losing my anal virginity."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Katy:   Master fucked my ass tonight.  I had thirty minutes to prepare before I was to call Master.  I started by inserting a rabbit vibrator in my pussy backwards, with the rabbit part vibrating against my anus.  We've had trouble with anal play before.  I have a very sensitive ass, and have had to call a halt to anal play in the past, but using the vibrator first helped a lot.  After I felt the anal sphincters were relaxed enough, I inserted the medium butt plug and put a red velvet thong on over it to hold it in.  These two innovations--using the vibrator before insertion and the thong after--made a huge difference.  This was definitely the most fun anal play I've had in long distance.  After I was prepared, I called Master.  I had to confess that I had had an orgasm without his permission, and I hadn't tried very hard to stop it.  He ordered me to pinch my clit as punishment.  He asked me if I thought that was enough punishment.  I didn't think it was.  The second pinch was much harder, and I felt the combination was appropriate punishment.  Master might have punished me more for his own pleasure, except that he is always careful on work nights not to do anything that might leave residual soreness in the morning.  (We learned that lesson once when I was using nipple clamps while we were on the phone.  Since I'm not experienced in their use, I ended up with very sore nipples the next day.  We since decided that nipple clamps will only be for Master to use on me when he is physically here.)  Playtime was very raw and erotic.  Master wove a fantasy on the phone, directed my play with the vibrators, called me his slavegirl, made me beg to cum.  My favorite part was when Master had me count down from ten to one to reach orgasm.  I counted slowly, and in between numbers, he told me I was his fucktoy, that he loved me, that I was his property, that he was going to cum in my slut mouth.    A bubble bath followed the play.  Safety is important.  All of the toys get washed and disinfected after any play--not just anal play--but normally I wait until the next morning to shower.  But after anal play, I prefer to bathe immediately and make sure no germs get transferred to the vagina or urethra.  And since I had the cordless phone, I was able to talk to Master while I soaked and relaxed.  Pure bliss."

P2XDNH3,male,43,"Master   To say that I enjoy torturing katy's nipples would be something of an understatement.  I love to twist them; pull them, bite them; cane them etc.  (Yes, I really have caned katy's breasts, and will again)  Perhaps, if someone asks nicely enough, I will post pictures of the welts after her breasts have been caned.  Nipple torture is a really good way to feed the InnerSadist.  They are very sensitive, and I get loads of feedback.  Torturing her nipples when she straddles my cock is also a wonderful way of reminding her that she may be on top, but I retain control.  ;-)  Anyway, here are her nipples after I had been twisiting and biting them for a while.  You'd think they'd be redder, wouldn't you?"
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Katy:   Master asked me how it felt to have my slutty pictures on the web now that we are starting to get some traffic.  I said it doesn't feel ""real"" to me yet.  I have so often seen these pictures on my monitor that it is hard to imagine the main difference now--that anyone else can see them too.  I said it won't feel real until other people comment on them.    Master ordered me to post that tonight.  So will you help me make it real?  Will you tell me what you think of these pictures?"

Anyway, I started getting impatient with him asking me questions that I didn't know the answer to, and finally exploded in a growl and asked him to give me a moratorium from having any questions directed at me.  Unfortunately, his style of patter depends so much on the asking of questions that it is effectively gagging him.  And I'm trying to steel myself up for being spanked with The Beast later (for something that happened earlier), so now we're both in weird, growly moods.  Part of the lifestyle, but I wouldn't be vanilla for the world."

Unfortunately, we were apart, so I had to do the honors myself:     Even more unfortunately, we will probably be apart again this year.  It looks like we get to choose between Master's birthday or Christmas, because money won't allow both.  So, going with tradition, do I want a birthday spanking from Master?

Pretty much the same if she is clothed, actually.  ;-)  katy has beautiful breasts, and exquisitely sensitive nipples.  I like that in a slavegirl.  Anyway, katy had never experienced a titfuck until she met me.  She had never even had them (or any other part of her) stroked by a cock.  I leak a LOT of pre-cum, which not all of my previous lovers have enjoyed.  katy loves it.  When I say ""a LOT"", I mean enough for it to provide enough lubrication to use my cock as a massage tool.  Yummy.  It also means we don't need lube for titfucks.  katy was, I think, mildly surprised by how intimate it feels.  Of course, the old spunk all over her tits thing seriously feeds her inner slut and naughty girl.  She almost almost has an orgasm with me when we do this, even though I am not stimulating her clit.  katy is also a tease.  She sent this piccie recently.  What do you think she was suggesting?     PS. She is wearing her heavy chain, non-public collar.  PPS. 27 days."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"I just  urlLink read this:    The Enslavement Hypothesis is that there are submissives who have an overwhelming need to be possessed by a dominant. Given the right environment, the submissive can be coaxed out from behind the protective walls she has built during her life and made to expose all of her Self to her Master. Among other things this requires that he creates an environment which is emotionally safe and in which her underlying character will be accepted, probably for the first time in her life. During this process, the bond between the submissive and her Master becomes sufficiently strong that she can no longer break it herself, and she has then been enslaved.    I agree with most of this.  So much of my life has brought me to the point of wanting to be owned.  But I think (I don't know) that if Master ever became abusive to me  (we're talking *major* hypotheticals here, like him being taken over by aliens) , I would have the strength to break the bond.  He has taught me how I deserve to be treated, and I will never settle for anything less again."

P2XDNH3,male,43,"I tried to explain to Master how I could be totally nervous about today, and yet not have any doubts or fears.  The closest I could come was relating it to stage fright.  I'm not afraid of public speaking in the sense that I'm scared I'll forget what to say, or that the audience will hate me.  But I always have the jitters just before.  Master said, ""Ah, it's performance anxiety.  You're afraid you won't be able to get it up.""  *snicker*  Well, not exactly.  I want everything in our home to be perfect, but I know it won't be.

She tries not to, in part because she knows how it tears me apart inside to see her cry.  I manage not to cry.  Just.  Only just.  katy didn't cry last Wednesday, although we were both miserable, and just barely holding on.  Parting sucks.  Parting at inhuman airport cattle markets sucks more.  I phuquing hate it.  We've (half-jokingly) spoken about what happened to the tears, wondering what happened to them.  We initially put it down to the fact that this time we had the knowledge that we would be together this summer.  Wrong.  They came last night, for no apparent reason.  katy has a Standing Order to call me if she needs me, whatever the time.

P2XDNH3,male,43,"Teacher caught me.  I was masturbating in the cloakroom of Teacher's office.  I thought I would be alone.  Well, except that I was thinking about Teacher, and I wasn't surprised when he opened the door and saw me... leaning against the back wall, my skirt up around my waist, one hand in my panties and the other pinching my nipples through my starched white shirt.  ""Miss Drake!  What do you think you're doing?"" Teacher asked in a calm tone.  I could hear the steel beneath it.  ""I... err... I was just...""  I tried to put myself together.    ""Come here, Miss Drake.  Just as you are,"" he commanded.  ""Don't bother trying to straighten your clothes.  The other students know what a slut you are.""  I obeyed.  My skirt was askew and one shirt-tail was hanging out.  Worse, I hadn't yet reached orgasm when I was interrupted.  I stole a glance down as I emerged from the closet.  I couldn't help smiling when I saw the bulge in Teacher's slacks.  Of course, he saw the smile, and I knew I would pay for it.  He marched me back to the class that I had skipped when I discovered Teacher's office was unlocked.  Teacher was right.  The students did know what a slut I was.  Especially the boys.  The whispering started as soon as I entered.  ""Over the desk, Miss Drake.""  Teacher's desk was always clean.  I obeyed, assuming the position I knew all too well.  But this was the first time I was to be punished in front of the class.  Teacher flipped my skirt up.  I couldn't help it.  I jumped.  I had expected the first stroke to fall, and instead had felt the crisp hairs on the back of his hand brush against my thighs.  ""Do I need to make you hold still, Miss Drake?"" Teacher asked.  He didn't wait for an answer.  ""Andrew, Bryan, come here and hold Miss Drake in place.""  I heard the class breaking out again in whispers and felt a firm grip on each ankle as the boys grabbed my legs and spread and lifted them, so that my feet no longer touched the floor.  From their position sitting on the floor, they could see everything.  Could smell everything.  Had my panties soaked through yet?  ""Miss Drake is a dirty slut and needs to be punished,"" Teacher announced to the class.  ""Bryan, take her panties down.""  I felt Bryan's hot breath on me as he peeled my panties down to around my knees.  He pulled my leg closer to him, and I realized he was surreptitiously rubbing his hard cock against my calf.  A whimper escaped me.  ""Count the strokes, Miss Drake,"" Teacher ordered.  Then the first stroke of the thick wooden ruler fell on my left buttock.  ""One, Sir,"" I gasped.  ""You are a very naughty girl, and you need to be punished,"" Teacher said, then swung again.  ""Two, Sir.""  ""You need to be punished in front of the whole class to teach you not to be such a dirty slut.""  ""Three, Sir.""  ""And I will punish you, every day, if I have to.""  And so it went, me counting each stroke and Teacher telling me and the class what a naughty girl I was.  My bottom grew hot and I struggled to remember the count while trying very hard to catch a view of the bulge in Teacher's slacks.   Please make me stay after school,  I begged silently.   Please, Teacher.  I'll be such a good naughty girl if you do."

P2XDNH3,male,43,"Back on December 31, Sara asked:   excuse me if I sound naive, but your relationship dynamic is so far out of my personal experiance that I have trouble fully groking it. katie, why did you have to ask permission to go to bed? does your submissive role really extend that far?    I realized after I read that question that I left some rather important information out of the story.  My bedtime is always 9pm if I'm going to the gym in the morning and 10pm otherwise.  Exceptions may be made for special circumstances, such as a special event with others that we don't have control over the scheduling, or genuine illness or insomnia (where I try to go to bed at the correct time, but lie awake for 30 minutes or more).  Exceptions don't include staying up for a tv show or getting tied up doing something on the computer and forgetting bedtime.  Bedtime comes, I go to bed.  No arguments.    Now, without this information I can see how the story might have looked extreme.  What if he hadn't given me permission to go to bed?  Is sleep deprivation for hours or days a form of play we use?  Maybe there are people who play with sleep deprivation, but I would consider that very extreme play, in line with breath play (which we also don't do).  For Master and me, our physical and emotional health comes first.  Before play, before pleasure.  We may sometimes disagree on the means of protecting our health, but never on its priority.  So Master would never keep me up past my bedtime without a very good reason.   In answer to your question, I never have to ask for permission to go to bed at the assigned time.  It's only if I want to change the schedule that I would need to ask.  (Another point which I'll develop more in a later post is how much Master and I enjoy me asking him for permission to do things, even when it's obvious to both of us that the answer will be ""yes"".  ""May I go to bed now?"" is much more gracious than ""I'm going to crash--you coming?"")"
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Master   It is strange, and dispiritingly perverse that, as we approach permanent togetherness (30 days), some of the problems of maintaining an LDR (long distance relationship) are becoming greater.  Is it so unreasonable to expect them to lessen?  It seems that we both have become more sensitive to the loneliness, the ache, the rolling over in the night to a cold and empty bed.  We are both world class at talking through problems, and this has helped make us best friends, as well as everything else we are together and that is getting us through.  30 days."

P2XDNH3,male,43,"Katy:   I love being a submissive.  I have been submissive all my life, and now that I have a strong Master, it brings me even more joy to be my true self.  However there is one particular disadvantage to being submissive.  My dog doesn't listen to me.  Why should she?  It is obvious that I'm not the alpha bitch of the pack.  It must vex Mutt greatly that an inferior bitch has control over doorknobs and leashes.  We've been through a training course, and she knows all the commands, but she obeys them or not as it suits her.  Everything changes when Master is here.  She recognized him immediately as an Alpha Male, and refused to meet his eyes for several days.  Then after an unfortunate incident involving rough sex and a broken table, Mutt became anxious whenever we created any kind of creaking rhythm.  The second visit, you could almost see the thought in her head ""Oh shit, not HIM again!""  But this time, her strategy was different.  Whenever Master and I became close, Mutt tried to wiggle between us.  At first we thought she was jealous of the attention that I was paying Master.  But soon it was obvious.  Mutt wanted Master for herself.  Mutt wanted to replace me as the Alpha Bitch.  Master is not a dog lover, but he tolerates Mutt for my sake.  Mutt's designs to engage his affections are in vain.  But she obeys any order he gives, all the while ignoring me.  Now that Master is gone, Mutt has returned to thinking herself the head of the pack and not listening to a word I say.  What's a submissive to do?"

UMBMHKV,male,39,"Who would have thought that conduct during the Bush Administration would make Bill Clinton's blowjob party in the oval office seem silly and unimportant in the scope of the big picture? Now we are learning that the ""few bad apples"" excuse being proffered by the military, the Bush Administration and Republican Party loyalists fosters about about as much believability as ""I didn't inhale"".  Abuse, torture, mutilation, death. Here come the  urlLink war crimes !  a NEWSWEEK investigation shows that, as a means of pre-empting a repeat of 9/11,  Bush, along with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Attorney General John Ashcroft, signed off on a secret system of detention and interrogation that opened the door to such methods . It was an approach that they adopted to sidestep the historical safeguards of the Geneva Conventions, which protect the rights of detainees and prisoners of war. In doing so, they overrode the objections of Secretary of State Colin Powell and America's top military lawyers—and they left underlings to sweat the details of what actually happened to prisoners in these lawless places. While no one deliberately authorized outright torture, these techniques entailed a systematic softening up of prisoners through isolation, privations, insults, threats and humiliation—methods that the Red Cross concluded were ""tantamount to torture.""   The Bush administration created a bold legal framework to justify this system of interrogation, according to internal government memos obtained by NEWSWEEK.  What started as a carefully thought-out, if aggressive, policy of interrogation in a covert war—designed mainly for use by a handful of CIA professionals—evolved into ever-more ungoverned tactics that ended up in the hands of untrained MPs in a big, hot war. Originally, Geneva Conventions protections were stripped only from Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. But later  Rumsfeld himself, impressed by the success of techniques used against Qaeda suspects at Guantanamo Bay, seemingly set in motion a process that led to their use in Iraq, even though that war was supposed to have been governed by the Geneva Conventions . Ultimately, reservist MPs, like those at Abu Ghraib, were drawn into a system in which fear and humiliation were used to break prisoners' resistance to interrogation.  Clinton's amoral behaviour in office merely shamed himself. Bush's amoral behaviour in office shames us all."

UMBMHKV,male,39,"This intrepid Boston Globe reporter makes a  urlLink ridiculous claim  that because Apple's best-selling iPod (3 million sold and counting) is proprietary in nature, only playing music files from its iTunes service, which utilizes its ""FairPlay"" digital rights management and does not allow its files to be played on other digital music players, nor play files from the other digital music services such as Napster, that it effectively encourages stealing. Forcing people to go to use P2P sites like Kazaa to get all of their music. That's like saying if I buy a gun for home protection, Smith & Wesson is encouraging me to enter into a life of armed robbery or murder. DVD-Audio discs don't play in my CD player, SACD's don't play in my DVD player. Proprietary formats are nothing new. Consumers make a choice. What levels the playing field is equal availability of all titles in every medium.  When I buy an iPod, I understand going in that it only works with the iTunes music service AND any MP3 music files I may already have on my computer. I'm not sure I see how that suddenly implants visions of criminality in my head.  Apple has done more than ANY company to offer a legal, easy and comprehensive system for consumers to download music from the internet. Rather than demonize them, why not focus on the true culprits - the music industry. If the industry would catch up and respond to comsumer demand, they would make ALL of their music catalog available equally to all of the digital music download services and let the consumer make the final decision about how they would like to access and purchase their downloads.  All this journalist is doing is engaging in some kind of biased vendetta against Apple and their cutting-edge products and making an outlandish claim that buying an iPod will turn people into digital music pirates. Nothing could be further from the truth and it is just plain wrong to suggest otherwise."
UMBMHKV,male,39,"Eric Schlosser, author of the excellent book,  Fast Food Nation , writes a well-reasoned  urlLink op-ed  in today's NYT about the harmless and beneficial effects of marijuana and the need for its decriminalization.  I've never understood all of the hysterics and hand-wringing over the use of marijuana. Study after study have noted the medical benefits of herb. The government's own studies, as far back as the 70's, show that it should be decriminalized. Yet all of the government's propaganda would have us believe that it's one of the most dangerous and lethal drugs available.  As someone who has dabbled in a bit of the chronic myself, I can say with firsthand knowledge that, with the exception of some unfortunate weight gain brought on by the ""munchies"", I have not experienced any negative side-effects. Not only that, I'm convinced that for the 2 years I used it regularly, my eyesight (nearsightedness) did not get worse. In the years before my regular marijuana use, both eyes degraded roughly .25 per year and in the 2 years since I quit, my eyes have degraded a total of .75 in each eye. It's almost enough to keep me enjoying the cheeba but I'd rather wear contacts and be fit than keep my eyesight at its current level and be fat. Call me crazy but those are my priorities these days.  Accusations about pot being a ""gateway drug"" and it being highly addictive are specious arguments. It's no more addictive than alcohol and one could argue it's not the drug itself that's addicitive but the person using it having an ""addictive personality"" or having other issues which cause them to use it as a crutch. Reason to make it illegal? I think not. Using that anology why are alcohol and cigarettes legal? As for claims that it is a drug that leads kids to experiment with harder drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, anyone who has smoked pot would understand that the feeling it evokes is the polar opposite of cocaine and hardly makes jabbing a needle in one's arm all of a sudden more appealing. Again, people who start experimenting with marijuana and eventually migrate to harder drugs would have ultimately gotten there with or without pot. The desire to experiment, or the desire to cope with problems real or imagined by using drugs and escaping reality is not fueled just by smoking pot.  Am I advocating the use of drugs? No. It's an individual's choice and it is a choice that should be exercised only by adults who can fully understand and handle the responsibilities of taking this kind of mind-altering substance, just like alcohol.  Finally, from a legal system standpoint, our jails are filled with offenders whose only crime was to be in possession of a little herb. I don't feel, as a taxpayer and citizen, that this is an effective use of law enforcement resources. Imposing stiff sentences on marijuana offenders does nothing to keep any of us safer and may achieve the opposite effect. It takes up precious jail-space that could be used to hold more dangerous and deserving criminals the full length of their sentences rather than releasing them early due to prison over-crowding.  As with all minor drug-related offenses, the focus should be on treatment and rehabilitation rather than incarceration. That would be my tax dollars at work in a more effective and positive way."

UMBMHKV,male,39,"I just learned about  urlLink ""The Methuselah Tree"" . This is a 4,647 year old bristlecone pine tree that's been around since the pyramids! Not only that but it's located in California, of all places, high in the Sierra Nevadas. And people think we have no history in California! We have something better than history, we have the oldest living tree in the world. Who needs Disneyland?  Of course, man being the effective destroyer of nature that he is, an even older bristlecone tree was cut down in 1964 by an unwitting student...   The 1957 Schulman discovery of old bristlecones in California brought much attention to the bristlecones in the Wheeler area. With park development in mind, the Nevada congressional delegation asked the National Park Service for a study of the area. Some initial research was done but months went by with no further movement.  A local group that included author-conservationist Darwin Lambert was established and together they formed the Great Basin National Park Association. Lambert and this group believed the bristlecones of Wheeler to be every bit as old as those in California and worked hard to get scientific research to the area. The University of Nevada showed some interest but money was short and the theory that the oldest trees were in the White Mountains of California left the group without the support they needed. Lambert and his friends were longtime travelers to Wheeler Peak, and many of its bristlecones were lovingly given names by members of the group: names like ""Buddha"" and ""Socrates"". One tree was named ""Prometheus"" (pronounced: Pra-me-thee-us) after the Greek mythical character Titan, who gave fire and arts to mankind but was chained to a mountain for thousands of years by the gods for doing so.  The Association failed to get the research project, but the colossal trees along with the great beauty of the area was enough to bring attention to the Advisory Board on National Parks who endorsed the area as worthy of consideration. Bills were introduced in both houses of Congress and their passing seemed imminent, but grazing, mining and hunting special interests intervened, and the legislation failed. Legislative efforts continued year after year without success.  One day, while reading a newsletter clipping from the University of North Carolina, Lambert was dealt an almost unbelievable blow. He had stumbled upon a story that escaped the public and conservationists alike. Late in the year of 1964 a young geographer, Donald R. Currey, a student at this university, who was working toward his doctorate, was in the Southwest searching for evidence of Ice Age glaciers. The Wheeler Peak glacier and related phenomena attracted him. When this student and his associate came upon the bristlecones at the timberline, they began to take core samples from several trees, discovering one to be over 4,000 years old! Needless to say they were excited, and at some point, their only coring tool broke. The end of the field season was nearing. They asked forand I still can't believe it!were granted permission by the U.S. Forest Service to cut the tree down. It was ""Prometheus"".  After cutting the trunk at a convenient level, which happened to be more than eight feet above the original base, 4,844 rings were counted. This student had just killed the oldest living thing on earth! Eventually, dendrochronologist Don Graybill determined the tree to be  4,862 years of age ."

A bacterial agent commonly found in health-care settings has been blamed for the deaths of 100 patients in the last 18 months in a single Quebec hospital, says an infectious disease expert at the facility, who is calling for government action to forestall more outbreaks across the country.  Dr. Jacques Pepin says cases of Clostridium difficile at University Hospital in Sherbrooke have been steadily increasing. And the incidence among those most vulnerable to the disease — patients aged 65 and older — jumped 10-fold between 1991 and the end of 2003.  The infection has been blamed for killing 54 patients in 2003 and another 46 in the first six months of this year at the 683-bed hospital, said Dr. Pepin, lead author of a study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.  Using patient records, the University of Sherbrooke researchers compiled cases of C. difficile and deaths from the infection over the last 14 years. They found the proportion of patients who died within 30 days of diagnosis soared to almost 14 per cent in 2001 from less than 5 per cent in 1991.   Mayonnaise on french fries and now this?

I'd be remiss if I didn't link out to his  urlLink most recent article  on this subject, proferring the evolved claim that the now unholy alliance of Kerry/Cheney are covering up the real story on Vietnam POW's.  Department of full disclosure: I am not someone who wants John Kerry to lose this election. To my mind, he is clearly a better man and leader than his opponent, who has lost his way. But he is also a man who, like many politicians embedded in government for a long time, has on some occasions allowed his ambition and perhaps his hubris to cloud his judgment. So why, with this piece, have I now written two stories for the Voice (and dozens of other stories elsewhere in the past) about Kerry's role as chair of that committee—stories that might cost him some votes? The answer is twofold. First, history and honesty are consequential. A nation can't claim to be a beacon of democracy for the world if the beacon is built on a foundation of lies.  And second, this story has become personally important to me, probably because of my life's arc. I've been in the army, and I've been a war reporter in India and Indochina, where military people have looked out for me. I have learned that duty, honor, country, and band of brothers are not words to be used lightly in political campaigns. I have learned never to confuse soldiers with the policies of the men in a nation's capital who have sent them into war. And I believe that abandoning men who have fought under their nation's flag is a terrible betrayal.  In his Democratic convention speech last week, Kerry said: ""We have it in our power to change the world again. But only if we're true to our ideals—and that starts by telling the truth to the American people.""  I hope John Kerry will turn out to be a different kind of leader. I hope he digs deep and tells us the truth about the band of men—not the ""small number"" they were reduced to in his committee's report—who were left behind in 1973 in Vietnam. That would truly be a fresh start.   Those of you out there that have a conscience will not want the blood on your hands a vote for Kerry/Edwards  or  Bush/Cheney would bring. Therefore, through sheer elimination, the only safe vote to be cast is for Ralph Nader! Whoooooooo Aaaaaaaah! Let's get ready to rumble!"

I think the most relevant and compelling assertion this CIA officer makes is that it's not our freedoms or liberties that bin Laden opposes and is fighting against, it our foreign policies which he views as anti-Muslim - we are occupying two of the holiest nations in Islam - Saudi Arabia and Iraq and our unwavering support for Israel which ""occupies"" Jerusalem and severely represses the Palestinian people.  ""And the genius that lies behind it, because he's not a man who rants against our freedoms, our liberties, our voting, our — the fact that our women go to school. He's not the Ayatollah Khomeini; he really doesn't care about all those things. To think that he's trying to rob us of our liberties and freedom is, I think, a gross mistake. What he has done, his genius, is identify particular American foreign policies that are offensive to Muslims whether they support these martial actions or not — our support for Israel, our presence on the Arabian Peninsula, our activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, our support for governments that Muslims believe oppress Muslims, be it India, China, Russia, Uzbekistan. Bin Laden has focused the Muslim world on specific, tangible, visual American policies.  Where I differ from the CIA officer's views are in the type of solution to this Islamic terrorist problem. ""Anonymous"" is an advocate of even more heavy-handed military action against all terrorist elements and the nation states that provide them cover and support. At no point does he address the ""foreign policy question"" and suggest that we adjust our foreign policy initiatives and goals so that some of the grievances many Muslims have might be addressed and alleviated.  Do we need to maintain a troop presence in Saudi Arabia? Do they not purchase from us on a regular basis the most cutting-edge military technology known to man? As has been discussed ad nauseum for the last 18 months or so, did we really need to invade Iraq to make ourselves safer? Finally, is our fanatical military and economic support of the government of Israel and our blatant favoritism on their behalf when it comes to the Middle East Peace Process entirely necessary? Why can't we approach that conflict with more of an even-hand and help forge a viable two-state solution?  I'm all for committing more assets to the fight against terrorists, as long as they are not squandered on wars barely connected to the issues at hand, but I also think we can implement a bilateral approach to diffusing the rising tide of Muslim hatred towards our country's policies by giving those policies a second look and modifying some of them to reflect world concerns."

He's making quite a name for himself in Iraq with his beheadings and high profile car bombings but his biggest proponent is George Bush, painting him as the latest ""mastermind boogey man"" that is attached to Iraq and al Qaeda.

According to several military analysts working both inside and outside of government, the Bush administration's oft-repeated claim that militant leader Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi is the direct link between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein does not ring true.  Al- Zarqawi, a Jordanian who heads a group that reportedly claimed responsibility Tuesday for killing a Bulgarian worker held captive in Iraq, appears to be one of many leaders within the decentralized, global Islamic extremist movement. The various groups often work in competition with Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network for recruits and funding.  The analysts also suggest that, contrary to other Bush administration assertions, Al-Zarqawi's religious beliefs, combat tactics and operational goals were never consistent with Hussein's, nor are they in accord with those of most Iraqis currently fighting against the ongoing US-led military occupation...  ...""The jihad money market... it's like a free market,"" Ware said in an interview July 1 on Australian television. ""The money ebbs and flows, it follows trends, it follows personalities. Some time ago, Chechnya was hot, then Afghanistan was hot... Now Iraq is the hottest of the hot, and Al-Zarqawi is here.""  Ironically, according to Ware, another factor driving Al-Zarqawi's growing popularity among Islamic extremists is the substantial attention currently being paid to him by the Bush administration, as well as Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq in the first place."

Outside experts said Abraham's unprecedented order would curtail operations across the Energy Department's chain of laboratories, computing centers, accelerators and factories that employ more than 100,000 workers.  Abraham's order was based on growing concern that the Energy Department had a systemwide vulnerability to losing important bomb secrets stored on removable devices, known as Classified Removable Electronic Media, or CREM. Such devices allow a person to download massive quantities of data that can be easily concealed.    Anyone lax in the security and protection of nuclear secrets should be, at the very least, fired immediately and at the most, tried for treason. Just because the Cold War is over doesn't mean the threats against this country aren't many and severe. Certainly with the global emergence of terrorism directed against the West, the protection of our nuclear weapons research is just as important, if not more so, than during the Cold War. During the Cold War, the US government could take a modicum of solace in the fact that M.A.D. (mutually assured destruction) was not something the Soviet Union or the U.S. were anxious to initiate. The enemy was clear and they were located in a specific place. Therefore it presented a clear and fixed target to retaliate against. They had the bomb, we had the bomb, thus ""nuclear stalemate"".  Terrorism, in contrast, is amorphous. It exists, at least in theory if not in practice, all around us. Those who are part of the global terrorism collective would seem not to have any qualms about using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against this nation or any others in the West or Middle East that it viewed as a threat to its vision of a worldwide Islamic theocracy based on the most fundamental interpretation of the Koran. They just need to get their hands on the weapons themselves or the means to make their own. We end up continuing to be our own worst enemy, potentially sowing the seeds of our own destruction, by letting nuclear secrets leak out of our most top-secret facilities.  What I think remains to be be seen is if this is a threat from within or from without.

By Michael Moore   For too long now we have abandoned our flag to those who see it as a symbol of war and dominance, as a way to crush dissent at home. Flags are flying from the back of SUVs, rising high above car dealerships, plastering the windows of businesses and adorning paper bags from fast-food restaurants. But these flags are intended to send a message: ""You're either with us or you're against us,"" ""Bring it on!"" or ""Watch what you say, watch what you do.""  Those who absconded with our flag now use it as a weapon against those who question America's course. They remind me of that famous 1976 photo of an anti-busing demonstrator in Boston thrusting a large American flag on a pole into the stomach of the first black man he encountered. These so-called patriots hold the flag tightly in their grip and, in a threatening pose, demand that no one ask questions.

If we don't do that -- the bare minimum -- for those who offer to defend our country, then we have failed them and ourselves. They offer to die for us, if necessary, so that we can be free. All they ask in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. And with this war, we have broken faith with our troops by sending them off to be killed and maimed for wrong and immoral reasons.  Let's create a world in which, when people see the Stars and Stripes, they will think of us as the people who brought peace to the world, who brought good-paying jobs to all citizens and clean water for the world to drink.

UMBMHKV,male,39,"The Arab League is fronting for the Sudanese government,  urlLink saying they should be given more time to end the crisis , you know, the one where state-backed  Arab  militias are slaughtering thousands of black Africans in the Darfur region.  This is what incenses me. We go into Iraq under false pretenses and then our government makes some half-hearted claim that part of our ""intervention"" in Iraq was for humanitarian reasons, yet when we are clearly looking at genocide being carried out in Sudan - we do nothing. We don't lift a finger. Sure, we get a resolution passed in the UN Security Council, one that had to be significantly watered down before it could pass, but how many lives has that saved so far? What about the thousands of people who have been killed and will be killed since that resolution passed and before something effective is actually done?  What is so hard about forcing the Sudan government to stop backing the Arab militias and sending their own troops in to restore order? Clearly the Sudanese government's reluctance to do so shows their complicity in the slaughter. I would say that with their recent intervention, the Arab League too are complicit in the ongoing slaughter of thousands of black Africans.  Why is it that the rest of the world so devalues African lives? So much so that no one has done a single thing to help stop this horrible genocide. Even after the terrible expereince in Rwanda during the 90's, the West is still sitting on it's hands, content to let the ""savages"" fight it out amongst themselves. It's covert racism that really not all that covert.  Nobody is coming out looking good in this so far, the West, the UN but the Arab League should be ashamed of itself for coming out and tacitly supporting the despicable actions by the Sudanese government by insisting that they be given more time before any sanctions are enacted.  Lives are being lost every day. The longer the rest of the world takes to respond to this type of mass murder, the greater the message is to African despots that no one cares about what happens on the African continent."
UMBMHKV,male,39,"urlLink   America's Heart and Soul    is going to be Disney's first theatrical documentary release (since they dropped Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 ). I saw a screening a few weeks ago and thought it was an excellent movie and very inspirational. With how  down  many of us feel about America these days (certainly the government, if not its citizenry), this movie will remind you of how special our cultural diversity is and how beautiful and awe-inspiring the land we call the United States is. Interestingly, Disney is choosing to  urlLink market  this movie much in the same way ""The Passion of the Christ"" was marketed. One can only hope that it's half as successful!"
UMBMHKV,male,39,"Bill Cosby dropped some science earlier this month during a DC address honoring the 50th Anniversary of  Brown vs. Board of Education  - condemning blacks' use of ""ebonics"", excessive consumerism over self-improvement and perpetuating a ""victim's mentality"" (blaming black criminality on oppression and subsequently protesting its unfairness, rather than condemning the act of stealing itself). Certainly issues worthy of discussion but during a celebration of Brown v. BOE?  Erin Aubry Kaplan in  LA Weekly  writes more on the conundrum of  urlLink black-on-black criticism  in this country."
UMBMHKV,male,39,"A cellphone directory is now being  urlLink compiled  which is expected to incude 75% of the 163 million mobile phones in the United States. Of course the industry is touting the convenience angle - customers being able to call directory assistance to get the number of a friend, mobile professionals who would like clients or customers to be able to call and get their number, but how many of us don't already have our friends' numbers or important numbers programmed into our cellphones already? How many of us would be willing to give up the peaceful right of privacy and anonymity we currently enjoy with our cellphones?  I, for one, use my cellphone as my primary phone line since my land line was getting inundated with hispanic marketing calls. Since cellphone numbers have been private up until now and have never been listed, I do not get any unwanted sales or marketing calls. That is beginning to change though and I do occassionally get text messages for loan rates on my phone. Annoying, for sure, but not yet at a volume that is terribly distracting. With the publication and inevitable exploitation of a cellphone directory, the relative peace and privacy of our collective cellphone universes will be forever shattered.  Of course, making it an ""opt-in"" service would be acceptable. I'm sure there are many lonely people out there who would enjoy the contact but after those 200 people agree to opt-in, what about the rest of us? Another disturbing fact is that many cellphone providers already have language built in to their usage agreements that allow them to publish your number. Of course, just like their landline brethren, you know they will not miss an opportunity to CHARGE you a ""small fee"" to ""opt-out"" of the directory, which is nothing short of highway robbery. Plus, it won't really work. I was unlisted with my home phone number and I still got a voluminous amount of marketing calls between 7pm and 10pm.  Verizon seems to be the only sane company (I never though I'd say that) as they have expressed scepticism at the directory idea. Any company who opts-out of participating in this cellphone directory is going to find a HUGE influx of new customers over a very short time span. It would actually be a very savvy business move if they can resist the potential revenue temptation of sharing their cellphone numbers with the directory.  Here's hoping lawmakers step up to the plate and squash, or modify, this idea before it takes root and we are unable to escape marketing messages anywhere on anything we communicate on."

UMBMHKV,male,39,"The numbers aren't easy to find and barely any match up. Here's an  urlLink article  that quotes the Air Force as saying 11,000 evacuees have come through Andrews Air Force Base.  More than 11,000 medical evacuees have come through Andrews in the past nine months, the Air Force says.  Most, we suspect, from Iraq. But that's 8,000 more than the Pentagon says have been wounded there.  Most of those wounded in action come through the vast Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington.  The American public is, for the most part, unaware that the true casualty count of the war in Iraq may actually be higher than official figures suggest.  Here's another  urlLink article  that indicates a similar number but says the wounded came through Landstuhl, Germany. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center is the largest hospital outside the U.S. for troops stationed in Europe and the Middle East.  Some figures that have been briefly mentioned in the press fall in the range of two to three thousand. But in a story that received little national attention, the Pentagon reported last month that the military made over 18,000 medical evacuations - representing 11,700 casualties in the first year of war in Iraq.    As for Iraqi civilians, between 8,789 and 10,638 civilians have died since war began March 19, 2003, according to one group of British and American researchers that surveys media reports and eyewitness accounts.  Let's hope for our US serviceman, as well as Iraqi civilians, sake this madness in Iraq ends before too many more human lives are lost."

Make sure to pass around that Kool-Aid, Andrew!"
UMBMHKV,male,39,"Religious leaders in Saudi Arabia are  urlLink condemning  the recent terrorist attacks in their country in very strong terms.   Delivering his Juma sermon to the thousands of faithful who had assembled at the large mosque complex, the imam warned Muslims against following radical preachers promoting violence.  ""We strongly warn you against heeding misleading edicts that promote extremism,"" Sheikh Sudais said, referring to radical Islamist preachers who give their blessings to militants to carry out terrorist attacks.  He said the attack had shocked every sane and humane person.  ""Nobody will approve such a horrendous crime. It's a prohibited, nefarious, terrorist act.""   Why don't we hear that kind of talk from imans in Iraq? Why don't we hear that kind of talk from imans everywhere about what is transpiring in Iraq? Muslims are killing muslims in Iraq as well. Yet in the case of Iraq, imams plead for the end of the occupation but not the terrorist attacks that kill so many innocent muslims. Was Saddam such a friend to Islam, other than paying lip-service to Allah? Are the Iraqi people freed from his oppressive regime not better off, if not in the short run than certainly in the long run? When suicide bombers in Iraq detonate themselves at police stations, also killing innocent children should that not be condemned in the strongest possible language IF, as claimed, Islam is a religion of peace? Should not what the imam said above be true no matter in what country the terrorist attacks take place? In order to be believable when making claims that Islam is a religion of peace, we must first see equanimity in the way it is preached.  You just can't have it both ways. Either your religion is a religion of peace or it is not. Either you condemn the killing of innocent people, regardless of who is doing the killing, or you don't. I'm tired of two-faced Islamic religious leaders condemning violence in their own backyard as in Saudi Arabia but then only condemning the US in Iraq. I have yet to see any proof that Islam is a religion of peace since no Islamic religious leader has stepped up and has been as outspoken about denouncing the terrorist attacks in Iraq, Spain, Bali or the US as they should be if Islam were indeed a religion peace. Actions speak louder than words, yet Islamic religious leaders aren't even willing to speak out. It is truly a blackmark against the Islamic religion and an opportunity lost for them to educate non-muslims as to what their beliefs are all about. Instead they are content to let the horrible images on TV shape the Western world's minds."

UMBMHKV,male,39,"It was hard enough to go to any of the seemingly hundreds of fast food restaurants that loom within a 5 square mile of my abode after having read Eric Schlosser's   Fast Food Nation   last year and having recently seen Morgan Spurlock's ode to the gastric delights and ruinous health effects of fast food,   Super Size Me  . If anyone needed that last little push over the edge,  remembering the Swedish discovery of the cancer-causing chemical ""acrylamide"", created in high-carbohydrate foods when they are cooked at high temperatures, back in 2002 should have done it.  Now some intrepid individuals in California are  urlLink suing   McDonald's  and  Burger King  to force them to start labeling their french fries with a cancer warning label due to high levels of acrylamide found in them after cooking. They are pursuing this lawsuit due to a piece of voter-approved state legislation, Proposition 65... uses labels to ""help consumers make informed choices about products,"" which let the buyer beware of chemicals in food and consumer products that are ""known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Unfortunately for consumers, there is no practical enforcement of the rule.  Alan Hirsch, a spokesman for California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), explains. ""Acrylamide has actually been listed on prop 65 since 1990, for the hazard associated with occupational uses of the chemical, but its presence in food has only been known for about two years. Labeling of chemicals on the list, although required, is not enforced. ""  That's precisely why McDonald's and Burger King are being sued. ""Though it's the responsibility of individual businesses to have a warning for products on the list,"" Hirsch says, ""Prop 65 allows any member of the public to enforce a warning if there isn't one in place."" If the world's largest fry sellers lose, as many suspect they will, they'll be under court order to place acrylamide warnings in their California restaurants, if not directly on their packaging. Because fast food restaurants do about 60% of their business in the drive-through window, packaging labels may be preferred. With so many health organizations and scientists acknowledging the danger of acrylamide, every restaurant selling french fries should post some sort of warning sign or label in the restaurant, on the menu, or on the packaging itself, to inform consumers of the possible deleterious health effects of the french fries. It should also refer to any other foods which pose the same health risks. I can't make the best food choices for me, as a consumer, unless I am well informed about the impact of those choices on my health."

Your motto is: Its better to burn out than to fade away. You are extremely sensitive person, but dont want to show it in the outside world. May you even didnt realize it in the beginning. There has been a problem in your family and you dont get over it. Its lying like a shadow behind you and you cant see it, because you dont want to turn around. This depression runs after you but you are so long inside that you think you wont come out. You never thought about being popular but you get it because you are very talented .You are a genie, and can reach into the hearts of the people, but there is still this depression. Then you get these stomach problems and take drugs. They make your feelings even more extrem. After some time this satisfaction you felt for your music disappears. Your erratic mood  hasnt got the passion anymore . Then youll kill yourself with a gun, but youll still live in people minds and will forever.    urlLink   ~Which famous suicide would you be?+8 different,long results and pics!!~     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       LOVING ONE.

You have an angry soul! Angry Souls arent always angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold grudges. You probably often get in fights with your friends and family, and its difficult for you to understand. When someone makes a mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to those memories. Your very stubborn and your rage is known to everyone. Though you never actually mean it, you can say mean things in a fight and go over board. Many people are sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you have many redeeming qualities and those are that you are quite intelligent and smart. You would make a good businesswoman or lawyer because you know how to prove your point. You cherish the ones around you, and appreciate life, even though you can complain or throw a tantrum now and then. The good things is, you keep your emotions very outspoken, and are normally a very happy person because all your rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a state, but you, yourself as a person, are great.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla"

B0R7AW0,female,14,"You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what that can always mean, because it can be defined in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were the spirits of passed away people who are neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing when you expect it least. So hence, if you have a Lost Soul, then you are probably very insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box, you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont know your place. You seemingly dont have a place in society or an interest. You are a very capricious person, and are confused and frustrated about where you belong.

A98XKGK,female,24,"Wonderful Yesterday...   Yesterday was one of those days that nothing was wrong.  Everything was in place and in order.  Nothing was wrong yesterday and I had a best time even though I lack sleep. =)  I met my old taekwondo professor yesterday and I got a chance to actually go back to training.  All I have to do is find the friggin' place where he teaches during Saturdays. =)  Not only that, I also got my last salary in Miriam without anyone knowing I was there.  I also got my blood pressure, my blood sugar and my blood type when I was walking at the walkway in Greenbelt.  Now I know that I'm my blood pressure is low, I'm type 'A', and my blood sugar is just right.  At least the reason for me not getting fat isn't because of the sugar intake that I make. =)  And I finally got to finish without any mistakes on the song that I have been trying to learn how to drum in the arcade.  Finally I've got 3 consecutive 'S' with no mistakes at all. =)  That is quite an achievement for me since it has been a long time since I haven't been playing the drums in the arcade. =)  And since I still have a hard time in coordinating my eyes and right foot, it was really an achievement for me, even if it was only ""Ai Ni Shinoku"".  My next drum ""project"" would be ""Sakura No Toki"" (I think that's what it's called).  All in all, I really had a great time yesterday. =)  I didn't get to think about bad things that much and my mind was well rested. =)  That is such an achievement for me as well since my mind has been buzzing with thoughts, ideas, images, stories and what nots. =)  Anyway, it's back to the real world for me. =) But the memory of wonderful yesterday would stick in my mind. =)"

He drove around the area showing me good places to eat and hang out.  It was really great.  There was one coffee shop that was really great called CCF (or something like that) that makes good coffee better than any Starbucks or Seattles Best.  As we were driving around I saw Speed Zone.  It's a place where you can go carting.  I was really amazed and shocked.  At last something that I can do for my spare time.  And now that I have found out where it is, it won't be hard to go there in a while.  Wow! Global City is really a nice place.  It's really hard to go to if you don't have a car but when you're there, you'll be enjoying it immensely. ;)"
A98XKGK,female,24,"urlLink Click here for larger view   Don't worry...more pictures to come. =)  Yesterday I went out some friends of mine and we went to Enchanted Kingdom.  It was really great! I got to spend the whole day with them.  We arrived at EK at around 2pm.  But before we got there, we had lunch at KFC at a gas station near Susana Heights.  On the way we played a game called ""Fact or Crap"".  My friend Leonard won the first round but we never gotten to finish the second round though since we had lunch and forgot about playing when we continued on our journey to EK.  Too bad though, Paul was winning the second round. =)  Anyway, when we got to EK, we rode the indoor rides first and rides that have roofs on top of them because of the heat.  We were lucky too that we've decided to go on a weekday because there aren't that much people then.  We started out with bump cars, with Dino as our target person to bump all the time.  Then, we got to ride 4D(escape from Bane Manor) where you not only watch in 3D but also there are other effects as well like spurting blood and strong gust of wind. Then we went to Rialto which is more or less a disappointment after the 4D ride.  But the best rides that we got on were the Jungle Log and the Rio Grande.  Both rides we got wet.  We rode Rio Grande three times because we really wanted our friend Dino to experience getting wet like the rest of us.  We really enjoyed that ride very much that after the third time we rode it, the operator told us not to ride it anymore...of course she was only joking.  It was really great! I enjoyed it very much!  After that, we went to dinner at Leslie's in Tagaytay.  It was a great way to end the evening.  Our friend Paul took a lot of pictures.  He said that he needs to edit some of them first before he'll send me some of the pictures that we had as a group.  One pic that I really want is the picture of us right after that ride in Rio Grande where all of us were really wet.  That was really a great trip.  Too bad two of our friends (Noel and Raf) weren't there to enjoy it with us.  It would have been really great if all 8 of us went to EK as was the original plan.  Oh well, there will be next time.  But in the mean time, I really want to enjoy this moment."

A98XKGK,female,24,"So It Begins   War has finally come.  I just cant believe that they couldnt wait to show how powerful a nation they are.  Innocent people will be suffering because of the personal agenda Bush has with Saddam.  Clearly you can see that I still stand my ground that we should have talked about this first before any of this ever became a full scale war.  So much for the United Nations.  I guess the world isnt united anymore since theres a war brewing.  I really hate this.  People will die but these leaders say that its a risk that these soldiers will take.  I say thats a load of crap.  It would have been much better if people dont die at all.  More bloodshed that our children will see.  More violence that they will follow.  The future of the world will see that the only way to fix a situation is through violence.  Stupid US president.  Only thinks about his personal vendetta against Saddam.  He keeps insisting that they had failed negotiations with Iraq already.  What negotiations?!?! He didnt let the UN investigation finish, now hes saying that political negotiations has failed?!?  How stupid could you get?  I hate this war.  There is no basis for this war.  I really hate this.  I worry for the families of the soldiers.  They are fighting for something not worth fighting for.  I worry for my parents as well.  They are presently in Saudi Arabia and they told us that we shouldnt worry because its far.  But if we in the Philippines worried because we might get bombed as well, why wont we worry about them who is closer?  There is nothing to be done anymore.  I only hope now that it would be over and not lose people on both sides.    Heres another song that is very right for the present situation.    From A Distance    From a distance The world looks blue and green And the small cap mountains white  From a distance The ocean meets the stream And the eagle takes to flight  From a distance there is harmony And it echoes through the land Its the voice of hope, its the voice of peace Its the voice of every man  From a distance We all have enough And no one is in need  And there are no guns,  No bomb, and no disease No hungry mouths to fee  From a distance we are instruments Marching in a common band Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace Theyre the song of every man  And God is watching us God is watching us God is watching us From a distance  From a distance You look like my friend Even though we are at war  From a distance I just cannot comprehend What all this fighting is for?  From a distance there is harmony And it echoes through the land Its the hope of hopes Its the love of loves This is the song of every man  Its the voice of hope Its the voice of peace Its the voice of every man  And God is watching us God is watching us God is watching us From a distance  Oh God is watching us God is watching God is watching us From a distance"

Writer's Block   For the passed few days that I have been working here in the office, during my lunch break and any other break that I create for myself, I started re-writng the very first book that I made which was NINJAS.  Unfortunately, nowadays, even with the basis, I couldn't seem to continue it.  I still haven't finished Chapeter 3.  I haven't posted anything on fictionpress.net either.  I have writer's block again.  It really sucks to know that there is something on your mind that you wanted to bad to let out but can't.  It's really annoying.  I sometimes think that it's because of the depression that I have right now but there are some instances that I can't think as well even if I'm all happy and devoid of any problems.  I really hate this.  I honestly would love to finish the Ninjas story so that I can move on to rewriting the next Ninjas book.  I think I going to calm my mind now. =) 'Til next blog. =D"

A98XKGK,female,24,"Weekend At Home   It has been a long time since I just stayed at home on a weekend.  I am usually out during Saturdays and the family would be goind somewhere during Sundays.  But last weekend, I just spent both days at home with my family.  Not really doing anything but just watching VCDs and DVDs with my siblings and grandmother, eating spaghetti and burgers.  I usually wonder why some people would rather spend most of their days with their friends rather than their families.  I do not see the point of spending most of your time outside with people not really related to you by blood.  It's something that I really couldn't get.  I guess, I'm just lucky because the family that I have is really close knit that we'd rather spend time with each other than going out with friends.  Not that I don't enjoy going out with my friends, I really like it a lot.  I really love spending time with them, wacthing movies and eating out and just hang out, but honestly, it really is a different feeling spending time with friends than with your family.  For one, you can be really yourself with your family because they know you inside and out.  I know that you can also be yourself with your friends but there is still this feeling that you have to hold back at somethings even if you're really really close with them.  Anyway, I got to relax.  I mean, really got to relax.  I didn't think that I can get to relax like this...it's really a great feeling.  And the best part is, I got to spend it with my family.  We got to talk and tease each other and just be siblings.  I'm really glad that I am lucky to have a family like them...I wouldn't ask for anything else...well except of course a love life. =P"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Sayings and then some...    ""I already have a sword, not one made of metal.  The sword is inside me.  It is not a very good weapon right now.  It needs to be hammered into shape."" - Raistlin at age 6. ""Soulforge""    This is one of my favorite phrases in the Drangonlance Book ""Soulforge: the Raistlin Chronicles"".  As I remember correctly, this is the time when Caramon was convincing Raistlin to practice sword fighting with him for his own protection but Raistlin said no.  Raistlin was right though.  All of us has a sword that needs to be hammered into shape before it could be a very good sword.  It needs to be carefully crafted.  If we hurry in shaping our swords, it could never be a good weapon.  It would break easily when battle arises and we would be left with nothing to defend ourselves.  To shape our swords needs time and patience.  We should rush it because it will not be of any use if we did.  It needs to be molded carefully so that it would be the kind of shape that we want our swords to be.  It needs to be handled with care so that we won't hurt anybody with it.  We mustn't be careless with it because it's a powerful weapon.  We have different kinds of swords that needs shaping and wielding.  It is up to us to see to it that we mold it and handle to either help other people or use for our own gain."

I had actually thought that I wont be seeing him flying around near my chair claiming it for its own to make a hive.  Unfortunately, its back with a vengeance.  Its flying again one more time looking for a hive.  I honestly have to squirt him again with my trusty alcohol yesterday and today.  If this goes on, I wouldnt be able to work well because I have to look to my left and right just to check if hes coming to ruin my morning.  Mr. Bee is making my decision to leave this office much easier.  But I still have to look somewhere else before I could actually push through with it.  Honestly, this office environment where I am right now isnt conducive to me.  Now, not only will I be battling Mr. Bumblebee, I also have to put up with Mrs. Mosquito and Commander Ant with his battalion.    I have bite marks all over my body.  I cant concentrate on working because of all these insects thats coming in and out of my life.  I feel that by the end of the month, I will be nothing but a hollow shell because these mosquitoes already suck all the blood out of me.  Its really not right.  I cant get any peace of mind.  Honestly, I really need to be able to concentrate on working if I wanted to be stuck here and finish my contract.  With all the distractions that is the office I really dont see myself doing a good job even if the job is clerical work.  If my life wouldnt get any better  by the end of the month, I would have to take drastic action.  I cant stand it here anymore and its not even about my boss.  I might get malaria, or dengue or even typhoid fever because of these insects thats trying to make my desk as their homes.  I could actually start an ecosystem here already if Im not careful.  I have made a decision.  Later this evening I would be going to this meeting of people being asked to edit some document.  Honestly, I am hoping that the job would take longer than a month to do, that way I could resign in this job but still be able to afford looking for a job and going out with my friends even though I dont have a real job anymore.  I hope that job would keep going until I actually get hired by a company thats near my house so that I would actually sleep longer.  Anyway, the return of Mr. Bee got me thinking of whats been happening to my life and I feel that Im wasting it all away just because I keep on staying here.  I need a change and fast.

A98XKGK,female,24,"Test from emode   Mitch, you answered 22 out of 30 questions correctly!   Congratulations! Your score is in the 87th percentile. This means that if one hundred people took the test with you, your score would rank higher than 86 of them on average.  When we analyzed your test, we also discovered that when it comes to visual-spatial ability, you measure in the 70th percentile. This score indicates you have unusually strong abilities when it comes to spotting patterns in the world around you. You're easily able to envision things spatially in different positions, and this allows you to determine what spatial patterns are present. Compared with you, most others lack the creative ability and/or skill to imagine the movement of objects or patterns in time and space. ***  Mitch, your destiny is to be a Provider   Whether you know it or not, this is the role that is most in tune with who you are at your core. As a Provider, you have a genuine nurturing concern for the welfare of others and you're eager to serve them. You can recognize exactly what people need and your friendly, helpful, social nature makes them feel comforted. With your kind and generous heart, you are personable, talkative, and outward with your emotions, and your openness and sensitivity makes you concerned about the way others view you. Along these lines, be careful not to blame yourself when things go wrong. You cannot prevent bad things from happening, even though your tendency to be orderly with a strong sense of right and wrong may lead you to believe you can. Accept that you do what you can to take care of things and that this will get you far in the world.  ***  Mitch, your emotions are triggered by your underlying belief in Integrity   In other words, your uncompromisingly honest nature directly affects how, and how often, you experience certain feelings.  For example, your test results indicate that you're most fulfilled when you hold fast to your moral ideals. That factor is directly related to your fundamental belief in integrity and the range of emotions it triggers.  Based on your belief in integrity, where do you rank in the emotional landscape? Which of your emotions dominate your life? And how can you learn to control your emotions? ***  Mitch, your best quality shines through in how Intelligent you are!   The fact that you're a smart person who is more able to understand complex concepts than many other people are really draws people to you! But that's not the only thing. Your answers on the test indicate you're psychologically and emotionally stable and better able than most people to tolerate even the roughest situations. You are a person with a strong will who is typically determined to follow through on difficult demands and meet important goals, too.  In all, there are 15 qualities that help define you when you're at your best. Those are the traits potential employers, friends, and partners look for in you. What makes you unique is your particular distribution of those 15 qualities.  We've found that your particular combination of qualities is rare  only 5 in 10,000 people share the same general mix of traits. Those are great odds if you're trying to show a potential employer, colleague, friend, or date why you're exactly the right person for them."

A98XKGK,female,24,"EVA?       Which Evangelion Child Are You?    Have you ever watched Evangelion?  It's that weird Anime that literally ends up killing everyone on the planet except for two people (or so that's how I interpreted it).  Anyway, this character Rei.  She's such a silent child.  But even with the numerous times she was attacked and almost shot to death and practically died already, she's always there on the next episode.  Freaky ain't it?  At some future series you will eventually find out the secret of her always miraculous recoveries....but you have to send me an email for that since I don't want to spoil it to those people who haven't watch it but wants to.  Anyway, Rei is the kind of person who gets the job done no matter what happens.  But she's the kind of person who does it while following the rules of the game but still ends up winning.  How many of us tend to bend the rules jus to get what we want?  How many times do we have to lie to get the job done or just give some leeway to finish the job?  I guess we all need to find the Rei inside all of us.  If we actually want to be a better person or a better citizen of this dying country, we have to find a way to be like Rei.  We need to stop blaming each other and see actually start helping one another to help bring this country back to life.  Like Rei, we have to start everyday like we're a newborn.  We should start seeing things in a different perspective.  Evangelion maybe a weird series but it tends to give lessons about life in general in such a manner that you won't see until you reflect on it.  Maybe we could even find a way to use this Anime series to better our already corrupted and dying country. :D"
A98XKGK,female,24,"In Dealing with Pecopecos...   She met Kawangakid in Alberta.  After giving him some arrows for Ktk8, and helping out some lost wanderers in this land of Midgard, they went their separate ways.  Kawangakid went out to the forest of Payon while Kirsikka, stayed and checked out the local pub.  It was quiet in Alberta, there aren't much people there. Most of the travellers there came to the city by boat the same as she was.  She passed through some people she met on the boat.  One of them was very drunk he already fell asleep on the table.  Kirsikka caught a faint blue tint on the man's pocket.  She lookedround to check if anyone was looking at her.  When she found out that none of them was paying attention to her, she slid of her seat and gracefully glided towards the drunken man.  Without anyone looking, she quickly took the shiny blue object from the drunken man, paid for her drink and headed outside the pub.  She then went to an isolated place in the city, which wasn't really hard to find since most of the place in Alberta was deserted.  When everything was already clear, she started to chech out her loot.  It wasn't much though, just a few jelopies, 3 animal skins, grasshopper's legs, a poring doll and a strange grayish rock.  After poring over her new finds, she kept everything in her bag to be sold later to a dealer.  But she was still holding the strange gray rock.  It was the first time she'd seen that kind of thing.  As Kirsikka examined the strange rock, it instantly broke into two.  ""Dang!"" Kirsikka said out loud to no one in particular.  ""I broke it!""  As she was trying to put the two pieces back together, the world suddenly spun and I find myself on the other side of the city.  The people looked at me with curious stares.  They are probably wondering where she had came from.  She looked around the area where she ""landed"" and found herself near the docks.  There was a sailor calling people who were planning to go to the Sunken Ship or the Izlude Marina.  Looking around and finally deciding on what to do, Kirsikka went to the sailor, gave him the last  five hundred zennies that she has and headed towards the boat that would take her to the Izlude Marina.  The voyage was short.  It only took about 5 days to get to Izlude and when Kirsikka got there, she sold the items that she had previously got from the monsters that she had faced and that drunken man.  Kirsikka went around and found out that the gray stone that she got was actually a Fly wing.  It helps non-magic users to teleport from one area to another.  She figured that that might help me out when she gets to encounter monsters that she know that she can't fight against.  So Kirsikka purchased some of those and a couple of necessities that she knows that she would need and headed out after giving the nice lady Kafra some of my life essence to keep me alive, she left the city of Izlude and headed towards the city of Prontera.  It was an easy trek going there.  On her way there, she was battling monsters left and right, training herself to be one of the best thief in Midgard.  Kirsikka new to the trade, she hasn't even been stealing much.  Just trying to kill them and get the loot when their already dead.  Kirsikka knows that it's very disrespectul to the dead but she also knows that her skills werent good enough to actually try and steal from the monsters without actually getting caught.  She remembered when she tried stealing one time from a bigfoot...that wasn't one of her memorable experience but it's enough for her to learn that when you're new to the trade, you have to start small.  As Kirsikka was battling those monsters on her way to Prontera, she getting more loots than I could possibly handle.  When she reached the city, she enterd the some of the shops and sold her loot yet again.  When she was finished, she again purchased more items that would help her in her trek towards the City of Morocc.  After the preparations, she was ready to set out again.  Giving her life essence to the lady Kafra, she then headed out towards the Prontera forest where she started battling monters again.  Training did help her become more agile that the monsters barely hit her anymore.  She started batting out stronger monster that she knows that she can fight.  And while she gains experience from all the fighting, she has been improving on the attack strategy that she makes.  She knows that she was getting better.  And she loves the feeling of power as she quickly slice of Porings with her knife.  As it happens that Kirsikka was travelling in Socrat dessert when she encountered her first Pecopeco.  It was really a magnificent creature.  But she needs the monster to gain more training.  Inching closer, she tackled the giant beast and started slashing it with her Cutter.  She dodges and slashed with swift movements that the Pecopeco was didn't know where to start pecking her.  But it was really hard work.  The feathers of the beast was strong and thick that the cutter was having trouble slicing through it.  But after numerous attempts, Kirsikka fanally killed him.  She was proud.  This was the first time she had battled a Pecopeco and won.  Though, she had suffered much in the process, Kirsikka smiled inspite of herself as she headed to the closed palm tree and rested to get her strenght back.  Drinking some milk and eating some meat while she rested in the shade she regained her energy quickly ready to strike at her next victim.  But as it happens, she has come across a pair of Pecopecos on her way to Morocc.  Feeling that her luck was still at her side, Kirsikka started towards one of them and started attacking yet again.  But Kirsikka did not anticipate that the other Pecopeco was her mate.  The other creature started attacking her as well. not knowing what to do, she kept her concentration on one of them trying her best to finish the job and start attacking the next one but she was blacking out.  She couldn't open her eyes anymore.  She fell and went into a deep slumber.  She woke up looking at the face of the lady Kafra she met a few days ago in Prontera.  ""So, you're finally awake,"" the lady Kafra said smiling at Kirsikka.  ""You be careful next time.  I'll be hanging on to this until you are really safe from your journey.""  She continued as she held her essence in her hand.  Kirsikka thanked the good Kafra and headed off once more towards the city of Morocc... -------  Not much of a story but I hope you liked it anyway.  Feel free to give your comments out, okay?"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Birthdays, Friends and Whatever Happened to Mr. Bee?   First off, I would just like to say Belated Happy Birthday to my boyfriend's sister, Ate Yna who celebrated her birthday last Saturday, March 15.  And to my uncle Tito Dodong, who celebrated it yesterday March 16.  I was fortunate to have celebrated their birthdays with them both of which a day before their actual birthday.  Ate Yna and I ate dinner at a local mall but we were suppose to watch a movie that time.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to because she had to work overtime at ther job.  Tito Dodong celebrated his 80th birthday last Saturday at a hotel penthouse.  It's really great.  He doesn't look 80 at all.  He looks like he's only 50.  I really admire that man because he's really a good person.  Despite all the hardships and challenges that were given to him, he never cease to smile.  You never see him not smile even when his daughter and wife died.  He always see the better side of everything.  He never seem to judge and always see the good in people.  He's a good man and I respect him.  Anyway, for the passed few days I have been trying to get my highschool friends together.  Rocky, one of my friends asked for it so I was trying to get them all together.  Here's hoping that I can actually get at least 5 of us together on Friday.  Just yesterday, another friend of mine sent me a very disturbing SMS.  And honestly speaking, even though it seems that she wanted me to side with her, I would actually side with her mother.  This is the gist of the SMS.  She just got home from somewhere and she really wasn't feeling well that time.  Her sister wanted her to accompany her to a children's party at a neighbors house.  She didn't want to because she was tired and wasn't feeling well.  Her mother then intervened and asked her to go, even cried to her just so that she would comply.  Still, she didn't.  This got her mom mad at her.  My friend said that it wasn't fair.  That her mom was siding with her sister for no apparent reason.  She really was upset that night so I just didn't replied to her message.  I just let her rant about it.  But honestly speaking, (and I hope my friend doesn't hate me for saying it) I know where her mother was getting at.  I understand why her mother was insisting her to come despite her not feeling well and all.  And if my friend is reading right now...this is just my point of view.  Feel free to call, SMS or even email me to correct me.  But this is just how I see it from the SMS she sent me.  Anyway, just keep in mind that as Filipinos, it is important to be very close knit.  Family is really a priority to most Filipinos and it really is very painful for a parent when he/she sees that one of their children is slowly moving away...if not physically but emotionally as well.  Here's my two cents worth.  One, our parents have different ways to show us how important we are to them.  I guess that was just one way her mother was showing that she loves her.  Our parents show their love to us in the weirdest way possible.  I guess anger and pleading is one way that her mother was showing how important she is to her.  Two, as I've said before, Filipinos are very close knit.  Once, a family member slowly pulls away from the family, parents tend to panic.  They are afraid that they don't know their children anymore.  It's that fear that drove her mother to insist that she come with her sister to the party.  The fact that my friend leaves early in the morning and goes home late at night.  And when she goes home, she already goes to bed without even getting dinner.  My friend is also very active in different activities.  This even takes up her weekends.  So rather than spending time with her family, she spends it outside doing her activities.  I guess, it's just one way her mom was saying ""Give more time to your family.""  Family is very important.  It should be one's priority.  Always remember the saying that ""Blood is thicker than water"".  Friends come and go but your family will always be ther through thick and thin.  With all the hardships that you're experiencing, your family is the best source of strenght.  It's true that there are some friends you can consider family.  I have friends who I can really count on when it really counts but that's only a hand full and you honestly don't know if they do that because they really want to or just for friendship sake.  Family will always be there.  Don't wait for the time that you would regret not being close with your family.  Don't wait until it's too late.  Anyway, if you're wondering whatever happened to Mr. Bee, I never saw him again...I hope...  It turns out that he was trying to make a beehive on my chair.  Honestly speaking, it would have been okay if he made it at the back of the chair and not in the center where I usually sit. When he left to get some ""supplies"" for his hive, I quickly destroyed what he already made and quickly put acohol on my chair.  When he returned, he was I think wondering where his hive went and when he tried to make it again, he couldn't go down because the chair was wet with alcohol.  But Mr. Bee was smart and he waited for the alcohol to dry and he eventually started to make his hive yet again.  This really got me annoyed so armed with my alcohol, I squirted the bee with it.  It went wild, and flew towards me and then he left never to return again...I hope.  Still I fear that it will come back with reinforcement.  I hope that that would be the last time I would see Mr. Bee.  I don't mind having butterflies decorate my monitor once in a while...even dragonflies look cute but please...NO MORE BUMBLE BEES!!!"

A98XKGK,female,24,"Finally A TagBoard   After all the trial and errors that I had encountered, Ive finally gotten myself a Tagboard.  Now people can actually get to post comments and might get instant replies from me. =D  But I still keep the old comment board.  Its also essential so that people wont get confused in what topics they are commenting on.  My Japanese friend Mikko actually visits I think once a week and post comments on my work.  Those are the things I really appreciate from people.  I dont care if its a negative comment just as long as its a comment that can help me improve myself or the way I write.  In my past topics about the war, I have a jian to actually debate with because he has a different opinion about the war than me.  Thats really informative and really inspiring because I get to know how other people feel about the war.  Different opinion really help me in particular understand whats been happening in our world today and how they can actually improve out life.  I guess comments board and this new tagboard is a good addition to my blog.  Now only will I get other peoples opinion easily, I can actually comment on them with other people so we can actually have a good discussion going. =)"
A98XKGK,female,24,"I Got In Level Up!!!   I was honestly shocked last night because I got a call from Level-Up telling me that I would start working on Monday.  I was really shocked by the call because I had already given up hope that I would actually get in.  I even have a blog entry ready to post here today that I didn't get in.  Well, as you know, I wouldn't be posting that particular blog entry because I did get in, much to my surprise.  Now I am just hoping that I only get a Monday to Friday Schedule.  I really don't want to work on a weekday.  It's my ""Family Day"" and at the same time my ""RPG day"".  I really hope that I get the weekends off.  Or else I wouldn't be able to see my friends on Saturday and I won't get to spend time with my family on Sunday.  Hohum...I can't get everything I want right?  But anyway, at least I'm leaving that ant infested office right?  I wouldn't see Mr. Bee again.  Though I would miss the occasional butterfly decorating my monitor.  But I'm so happy that I would never go back to that place. =D  And it's all thanks to Level-Up.  Thanks Jay! If you hadn't told me there was an opening, I wouldn't even get in!"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Reflections yet again    ""You Catholics do not celebrate your religion...you mourn it."" - Selma Hayek, Dogma   Up until now, I still haven't solve my accounting problem.  I have found a way to actually fix it but unfortunately the Task Force is giving me a hard time.  I really don't know where they get the budget for  their particular sectors.  I have searched every single budget that was made for this project but I couldn't find where the hell did they get the money to adjust their budget.  It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.  Anyway, today is Ash Wednesday.  It's the start of the start of Lent (I hope I got the spelling write or my religion teachers will kill me) and it's also a start of fasting and abstinence.  All my life, even when I was a kid we have been practicing fasting and abstinence at home.  Even if I was only 7 years old at that time, we were not allowed to eat meet starting Ash Wednesday and every Friday until Good Friday.  It was like a tradition in the family to do so.  Fasting for us starts when you turn 18, hence unfortunately even if I really need to eat a lot, I have to refrain my self from eating rice during the day time.  So at the moment I have bread for my breakfast and lunch...here's hoping I get through today. :D  Anyway, the funny thing is, even though the Church has already gave the ""law"" of fasting and abstinence only on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, we still practice the no meat every Friday but we can eat rice 3 times a day...at least I can eat rice during lunch...hehe.  I guess we were already used to that practice and start to get ourselves ready for Holy Week.  I guess it's just my families way of joining in the sacrifices that Kuya Jess has done just to save our souls.  I remember my father when he was still here.  He doesn't eat during these times.  I only see him drink water the whole day until dinner but I never saw him eat.  Now that is such a sacrifice.  But I guess he has been doing that since way before since I know his mother, my grandmother is a very religious woman.  So I guess that she taught them the Catholic way of celebrating Holy Week.  I guess having a very religious family can do this to you.  The good thing about it is that you get very high grades in all your religion subjects and you actually get to debate about religious issues that have been wondering about all these years.  The down side is that friends tend to see you as weird and going over board.  In a way, I actually agree with what Selma Hayek said in Dogma.  We Catholics tend to give more emphasis on Christ's death than all the good things he has done to the world.  The Church just consider all his good works an ""ordinary sunday"" and when it's lent, we have forty days of reflection...fasting and abstinence...processions, salubongs, stations of the cross and so on and so forth.  Why won't the Church view this as an ""ordinary sunday"" and the rest of the happy gospels a special sunday.  Anyway, I guess I wouldn't really know what the Church is thinking.  But for me, I'll see to it that I can celebrate it as much as practicing Lent."
A98XKGK,female,24,"Damn Stupid Power Failure   Since this morning I wasn't having a good day.  All my hard work editing the scripts needed for the Non-Playing Characters for this online gaming hasn't been paid off.  I  have saved for the nth time only to see that after the power surge, there was nothing there for me to go back to.  I have to start from scratch yet again.  This is not a very nice start of the week for me here at work.  I wouldn't have minded if it was only one time.  Twice is acceptable but three times!!!!!  That is too much already!  I'm sick and tired of looking at the same script that I have twiced edited only to see the same script again, not change after the lights went back up.  What is going on?!?  This is so not fair.  I do a good damn job trying to finish my work on time and this happens!!! It's really not fair!!! I don't deserve this!!!  Why does it always happend to me?  It's just isn't right anymore!!!  I have been taking crap ever since the start of the year...I guess even before that.  I don't know how long I will last if I keep on getting this type of crap over and over and over again.  I don't know what God wants with me.  He usually tells me these things.  Now I don't hear anything anymore.  It's not like I've turned to the dark side or anything.  Maybe I'm just so angry about my life that God just wants me to blow off some steam.  Well, whatever his plan is for me he'd better tell it...or maybe I'm just not listening...  Is it alright to be angry at God for all the bad things that has been happening to me over and over and over again?  I mean, I don't hate Him, I'm just a stubborn angry daughter who doesn't understand what he's been trying to tell me.  Have I been ignoring him or something that he just stopped trying to get through to me anymore?  Am I that evil in his eyes that he wants to teach me a lesson?  If there was some way...any way I can talk to Him...He used to send me signs...Am I just blind now to all the things that he wanted me to see?  I still don't get it?  I still can't see the point of me taking all this crap...  But I will not be beaten. If this is a challenge from the Big ""G"" himself then I'm up for that challenge.  I will not take this crap anymore.  If He's testing me, I'm ready."

A98XKGK,female,24,"Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me.           I have heard that saying ever since I was a little kid and I had usually thought that this saying is true...well, I was just a kid back then.  Whoever gave out this saying should see how wrong it is.    Sticks and stones can indeed break my bones but words are much worse than that.  Words hurt.  It hurts more than the stinging sensation that any sticks and stones can do to you.  And unlike sticks and stones, the wounds that you will get from words will be etched in you for life and no amount of healing can mend that.  There would always be a scar that would be there forever.    Yes I know, physical pain can also give you scars.  But those scars won't hurt after they've healed already.  It would just be a vivid memory, something you will laugh at everytime you will see it.  But with those hurtful words, the scars still stings everytime they are remembered.  Those words will haunt you even when you thought that you are over it.  Words will make you suffer, and it's that pain that will never be over.    Words.  They really hurt.  Honestly, I would rather get hurt physically than to suffer psychological hurt.  It would be really hard to recover from that than the physical one.  At least the wounds that I will get physically, I will be able to see it heal.  With hurtful words, you really wonder when you will be okay with that.    I had my share of psychological trauma because of the hurtful words I recieve from people.  And honestly, eventhough I think I look okay right now, there would be a time when those words that had hurt me would resurface and it would trigger the pain that I had.    So next time you say something, make sure you think twice before letting out that thought in your head.  You may  never know that you will be scarring someone for life if you are not careful."
A98XKGK,female,24,"For the passed few months my body has already started getting the hang of the schedule that I had eversince working again.  I've gotten used to the fact that I have gotten more sleep and more exercise than I what I had gotten used to growing up.  Oh well, now I have to go back to getting the lack of sleep and still be one hundred percent at my best.  Sleep has become a luxury yet again.  It's not entirely bad though.   It's just one hour off my usual waking hours.  But still that one hour short of sleep will really take it's toll on me in the future.  One thing good about this new schedule is that I have more hours to myself in the office than if I'm on my usual schedule.  It gives me more time to actually be myself, work on the papers that I need to do, write the articles that I need to write and more time to actually do stuff that I wouldn't normally do since I would be looking around if my boss would be standing right behind me or not.  Well, I guess I have to sacrifice some stuff to get to where I am right now.  But honestly, right now, I really need sleep. -_-"
A98XKGK,female,24,And My Depression is Building...So Is My Anxiety   People in this office seem to think me as marble.  No feeling whatsoever.  The things I do just to keep this job.  I am in a verge of a nervous breakdown.  I dont think I can handle this any longer.  I dont even think I will last until the end of the month.  I want to scream.  But I dont think thats possible.  One thing because the place isnt air-conditioned people will hear me outside of the building.  HohumIm really depressed.  But now Im a little anxious.  I honestly dont like those feelings.  Anxiety and depression.  Signs of stress.  You might be wondering why do I have anxiety attacks and depression attacks today.  Its mostly due to the fact that I saw that my boss got to the documents that need to be signed that I made.  Im honestly thinking whether she would again scold me because of my English.  I cant take another insult.  I dont want to blow at her for all this anxiety panics that I am having.  But its building and its really scary.  Im so afraid of what she might tell me if I go in her office and discuss about the documents.  The pressure is building and I cant handle it.  I dont know what she would be telling me.  I am afraid to know as well.  I am so scared.  I might even get fired today.  My aunt cant help me here.  I am scared.  Im really scared.  Im not ready to lose this job.
A98XKGK,female,24,"I was watching Smallville last night and I thought it was just pretty boring until the last scene where Clark and Lex were talking about another version of the interpretation of the cave paintings.  Lex said that if a person has the strenght of 10 men and can shoot fire out of his eyes he can be the most powerful man on earth.  He might even end up being a tyrrant.  The person who will try to challenge him is a very courageous man just to put him to right.  What Lex said really made sense to me that time.  I mean, what if there was no Lex Luthor to keep thinking of diabolical things to destroy Superman?  With all those powers and no one to use them against, surely the Man of Steel would have thought of other ways to use them...say rule the world?  Whenever there is a good guy there should always be a bad guy to balance things out.  But what if the good guy isn't the one with the super human abilities?  What if he's just an ordinary human being whose only power is his influence over so many things trying to stop this super being who comes to destroy the world?  Lex has a good point that the bad guy might not really be the destroyer of this super being but the super being himself.   Without Lex to do check and balance, the Man of Steel would surely use his powers to do a lot of bad things just to get what he wants.  If there wasn't a Lex Luthor who gives Superman a hard time, thinking of ways to retaliate where would our man of steel be? Will he really be this good guy everybody loves?  Lex has a really good point last night.  It would take a really brave man to go head to head with a man with the strength of 10 men.  But head to head he did hence the arch rivalry between Superman and Lex Luthor.  If you think about it, Lex is the hero because he sacrificed being good just so that Superman wouldn't turn evil.  Criminal mastermind? I think not, but a mastermind he is.  And a brave one at that. =)  Superman has always been depicted as the good guy, the boyscout, Mr. Truth-Justice in the American Way.  But if you think about it, if Lex Luther wasn't there to make him depict the boyscout image, Superman would just be one of your average super villain.  Hmm...Superman, a bad guy...that is not such a bad idea. =)  What do you think?"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Mixed Feelings...   Today was one of those days that started out wrong but eventually ended up right.  This morning, my wallet was yet again got stolen on my way to work.  Honestly, I don't really care about the money that was in it for it was only P300.00 But in it were very important stuff, like my two ATMs (one of which is the ATM where I get my salary), the picture of my beloved god daughter, my prescription for my heart and blood, my medicard, my college ID, my Timezone card, and my Advantage card.  I got everything locked down and fixed.  I just have to get the cards as soon as possible.  Anyway, things turned out right in the end. =)  Well, that was the bad news.  The good news is, I had a first glimpse of what it would be like in front of the wheel.  For real this time and not the virtual racing games that I play in Timezone.  Honestly, it was really a good experience but I have learned that I still need a lot to learn.  It was really scary but this way, I am more determined to learn and really understand the importance of driving well and not just something that I would take for granted.  I see how hard it was to really drive with just that short span of time.  It was an experience I would never forget.  Anyway, I'm happy.  At the end of everything, I saw a bright light. =)"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Is It Really Worth All The Sacrifice?   I have been thinking a lot lately.  A lot has been happening in the office lately, things that I really don't want anymore.  And with everything that's going on, problem arises and more often than not, no one hears our cries for help.  Everything that the team had stood for suddenly collapse right in front of us and we're all at our wits end.  Most of us are already thinking of leaving.  But for me, I honestly don't know where I can go if ever I'll leave.  At least my officemates have some place to go to, I really don't know where to go from here.  Honestly, is this really worth it?  I've been working my butt out for these people only to be taken for granted.  The worse part is, the team is getting flack from all the wrong things management has been doing to us.  I really can't stand what they're doing to us but I can't do anything about it anymore.  Honestly, I've gotten more stress than any of the work that I have been doing for the passed years since I've graduated.  My heart ailment has gotten worse and it's getting much worse everyday.  Back when there were only just a couple of people in our department, we were happy.  We were having fun.  We did our work and we were proud of it.  We were even eager to work, waking up early just so that we can go to work right on time, or even before time.  I used to see people always smiling.  And even with all the problems with the servers and stuff, it's still fine.  Now, they view us as being kids.  The fun of working is gone.  Is this really worth it?  Is all this worth anything?"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Getting Myself Together   Wow! It has been a long time since I've posted something here!  Where do I begin?  Let's start with what has happend to me for the passed week.  Last week was hell week for us all in the office and I really thought that I wouldn't be able to get pass all of the trials that they had given to us...I also thought that I was going to lose my job...Good thing that I still have it right now, with added responsibilities and added stress.  But the best part of that is I get to do what I want to do with my life...you can say that I have found my calling. =)  Well, for the passed week, we have been going through some major changes in the office.  I for one can understand what has been going on.  A company that is slowly growing needs to have these changes or else you won't see any progress...right?  But the thing that ticked me off was because we need to do these changes quickly and with a deadline or else we will find ourselves out of a job.  Anyway, last week was a week of sleeping over in the office or my friend Christine (she's also my office mate by the way) so that we would be able to finish what was needed to be done.  It was really hard...though most of the time you will be finding us laughing and kidding around in the office instead of doing the work that needed to be done.  Oh well, I'm happy that was over...but the challenging part is yet to come I'm afraid.  I was assigned to be the unofficial HR personel of out department...(thank God it's not the whole company)...and honestly speaking, I'm a bit frightened but it's a challenge... This is going to be a test of the things that I have learned in school...and though I know what to do in theory, I still have yet to understand what I need to do in practice...looking at people's resumes are hard enough without having a personal bias against the applicant...now what would happend if I get to talk to them face to face?  I'm really scared.  Picking the phone up and looking for them to schedule them for an interview is hard enough as it is... The only people I really get to talk to on the phone are my friends...and I make sure that they answer the phone before I call them up.  It is a misconception that I enjoy talking on the phone...on the contrary, the only person I want to spend hours talking to is my boyfriend, and that I only just wanted to listen to him breathing (yeah, yeah, it's corny I know but what can I say?  I'm inlove with the guy).  But the rest, I dread picking up the phone and talking to someone.  I don't even like talking to my parents on the phone...as much as I miss them, there is something about the phone that is scary (too much conspiracy theory movies if you ask me...hehehe).  Anyway, going back to my original train of thought...I am scared of this challenge that's put upon me but I have to do it...I love a good challenge, so why do I feel scared?  Well, being scared is natural...if I wasn't scared then there is something terribly wrong with me (as if there is nothing wrong with me already.... O_o).  But as I always say, being afraid is one thing but doing something about it makes all the difference.  So, with that said.  I'm going to smile and face the new day!  I'm going to let everybody think that I'm not scared of this responsibility.  I'm going to face them and give the best that I can with this new responsibility...I can do this... I will not be afraid, I will face this challenge and smile because I will be good at it, I will be the best they will get and with that I might get the job as HR Manager....(kapal talaga ng mukha mo Michelle...)  So, shall we dance?"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Conversations with God      It might be funny but it really made sense.  If we think about it. Even though we have so many mistakes, even if we eventually do so many bad things in life, still God never cease to Love us.  We make mistakes.  We even ended up blaming God for the mistakes that we make but still he never cease to be there when we trully need it.  We have such a loving Dad.  I had always said that I can be angry at hime for one reason or another but I can never hate him.  Much like the kind of relationship a daughter has to a father.  Everyone of us makes mistakes.  But out dad never seem to judge us wrongly.  Instead, he tends to say that they love us still despite those mistakes.  Let us stop and think for a while.  Aren't we glad that our God is the kind of God that loves us despite the numerous times we let him down?"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Oops...I did it again   Here I go again.  I just couldn't seem to stop my big mouth from saying something that would actually has the potential to destroy a friendship.  What I thought was a way for me to fix things up, I ended up making it worse...yet again.  Why can't I seem to stop my big mouth from voicing out her opinions?  I know no matter how noble my intentions were, I just can't seem to stop being guilty of what's been happening to my friends.  Honestly, it wasn't my intention of breaking this group up.  Contrary to it, I wanted to actually fix things so that there wouldn't be tension in the group if we're together.  Instead I ended up with two different groups and the other group doesn't even talk to me anymore.  Though my intention was really a  noble one, without the hopes of becoming the hero of this little story, I only wanted these two factions to actually understand each other.  Contrary to what people think, I'm in the middle of this.  How can I chose?  When on the one side, my friends since college who has helped me out with everything and they never once judged me for my actions.  And on the other side, someone I actually gotten close to in just a small amount of time.  And to think that this person is a girl is a remarkable thing for me.  I was never close to my own gender, the only ""girlfriend"" I have is my older sister.  So, it really is a refreshing change to find people who are of the same gender and you actually get along with them.  Now, I might end up losing both because of this blunder that I had made.  So much for my supposedly heroic act. =(  If you would actually call it a heroic act.  There was this small wedge that wasn't visible before but because of me, I ended up making a huge ledge that separates one from another that's worlds apart.  For those who were affected. I'm really sorry.  My intention was purely for helping out both parties and not break them apart.  I thought I was actually helping out.  I didn't know that I would be the reason why it  got worse."
A98XKGK,female,24,"And It Keeps Getting Worse Everyday   I have been to the bottom of this hell hole and I have seen the core.  I have been suffering a lot and I for one has had enough of it.  So when I thought that finally I am now able to climb back up to the surface, fate has something different instored for me.  I find myself slipping back down the bottom and the foot and hand holds that I had previously found on my way up has disappeared.  Now, let me see... the job that I am in right now has been on the rocks lately, I have been bypass in a promotion, I don't see my friends anymore, and I still have financial worries despite the help my friend Jay gave me.  To top it all off, I don't get to play RPG that regularly anymore.  And I have this strange feeling that my GM doesn't want to GM me anymore.  Though, I don't blame him, GMing is hard work.  And I guess, he wants to play as well which he doesn't get to do since he's holding the game.  Some sacrifices must be made to please others.  And though I feel some recentment because I don't get to play with the usual people that I use to play with, still I consider them my friends despite it all.  I just wanted to know why I don't get invited to their games anymore though.  No offense to Christine, I really like playing with her but I miss playing with the people who gave me the reason to play.  I miss playing with the original group who helped me out when I was just learning the world of RPG.  But with those people gone, I feel abandoned and set aside like a piece of meat.  And with everything happening to me right now, that is not a good feeling.  Well, they have their reasons.  Though, I wish that they would tell me those reasons.  Speaking of which, I have yet to muster my courage and talk to my boss why I was bypass in a promotion that I know in my heart that should have been for me.  I am qualified for the job than the people who took the spot that was suppose to be mine.  Heck, when I was doing my job, they were doing something else very different from the supposed job description.  They're not even working most of the time.  But since this is all over and done with, I will just accept the fact that I was bypassed.  Though, I would really like to know why.   I am sick and tired of all this.  Though one solution is coming to  mind, fate yet again has some funny way of telling me that it's a bad idea.  Killing myself is not a solution to the problems that I am facing.  And with that knowledge, I have to think of another way out of this.  Dang! it's hard but I have to at least try."

A98XKGK,female,24,"Just Some Clarification   I just want to clarify something about the blog entry I did yesterday.  So my dear friends who send me SMS, thanks for your concern but I'm alright now. =)  Yesterday was really bad.  But it was just a ranting of someone who was really mad at three power failures while she was on the computer doing her work.  Honestly, yesterday was really hell for me.  I didn't get to do my job well.  But that was yesterday.  With all the bad things happening to me all I need is a pen and paper (well in this case my blog) so that I can rant all I want and feel better afterwards.  It's just my way of releasing tension, stress, depression and anger.  I promise I'm fine now...There might still be some issues here and there but it's nothing I can't handle.  I can face these challenges now because I have a clearer mind.  Anyway, thank you people for your concerns.  It was well appreciated. =)"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Panic Attack...""Which Way is East?""   This has been one of the most tiring day for me.  I have been running around the office, making phone calls, trying to convince the task force to give me their friggin' report.  I couldn't get in touch with two people in the task force and I really don't know where to get in touch with them.  It's almost five o'clock pm and I really don't know how many will be attending for Wednesday.  Sometimes, working for old people really gets on my nerves.  I don't know how to handle them sometimes.  If I get this wrong, I might end up losing my job.  I feel so dizzy, I don't know where north is anymore... My head is spinning and I really am annoyed by everything.  My work has been moved back and I'm fearing another backlog on my work for the following week or so.  To make matters worse, my computer has not been cooperating with me since this morning.  It hanged three times already and I fear a fourth coming.  I just hope I get through today..."
A98XKGK,female,24,"Another Song   Heres another old song that I just heard again yesterday.  Its a depressing song if you try to understand the lyrics but I guess its a timely song for me.   Tears of The Dragon   For too long now There were secrets in my mind For too long now There were things I should have said  In the darkness I was stumbling for the door To find the reason To find the time, the place the hour  Waiting for the winter sun And the cold light of day The misty ghost of childhood fears The pressure is building And I cant stay away   Chorus:  I throw myself into the sea  Release the wave Let it wash over me To face the fear I once believed The tears of the dragon, for you and for me  From where I was I have wings I couldnt fly From where I was I had tears I couldnt cry  My emotions Frozen in an icy lake I couldnt feel them  Until the ice began to break  I have no power over this You know Im afraid The walls I build are crumbling The water is moving And Im slipping away (Repeat Chorus) Slowly I awake Slowly I rise The walls I built are crumbling The water is moving And Im slipping away (Repeat Chorus 2x)"

A98XKGK,female,24,"Sayings from the Wise    Life is dangerous.  Just stepping out the door is dangerous.  You cannot hide from danger.  Death floats on the air, creeps through the window, comes with the handshake of a stranger.  If we stop living because we fear death, then we have already died.  -Raistlin at age 21, Soulforge    Interesting.  It makes sense as well.  I guess that's the reason why there are so many people who drink and smoke too much.  It's not about fearing death but living a life before Big G takes you back.  If you think about it.  There are so many people who fears death so much that they are so afraid of stepping out of the safety of their homes.  I guess this is one of the reasons why I like Raistlin very much of all the characters of Dragonlance that I am familiar with.  I can relate to all the pain and suffering that he has gone through because of his frail body and constant sickness.  But he never stopped achieving and reaching for his goals.  He never stopped dreaming to be the best that he can be even though he ended up turning evil because of his ambition.  Like him, I've suffered much mistreatment because of my weak health.  I have been the topic of discussion concerning unhealthy people.  When I was a kid, I would always be absent for about a week every month.  But that did not stop me from getting where I am right now.  Even with my weak health I tend to do more than what I can normally do to achieve my goals.  Raistlin was right.  If you just stay indoors because you fear death, you have already died.  If you stop living, then why do you want to keep breathing?  Life is good! Even if there are so many problems that you are facing.  Even if you have some difficulty in life, just be thankful that you're living it.  Just remember that you need to see both the bad and the good in life.  Gettin sick means that you feel fatigue, hurting your finger means that you feel pain.  These are wonderful feelings and you should welcome them like you welcome falling in love and enjoying the company of your friends.  Live.  Make your life worth something."
A98XKGK,female,24,"Drinks Anyone?       What Drink Are You?    This is one of those afternoon that I just don't want to work anymore.  I just want to go home and read a book or sleep (sleep...a luxury for me at the moment).  Anyway, I went to my friend's blog and took this test.  Contrary to my previous rant about internet quizes and test are a load of crap, this quite funny.  The test suits my just fine, hot chocolate is my favorite drink after all.  I guess, my friends see me as this as well (i hope).  You know, I never actually guess that hot chocolate conotes this kind of characteristic... Maybe it's because hot chocolate are warm and has a very pleasant aroma...much like coffee. :D  When you drink chocolate, you have that sense of satisfaction.  I guess that's the reason why the test said that it feels like home. :D  Try the test yourselves and see what kind of drink you are as well. :D"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Highs, Lows and a Congratulations   Im sorry for not writing something yesterday.  I have been busy with housework, and curing my cold which has become full blown with cough on the side.  Its not as worse as when I had pneumonia but its still awful.  I hate getting the common cold.  Its irritating and its one of those viruses that just doesnt want to leave quickly.  Anyway, to my low points first.  Aside from my cold, I had the misfortune of having friends who doesnt care at all.  Try as I might to understand their situation, they just dont see all the sacrifice that I do for them.  They keep giving you excuses and for the life of me I had enough.  Take for example my friend Rocky.  Last Friday we were suppose to meet to have coffee in Starbucks at Ayala Town Center.  Ive spent two weeks getting people to come.  Ive asked, begged even pleading on my knees for them to just drop by for all time sake.  I even told some of my friends that if they are financially not able to get there, Ill shoulder their expenses.  But still, only four of us came out of the twelve that was suppose to come.  My biggest disappointment was Rocky because he was the reason I spent all those times preparing for the meeting.  A few days before the preparation our friend Lea told me that Rocky was looking forward for our next gimmick together.  I responded by looking for the best date and after confirming from Rocky himself if he will be available on that day, Ive started making phone calls.  Honestly speaking, if Rocky just told me that he would be available that day, I would have just spend the rest of those two weeks thinking of good stories to write to fanfiction.net instead of convincing my friends to come with us to Starbucks.  I honestly would have understand, Im not that kind of person whos narrow minded.  Some of my friends that Ive called really told me that they would try to make it but still not sure whether they can of not.  I just pleaded so that they would say yes to me even if I would have to pay for their orders just to get them to be there on that day.  Rocky on the other hand told me he will be there, no questions asked.  He may be late but he will be there, so he said.  On the day itself, he didnt even try to call or send me an SMS to tell me that he couldnt come (or wont come as I have a feeling that he did).  Lea had to call him just to find out that he couldnt come at all.  We were already in Starbucks that time, waiting who would still be coming when Lea called Rocky and gave me the bad news.  That really pissed me off that night.  First of all, I wasnt feeling well that night.  I lack sleep, I had so many work that morning that I had to cram for the whole day just so that I would be on time to pick up my baby brother Louis from his office to go to Starbucks that night and my cold was becoming worse by the hour Ive spent working.  I already finished a roll of tissue paper from blowing on my nose.  But I still came because I organized the whole thing and I was hoping to see most of my friends that night.  Secondly, I did it for Rocky.  He asked for a night with his friends and I tried so damn hard to give it to him.  I called him up to say when it was okay, I even confirmed it from him if it was an okay date.  All the hard work I did was all for nothing when it concerned him.  Third, this wasnt the first time my friends did this to me.  When we were in high school I had organized my events countless times to be disappointed in the end.  One time, I was the only one who was there and none of my friends even tried to call me to tell me that they cant come.  Fourth, I felt embarrassed to my baby brother who had so many things to do that week and I just begged him to come and being a good baby brother and he really cant say no to me, he still went that night.  I was really embarrassed to face him when only me, him, Lea and our friend Dean were the only four people who came that night.  We were really hoping there would be more of us.  And lastly, Ive wasted good money just to call everyone there.  Ive wasted pre-paid credits so that I could get in touch with my so-called friends to just get them to come last Friday.  At least I know who my real friends are.  That would be the last time, Im going to organize a get together for my friends.  I not only felt I was being used but I also felt like trash that night.  All my efforts had gone to waste when I saw the usual people getting together.  I felt at my utmost low that night.  I was so humiliated and toyed with that I honestly just want to crawl into a hole that night and stay there for the rest of my existence.  It was really a good thing that my real friends were there that night and made the night fun and interesting despite the lack of numbers.  We even get to see and old high school classmate of ours and got some news about our old batch in high school.  The night wore on looking brighter by the hour making me forget that awful feeling.  We even ended up going to Deans house and see the progress that he has done with it.  I applaud my friend Dean for the achievement hes done so far.  To Dean, thank you for being my friend.  I raise my glass high to toast you of your achievements and being there despite your financial situation.  Same goes to Lea and Louis Dean.  I guess my night would really be really low if it wasnt for the two of you there.  You gave me a reason to enjoy the night.  And I thank you for that.  A toast to you my friends!  Youre the best!  Needless to say the next day, I didnt get to play RPG.  Not only I wasnt allowed because of my cold but I had other things to do as well.  And to make matters worse, Card Captor Sakura didnt air because the local network were its being aired was covering the stupid war!  Yes, I still did not change my stand.  The war is still stupid.  There should have been a better way to change this without bombing and bloodshed but still the stupid US president wouldnt listen to reason, his people and the Pope.  And honestly speaking rallies wouldnt help at this stage as well.  Last Friday my aunt was with those rallying people who wants peace.  As much as I myself want peace, I dont think a rally would let the rulers listen to what you have to say.  Youll just end up getting literally soaked with water being hosed at you or you get rained at like what happened to my aunt and boss.   The good thing about last Saturday is that at least I got to rest longer.  I got to catch up on my sleep and I feel better already.  I can breathe better and I think my cold is reduced to the sniffles and Im not coughing that much anymore.  At least theres something good.  Lets just say that its getting better everyday.   Last Friday I also got praised by my boss for the job Ive done encoding some materials she will use for a seminar.  Its really good to hear a praise coming from someone whos not a family member.  At least you know that its not because youre blood related but because youve really done well.  And I have spend the whole day of Thursday just to make that only to repeat it Friday morning because my computer conked up on me.  It was really a refreshing sound to hear a praise instead of scolding from your unbearable aunt.   Lastly, a big congratulations to MR. KIMI RAIKKONEN for winning the first place of the Malaysian Grand Prix.  The ICEMAN did it!!! And Im sure there will be a lot of commotion going in the Official Kimi Raikkonen forum because of it. :D He drove  a good race.  Kept his cool and followed his team.  He wasnt cocky.  Hes really great and I have new admiration for him.  Again, to the ICEMAN congratulations!!! We at the Forum hope and pray that you get to be World Champion this year. :D  I have another week ahead of me.  And I hope that it will be as wacky as last week. :D"
A98XKGK,female,24,"In Other News   I'm turning 24 at the end of the month and I can still be grounded.  Yup.  I'm grounded for 2 months.  I have to be home at 7pm at the most otherwise I will not be allowed to go out at night anymore. Even if it's really an important event.  I did deserve it.  After all, I am sick to begin with and they are just concerned about my health.  I really don't mind.  I have been having a lot of stress lately and going home early might help me out to relax and regenerate.  So I guess, it's a blessing in disguise that I am grounded.  At least, I will be able to rest a bit from all the shit that has been happening.  Speaking of shit, that's the reason why I have been coming home late.  There have been a lot of disgruntled employees that we really need to talk it out outside the office and just release everything that we need to release.  So that at least we can keep our sanity when we're inside that hell hole.  Last night...or should I say this early morning was one of those examples.  As I've said, I'm already grounded and I went to dinner with them.  And we let out all the things that we have been keeping inside and we just have to release it all out.  By 11pm, we were laughing again.  And not just any laugh but the genuine laugh of someone having the night of their lives.  And it really felt good.  After dinner, we have decided to take a road trip.  I was suppose to go straight home that time but I have this crazy idea to go detour to another officemate's house and just hang out for a while.  We also did update him on what's been happening.  And we were thinking of an action plan on what to do.  We have a vague idea now as well. All we have to do now is really fix ourselves up and just try to do the best that we can.  We really had fun that night.  Plus the fact that I get to see someone who we haven't seen in a long time and he gave us hope of a new beginning.  I just hope that that new beginning would be soon. =)  All in all, I got to relax and have fun again with people who I now consider real friends.  If this company has been giving me all the crap in the world, one good came out of it.  I have found friends like them.  And I wouldn't exchange them for the world.  Yup I am grounded.  But what I did yesterday was worth it!  For the first time in my life, I got to really relax and have fun.  Something that I have not done in months.  In addition, the reason why I didn't get to meet my barkada was because of that something that I've found out in the office that I really need to fix.  And here's hoping.  If it did push through...our problems will be more or less solved.  So I guess I have to ask everyone to cross their fingers... =)"
A98XKGK,female,24,"Another note on War   Well, I know that the war in Iraq is over but eventhough, I still want to put my two cents to it.   Ironic is when we go to war in order that we may have peace.   I found this quote when I was scanning my old notebook filled with it.  They are some quotes that came from different books and a particular radio station that gives Thought for the day before they end the program.  That station doesnt have a thought for the day anymore but I have enough to put on my blog for the next 10 years or so.  Anyway, back to my quote.  This is from Kurot sa pisngi.  And it actually makes sense.  Its like what Master Yoda said before in the Empire Strikes back, Wars dont make one great.  War is war.  I dont think that we can have peace if we do it by waging war against someone.  Its just not right.  You may accomplish something like making the other step down and surrender but in the end, they will be loathing you and would be waiting to extract revenge on you.  When they fix their lives and strong enough, they will come back in retaliation.  Vengeance is the only thing that would keep them going.  They would not stop until they have extracted their revenge.  Hence, war will break out yet again.  War will not stop a war.  You cannot have peace even if you wanted to if you start by arming yourself and go to battle.  Lets take the war in Mindanao.  Why do you think that up to now they still couldnt stop the Abu Sayaf?  They tell us that they are dwindling in numbers.  They say that in a weeks time there would be no more Abu Sayaf to worry about.  They say that their leader is already dead and that they have scattered.  I say thats a load of crap.  The leader might be dead but the hearts of the people who were struggling in this war has vengeance in their minds.  They had already lived life in terror and death.  They have seen their loved ones die because of the war that I for one dont know how it even started.  War is not the answer to have peace.  Didnt they get that when World War I and II were being done?  Didnt they just stop and think when the Gulf War occurred or even the Cold War?  And about this war against Iraq?  Now that Saddam is gone, where are the US troops helping the Iraqis start with a new beginning?  Where are the people who wage war against a poor country whom they accused of having weapons of mass destruction?  Where are the weapons of mass destruction that they are saying? I for one havent seen it in any of the news.  I havent seen any mopping up on the mess they made.  I thought they were going to liberate the Iraqis from the tyrant named Saddam Hussein?  Where are they now? Where is the help they had promised these people?  If this is the peace that they offer, Iraq was better off with Saddam.  I see people in panic.  I see people raiding shops, stores and even hospitals.  The only thing the US liberated was the oil that was very rice in Iraqi soil.  Now that the tyrant is gone, they would have no problems accessing the oil there.  You call this peace? I see people still suffering.  There are so many people who need help after the war, where are the people who swore to help them?  This is peace?  What peace did the US give to the Iraqi citizens?  I see more turmoil, more problems even before Saddams reign!  Where is the peace you Americans promised when this war started?  Or are we all right that all you wanted was the oil?"

JP2BY0F,male,27,"I’m in this class that over the last 2 semesters has been extremely time consuming. In the class you are required to make a covenant and goals and all this stuff to help you work on some of your weaknesses. Along with that you meet with a Field Supervisor (my boss) weekly, a Spiritual Director (a pastor friend of mine) Monthly, and a ministry support and reflection group (made up of people I work with) 6 times over 8 months. It’s a lot of paper work, but the intent is great and it has given me a lot of feedback on how people perceive me.   Today was the “competency interview” or basically what I thought was going to be a “hey here is all the things that you need to continue to work on” meeting. Instead what it turned out to be one of the most encouraging 45 minutes I’ve ever experienced. The meeting had my boss, 2 co-workers who’s opinions I highly value and respect, my peer group leader ( a convention leader that I’ve enjoyed getting to know through the process), and a guy from the seminary.     I won’t go into all the specific of what they said (cause that would feel really self absorbed), but they spoke words of encouragement about the things they saw in my life all most all of them positive and a few that pointed to areas of needed growth. But all four were tremendously encouraging and spoke from a genuine heart. Their words were very comforting and something I feel God ordained for me to hear today. Not to stroke my ego, but to remind me of the call he has on my life, words that are needed as I look for my next place in ministry. I officially have just over 6 months left in my current position and have begun to think about what my next move might be. It’s exciting and frightening all at the same time, but today I feel blessed and encouraged. Blessed to have friends that will speak truth in my life, encouraged by the fact God’s call on my life is noticed by those around me."
JP2BY0F,male,27,"Meeting Mosaic  A week ago I had the chance to attend a meeting with Eric Bryant. Eric is on the leadership team at  urlLink Mosaic,  a church in L.A. Mosaic is the next Saddle back type church, not it's style but it's influence. The pastor of Mosaic, Erwin Mcmanus, has 3 books out.I finished the first one ( urlLink  An Unstoppable Force  ) a few weeks ago, and currently in the middle of the other 2 ( urlLink  seizing your divine Moment  , and  urlLink  Uprising  ). If you haven't read any of his books they are MUST reads.  Seriously some incredible books. McManus is not only a great theologian he's an incredibly creative person. After reading  urlLink  An Unstoppable Force   I had the same reaction as I did when I read Purpose Driven Church ten years ago, before it was the crammed down our throats. He's on the cutting edge, most notably  I love his thoughts on creating a culture through the church.  But that's not what grabbed my attention in this meeting. What grabbed my attention was something called ""The Character Matrix"". Mcmanus came up with this when he was working in an inner city church in Dallas, back in 1993. Essentially the matrix is a lose paradigm to help people see what their character looks like. The Goal is to transform self-centered people into servant leaders.  It's one of those things you have to see, and I have neither the time nor the ability to draw the picture clearly, but  urlLink  Uprising   is all about this concept so read more there. But I write to say that I was very much challenged in that meeting, and so if your looking for a book pick up  urlLink  Uprising   by Erwin Mcmanus."

JP2BY0F,male,27,"Well here is my latest silly dilemma. Our Cable went out about 3 weeks ago. We never paid for it in the first place it was just on when we moved in. So when it went out 6 months later I was not surprised and my ethical dilemma (yeah I probably should have called the cable company and told them) was eased.   Well, Scott and I went out for an lunch Saturday. And the conversation came to what to do now. You see Speed vision is on and IRL racing season has just begun, so Scotty wants very much to watch the races. I have enjoyed not having TV to some degree. It's been much less distracting to not have much to watch. So my roomie says that he's all for it.  So here is my dilemma. 2 months ago I had a strong urge to buy an X-box. And pretty much made an impulse buy and got it. So now I'm at a crisis. I feel that I really don't need to spend the money on getting Direct TV (we decided that it's a better deal then Cable, especially since you can get the MLB extra innings. This would allow me to see 2-3 games a week of my beloved Cardinals!!!) w/TiVo. It will wind up costing me an extra 20-25 dollars a month. Which having just done my budget would be ok during the summer months, but with school in session it's pretty tight.  The only reason I would get Direct TV is to Watch Sports also I've heard of the greatness of Cable for years so that's 2 reasons. However, I'm just not sure the effects this will have on my spiritual Life. Any thoughts?"
JP2BY0F,male,27,"A few random thoughts . . .  - The Pistons won. And it wasn't even as close as the 13 point lead.   - I watched every game from start to finish starting with Game 2. The first time I've watched an NBA game since the Jordan era.  - It was a blast to see a team without a superstar. While the lakers did have more talent. The Pistons were definatly the best TEAM.  - Larry Brown is a class act and I'm glad to see him win. Acknowledging Rick Carlisle in your moment of glory? Are you kidding me? Wow.   - Speaking of Carlisle he's got to be the most bitter man in all of america. I mean honestly first your fired and then beated by the team that fired you, and they do the impossible.

JP2BY0F,male,27,"Last week I had the privilege of attending a disciple now weekend at former  urlLink youth minister's present church . It was a great weekend, where I had the privilege of hanging out with 8 of the coolest 7th and 8th graders you could ever meet. After the weekend was over I we took a trip to New York and Philly on separate days. It's amazing how close all those places are.  The last evening Emily (a new friend that lives in Delaware), Jason (a good friend from Ark and Seattle) and I went to Beautiful Citizen's Bank Park.     It was great to be able to see the new ballpark, but it was even better as it was my first game of the year. AND as if that were not enough they boys in Red were there to boot! SO I was pretty much giddy from the time we hit the parking lot. To add to my excitement I had the privilege of negotiating the price of our tickets with local merchants.   We got there in the middle of the first, which I was ok with because that meant we'd definitely get below face value. After passing on some REALLY good seats that were a bit out of my price range. I was thought to be a sucker by vender #2 (tried to pass off $22 roof top bleacher seats as between 1st and home), we wound up going with vender #3 getting front row seats in the second deck just inside the foul pole.  The stadium is a great place to watch a game and of course state of the art. Being in philly I of course had the obligatory Cheese Steak (my 3rd of the weekend) which I must say was delicious. The game was great going down to a 6-5 victory for the cardinals with Izzy striking out Pat Burell with the bases loaded to end the game.  The evening was a blast in large part due to the company, proving once again that the best things in life are those that your able to share with someone else! Speaking of which I have to grab a movie on the way home, as some friends are coming over. So I'll try and be a bit more frequent in my posting. I also have some things to process as my world slowly begins the transition process yet again!"

JP2BY0F,male,27,"I’m in a theology class that I really enjoy this semester. I’m actually excited to read my text books. Anyway, we were in class on Monday talking about Christology and the 2 person nature of Christ (human and divine). The discussion involved a very confusing section on Christ being begotten but not created. It’s a long subject that I won’t go into right now, but it was fun and mind bending.          Next, we talked about the fact that Christ’s humanness remains still today. I never really thought about it till that moment. I always assumed that he just sorta turned back into fully God when he returned to heaven. But in order for our salvation to remain so must Christ’s humanity. I didn’t have a huge emotional reaction, but it certainly has changed the way I see my savior. It makes me feel closer to him.  Something to think about.

The kind computers will be doing soon!"
JP2BY0F,male,27,"I'm a life long Cardinal fan. I started watching baseball when I was in 4th grade, I'd ride my bike to Chris McCloud's house and we'd often watch Ozzie, Terry Pendelton, Joe magrain, Todd Worell and the rest of the Cardinals. But they haven't been to the World Series since 87 and I barely remember any of that.   The single greatest trade in the history of my Cardinal fandom was the acquisition of Mark McGwire. He's still my favorite baseball player of all time. His run to 70 was one of the greatest season of all time! His rival Corky Sosa is a cheater. I don't like him and probably never will. Which brings me to my point.  There are 2 teams that I hate in baseball. They are really polar opposites of each other. One known for it's winning and the other for it's endless ability to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. Corky's team the Cubbies for whatever reason just irritate me. Call it the biterness, but if there is one team I want to finish ahead of every year it's the Cubs. The other team I hate is the Yankees. I think it's a law that if you care at all about baseball then you either love or hate the Yankees. There is no in-between.   Last summer I got to go to Yankee stadium to see my beloved Cards play the hated Yankees. And as much as I hate them I found myself cheering with them. In a wired way I loved what they had, the fans were so knowledgeable, they were so into the game it was awesome! Now, granted I will claim special circumstances, because I just happened to have tickets the night Clemens won #300 and K'd #4000. I came away respecting the Yankees and their fans, but still hating them just not as much.   All that was before this weekend. The signing of A-rod infuriates me. Because as I watch my team struggle to keep their emerging Babe Ruth (and Pujols is in that company by the way), while passing on a needed quality 3rd starter (Maddox). The Yankees add a guy they didn't even need! The Yankees payroll is more then double 4/5 of the league. It's just not fair! To add to the misery Arod is one of the ""Good Guys"", how can he play for the evil empire?? It's like your best friend just eloped with your ex-girlfriend. I mean I can't root for the Yankees!   So here's to hoping the Red Sox win the division and the Wild Card comes from the AL west!  Of course we always root for the Cardinals to win it all.  I'll post more thoughts on their division later, as this is way longer then intended."
JP2BY0F,male,27,"Ok so what's the pitching equivalent of staring at a home run? Pumping your fist after a K? Wagging your finger at a guy? Plunking a guy for the second time that night because you just lost the game?   Well I'm not sure exactly but Carlos Zammbrano, while a great pitcher, threw the biggest tantrum I've ever seen. Sheesh kid grow up.  P.S. The Cardinals have officially clinched the NL Central with their stunning comeback win today."
JP2BY0F,male,27,urlLink News   Wow! That's awsome. I bet the little girl is really proud of her mom.
JP2BY0F,male,27,"urlLink Myles Werntz   a friend of mine from college, and a fantastic writer, had a very thought provoking blog today. Read his thoughts and you'll know what I mean, but one line is a good jumping off point   ""This is the curse of our generation: we are forever Cain, wandering from town to town, never settled down, leaving our name and feelings in little places all over the map.""  I've been thinking a lot about this subject lately. Having not lived in the same residence for longer the 16 months since I left high school (I'm almost 28), and having lived in 4 vastly different areas in that same time. Looking for a job, again! (making this my 3rd job since leaving college) I find myself on the other end of the conversation.   I long for a community where my departure is not predetermined. I long for a place to throw down roots.  But I know that, that place will not be here. I must once again pull up roots and start all over. While the location could be as close as 15 miles or as far as 2,500, the result is the same, another new beginning.  This time it's different though, for there is a hope. A hope that this could bring the peace that I seek, the peace that comes with longevity. They say one key to effective ministry is being in one place for a long time. I want to say that my ministry was effective, the lives were changed, and that I my time on each counted.  And I want to say that my ministry was hard to distinguish from my day to day living, and at the end of it all God was pleased with the life that I lived.   But does that require that i remain in one place? I have no idea. The thought of living in one place for 30 years, is both comforting and suffocating at the same time.   IN the end though I have to rest on the fact that I do believe that God will see me through to the end, and that if I seek after him he'll place me where he needs me. A trite saying, but true none the less."

JP2BY0F,male,27,"Season Preview  Opening day is tomorrow . . . night (yeah I know). But I thought I’d give my predictions on the standings as I think they’ll look come this October.  AL East   Red Sox – 2 words: Schilling, Martinez Yankees – Starting pitching will get hurt Blue Jays – Would be contenders in any other division in Baseball O’s – Good additions still not enough D-rays – Lou will have them playing better then the talent they have on the field.   AL Central – Division winner may only have 83 wins  Twins – I like Loshe and Santanna Royals – Good line-up but rotation questions abound White Sox- Not enough pitching Tigers – Still the tigers Indians – Still too young to do much   AL West  Angels – Added a lot to a team only a year removed from a Title Mariners – Great pitching, just no power and too old. They’ll fade come September A’s – Bullpen is shaky and the line-up isn’t as strong as it has been Rangers – WOW, a complete mess   NL East  Phillies – A solid rotation and a potent line-up Marlins – Pitching is too good not to compete  Braves – This is not your Fathers Braves team. To many questions with the line-up and the rotation. The rotation could be the 4th best in the division Mets – They aren’t as bad as their record last year, but I just couldn’t see the braves falling to 4th. Expos – How could they give Vasquez to the Yankees?? They really need to move this team in a hurry. I vote Portland, it’d be great to have an NL team with in a couple hour drive.   NL  West – Similar to the Al Central just not bad. Any of 5 teams could win it.  Padres – New Stadium and some nice additions will push them over the edge Diamondbacks – RJ and Webb will hold them in there Giants – Slowly fading into the background, age gets this team Dodgers – Pitching is still there, but like the M’s they have no power. Depodesta will make them a contender, but not this year. Rockies – After Helton and Wilson I can’t think of a player on their roster, so they get last place.  NL Central  Cardinals – Yeah a bit of a homer pick, but I look at what they did last year and see that they’ve made significant up grades to their bullpen. They have 2 top notch pitchers (Williams was second in the NL in wins last year) along with 2 other work horse pitchers that will keep them in games. Combine that with the Best Defense in the NL and the Lineup the cards throw out and I just can’t pick against them.  Astros – Their pitching is un real, but Clemens (41) and Pettite both had era’s around 4 last year. Now they move to a park that is not Pitcher friendly. In the Last 3 years Pettite’s record away from Yankee Stadium is not that impressive: 21-14 with a 4.20 ERA and a .289 Average Against in 268 innings but a  3/1   k/bb ratio  Also they have an aging lineup with Kent/Biggio/Bagwell, they could but up big Numbers, but they could also age really fast. All that said they have 2 awesome starters in Miller and Oswalt. They could very easily run away with the division, it’s going to depended on the veterans if the postion players hit like they have in the past they could win it.   Cubs – Their pitching is great it’s the lineup and defense that are a bit shakey. Also I’m not convinced they have a solid pen. Last year the key to beating them was getting to the pen. The addition of Hawkins helps, and if Farnsworth puts it together then this could be a strong suit, but as I’ve said before. It’s the Cubs they find a way to lose!  Ok all three of the teams below are in a word AWFUL. The Reds have a good lineup if everyone’s healthy, but I dare you to name 2 starters in their rotation. And the Brewers and Pirates are both pathetic teams in nice stadiums.   Reds Pirates Brewers   AL Playoffs Red Sox over the Twins  Angels over theYankees   Sox over the Angels  NL playoffs Cardinals beat the Padres Philles beat the Astros  Card over the Philles   Sox over the Cards in 6 ( I hope I’m wrong)  I just can’t see anyone beating Schilling and Martinez in the playoffs.   NL MVP – Pujols (finally) AL MVP – Delgado  NL Cy Young - Beckett AL Cy Young - Pedro    A couple of additional thoughts.   I don’t care what they say Opening day should ALWAYS be played in the U.S.! Not Japan, Italy Korea Australia, Russia, or China and no not even in Canada. Nothing against those countries but it’s AMERICA’S past time. One of the coolest things about baseball is the tradition that comes with it. When I visited Yankee stadium last summer it was more then just seeing a game it was seeing “The House that Ruth Built” the place where some of the greatest of all time played ball. You could almost see mantle and DiMaggio in the OF or Yogi behing home plate. Same with Fenway. Please for crying outloud Selig don’t screw up Opening day any more.   •	As sorry a commissioner as Bud Selig has been you have to give him credit for the Wild Card. It keep more teams competitive deeper into the season, which makes for some phenomenal races.  •	That said how is it that the Marlins have more World Championships (2) then Division titles (0)?   •	I don’t care what the Cubs did in the offseason, they are still the Cubs and will find a way to lose before it’s all said and done.  •	Also, why is it that nobody gives the cardinals any credit? They had a horrible season last year and had some key injuries especially early. They blew a League high 20 something save chances last year, and only finished 3 games out. So all they did this year was revamp the bullpen and bring in a more stable rotation to go behind Morris and Williams. Suppan and Marquis aren’t flashy but they can win with the lineup the cards will but on the field. Trust me the Cards will be there come September.  •	How can the Cubs and Cardinals play their last series in July?? The 2 teams don't meet again the rest of the season. I don’t care if they are the 2 worst teams in MLB their rivalry is one of the best in the game and they should always have a series in Sept.   •	Finally, Barry Bonds is a cheater. Ok well I can’t prove it but it sure looks like it. At the least he’s my favorite player to root against. (Yes, I’m still bitter over the 73 season. Give me Big Mac anyday)    That’s my take. I’ll update it at the break."
JP2BY0F,male,27,"Gracefully kissing your knee   	 	Well I arrived in Tulsa yesterday after what seemed like the shortest six hours of travel in my life! I grabbed King of Torts by Grisham on my way through the airport and simply couldn’t put it down. Nothing better then grabbing a good Grisham book after a semester of forced theological reading (not that seminary’s not great, but books are better when a grade is not attached to their reading). Tulsa is about 90 miles east of my hometown of Springdale, AR. Tulsa is also the home of my sister Diane, her husband Chris, and my two nieces Olivia (almost 5), and Annika (3 months). They just moved in to a beautiful new home, and as such we will be spending Christmas with them in their home! My mom met me at the airport and informed me that I would be attending Olivia’s ballet recital that evening (which was actually more of a rehearsal with parents watching). Normally I’m not a huge fan of the ballet, but I’d go watch basket weaving if my niece were involved so I was perfectly happy! So after a brief stop by the house, we all loaded up and went to the rehearsal. It was a small studio and there were only 4 students and the teacher Mrs. Lynn. This was the first time I’ve ever watched ballet, other then the few times I may have run across it on PBS and quickly turned the channel. I came away very much impressed though in several areas. To start Mrs Lynn was sooooo graceful and beautiful in her dance. Her she was a lady probably in her late 40’s and she would run the children through the various exercises of basically swing your leg around from one place to another and moving your arm in and out. But Mrs. Lynn had such control and balance grace when she did it. It was very beautiful! The first time I really appreciated that form of dance. Mrs. Lynn was helped by the fact that 4 and 5 year olds are not ummm  . . . well . . . graceful, not yet anyway. In fact they often lose focus, and pick their nose or stare into space. Essentially, Mrs. Lynn was like a football coach that is instilling discipline into his team. She would gently correct the students by name correcting their movements, which they often still didn’t grasp, and reaffirmed then if by chance they did make the correct change. (Lot’s of spiritual analogies I don’t have time for right now that I saw in this small class.) It was neat though I enjoyed it.  The highlight of the afternoon for me was toward the end. They were doing some stretching exercises. Sitting on the floor in a sort of splits position (ok well Mrs. Lynn made it there, the girls did their best) the goal was for them to touch their head to their knees. Mrs. Lynn asked them to kiss their knee, and then demonstrated, by slowly stretching and kissing her knee, one knee and then the other. They did this about 3-4 times each knee.  Now the knee was supposed to flat on the ground, and many of the other girls being unable to kiss their knee on the ground would lift their knee and kiss it that way. No shame in that. But Olivia, did the coolest thing ever! Not being able to reach her knee either and in fact not being able to reach it by a good distance, she did what your supposed to do when your far away from something you want to kiss. She blew it. She leaned as far as she could, kissed her hand, and blew her knee a kiss!  It’s good to be home!"
JP2BY0F,male,27,"The Matrix Revolutions (WARNING The major plot lines in the movie are reveled, well the 2 min. that weren't part of the preview anway.)      If your going to the theater and want to go see a good movie check out ELF, or that new Hugh Grant movie, or better yet just hold your money and see ""The Return of the King"" twice. Revolutions while very good visually, in fact I'd say the best of the three, lacks any kind of real draw! As one critic said: 	‘ . . . while ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" might be technically proficient, they are largely devoid of the kind of wonder and storytelling that hooked us the first time. Simply put, the Wachowskis ran out of good ideas, and they isolated themselves so no one could point out their indulgence.”  The Whojahoski brothers (I donÂt care how they spell it) seriously disappoint us. All three movies lead up to answering the question of fate vs. free will. At the end of a decent fight scene between Hugo Weaving (who was the lone bright spot in the movie) and Neo, Weaving beggs the question why do you continue to fight? He throws out some great answers like Courage, honor, love, etc. etc. And Keanu in all his greatness says: “Because I choose too” .  What?? That’s it? Like hey I felt like having a tuna sandwich today. I’d like to be a dentist instead of an optometrist. What are you talking about? You choose too?!!!!! That’s your reason for saving the world? Wow, that’s Keanu at his best I suppose. There were a lot of other things that were messed up with the movie, but that was the most disappointing line in the whole series.   The other thing that was very disappointing was the fact that they called a truce. What?? Does anyone else see this as a huge problem? I mean how long is it going to take before the humans demand that the machines let their people go? The machines obviously can’t because that would mean they have no power and therefore all die. HELLLOOO! HUGE flaw in the plot there.   Anyway, the special effects were pretty cool and also much more seemless then in Reloaded. But I think the movie as a whole jsut doesn't ring true. The movies overall message just falls flat. I mean hey nothing gets you through the day like well I chose to. That is what gives me meaning, he might as well have said I think therefore I am or some other load of crap like that.   See it if your dying to know what happens other wise borrow your neighbors copy when your bored next summer."

If the movie were true (which it’s not), then George W. should be hanged on Pennsylvania Ave.  I’m not saying that Bush has never lied or that he is a saint.

JP2BY0F,male,27,"urlLink         Having the just gone through the finacial crunch of the holidays, the weekends have been . . . well . . . thrifty. So I find myself watching  urlLink Star Wars  after a very good dinner. Scott (my room mate) cooked a great dish called Swiss Steak, a wonderful combination of beef, covered in flower and tomato sauce, along , with a potato and a side of green peas. Ummm Ummm good. Sooo a Saturday night at home with Star Wars is the course for the evening.  It reminded me though of my college days when  urlLink Star Wars  was re-released into the Theaters. I remember a bunch of us got tickets to see it on a Saturday. Yep that's right we paid perfectly good money to see a movie we could have rented collectively at about 1/30th of the cost, but that's another post. I remember watching the movie and trying to think like those that saw it for the first time in 1979. How would a 21 year old in 1979 have seen this show? How would they have received it?  Now it is important to know that I grew up with Star Wars as one of my earliest memories. So I don't remember a time in which it did not exist. The world of the rebels fighting the federation, Luke, Darth Vader, and Princess Lea, were fond memories. We played Star Wars instead of Cowboys and Indians. So for me the world of star wars was like a history almost. I just accepted it.  I concluded that I have no idea how this film ever made it there were huge risks and crazy worlds. All of which the audience had no idea what was going on. However it did have one thing which I could not duplicate. That was technology. The Special effects were revolutionary at the time, and now watching them 15 years later I had seen the SPFX advance so much things looked a lot cheesier.  It was only until  I saw ""The Matrix"" (yeah I know the sequels were disappointing, but were focusing just on the first movie not the trilogies) in the theater sometime later that I realized what those viewers must have thought. A totally new world with revolutionary SPFX. When I walked out of the Matrix I wasn't sure what I thought, but I thought it was pretty cool.

JP2BY0F,male,27,"I spent my time this weekend in School of all places. And oddly enough I thought it was not only productive but actually enjoyable! It's odd to my that now that I can actually see the end of my schooling days (spring of '05) I find myself enjoying it more then I ever have in my life.   Before class we were required to read Now, Discover your Strengths, an interesting book that essentially says we should focus on our strengths instead of always trying to fix our imperfections. Andy Stanley talks about this same idea in Next Generation Leader (a must read by the way), but this book fleshes it out more and gives you tools to identify your strengths. The concept is good and something I’m going to try and work harder at implementing in my life.  Most of the class however was focused developing our personal calling statement. This is a three part process that combines your Biblical purpose Statement, your core Values and Your personal Vision Statement. I absolutely loved this process because it allowed me to really sort through where I’m headed. My position with the association ends in December so I have to decide what I’m going to do when I’m done. This class coupled with a conversation I had with my new boss last week have really brought a lot of clarity to my direction, but the details are still well . . . yet to be resolved.   The long and short of it is  I feel like God is calling me back to the local church, but has still given me heart to  help other Youth Ministers. Soo this is what I have so far.   My Personal Calling Statement  Biblical Purpose Statement I exist to bring God Glory; by being a man who places obedience to Christ and a love for others over my own desires.   Vision Statement I see a day when God’s call in my life will bring about . . .  . . . my passion for Christ overflowing into the lives of 6-8 people in discipling relationships; which produce passionate Christ following disciples. I see relationships with lost people, established through involvement in community sports, which produce new believers.   . . . a student ministry where adult and student leaders equip futures leaders to do the work of the ministry.   . . .  networks of Youth ministers across the Puget Sound, that work together to reach students and encourage one another.  . . . a seminary degree, that has given me a love of learning and a continued desire for growth.  . . . a wife whom I minister along side of and children which we raise to passionately seek after Christ."

JP2BY0F,male,27,"This makes 2 Saturdays in a row that I've had the joy of climbing everyone's favorite volcano. Last Saturday Heather and I went up the Paradise side. Well that is to say we did about 4 miles of hiking on 2 trails. There was a ton of snow and some nice views. The hikes were moderate with some elevation but nothing horribly difficult.  Today, However I went with Brian, DJ and Steve. WoW!!! We did approximately 10 miles (maybe more) in about 5 hours. This may not be a lot for the experienced hiker (which I'm not), but for me it required a hot shower a 2 hour nap and an evening with my feet up. It was Brutal. I loved the hike up the mountain, but coming down my feet were killing me with about 3 miles left.   Normally, if I'm tired I'm going to take a breather and easily mosy down the mountain. However today DJ and Brian had to be at work by 5. So after coming up short of making Mystic Lake (we only had about a half mile to go too!) We decided that we had to turn back or make the fellas late. So after 3 hours of hiking up the mountain we needed to be back in 2. Fortunately we were headed down hill for most of the way.  We made it, and I'm glad I got pushed like I did it was a great workout, but I'm definitely feeling it this evening.  Anyway, I'm a officially a big hiking fan and intend to make more visits in the future."
JP2BY0F,male,27,"School was canceled yesterday so we could attend the Evangelism Conference (yeah we Baptist are so creative with our names). Henry Blackaby was the Key note speaker along with John Franklin (a guy from Life way who did an excellent job as well). Blackaby spoke on 1 John 1:1-4   That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our joy complete.  1 John 1:1-4 (NIV)  He made a statement that resonated with the core of what I believe. “Eternal life has come to mean getting to go to Heaven when you die; but the Bible says that’s not Eternal life.” Eternal Life according to verse 2 is a relationship! So you and I can have eternal life today!   He went on to explain the reason so many of us don’t witness. Again, his message was  life a tuning fork in my ears, only it started to get painful. We can not bear witness to that which we have not, or in some cases are not, experiencing. In other words if we are experiencing a close intimate relationship your just going to tell others about it. If your not then your going to have to force yourself, or simply remain silent. Ouch!! That’s hard for me to hear, but it’s absolutely true. Which means I need to do some re-evaluating"

UNATEZM,female,24,"I got my hair cut on Monday, for the first time in months. This time, throwing caution to the wind, I got it cut into an actual ""style,"" rather than just getting the ends trimmed. I now have what I believe is know as ""long layers."" It looks vaguely like  urlLink this .The bottom layer of hair is about two inches longer than the next layer up, and the top layer is probably 1.5 inches longer than that. No bangs, but the sides are shorter than the back. Thankfully, it is all still long enough to go up, so I have that going for me.  The problem with me having a hairstyle is that I don't really know HOW to have a hairstyle. So far I've been putting some straightening lotion stuff in it when it's wet (my first use of ""product"" in at least five years) and combing it out straight. My idea was that this would keep it from being puffy on the top  layer and frizzy at the ends. Results have been very mixed. It looks a lot better a day or so after being wet (I let it dry naturally and even with the straightening goop it's frizzier than I'd like). So my question is this: is there anything I can do to give it that flatter, day-after washing look every day? I can't just not wash it on most days, because of the whole working out and sweating thing.  Also, I want some color advice. What I have now is pretty basic dark brown with some splotchy leftover highlights. I want to do something funkier, but still look employable. Ideas?"

UNATEZM,female,24,"It's easy-peasy, as Jamie Oliver the cutie-boy says, so go for it: First mix up your salts. The kind you use really depends on what texture you are going for. I usually use about 1/2 espsom salts, 1/2 sea salt, and a good amount of baking soda. Mix all that together. Add a bit of vegetable glycerin (about a teaspoon for every two cups of salt, I think). You get get vegetable glycerin at a health food store, generally. Then add essential oils and colors of your choice. The color is the hardest part, because liquid color (I use food coloring, because I'm cheap, but you can get special soap colorant at a craft store) doesn't adhere very evenly to salt. The best thing to do, I think, is to mix and mix and mix and mix with your hands to get the color as evenly distributed as possible, and even then larger grains of salt are going to hold more color than smaller ones, so don't be too much of a perfectionist. Scent is really to your liking--I use a little 1/6 dram sample vial of a scent for about 4-6 cups of salts, but it depends on the flavor. You want the smell to be fairly strong when you are mixing it up, because otherwise you have to use too many salts at a time, and the smell seems to fade over time.  For containers, you can use whatever, but my current favorite are old glass containers from the Goodwill, particularly the heavy glass type with latching lids like folks keep coffee and stuff in.  I think I'm going to try sugar body scrub next, so I'll let you know how that goes."

UNATEZM,female,24,"Hello, I'm Grace and I'm an alcoholic.  Well, not really, but that's where I wanted to start, because what I am thinking about this morning is the words we use to identify ourselves. I'm very uncomfortable with AA for a ton of reasons, but one of those reasons is the sentance above--I don't like the idea of ""an alcoholic"" being the first term you use to identify yourself. In fact, I'm not sure I like terms used as identifying markers at all, especially when they get long and complex and they don't really fit.  I will take myself as an example. Here are some terms that could be used to identify me: -woman -female -feminist -bisexual -monogamous -dog-owner -non-mother -white -Oregonian -Texan -student -non-profit employee -Virgo -INTJ  The list could go on, but that's enough for now. When I look at this list of terms, though, it says absolutely NOTHING about me. These are just easy identifiers, words that people can make easy associations with--they aren't me. They certainly aren't when taken seperately, but even the whole list doesn't say a whole hell of a lot.  So why are people so damn attached to their identifying words? When we describe a friend to a third person, do we relate a story or something that reveals who the person really is to us? Usually not. Usually we say, ""my friend X, who is a ____ from _____ and is married to _____ and has _____."" We use easily definable characteristics--sometimes sexuality or nationality, sometimes physical characteristics, sometimes job status, sometimes things that are even more arbitrary. But do these signify anything real or true about the person we're describing? What about when we're describing ourselves? If I say I'm a 24 year-old student/non-profit employee, originally from Oregon but transplanted to Texas, who lives with my partner and my dog, that seems like it should give quite a bit of info, but does it really tell you anything?"
UNATEZM,female,24,"This is my life, and I control it. I am not morally obligated to continue interactions that provide me only with pain and not with sustanence.  In fact, I have an obligation  to myself  to remove myself from those situations, whether the come from family, friends, work, whatever.    Amazing how many times I seem to need to learn this one."
UNATEZM,female,24,"When I first started reading the Ms. Magazine message boards (three years ago? Four?), it was with a mixture of awe and disgust. Some of what I saw going on there was amazing, awe-inspiring—it was online feminism, women connecting with one another with no regard for the boundaries of race or age or nationality or physical proximity. It was wonderful. Usually, the disgust followed the awe pretty closely, though, because the nasty undercurrent was there from the beginning. However, I was so enraptured by what I was seeing that my initial skepticism wore off and after awhile I felt like a real member of the community. I put my shyness and feelings of inadequacy aside and I jumped in and started posting.  I was an active member there for two and a half years, and much as I hate to say this, much as I know it makes me sound like a Republican pundit on TV talking about the decline of family values in America, I watched it decline. What had been a pervasive but generally ignorable undertone of racism, misogyny, and joy in the pain of other women when I started out became something much darker, and it clouded the waters over and over again. Every time there was clarity or a brief reprieve, I hoped that my community was on the way back up, and every time I was disappointed.  I could spend thousands and thousands of words giving examples of the horrible things that went down at Ms., but I’ll limit myself for your sake as well as my own. Basically, a small group of women calling themselves “radical feminists” made their presence known in nearly every thread, and they made it known in the most hurtful and vile of ways possible. There are only half a dozen to a dozen of these women there, but they have for years now spewed hatred with a consistency and determination that would be laudable if it were dedicated to actual feminist activity. Lowlights include various racist and anti-Semitic comments, horrible class bias, and intolerance bordering on hatred of women with non-lesbian sexualities, but the worst thing was always the general nastiness pointed towards posters who had been deemed “non-radical” and apparently not fit for human form. Examples of this include telling a board member the world would be better of if she committed suicide, referring to mothers on the board as “breeders” and worse, questioning not only the feminism, but the humanity of nearly every post some of us made for months. There is no way I can count the number of times one of the few women in this destructive pod wrote something to me that had me in tears, and I don’t cry easily. And I am not alone, either. I am one among dozens of women who were routinely abused in exactly this fashion in what they had come to depend upon as their community online.  After months of attempting to fight this and seeing more and more of the posters I really respected wisely jump from the boards like they were a sinking ship, in October of last year I finally gave up, left, and started The Phoenix. The Phoenix has been wonderful for these past months, providing me and a lot of other women with a safe feminist space. It doesn’t and probably never will have half the traffic Ms. did, so it suffers from a greater skewing in age, race, nationality, etc. that I regret and want to try to fix, but the environment there is almost wholly positive and I am proud to have created it.  Since I left, things at Ms. seem only to have gotten worse. I have lurked there from time to time but haven’t posted much if it all. The moderation was always spotty—sometimes there daily, sometimes no presence for weeks, etc.—but it seems to have worsened considerably, including the bannings of some wonderful long-time posters for infractions that were retaliatory, at worst. Having lost contact with some of these women, I truly hope that they have found better communities elsewhere. The moderators have also persistently refused to hear complaints about the core group of so-called “radical feminists” who have caused all of these problems.    Recently, the situation escalated in a way I wouldn’t have thought possible. A long-time board poster committed suicide, and board members turned this tragedy into one more excuse for in-fighting, back-stabbing and brutality towards one another. My level of disgust now is as high as it was when I left, even after having six months to cool down. This is NOT a feminist space. It is quite simply a catfight. If the patriarchy had planned it themselves they couldn’t have done it any better—it’s women as women’s worst enemy, and when we’re all busy destroying each other, who is left to destroy them?  For these past months, I’ve had this back-of-my-mind hope that the place would return to the “mostly-good” state in which I found it years ago, and that all of us who abandoned ship could go back and rebuild it. But that’s not going to happen. What could be a locus of hope, communication, strength, activism and friendship for women from all walks of life, worldwide, is nothing more than a mud pit, where women go to beat up on each other, sling filth at one another, and generally participate in the destruction of their own sex, all for the pleasure of what I really hope is an imaginary audience. But what if it’s not? These boards are open, and the women there are happy to give any lurkers all the inside help they need in defeating a feminist movement that still—perhaps now more than ever—desperately needs all of our strength.  This is the part where I’m supposed to say what I have learned from all this and how it’s made me a better person, but I’m honestly not sure it has. Because of the creation of The Phoenix, and because of the excellent friends I’ve made through Ms., I do feel as if something good has come out of it, but as far as my growth as a feminist, I suspect my participation there has been counterproductive. I used to trust other women more than I do now. I used to like other women more than I do now. And I want my old self back."
UNATEZM,female,24,"Deep breath.  I talked to Emily on the phone a bit ago. It sounds like her mom is very sick. Dying, probably. And there is nothing I can say about that that will make it any better. I wish I could, but I can't. Still, I thought I'd call and at least let her know I am thinking about her and I am here if she wants or needs to talk. Now that I'm off the phone, of course, I can think of a few things I wish I had said. Something about how it feels to watch someone you love die of cancer, and I know that, because I have seen it a couple of times now. Something about how even though I've seen it, I can't imagine it happening to my mother. Something about how my mom is the single most important person who will ever be in my life and I can't even fucking comprehend anything like this happening to her.  But perhaps it is better that I did not say any of those things. Instead, I asked questions about the prognosis, about the trajectory of events. I think I did that because sometimes talking about things makes it easier--going over the details is something you can sort of control, you can speak about it calm, measured terms. It's easier than how you feel, it's easier than what you are afraid of.   I don't know, though. Maybe I shouldn't have called at all. I really have no idea. I know there is no way I can help.  Crying, now, for Emily and her mom. And for Papa Gene, who I still miss, though I wasn't old enough to understand I was saying goodbye to him when I was. And for Grandpa Davie, to whom I was old enough to say goodbye, and that doesn't make me miss him any less.  I am so glad that Emily has her God. I don't know how helpful He(he? she?) is in all this, but I think this kind of situation is one of the best arguments for keeping the faith.  I wish I had some faith I could keep with her. I wish I could pray so I could pray for her. But I can't, so I guess I'll just keep writing."

So when a couple for whom I actually have some positive feeling breaks up, it makes me question whether or not I believe in fairy tales.  If that makes any sense, which, now that I write it down, it doesn't.  To further humiliate myself, I will admit that I hope Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are very happy as well.

So all I have to figure out is how to get from here to Dallas and back for the flight (and I'm sure there will be carpools for that). So that's exciting. I think it will be a really re-energizing feminist experience. Or at least I'm hoping so, because I could really fucking use one of those sometime soon.  The Phoenix really does drain me. I really want it to realize its full potential, but my hope of that actually happening gets slimmer with every ridiculous in-fight. And nobody is immune, you know? It's not just people I don't like who are tempted to get in their jabs, is folks I really do like as well (and I'm certainly not above a low blow or two myself, to be fair in taking my part of the blame). I don't know why we like to shit on each other, but for some reason we do, and that really disturbs me. Is it just that this is how women in our society are taught to treat each other? Is this what happens in all frustrated progressive circles (I'm thinking of the New Left infighting now, or the gender problems and other problems in the Civil Rights Movement)? Or is it a problem with online communication in general, and none of us would do this in real life? I don't know what to blame it on, but I know it exhausts and depresses me, and some days, like today, I feel better if I just stay away (which is an abdication of responsibility that makes me feel guilty, but whatever, you can't win 'em all).  I'm beginning to worry myself a little bit with the diet/weight loss thing. I don't want to be turning into a calorie counter who sucks the joy out of food, you know? It shouldn't be a point of personal pride to me that I am down 9 pounds, because those are just numbers on a scale, and it shouldn't be a point of pride either that I burned 1000 more calories than I consumed today. I should be focusing on how I feel (which is actually pretty damn good, but I think that is due almost entirely to working out and has very little to do with food restriction), not what my numbers are. But it is harder every day to divorce my feelings from the numbers, and I think more and more about how I can get the numbers lower, what foods I can sneak out (for instance, it's amazing what limiting all beverages to water or tea will do for your calorie count)...I don't know. It seems unhealthy to me even from my internal vantage point, so I can't imagine it looks good to others.  And the bottom line is that yeah, I want to be in better shape and not have back problems like my mom and all that, but basically I'm fucking vain and I don't want to be fat. This all boils down to me not wanting to be fat. And that makes me feel like ass. So what if I am fat? Why should that matter to me? Why is my self-worth so connected to my body? Haven't I learned anything?  Apparently not.  But the chances I am going to quit thinking about it that way seem slim, so I just have to moderate myself as much as I can. Focus as much as possible on excercise and as little as possible on calories. And I have to promise myself that when I reach the goal weight, or when I reach the deadline, whichever comes first, then I am going to STOP counting calories. Because I am so fucking obsessive about entering every mouthful in to the website, and I know that can be a bad behavior.  Really I'm not worried about developing an eating disorder or anything dramatic like that. Rather, I just don't want to get any more fucking vain and self-indulgent.  Funny that I am blogging about not wanting to be so self-indulgent! As if this blog is ANYTHING but self-indulgence..."
UNATEZM,female,24,"My head has been pounding for 24 hours now. It is making me less-than-thrilled.  I have lots to do at work now. I think perhaps I am on a little bit thinner ice than I previously suspected, due to all of this stalker bullshit. Sucks. The stuff I am doing is really really interesting, though, and I'd rather be busy than not.  May be going to a movie with Susan and Tony tonight (haven't heard back yet). Right now I am counting the minutes until I can leave, because my head is throbbing and I want to get my stupid grocery shopping done and get home ASAP. I came in a bit early, too, so I can leave in just a few minutes. Everyone else is already gone."
UNATEZM,female,24,"It has come to my attention that I haven't posted anything of any actual substance since Monday. So I am going to attempt to remedy that. My brain is feeling not-quite-here today, though, so don't expect too much.  I am currently working on fact sheets on different issues in children's health in the great state of Texas. Probably needless to say, children's health doesn't seem to be a big state priority, so creating these fact sheets, while interesting, is inevitably depressing. I really wish I could be drawn to work that was not depressing on a daily basis. It would be good for me, I think. But it's not going to happen.  Life seems to be getting a bit more complicated than I would like. Partially it's this job/internship thing. Yesterday, completely on a whim, I sent my resume to a half-time position I had just gotten a posting for. It would be a good job, pretty well paid, benefits, etc. I don't think I'm particulary qualified for it, but I hate to limit myself, so I sent in my resume. The woman to whom I sent it called to inquire about my interview availability literally less than ten minutes after I sent the email. What does that mean? Does that mean she's desperate? Does it mean I'm a good candidate even though I didn't think I was? Does it mean I misrepresented myself in my email?  And why can't any of the other things I have applied for get back to me...? What's taking so long?  Nag nag nag.  Also, I need to go to the doctor. In fact, I'd say I  really  need to go to the doctor. I think there is something wrong with my anti-depressant prescription, I'm getting more migraines, blah blah blah. So why haven't I made an appointment yet? Well, because I'm scared, frankly. I'm terrified of doctors and it takes me weeks of building up to make an appointment.  To make matters worse, I now know which strains of HPV I have. The research study I was in finally ended, so they un-blinded the results. And yes, one of the strains I have is a cancer-causing strain. So I really need to go for a repeat Pap. But have I made an appointment to do that? Fuck no--again with the fear of doctors.  So yeah...that's where I am today. Perhaps it was better when I was just posting recycled song lyrics and pictures, huh?"

UNATEZM,female,24,"I realize that on a global scale, it doesn't suck that much, but it's Sunday night and I am realizing that I've had a really pretty lousy weekend. That sucks.    Also, my hair is currently somewhere between orange and pink and seems bound and determined to stay this way. That sucks.    Finally, not only have I had little fun this weekend, I've done precisely 0 loads of laundry. That sucks."
UNATEZM,female,24,"I am in miserable fucking pain. It's only 11 and I really should stay up for a couple of hours and get some work done, but my shoulder is killing me and all I want is to take a bath and then get in bed with the heating pad. I spent the evening watching movies with Susan and Tony, which was fun, but it would have been 100% more enjoyable if I weren't in such fucking pain. I honestlly don't know how I am going to get out of my shirt this evening--every arm motion hurts. Driving is becoming increasingly problematic.  Chancey was really good on the walk and didn't pull on me at all, thank God.   We watched ""Spirited Away"" tonight, which I liked, though it confused me. I would like to see it on a big screen or at least a really large TV, because the animation was pretty cool. We also watched a short film called ""Book of Life,"" which I wasn't crazy about. It was funny in parts, but it struck me as pseudo-religious pretention, which gets really old really fast.  I haven't heard from Adam, so I don't know if he's coming this week or not. I hope he is, because it would be good to see him, but I also hope he's not, because I will get even less done with him here. Maybe if he just comes for one night or something. We'll see. I'm sure he'll turn up.  Chancey is being pretty affectionate tonight. I think he misses Mark.  I should probably erase that, lest my stalker know I am here alone. Fuck that. Come and fucking get me.  Alright, I am going to work. I swear."
UNATEZM,female,24,"Today was distinctly better. I think I was just grouchy last night. These are my people, as far away from them as my life gets, I am still grounded by them.  I took a walk ""into town"" today. Six miles, took about an hour and a half. It was really nice to do and I was really proud of myself at the end. My feet and legs don't seem too sore, either, though that might change tomorrow. I am eating like a giant pig here, which needs to stop (but won't, I'm afraid). There is junkfood everywhere, and the way people cook here for meals isn't exactly diet-friendly. Oh well. If I can hold steady until I get home, I'll be happy. No use trying to actually lose while I'm here--it's just not going to happen (unless maybe I find time to take that six mile walk every day...)  My mom is really really miserable. She's been worse every time I see her for ages now, but you can tell she's really at the end of her rope right now. And she's up to 3 or 4 pain pills a day, which can't be good for her. She says she is in pain and depressed and she doesn't know how much longer she can take it. I don't know what that means. I guess it means that this surgery better fucking do something. It's so unfair to see someone as great as my mom in so much pain. And it makes me feel guilty for not being here to take care of things. I don't think George helps around the house as much as he should. He does some, but Jesus, she can barely walk. She shouldn't be doing laundry and cleaning and making dinner and all that crap. Not that I think she'd stop even if someone else were here to do it, but still. I'm trying to do as much as I possibly can while I am here...and hopefully by the time I leave she'll be feeling better (though that's really unlikely, as it will take her six weeks or so to recover fully from the surgery). I hate seeing her like this. It's really aging her, too, which is sad, especially since she's really so young.  This is really odd to admit (and I hope Mark still doesn't read this), but being here makes me want to get married and maybe even have a baby sometime. I love my family, and I love that they are my family. And I love my family with Mark and Chancey as well. I want them to be...connected more, I guess. I long for something more ""official."" Which is really really strange, because I am completely politically opposed to getting married and I have absolutely no plans to do so. I was daydreaming today, though, about telling my mom she was going to be a grandmother.  It's in the air down here, I swear. I have to get away quick!  I saw Sadie today and she knew my name. She's only just started talking in the past few months, but she recognized me. Amazing, considering she hasn't seen me since August. She's a beautiful, bright, tempermental little girl. She looks just like Randi, but I think she acts more like me. Apparently she's prone to tantrum-throwing. :) I hope I get to see a fit before I leave. Proud to have passed that particular legacy on.  The wood heat is drying out my skin, chapping my lips, and making me sneeze. It's nice to listen to the fire crackle, though, and to stand in front of it until my ass gets so hot I have to go bury it in the couch. There are always good things about being home.  Tomorrow I think I'll have some solitude. Mom and George will be at work and Mitch is going fishing, so I'm just going to hang out and make Christmas cookies and watch TV and read. I hope this Janet Frame book speeds up a bit--her childhood doesn't interest me as much as it could, and I'm finding her a little bit unaccessible (inaccessible? INXSable?) I'm sure it will be more interesting once she gets to the mental hospital, though.  Speaking of, I think I will get under my covers and read a few more chapters. One thing about the wood heat--my bedrooom, as always, is ice fucking cold. I don't know how I stood it here when I was growing up with the door shut. I sleep with the door open when I am here now. Fuck privacy, I want warmth!!"

UNATEZM,female,24,"I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me today. I have done everything I shouldn't have and none of what I should have (except that I did finally clean the floors). I stayed home from class for no reason, I went to Old Navy and spent $125 on clothes, I ate 4 super-size sugar cookies, I bit all my nails to the quick...you name it, I fucked it up today.   I don't feel depressed. I don't feel tired or sad or good or bad. Actually, come to think of it, I don't feel much of anything. Certainly nothing that could lead to any kind of motivation to DO anything. That seems bad. I have been eating terribly, sleeping plentifully, and haven't excercised in a week. The less I do, the less I feel like doing.  Obviously the thing to do is to force myself to do some stuff in order to break out of this vicious cycle. But I just don't have the motivation. And at this point I'm so digusted with myself I don't even want to try. I want another cookie and another nap, but even taking the dog out just seems like so much unnecessary work."
UNATEZM,female,24,"What a generally irritating day. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.  On the plus side, my biscotti look great. Too bad I don't actually like almond-anise biscotti.  I don't remember the crampy post-Pap smear feeling usually lasting this long. It blows goats. I just want to take more Advil and go to bed.  Which I will, in a few minutes. Mark is walking Chancey without me. I walked him this morning and walked all over campus today, so I think I am OK for excercise for the time being.  I was wondering if walking Chance ""counts"" as 20 mins/day (even though it's 20 mins twice a day, usually) of physical activity? I don't break a sweat, my heart rate doesn't much accelerate, but I am walking. Is it worth the time, workout wise? Is there something else I should be doing to supplement it that wouldn't be too much of a time strain? I'd like to start lifting weights (arm definition, rather than just arm flab, would be great), but I can't muster up the energy.  I can't muster up the energy to write anything worth reading here, either. Fuck it, I'm going to bad. Probably best just to call this day a loss and move on to tomorrow."
UNATEZM,female,24,"Mmmmm...it's Sunday night and my life is just good. I love my Mark, I love my dog, I love what I'm doing (school and work). I love that I made lentil soup today and it's cheap, it's good and it's nutritious. I love that even though I am tired, I am tired from actually doing school work and chores and playing with the dog. I love that the TV hasn't been on all day and isn't on now.   It's hard to just be content. I don't trust it for very long, and it worries me when things get too quiet and seem too good. But I am content with this. This is what I want. Mark and were sitting on the couch and Chance came up and sat between us (on both of our legs) and we petted him and he just stayed there for several minutes. This is my family, I thought. And it is. I love my family of origin, but this is the family I am creating--the family we are creating. There isn't anything better than that.  OK, I should go get some more reading done before I melt completely into a puddle of gooey romantic nonsense.  Now if I could just figure out what THE FUCK happened to my sex drive..."

UNATEZM,female,24,"Ug ug ug. Today is just shitty all around. I can't believe how much the upsetting news of all of my friends is upsetting me. I can't tell if it's empathetic or self-centered to say that, either, which just makes me feel vaguely shitty about myself.   And I got not enough sleep last night, so I am crabby and tired. For the first time, I'm not looking forward to Regulation of Gender this afternoon.  I'm bailing on the doggie training class on Thursday in order to volunteer at a Stop Domestic Violence event. I have on idea if the event (which includes a performance by Lisa Loeb, a short film and a speaker) will be any good at all, but I told myself I was going to get more involved in actual feminist activities here, and by God I am.  For all that's worth."
UNATEZM,female,24,"There is lots floating around in my little head this morning. Walking Chance was great--beautiful weather, he was well-behaved, and my mind just wandered. I had no idea having a dog would offer me this particular chance for peace and reflection in the mornings. It's so nice. I'm sure that once it gets into winter and it's dark and shit when I need to walk him I'll be less all about it, but for now it's lovely.  Anyway, I realized that I am worried about what happens when Susan and Tony finally go get their little girl. I'm so excited for them, and I think they will make exceptional parents, but you hear all those stories about how it's tough for people with kids to be friends with people without kids...I'm afraid of losing them as friend. I think most of their other friends (the ones closer to their own age) probably have kids, too, so they will have more in common with them than with us...blah blah blah. I don't know why I am even fretting about it--it will either work out or it won't. But I just enjoy hanging out with them so much, I don't want that to all go away when the baby gets here.  My selfishness knows no bounds.  What else have I been thinking about? I had so much to write and it sort of flew out of my head as soon as I got back in the door. Stupido...  Oh, yeah, thinking about internships for the summer. I'd really like to stay here, it would be infinitely easier, Mark and I wouldn't have to do the LDR thing, I wouldn't have to pay rent in two places, etc. However, the more I look the more I see better opportunities elsewhere (including and right now especially in Portland). It wouldn't be THAT tough to go back for the summer, would it? On one hand my relationship (my family, I guess, when I think about Mark+Chance) is my top priority. On the other hand, I don't want to sell myself short career-wise (or financially) by taking something mediocre here when I could do something excellent elsewhere. This is going to require a lot of thought.   Off to class in a bit, then back here for the afternoon, then class tonight. My weekends have been so relaxed lately that the week sort of takes the breathe out of me when it rolls around. Mark and I even found time to watch a DVD last night (""Philadelphia""). With the Ani show on Tuesday night, this week is going to be especially busy. I'll survive, I know, especially since I miraculously finished all of my reading (well, all of it that I'm going to do) over the weekend so I don't have that pressure. Still, I find myself in ""gearing up"" mode this morning, as if I am headed into battle and not just a week like any other.  I am a little bit concerned at the amount of energy my everyday life seems to be taking out of me recently. It reminds me uncomfortable of The Time Before Antidepressants. :("
UNATEZM,female,24,"Shit.  Why am I freaking out about this AGAIN?  I have to go and get my cervix scraped this afternoon (Pap smear/annual exam). I'm overdue, as I was supposed to get one in six months after my last one came back abnormal, and that was in May. I have a pretty definite feeling they are going to find something this time, something that's not just ""a little weird"" but that needs to be frozen or cut out. And I know that's no big deal, it's not even real surgery, it's easy to take care of, etc., but I'm still flipping out.  To make matters worse, Mark and I had sex for the first time in probably a month last night, completely forgetting about the ""no intercourse for 24 hours before the pap smear"" rule. I've broken that rule before and nothing has happened, but damn, you'd think we could have thought about that. (Sorry for the TMI, but I need to write about this and I have decided I'm going to try to censor my blog less, since I don't have another journal anymore--if you are uncomfortable knowing this much about my life, you don't have to read it, right?).

It hit me like a truck all of a sudden last night and it hasn't let up. I am at a loss for what to do. I thought the damned antidepressants were supposed to keep this from happening? I've been taking them every morning like clockwork. Why have they suddenly stopped working? Or is it something else entirely? What am I doing wrong?  It sucks that this happened right on the heels of my declaring myself a compulsive shopper and figuring out a plan of action to deal with it. I hate having all of my mental/emotional maladies rear their very ugly heads at once.  And I hate that I have to sit through four hours of TCFC meetings this morning feeling like this. Yuck. I hope I don't have to socialize too much."
UNATEZM,female,24,"So you tell me if this is stupid...  I was sitting on teh couch this morning, waiting for Mark to be ready to drive me to work, petting Chancey. And I got to thinking--why are we so much more comfortable with physical contact with animals than with other people? I would pet anyone's dog, but to even shake hands with the person freaks me out, and I certainly wouldn't touch them, or want them to touch me, in the intimate sense that petting implies. Does it have something to do with the power differential between us and animals? Or is it even simpler than that--would we all pet each other if we were all covered in fur?  Sometimes the ""no touching"" thing bothers me. I wish I could be more physically affectionate. Other than with Mark, I have a really hard time with it. Even hugging friends or my parents or whatever feels strange and stifling to me. And that definitely makes me feel like I'm missing something, because I like petting Chance, and Chance obviously likes to be petted."
UNATEZM,female,24,"So I have the allergies that will not stop. My throat is swollen and hurts, my eyes are watering, my nose is stuffed up, and I would give my right arm to be able to go back to bed, rather than going into work. Seriously. I feel fucking awful.   Wah wah wah.  To make matters infinitely worse, I agreed to work Monday-Wednesday this week. I agreed to do this knowing full well that I am flying out to give a talk that I have not yet written in Chicago on Thursday. I'll write it over the weekend, thought I. Wrong. I am no farther this morning than I was last week when I agreed to work these days.   So, to put it simply, I'm fucked. I feel exactly the same way as I did last week, before finals were over. This truly is the semester that never ends."
UNATEZM,female,24,"You know that saying about true wisdom being knowing that you know nothing? Well, I think I'm getting there.  Things have been pretty riled up over at The Phoenix in recent days, and basically the conclusion I have come to is that everyone else is right and I am wrong. I know that sounds obnoxiously self-depricating, but I'm totally serious. I need to learn to fucking listen to people, because they often have things to tell me that I need to hear, whether I enjoy hearing them or not.   It was incredibly hubristic of me to think that I could start a space that would somehow be immune to all of the old battles and old bullshit. And it didn't work. And that makes me sad and it makes me feel defeated. Really, though, what it should make me feel is humble. Why the hell did I ever think I would be capable of this? I'm 24 years old, I'm white, I'm straight (well, I'm not, but you know what I mean)...what the fuck do I know about oppression? What the fuck do I know about anything, really?"
UNATEZM,female,24,This post removed because it was just that stupid.
UNATEZM,female,24,"Today continued my trend of getting shit done, for which I am grateful. I read all of the PD chapters, two of the three PRP articles, did some PRP writing, watched the first 1/2 of the very depressing UT-OU football game, took TWO naps, took a bath and shaved all of the parts that needed shaving AND did eight loads of laundry (including sheets and blankets). I'm very proud of myself. I have more to do tomorrow, of course (like always), but I think I did a very reasonable amount today. Oh, and Mark and I went out to dinner at the Hyde Park Cafe.   Mark has pretty much been watching TV and otherwise lazing about all day, even though he keeps telling me he really really really needs to work on his NSF application. I'm not sure what his deal is. Far be it from me to nag him, though. He'll figure it out. I just wish he would watch less TV, because having the TV on is increasingly annoying to me. Wow, that sounded incredibly snobby. With as much as we pay for cable, I should be glad someone is watching it.   It's been raining all day and is supposed to rain for the next couple of days. It's so weird how it can be both very warm and rainy here, even in the middle of October. Strange stuff. I wish the rain would stop, though, because I am tired of Chance having muddy paws and us having muddy feet every time we go outside. The floors, which I spent so much time cleaning yesterday, are already covered in dirt and hair again, as are our bedsheets and blanket, which I washed just this afternoon. You can't win, I guess. It's part of having a dog. Again, I wish Mark were just a wee bit more helpful with this stuff (I don't think he reads this, so I am going to go ahead and leave that. If he does read it, well, maybe he'll get the clue!). Either I think he does less than he does or he thinks he does more than he does, but either way it's becoming more of an issue, at least in my mind. And the last fucking thing in the world I want to fight about it housework.  Interestingly, Mark and I have fought WAY less since we got here than we did before. I don't know why, exactly. It's good, though. I feel more and more like he's someone I could spend the rest of my life with.  If he'd learn to do the damn dishes and pick up his clothes, that is. :)  Susan and I are going to see Ani at an outdoor venue on Tuesday, so as long as the rain stops by then, I'll be satisfied. It looks like it is supposed to (but you never know). The tickets were expensive and I really want Susan to enjoy the show, so I really hope it stops. I also hope Ani is ""on."" She usually is, and when she is, it's something to see, but she was a bit off when we saw her last fall.  OK. Enough babbling. Susan, if you are reading this, UPDATE YOUR DAMN BLOG!! :)"
UNATEZM,female,24,"Today on ""things overheard while Mark is watching TV in the next room"":  ""I'm never going in the water. The ocean can suck my ass.""  He seems to be watching film of sharks attacking people. His viewing habits are...strange.  I've renewed my love of Ebay. So far, the damage is slight, but I'm having increasing trouble restraining myself. Why is it that whenever I have the least money, I feel the need to spend the most money? It makes no sense.  I wonder if anyone is reading this? I somehow doubt it, yet the idea that someone might be does sort of keep me on my toes with regards to putting periods at the ends of my sentances and making some attempt to spell correctly. Which is good, I think.  We've moved our furniture painting operation out on to the front porch because things dry so much faster outside, so I really should be trying to clean up the sunroom (where we were painting before). Once it is cleaned up and put together, the whole house will be in some semblance of order. Not a bad place to be with less that two weeks' residency, I think.  But I'm blathering on here rather than actually cleaning it up. Funny how that works.  I'm hungry. I'm hungry all the time now. I know it's because I am not eating enough or often enough, yet I do nothing to remedy it. I'm actually in some sick way sort of starting to enjoy the feeling of being hungry. That has to be a bad sign."

UNATEZM,female,24,"Two things I love are rolled into one in  urlLink this book . It's a book about my favorite (I think) artist,  urlLink Frida Kahlo , illustrated by the author/illustrator of my favorite children's books, the amazing  urlLink Tomie de Paola ! It's fucking fabulous. If you have a kid, get it. If you don't, get it anyway. Hell, give me your address and I'll send it to your kids. There aren't enough kids in my life. My neices would inevitably think they are too old for it, and Sadie and Li-li are still a bit too young.  Today we solved all of our bed problems. We ordered the bed for our room, and we went shopping for something for the guest room. After hours of trial and vists to at least a dozen stores, we decided to just buck up, spend the money, and get something we like and can use in the future (hopefully as a couch, and hopefully sooner, rather than later, I say, because our current couch is an atrocity), rather than settling for whatever we could find the cheapest (not much, as it turns out). So we ended up with a very nice futon. Beautiful all hardwood frame, Japanese style, dark Java finish, thick futon mattress with inner coils, queen sized. It's really lovely. They'll deliver it on Wednesday.  So much adulthood.  We also took Chancey to his first agility class today. He was great! He did everthing he was supposed to do. It was wonderful. Mark was in heaven, too. I'm sunburned now, though. I have to remember that yes, it is summer here now, and yes, that does require sunscreen.  Lots of sunscreen.  Was it just me, or was tonight's episode of  urlLink The Sopranos  weirder than hell? Now Mark is watching  urlLink Deadwood . I've never actually watched this show, but just hearing it from the other room pisses me off. The cursing is so historically inaccurate! Can't they even get the easy details right?"
UNATEZM,female,24,"I just listened to this for the first time in a month or so, and I was once again floored. So I had to share:   When the earth was still flat, And the clouds made of fire, And mountains stretched up to the sky, Sometimes higher, Folks roamed the earth Like big rolling kegs. They had two sets of arms. They had two sets of legs. They had two faces peering Out of one giant head So they could watch all around them As they talked; while they read. And they never knew nothing of love. It was before the origin of love.  The origin of love  And there were three sexes then, One that looked like two men Glued up back to back, Called the children of the sun. And similar in shape and girth Were the children of the earth. They looked like two girls Rolled up in one. And the children of the moon Were like a fork shoved on a spoon. They were part sun, part earth Part daughter, part son.  The origin of love  Now the gods grew quite scared Of our strength and defiance And Thor said, ""I'm gonna kill them all With my hammer, Like I killed the giants."" And Zeus said, ""No, You better let me Use my lightening, like scissors, Like I cut the legs off the whales And dinosaurs into lizards."" Then he grabbed up some bolts And he let out a laugh, Said, ""I'll split them right down the middle. Gonna cut them right up in half."" And then storm clouds gathered above Into great balls of fire  And then fire shot down From the sky in bolts Like shining blades Of a knife. And it ripped Right through the flesh Of the children of the sun And the moon And the earth. And some Indian god Sewed the wound up into a hole, Pulled it round to our belly To remind us of the price we pay. And Osiris and the gods of the Nile Gathered up a big storm To blow a hurricane, To scatter us away, In a flood of wind and rain, And a sea of tidal waves, To wash us all away, And if we don't behave They'll cut us down again And we'll be hopping round on one foot And looking through one eye.  Last time I saw you We had just split in two. You were looking at me. I was looking at you. You had a way so familiar, But I could not recognize, Cause you had blood on your face; I had blood in my eyes. But I could swear by your expression That the pain down in your soul Was the same as the one down in mine.  That's the pain, Cuts a straight line Down through the heart; We called it love. So we wrapped our arms around each other, Trying to shove ourselves back together. We were making love, Making love. It was a cold dark evening, Such a long time ago, When by the mighty hand of Jove, It was the sad story How we became Lonely two-legged creatures, It's the story of The origin of love. That's the origin of love.  -Stephen Trask"
UNATEZM,female,24,"So here is the problem I see with having an online journal that your friends know about, rather than a private, nobody-reads-this journal:  You can't complain about your lack of sex life.   Well, you can, but you'll be roundly and rightly accused of giving TMI to the people who you know might be reading your blog.  Must find a way around this issue."
UNATEZM,female,24,"I think blog updating is something you should do only when you want to. If it feels like a chore, don't bother. I will stop bugging you about it.  But if anyone wants to talk about anything that they don't feel comfortable talking about on their blog, I can certainly find time.   Now how's THAT for passive aggressive? :)"
UNATEZM,female,24,"Once again, I am struck by the overwelming urge to do more. I am not doing enough. Not doing enough to better myself, not doing enough to better the world around me, not doing enough to help people, not traveling enough, not loving enough, not living enough. I want to do more.  But it seems so difficult just to do what I must to get by, doing ""enough"" would be impossible. There is never enough time or enough money or enough energy. The whole situation is very frustrating.  This is stemming from a wonderful class I had tonight. My last class of the semester, and it couldn't have been better. I put myself on the line a bit and took a journalism class this semester--the subject was coverage of international crises. As one of the (many...I still have 30 pages left to write...) requirements for the course, we were to do 20 hours of volunteer work somewhere in the community and report back on it (write a field report and do an little informal oral presentation). Today, our last class, we had those presentations. And the organizations people worked with were so fascinating, so vital, and so in need. I ended up wanting to volunteer for all of them. And I ended up feeling really, really bad, because I just used the non-profit job I already had to fill the course requirement. I wasn't cheating or anything--the professor OK'd it--but I feel like I should have done more.   So I'm trying to figure out how to do more. Now is the absolute worst time to be thinking in these terms--I've got PLENTY to do in the next week or so, thanks! But I am thinking about the summer. Yes, I have to take a calculus course, and yes, I have to work full-time, but what else can I do? My reasons are fairly non-philanthropic--I want to contribute because I don't feel like I am pulling my weight, and that makes me feel like ass. But whatever my reasons are, one more volunteer body is one more volunteer body, right? And it's about damn time I got involved in something beyond myself.  That being said, I move on to the subject of friends and my not having any. It's quite strange. I went out to lunch today at a campus place (between work this morning and class this afternoon), and I ran into a group of acquaintances from school there. I talked to them some, but sat by myself and read my paper for the most part. I go to lunch by myself often enough now that I don't really think of it as weird, but today I was very much aware that these people were thinking ""Poor pitiful Grace, doesn't have any friends to have lunch with,"" or something of the sort. And it's true. There isn't a single person at my school that I would call a friend. There are a handful of people I say hi to or am happy to have class with, and I'm doing better with school-oriented social events (such as going to Happy Hour after class yesterday), but basically, I have no friends.  The really surprising part, though, is that having no friends doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have lots of  friends. I have my online friends, and I have my real-life friends, most of whom happen to be far away at this point, rendering my relationships with them very similar to those with my online friends (although really, reading my blog and being in my internet community are the only ways to communicate with me from afar on anything resembling a regular basis--I don't even talk to my mom on the phone more than once or twice a month). I absolutely adore the friends I have and hope they will always be my friends, geography be damned. But not having friends at school here just doesn't bother me. And it's not that I don't think tere are people here I'd like to be friends with--I'm sure there are--but I don't know how to form friendships intentionally, and I can't be bothered to figure it out.  Is that severely misanthropic? Maybe it's because I have Mark and we spend a ton of time together, but I honestly don't think that's the bulk of it. I just don't consider geographic nearness to be a particularly important factor in friendship, I guess. And at this point, I don't even consider regular communication to be that important a factor--as seeing Howell and Melinda and Ron and Sandy in D.C. the other weekend demonstrated to me, we fall right back into the same friendship no matter how recently or not we have talked. And to me, that's what it's all about. If they need me, I'm here, and if I need them, I trust they'll be around.  Still, I should probably attempt to be at least marginally social here. I'm really not an anti-social person. Just lazy, I guess. Or guarded? I don't know. Mostly I think I just don't have the patience to develop friendships over a long period of time--I love hanging out with good, close friends, but I'm not exactly enamored with the first date-esque stages before that. And making new friends really does remind me of dating, another activity I would never be good at and I'm kind of glad not to engage in.  This all reminds me of how strange it is to meet people IRL whom you have interacted with for a long period of time online. The idea that you are just now ""meeting"" them is so strange, because chances are you know more about them and have shared more with them than is true of most of the people you see quite often in your everyday life (at least in my circles, this seems to be the case). So it's not really meeting them. Ani has a line that goes, ""I have only just met an old, old friend,"" and I always think of that when I meet someone whom I already know I like. It's a strange dynamic. On one hand, you wish you could just brush away all the preliminary getting to know you stuff that is inherent in meeting someone, but on the other hand, you don't want to be too familiar with someone who you ""just met."" And I know that I am far more open online that I would be in relationships with people in person, so it's weird to meet someone and know how much they already know about me. It's this strange feeling of not knowing what face to put on, because they are going to recognize that your public face isn't you--after all, they've never seen it before.  Actually, that makes it sound like it's a really excellent way to meet people, doesn't it? No pretenses that way. Why doesn't it actually work like that?  Or maybe it does."
UNATEZM,female,24,"I'm slacking off already, I guess.  Classes start tomorrow. I wish I felt more anticipation than dread, but I don't. I'm getting bogged down in the financial mire again, too. I need to not let it get to me--with my loans and everything I will be OK. Still, it worries me. I would really prefer not to have to live hand-to-mouth all semester (though I know that what I am thinking of as I type ""hand-to-mouth"" is a really rich white Westerners version thereof and I should be ashamed to complain about it).   I am going to try to build some time into my schedule to get into the fitness center(s) on campus and maybe take some classes. I ought to be ashamed of how out of shape I am at my age. Since all logic tells me my problems (back, legs, whatever) are going to get worse and not better, I really need to start being a bit proactive about this stuff. I know it sounds funny to say this at two-days-shy-of-24, but I'm not getting any younger. So I paid the fee that allows me to take whatever classes I want for this semester and hopefully I can drag my ass to kickboxing or yoga or pilates or something a couple of times a week.  I'd like to find a new pottery class, too, but perhaps I'd better take it one step at a time before I go completely overloading my schedule.  It looks like we may be getting a dog sooner rather than later. Mark fell in love with a dog off a rescue site and he's coming for a home visit this weekend. He's a German Shepard-Rott-Swissy. He weighs 103 lbs and from his picture he is beautiful. Mark talked to his foster mom on the phone yesterday and she couldn't say enough good things about him, so I guess we'll see where that goes. Getting a dog might be a great thing for my needing to get into better shape, too. I imagine it's a workout to walk a 100+ pound dog, whether he's obedient or not.  Unforunately, classes are starting on my heaviest day, Wednesday. I have Public Financial Management from 10:30-12 and Polical Economy from 2-5. I'm a bit perturbed about the length of my classes (I have two three-hour classes, two hour and a half classes and one four hour class every week). I always hated the longer classes at Reed, and they weren't any longer than my shortest classes here will be. Let's hope graduate school is different, or the temptation to skip class is going to start awfully early.  I hope it doesn't, though. I don't want to skip class. At this point in my education, it seems really counterproductive and stupid to do so.   My used Political Economy book cost $80. Bah. I haven't bought any of the rest of my books yet."

JA99SLN,male,27,"[Arts & Crafts] • February 10, 2004  urlLink Valley of the Giants' Official Website   Here we have the debut album from this collaborative outfit that includes members from some pretty big Canadian names (Godspeed You Black Emperor, A Silver Mt. Zion, Do Make Say Think, Broken Social Scene, Shalabi Effect, and Strawberry). It's important that you not go into this one expecting something similar to BSS's  You Forgot It In People  or G!YBE's  Lift Your Skinny Fists... , because you won't find anything of that nature here. Regardless, what we have here is pretty impressive in its own right. It seems the foursome went into this project with the goal of capturing the ambience of the ""Old West"" (just take a look at the cover) and for the most part accomplish that quite well.  Five of the eight songs are barren instrumentals that each end up building into something quite a bit more sprawling and grandiose by the end, sending your mind off to a place where tumbleweed traverse the dry desert ground and vultures circle over cactii in search of fallen cowboys. The only problem is that, ranging from 6 to 10 minutes, they can grow somewhat tiresome. You may be tempted to hit the skip button before it gets interesting. Only three of the tracks on Westworld feature vocals and one is just a story - a compelling account of a teeny lil' tiny lil' penguin and a whaling crew, recalled by a gentleman with a thick French-Canadian accent.  Anyway, as a whole, I thought Westworld made for an interesting experience and one that was well executed, but ultimately falls short because there are only one or two tracks that I'd want to revisit with any regularity. Coincidently, they are ""Westworld"" and ""Bala Bay Inn"", the very two that feature Deidre Smith's vocals. I'd be interested to see what this group is capable of outside of the conceptual constructs to which they confined themselves for this album."

JA99SLN,male,27,"I'm not normally much of a fan of movies of this nature. In fact, It's safe to say I really abhor most of them. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I'm so shut off by them without carelessly throwing out a cliched excuse. But here comes a movie out of South Korea that will help me explain my feelings. It doesn't do that by illustrating how bad these films are. On the contrary, it gives me some hope for this overworked and exhausted genre we call ""the romantic comedy"".    My Sassy Girl  seems to do all the things right that most bland and predictable romantic comedies do wrong. It tells a touching, believable love story - both funny and enjoyable - that is complimented by carefully contstructed visual imagery and noteworthy acting that stretches from hilarious to endearing.  The movie is broken up into two halves (and an overtime?!).  The first half begins with us being introduced to Gyeon-Woo, a hopeless college student, lacking motivation in his academic ventures and lacking direction for his future. In the meantime, he just enjoys hanging out with the guys, drinking Soju and chasing after girls that are ""his type"". Everything is going smoothly, until one night he spots a young drunk girl in the subway station, teetering on the edge of the tracks. Noticing a fast-approaching train, he grabs her just as she's about to go over the edge and saves her. On the subsequent train ride, she passes out. Gyeon-Woo is mistaken for her boyfriend and, as a result, he feels obligated to take care of her. So begins their rocky relationship. However, he's about to get more than he bargained for getting involved with her. Because while this girl may look pretty, a girl needs to act pretty, too. And this girl is far from that. Yet no matter how many embarrassing situations she puts him in or how loud and domineering she is towards him, Gyeon-Woo puts up with it all because he's intrigued by her. He's able to see inside her, behind the smokescreen, and notices a vulnerability - an inner sorrow, an actual heart - and thinks maybe he can help to heal her.   In the second half of the movie, we still get to see Gyeon-Woo beat up and put through the ringer with the girl (we never are given her name), but not as much, as traces of her soft spirit begin to come out and make themselves more apparent. After awhile, it becomes clear that both have developed feelings for each other. However, the girl has some issues from her past that need to be worked out before she can move one. Plus, her mother tells the girl she's not aloud to see Gyeon-Woo anymore. That's how they break up and that's how we are sent into...Overtime!  Before Gyeon-Woo and the girl break up, they decide to write each other letters that express their true feelings for one another and place them in a time capsule, burying it and planning to come back and meet at the place two years later to open the capsule and see if their fate has changed at all. It sounds really cheesy, but it's really not as bad as it sounds. Normally, this sort of stuff would find me totally phasing out, probably falling asleep. But unlike most other romantic comedies, which skip past an important step and insult you by forcing you to put up with hoky stuff from the onset of the story before characters have been developed,  My Sassy Girl  waits until you're attached to the characters and genuinely care what happens to them before it gets all emotional and idyllic. And that makes a BIG difference.  Cha Tae-Hyun puts in a solid performance as Gyeon-Woo. Of course, playing the girl's punching bag probably isn't too demanding of a role, but nonetheless his facial expressions are completely hilarious throughout and when the movie gets serious he does a good enough job holding his own. Jun Ji-hyun, playing the girl, however, deserves most of the credit here. From when we first meet her in the subway station, all drunk and abrasive, to when we see her begin to soften up and expose that vulnerability, Ji-hyun showed she was more than capable of pulling off that sort of wide dramatic range convincingly. Without it, this movie probably wouldn't be as strong as it was. And I'll bet the American remake of this film (the deal's already been made) will suffer for that exact reason.  I keep asking myself how in the world I stuck with a romantic comedy for over 2 hours without getting put off by cheesiness, which though it is scarce is certainly not completely absent from  My Sassy Girl . I guess it's just balanced out with more entertaining and believable material than fluff. Plus, great performances from the leads. The story was full of unexpected surprises and comical situations. The laughs were not forced, meaning the humor was of much more of a realistic, that-could-have-actually-happened nature. Also, I feel like I came away with something from it. Like  Amelie , this is a movie that will remind you take advantage of life's little accidents and small pleasures. All in all,  My Sassy Girl  was a very enjoyable movie, even for someone who usually balks at romantic comedies. I wish there were more of them that pushed the boundaries of that genre like this one did.   urlLink Official  My Sassy Girl  Website  (warning: the site is all in Korean)"

JA99SLN,male,27,"yeah, scott. i'd say you nailed it with #4. in my opinion, that was one of the disc's strengths - it offered some work from a few bands/artists that I've been meaning to check out but haven't been motivated enough to (i.e. - jurassic 5, ryan adams). so thanks to this disc, i've been more appropriately introduced to said acts. i think the J5 song is probably my favorite on the disc, which is unusual b/c i don't normally choose hip hop over rock, but in this case i do. it was better than anything else on the mix, at least of the stuff that was new to me. death cab and postal service still reign. i only had one real complaint about the mix. the whole time listening to it i was looking forward to hearing a coldplay song i'd never heard and then it turned out to be ""help is around the corner"", a tune which i have been quite familiar with for awhile now. still a great song, i had just got my hopes up for something different and then they were kind  of popped and flew around the room in loops and esses, leaving nothing but a wake of farting noises behind before dropping to the floor motionless and completely deflated. ok, that was a bit overdramatized. i'm just joe king. i am still having a hard time deciding if the mix is more nashville or chapel hill, though...i think the latter. speaking of the nash, i'm heading home for the holidays this week (tues-sun) to visit the old man and the rest of my kin.  i'll miss you all very...very much while i'm gone.  so, anyway, when i get back, i should be expecting no.7 already from matt bubar. am i right or am i right? yeah, i thought so. anyway, good job, asher. hey asher...one more thing. i was looking at your acrylic portraits, which are very good, i must say. but i came upon one that looked very familiar by the title, ""Jessica"". it looks just like a girl that went to my high school. it wouldn't happen to be a girl named Jessica Gallup, would it? just curious. she dated my best friend for a few months senior year. anyway, that would be weird if it was. it would be weird if it wasn't, too, cos it looks just like her. i know, guys. i'm abusing the afterburners team blog. veering off topic. sorry."
JA99SLN,male,27,"[Placid Casual] • April 19, 2004  urlLink Super Furry Animals' Official Website   First of all, let's make this one thing clear right from the get-go. Everybody's favorite Welsh tunesmiths are not offering us any truly new material here with  Phantom Phorce . Basically, the Furries have put their 2003 release  Phantom Power  into the hands of an assortment of DJ's, knob twiddlers and computer nerds and said, ""Do what you like with these, fellas.""  So, as I was saying, you're not going to find anything that fresh for the ears here. Granted, the songs have been cut up and manipulated and some have taken on a new shape more than others, but the bottomline is they still do not compare to their original recordings. Thus, this album is really quite unnecessary.   I'm not saying you should completely disregard it, however. There is Kieran Hebden a.k.a. Four Tet's remix of ""Piccolo Snare."" This is the one single track out of them all that comes close to doing any damage against the prior version. I might even venture out there and say that it is more enjoyable to listen to. Four Tet proves yet again that he is the man with the Midas touch nowadays. Sort of like what he and Manitoba did for the Notwist's ""This Room"" from their  Different Cars & Trains  EP earlier this year, Hebden does his best to salvage this collection singlehandedly, and almost succeeds. However, one very solid track out of more than a two handfuls = not enough to make this worth purchasing. I recommend downloading it and then buying  Phantom Power  instead, if you haven't already."

Anyone who has the  urlLink Sundance Channel , you may want to tune in at 9pm tonight to watch  urlLink ""Anatomy of a Scene"" , which will be looking inside one scene from the movie  Garden State , examining some of the challenges that writer/director Zack Braff and his crew had to work around during filming. For a fairly small film, this little movie has created a pretty large stir thanks to word of mouth and one of the best trailers in recent memory. It has received tons of praise at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and it has legions of people clamoring all over each other on message boards, talking about every little thing related to it.   Garden State 's scheduled to hit theaters August 6th. With all the anticipation for this movie building up inside many of us over the past few months, this TV special should be just what we need to hold us over until we can actually see the film next week. I don't think there'll be any spoilers, so don't worry.

He, of course, is doing it to generate buzz for the movie, but I still think that's pretty cool -  to see a director putting forth so much effort to get more people to see his movie.

JA99SLN,male,27,"You may actually be the last one to see things. I never saw it on MTV - MTV doesn't show music videos except during TRL, and I don't stay up late enough to see videos that aren't hip hop on MTV2 - but I do remember seeing this video somewhere at least a month or two ago. I think I found it posted on the internet somewhere...probably on Heavy.com. So, anyway, don't get excited about seeing this video get any attention. It's probably already missed its chance.  One other thing; I'd also like to add that I've never liked the single anyway (in general).  I think a band should only release a single if it's a non-album track that didn't fit on the album or something. The idea of me going and buying a disc for almost the same price as the album I bought, just for a song that I've already got on a full album and maybe two b-sides (one being a live recording and one being a demo recording of another song on the album) is ridiculous to me. I used to justify it when bands like Oasis and the Verve were actually putting quality b-sides on them that I could listen to. In fact, Oasis' ""Whatever"" single is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. That's what singles should be like. New song and three new b-sides (some call this an EP, but in the UK I guess it's still called a single). Everyone loved it. If bands would do that, I might actually buy singles. Even if one or two of the songs turn out to be mediocre, at least it's new and fresh to my ears. So to hell with singles!  I actually read somewhere that Thom Yorke said he's unsure if Radiohead will do the album thing anymore. He'd like to release only EPs from here on out, because putting together an album has put way too much pressure on them and become quite a daunting thing. Hmmm..."

I guess my musical tastes are a little more upbeat and when I do get down on like sad time music its usually like the white stripes or brmc. I don't get sad,  I get rocked out. It was nice to hear vaseline again though. It would also be cool to try and never have the same band as anyone else has had until we get into like the third year or something. I'm gonna end up being able to put together my afterburners cds and compile the entire streets, pearl jam, radiohead, and ryan adams albums."

JA99SLN,male,27,"Just yesterday I got on here real quick to leave a short note about how I don't have enough time to do any posting until the end of this week, but I just had to put something up about this:  The  urlLink Detroit Pistons  knocked off the Indiana Pacers last night in a  urlLink very ugly Game 6  of the Eastern Conference Finals  (but who gives a crap - we won!) . With the win, the Pistons have advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since the 1989-90 season, which is when the ""Bad Boys"" won their second of two titles in as many years. It was so great to see Joe Dumars, the Pistons President of Operations, lofting the silver Eastern Conf. Championship trophy above his head after the game, for the first time since fourteen years ago when he did it as a member of the Pistons championship team in 1990.   I also have to add this: I  love  Rip Hamilton. The kid has been going off and is just now starting to garner the attention he has long deserved. He lit it up against Indiana all series, even when the Pacers tried to stop him by throwing ""supposedly"" the toughest defender in the leaugue, Ron Artest, at him.  So, anyway. I'm totally psyched for the Pistons/Lakers series to start. Game 1 is Sunday, June 6th. The majority of people out there are already counting us out against the L.A. in the Finals, but I like our chances. The only thing I'm worried about is the refs not giving our tough defense and rough-and-tumble style of play a chance against the Lakers. The league and its refs have a reputation of giving superstars the special treatment, blowing the whistle anytime someone so much as runs anywhere in the vicinity of Kobe or Shaq. Barring that, I think we've got a good chance to win. We match up against them really well. We've got a slew of 7-footers to throw at Shaq, two of which can step outside and knock down long jump shots, which will force O'Neal to step out from under the basket and make it easier for us to attack the rim. Besides, our D is gonna give 'em absolute hell. So go ahead - bring it, L.A.!"
JA99SLN,male,27,"Yeah I noticed that too about ().  It sounds like they came up with a chorus line and then sang it over and over again, changing the music obviously.  But I also heard that they developed their own language/code that everything is sung in, it's english and it's not icelandic(isn't that were they're from?).  Has anyone else heard that rumor? That (album) is so good though, it doesn't matter what language it's in!"

JA99SLN,male,27,"The weekend cannot come soon enough this week. My anticipation can be attributed 100% to the hope and promise of an extraordinary evening with Sufjan Stevens in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Originally, the only date he was going to be playing in this great state was in Grand Rapids, a good two-and-a-half or three-hour drive. Recently, however, we discovered a new date was etched into the schedule to pass through Ann Arbor this Saturday with Denison Witmer and Rosie Thomas in tow. Ann Arbor is an hour or less away from our home.   Dana is working Saturday. Normally if Dana has to work, this means that the show is a no-go, simply because not getting out until 7:30pm puts a really big stick in the spokes, if you will. This obstacle has been eclipsed by one wonderful bit of news: the Blind Pig is not even opening its doors until 9:30. As such, I will be at the show, and I will have the added privelege of having my lovely wife accompany me. We'll have time to get ready, scarf some food down, and make the drive to Ann Arbor, arriving at the Blind Pig right on schedule. It would have been nice if Dana didn't have to work at all on Saturday, so we could spend the day in downtown Ann Arbor, but you gotta take what you can get. So, anyway, the show will be amazing. Sufjan could make a very strong case for being my favorite artist working right now. Two other really good acts are with him. And we will be there with smiles."
JA99SLN,male,27,"This friggin' sucks! On Monday, the Beta Band posted news on  urlLink their website  that they have decided to punch out. What the heck for! Here's what they said:   ""Sadly, eight years of hard work and critical acclaim but little return in terms of commercial success inevitably takes its toll and a group decision was made to finally lay the band to rest.""   Right after they release a stellar new album,  Heroes to Zeros , that is received well by almost everyone? Doesn't make any sense! I don't know what enormous level of success they were going after. I'd say they were pretty successful. Maybe they just had a bad record contract and weren't seein' any of the money. Or maybe they got sick of splitting it four ways. Anyway, the decision to end it was mutual and friendly. No hard feelings. They will be bidding everyone adieu with a farewell tour throughout the UK this fall. Yeah, like there's a chance in hell that I'll make it out to one of those shows. I drove three and half hours to Washington DC once to see them open for Radiohead, and God unleashed the seven plagues on us to ensure that it didn't happen. It was one of the most excrutiating days of my life. No way am I spending $800 or more on a plane ticket to London, a concert ticket, plus travelling expenses just to see that happen again. I just have to accept that I missed out on what was probably an amazing live performance.  Anyway, I'm not going to get too sad. I got dumped, but that doesnt' mean I'm not still in love with them. And it doesn't mean I'm going to quit stalking them. Steve Mason is now putting the finishing touches on King Biscuit Time's first full-length effort. If you've ever heard King Biscuit's  New Style EP , you know that this release should soften the blow of the Beta Band's breakup quite a bit. In addition, Mason and Richard Greentree, another member of the group, are both working on their own respective solo albums. So there's still a lot in store for us from these guys.  The other two members of the Beta Band, John Maclean and Robin Jones, will both continue working in film and music. No specifics have been given."

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"It's Monday and I""m really busy but can't seem to get myself motivated to do any real work.  Maybe if I come here and ramble on for a bit I'll have some power to concentrate.  Had a nice unplanned laid back weekend.  Friday I helped Oompa Loompa (previously known as Old School), buy paint at Home Depot.  It's lucky I was with her or I'm afraid she would have ended up curled up in a ball in the middle of the store ;).  I helped her figure out what she needed and how to go about getting it.  It was fun =)  I suppose it paid off sleeping with a carpenter for 5 years.  We did a little other shopping, US Cellular, Pier One to visit Teaser and then rushed home to make ourselves pretty.  Went to SOB's for some drinks and darts and ran into our past head on.    After reminiscing a bit with Oompa about my nickname Bumpy and LL's nickname Lumpy.  A freak accident where we collided head on during a rousing game of ""Shoeball"", (trademark 1995; it's a game of little skill, played only after 2 am at Bradford Beach ), coined us with these name's.  Not thirty seconds after our brief reminiscing, MexiAfroman walked in the door...(co-founder of Shoeball).  How odd!  That same night I received a pleasant call from my newly single not-so-much-a-brother Matt.  It's midnight and he's calling me to tell me that Big D will be terribly upset if I don't make it to his Chuck E. Cheese birthday on Saturday.  How can I say no to that?  Poor JB gets cancelled on again.    After hours of skee ball, pop a shot, Bass fishing, Jet Skiing through Hawaii and Jurassic Park GREAT ADVENTURE...an exhausted Funquita headed to JB's house to make up the afternoon to him.  After a few hours on his couch I could have stayed there for the duration of the evening.  But alas, my plans kept me moving.    Poker Party at Bobhill's.  Goodie for me cuz I doubled my money and still got out of there in time to go out with Kit Kat and Flash Dance.  Change of heart, I didn't go.  I'm afraid of Kelly's Bleachers.  Instead I went back to JB's for a little R&R.  We started to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" but I couldn't keep my eyes open and he couldn't keep his hands off me.  So we called it a night and made the same attempt in the morning after we got back from breakfast.    Sunday afternoon I finally made my way over to Oompa Loompa's house to ""help her paint"".  Her walls were pretty much done, so I sat on  my arse and found some new modtunes for my phone...set up my brother to ring to the tune of the Inspector Gadget theme...LOL.  Read the paper and found some apartments to call on.  Oompa and I did some drive by's and I've got two appts. tonight.    I'm getting psyched about having my own place again.  The inconsideration is growing at my house and I""m seriously getting annoyed.    If your room mate is lying quietly on the couch at 8:30 with all the lights out and has a movie on when you and your BF or GF come home, which of the following do you do:  a.  Start talking to them, turn on all kinds of lights then go in your bedroom, lie on the bed with the door open and  talk in your outside voices to each other and laugh loudly.  b.  Decide to fix the thermostat by having one of you upstairs yelling to the other one who is downstairs, fight about who actually fixed it then talk in your outside voices about the movies you rented and want to watch.  c.  Order a pizza, wander around the house back and forth, then check out the window every 45 seconds to see if the delivery guy is here yet, (I mean come on he's not coming any faster if you look out the window 43 times). d.  Quietly say hello, take care of any business you have upstairs quietly, order a pizza and ask the delivery boy to deliver it to the back door, head downstairs, where there is another TV and DVD player, and set up camp for the night.  I vote for d, but apparently a b and c are all excellent options, especially when done in combination.  Okay, I think I've rambled on long enough.  AMF!"
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I told you I'd write you a poem. I'm doing it at work not at home:  I met you at Pfudpuckers over a year ago. At first I thought that you were a ho. But soon I realized you were nice and likable. Together you and I became double the trouble. It was okay cuz I discovered you were quirky. Atleast you don't make me eat beef jerky. You helped me stay away from a guy named Chris. You and I have even shared many a kiss. Sometimes we even fight like we're sisters. You borrowed me your shoes that gave me blisters.

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I'm very tired of hearing about babies and weddings.  My boss here just became a grandma a couple weeks ago, and just found out that her daughter is pregos and due in December.  Another woman here just became an aunt and the daddy is somebody who used to work here.  One of our retired senior partners just let us know that he's going to be a grandpa in January.  Somebody overheard our President talking on the phone and he said ""we already know the sex"" leading us to believe that his wife is with child.  One of the gals around here is getting married in September and another is planning a wedding for next February.  Another former coworker will be wed in April.  If I have to listen to any more wedding and baby talk I swear I'll shoot myself.      I am boyfriendless and childless,  according to everyone here as they look at me with sympathetic eyes and say ""You're day will come"".  As if I'm waiting around for Prince Charming to walk in the door, sweep me off my feet and bear me the fruits of his loins so I may become the wife and mother I was meant to be.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not a spinster just because I""m almost 28 years old and still single.  Did it ever occur to anybody that I may actually choose to be single and that I like the life I have?   I mean seriously, I am happy with my life.  Yes I may get lonely from time to time but I'm perfectly happy and SANE to be alone.  I do not measure my worth by who's waiting for me at home, so what if it's a roommate and two cats and not a husband and children.  When I'm damn good and ready  I  will walk into  his  life and if  he's  lucky, bear him the fruit of  my  loins!  (And no I'm not some kind of feminist, I would just like to make the point that I'm not waiting around for anybody!)"
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Dear Trish,  I met a nice man online about a month ago. We go out frequently and seem to get along fairly well, but I have the sense there's something missing. I've only been dating him for a few weeks, but I suspect he's about to give me the boot. How can I tell if he's about to dump me?  - Nervously Waiting   Dear Nervously Waiting, While a woman's intuition is strong, it can be overridden by other emotions like fear or insecurity.   Are you afraid of being dumped? Nobody likes to be, but it's part of dating, and it helps to be as philosophical about it as possible. This relationship is fairly new, so the stakes are still relatively low, aren't they? And isn't it better to know now rather than farther down the road when your lives are seriously entwined? Changing your attitude won't avoid the pain altogether, but it will help you get back in the dating game faster.   Or could it be that your self-esteem is a little low? Are you concerned that he's too good for you? Or simply convinced that this one will end as others have - in a break-up that leaves you gutted? Just because a relationship doesn't work out doesn't mean you're a bad or unworthy person. It just means you need to keep looking. There really is someone out there for everyone. Sometimes you have to kiss a few frogs to find him.   Be sure to check in with your gut before you go any further. Ask yourself if you really think he's going to break up or if you're just overly concerned about harmless behaviours.   Here are a few sure-fire signs that something's up:   He stops calling or checking in and/or stops taking your calls  He's suddenly unavailable for dates  He radically changes his look  He makes a lot of pathetic excuses  If this sounds familiar, it's possible that a break up is in your future. However, it's important to note that there are perfectly good reasons for any of these behaviours. They don't really prove anything but could be solid circumstantial evidence that a crime of the heart is about to be perpetrated.   If you honestly believe he's going to break up with you, you'll need to decide if you want to beat him to it and end the relationship first. But since there's still a margin for error, it might be best to have a non-confrontational conversation with him. Avoid the ""state of the relationship"" talk; it's far too early for that.   Instead, the next time you're together in a private setting, tell him how you're feeling. Yes, it's scary to put your emotions on the line. And yes, there's a possibility he'll stomp all over your heart. But it's just as possible that he'll appreciate your honesty and either allay your fears or be equally forthcoming about his doubts. As corny as it sounds, honesty is the best policy."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"What a _______ weekend I had.     Friday:  Candle party night at Funquita's and off to O'Brien's afterwards, where for 2 hours I got no male attention and then right when we were getting ready to leave I got hit on my 2 guys.  Figures.  Funquita of COURSE had to embarrass the shit out of me in front of Red - Thanks Funquita!  That's okay though cuz he wasn't all that cute head on.  Mr.Kickball on the otherhand was a cutie patootie, I think I might wanna make a trip back there nxt friday for an aftergame checkin'-you-out moment.....    Saturday:  I lounged around and did virtually nothing all day.... wait, scratch that.  I painted bar stools, but it took me 8 hours to paint 3 - does that count as being productive?  Went out with Spooner (formerly Flashdance) and Matt-Stealer for a couple hours.  Met this 'cute boy' (cute by Spooner's standards, not mine) at the Shed.  He was new in town from New York.  Thought we'd be nice and show him a night out on the town.  Little did we know he was a mute freak w/ random, non coherent spurts of insight, straight out of a 3 year NY rehab for ""mostly narcotics"".  So WEIRD.  We'll call him Idiot Boy.    Bar time.  Spooner and M-S decide they want to meet Trailer (formerly known as Matt) at an after bar.  I veto the idea, not particularly wanting to see  them all up in eachother's shit.  3 a.m.  The fun flirty bootycall conversation I'm having w/ Sosa is interupted by M-S telling me that they were in a car accident and Spooner might need stitches.  I fly to the hospital where I meet her and Idiot boy (yes, he's STILL with us).      So I'm stuck in the waiting room with a girl I hate because she stole my lust object and a boy who's very presence makes me want to gnaw my arm off.  Fun.  While Idiot Boy when on a smoking binge w/ M-S's cigarettes (p.s. he's an idiot AND he's rude!)  She and I bonded over vending machine food and cell phones.  5 hours later we can finally see spooner, she went thru cat scans and  cathaders (sp??) and her first comment is ""My doctor is HOT!""..... oh yeah, she'll be fine.     Sunday:  I tried to sleep all day, but of course that's the day I'm suddenly popular.  Funquita calls.  I go back to sleep.  Sosa calls.  I try to go back to sleep but he yells at me about what a beautiful day it is.  Very true.  So I sit outside and do nothing until Funquita calls and wants to do this thing called   excercise  (on a Sunday? how absurd...).  Our retarded gimpy asses tool around the river, blown over by the 95 mile and hour winds and pelted with sand and pebbles.  Maybe that was a little dramatic.  It was fun, defninitly should be a routine.  Head off to the Rooster for a good ass burger and chat w/ Sosa...  I think I have a crush on him.. Too bad he's off limits due to the Friend Code.     Monday:  Horrible day.  Not even going to talk about it.  The sun will come out Tomorrow, Tomorrow....."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I would like to share with ya'll about my 4 days in Green Bay but I don't think I should!    I cannot count how many times I repeated the phrase ""What happens in Green Bay...STAYS in Green Bay"".  It got to the point where as soon as I started to say it, everyone chimed in with me.   It was 3 days of steady drinking and partying with hundreds of people young and old testing limits and boundaries.  People crawling on balconies from one floor to the next, women baring breasts to security guards (okay that was me, but in my defense someone grabbed my arms back and someone else pulled up my shirt and bra), men peeing in the corners of elevators and hotel staff peeling condoms off of windows.    Wednesday, Thursday and Friday all blurred into one long day of pool and drinking, not to mention the free for all sex fests going on.  Wedding rings...meant nothing to anybody.  Sexual preference out the window and to hell with modesty.    I won't bore you with the details, but I will tell you that I got more attention from the women then I did the men.  But I don't kiss and tell ;)"
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Why does life have to come with so many decisions? I put a security deposit down on my new apartment and then yesterday talked with my newly single not so much a brother Matt about being roommates.  A couple weeks ago I had made mention in passing to him that I'd be looking for a new place soon and if him and SuperFreak seriously broke up I'm open to having a roommate.    Now he's stating to me that he may be interested, but he needs just a little time to get things straight in his head.  He did after all just move out of there and back into his mom's house.  Let's examine this.  Cons: MNSNSMABM is my long term ex's brother. is my good good friend SuperFreak's now ex-boyfriend. has been known to be somewhat of a hmmm man whore, before meeting SuperFreak. likes to party and works second shift...lots of noise late at night? isn't exactly notorious for being a neat freak nor a responsible individual. is a boy and I'm not quite sure that JB would be too thrilled about that. Pros: MNSNSMABM is seriously like a brother to me and we have always been very close. is the father to the most adorable little boy in the world who still thinks of me as Auntie Lisa and I'd get to see him every other weekend like I used to. would be paying half the bills in a larger apartment then what I'd afford on my own. has a job he's been at it for 8 years now and has been getting better with money.   works second shift for the greater part of the year and would barely be around when I'm there anyway. is a boy and I wouldn't have to deal with any bullshit.  What do I do?"
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I need to get a place of my own.    I have been roommate free for 2 days now and it is like HEAVEN.   No coming home to him and his gf bogarting the whole living/kitchen/breathing space area ... no having to feign interest in his long winded stories.... no having him tromp through my room with 18 loads of laundry every day.. because, you know, it would just be ridiculous for him to get that shit done when I'm gone, being that he has the whole daylight hours to twiddle his unemployed thumbs......      don't get me wrong, he's a super nice guy, but good god... i just like to be alone!   **Celebrity of the Day***   John Holmes aka Johnny Wadd:  1st porn star EVER + slept with over 14 THOUSAND women + was participant  of  horrific drug related slaughter +  Died of AIDS (go figure) = Celebrity of the Day!

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Two Words:  FOOD COMA  I ate way way way... WAY... too much this weekend.  I wonder if I can make it until the end of the week without another meal?   Had a pretty sedate weekend.  Stayed in with a very ill Spooner Friday night.    New favorite Movie of the Week:  Miracle  .  Awesome movie, cute hockey players an extra bonus ; )    Saturday Night - Hit Stonebank Days... which, well, sucked royal ass.  Luckily the 3 trays of jello shots we downed at the cookout beforehand kicked in just in time to make it bearable.  Watched 8 Mile make out with a 37-year-old-so-NOT-a-MILF for a  good 2 hours.  His defense?  ""She had pretty eyes!"" .  Good God.  We'll let this one slide considering he was so wasted he passed out mid sentence with the phone attached to his ear.    Sunday - Bright and early, medicated ourselves  w/ The Best Hangover Cure in the World (McDonald's Breakfast),  and prepared to watch Spooner's sail boat race.  After and hour of ringtone previewing and still no sign of sailboats, 8 Mile and I decided a 3 hour nap was a much better way to pass the time.    Tonight went to graduation party for Red's kids.  Since when did kids start 'graduating' from grade school?  When, huh?  I had to wait 18 years for a graduation party, I think everybody should have to.  Anyway it was an odd party... the guest list including ex strippers, ex porn stars, and 5 year old boys who liked to grope grown woman.

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"The Top 5 Reasons Port Washington Sucks:  5.  I don't know my way around.  4.  My cell phone doesn't work there.  3.  Their festival closes at 10pm.  2.  TRAFFIC leaving their festival was like the Brooklyn Bridge at rush hour.  1.  Did I mention I don't know my way around?     Fish Days was rocking Saturday evening when we arrived at a useless hour of 9pm.  Thinking we'd have a couple hours to enjoy some music and beers, little did we know that this festival of fish closed down after the 9:30 fireworks.  The party was rockin' when we got there.  Set at the marina, they had what I counted as 4 music stages and tons of people milling around.  Had I not been on a mission to find Freebird, we may stopped to enjoy some of the festivities.   The fireworks were mediocre at best but this is definitely an event I will surely check out next year.     Following this road trip gone from a 1 hour total drive to an hour and a half because of the Where's Waldo directions I received, we went to Boz's for Jay's birthday event.  Holy shit was that place packed and packed with people I knew from past and present.  Walking in to that place was somewhat of a time warp.  First I talked with a girl who was part of my life 3 years ago and we spent 20 minutes trying to figure out just HOW we knew each other...  Psycho Angie.  Then a bit later I ran into another flash from my past.  I hadn't seen this one in easily 7 years.  Still as ditzy as ever I was still excited to see her.      And of course I got to see Freebirds yummy brother.  This was the first time I'd seen him since Freebird and I figured out that I knew him.   This world is just too small.  How was I supposed to know that his brother hung out at MY Boz's.   I mean jeez the last time I had seen him before that was at Freebird's apartment for his bro's  18th birthday!   How was I supposed to know he was so hot and that when I met him I'd be wiping drool of my chin and trying not to jump on top of him?  He's dumber than a box of rocks but those um...eyes.   He kept telling people the story about how when we met months ago he thought I was hot and we talked and I gave him his number and that it's funny that I'm his brother's ex and have written to him for the last 8 years.   I was flattered in an odd sort of way that he was telling people (people who knew me) this story.  Crazy how Will and Poppy and Dena all know Freebird.  Saturday was just an odd night.  I swear there had to be a full moon.  I didn't get home until 4:30 in the morning...when's the last time I did that?      Friday night was a lot of fun too, Mt. Olive rocked as usual at the fest down the road from home.  CPA, Kit Kat, Teaser, Roomy, DorkBoy, WhiteTrash and Dancer and I all walked the 6 blocks and set up for a fun evening.  Afterwards I found myself on my way to Maverick's with Dancer to meet some of her work buddies.  Mavericks?  What?  Walking in to that place was like walking in to my past again.  Having spent many a drunken Thursday stumbling around that bar.  Playing darts so drunk I can't see the board, chasing beers with shots and vice versa, hanging out in power outages, yanking people's pants down, letting the bartender take pictures of me flashing the bar - oh wait after having somebody (not mentioning any names here) pulling my shirt up for me so he could take the picture, being pushed around the pool table after being doused with a glass of beer thrown at someone else, pulling my cuz out of the men's bathroom so we can leave, breaking up fights between her and whatever girl she pissed off, devouring tacos that tasted like heaven after 3 pitchers of beer ....memories.   Not quite so much excitement this time around but I was amazed to walk in and have Todd remember who I was.  ""Hey Lisa!  Nice to have you back honey!"" was the greeting I received.  I did a double take as I found it hard to believe he remembered my name.     Having had a weekend where my past was pretty much my present I've been reflecting on how many years have gone by that I've forgotten.  People that have been cut or fallen out of my life.  People who's lives have touched mine and I've touched theirs.  You don't realize what kind of an impact you have on people or vice versa until they have been gone and resurface into your life.   So many experiences I've had and places I've been.  Highs and lows.  Good times and bad times.  I can't ever imagine living a different life.  I've loved a lot of people along the way and am finding out that I've been loved more than I could have imagined."

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I once went on a date with a guy who was so gorgeous I couldn't even look him in the eye.  I fidgeted my way through dinner and tripped over my own feet on my way to the bathroom.  Why was I so nervous?  This guy couldn't hold a conversation longer than my pinky finger and wouldn't stop staring at my chest.  He was 24 years old, lived with mom and dad, was between jobs and talked an awful lot about partying with his boyz.  Not exactly a catch by my standards.  But yet I couln't get him off my mind after the date...oh yea and he never called for a second.  I once went on a date with a guy who was so average looking I found myself flirting with the waiter.  I drifted in and out of the conversations and excused myself twice to call my friends and make plans for later that night.  Why was I so disinterested?  This guy told me about his career, his friends and his family.  He asked me questions about myself and complimented my smile.  He was 28 years old, owned a condo downtown, had a bachelors degree with a career to boot.  I didn't think twice of him after I headed out to the bars with the girls...and it took him 3 unanswered phone calls before he left me alone."

Actually, it would have been a lot of fun had we not gotten lost and roll in 15 minutes before closing time.   Port Washington is a happenin town, eh?!  We went so Funquita could meet up with Freebird and, lucky me, he had a cute friend with him.  Didn't talk to him at all, but today he passed his digits to me thru Freebird and Funqui.  Hi, I'm in 3rd grade again.    Yesterday tooled out on the lake with Spooner, 8 Mile and MILF.  Got an HDI - Hot dog related injury - when Milf and I were catapulted off the inflatable hotdog at 60mph and her foot attacked my ear, causing my earring to practically slice my ear of.  Whatever made me think hoop earrings and innertubing mixed is beyond me.  That's the effin girl in me though.   We had fun... good times riding the big weiner ; )  Prince in 4 DAYS!!

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"hey beautiful-  let's shed some light Ignoring the adding of the 1 it becomes more obvious, multiplying by 80 and 250 is same as multiplying by 20,000 which moves the first three digits to the left 4 positions to the left, and doubled.   Adding the last four digit twice leaves them in same position but doubled.   Dividing then by two you end up with your number.  The adding of the 1 just adds 250 to the result, and thus you have to subtract it out later before the divide by 2.  ......love, Uncle Chuck"

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I haven't written anything here for over a week because I've been uninspired.  Haven't had much to say.  I've lost a certain passion for life somewhere in the last few weeks.  I've been drifting in and out of reality with no real concept of how much time has passed.    It's already the second week of February and I'm unsure if I've realized any of the goals I set for myself in the new year.  I've resumed the nasty habit of smoking.  It's not an every day occurrence but atleast once a week and sometimes twice I indulge myself and manage to go through a pack every couple of weeks.  I haven't joined Bally's like I set out to do, partly because of my busy schedule but mostly because it would be a waste of money since I probably wouldn't even go.  The other 3 or 4 promises I made to myself...I don't even remember what they were anymore.    I've decided I've got no self control or discipline and am so self absorbed that I just do what I want when I want no matter what/who is involved.  I used to think I was agood person with good intentions and that made it okay to be an asshole once in a while and made it okay to be selfish.  I'm so bored with this life, can I exchange it for a shiny new red one?  Some would say my life is very full and even exciting, but I've been on this track for so long that it's starting to be monotonous.  Maybe it's winter, maybe it's Wisconsin...but I need a change.  Something drastic to jump start my excite-o-meter.  But what?  I'm going skydiving this spring.  That'll be a rush for all of about 3 hours.  Then how will I top that?  One rush just leads to another to top it and so on and so on, you do so many things in your life, pretty soon there's nothing else to top it."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"White Flag  by Dido  I know you think that I shouldn't still love you or tell you that. But if I didn't say it well I'd still have felt it, where's the sense in that I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  Or return to where we were but  I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be   I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again  And I caused but nothing but trouble,  I understand if you can't talk to me again  And if you live by the rules of ""it's over"" then I'm sure that that makes sense but  I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be   And when we meet, which I'm sure we will  All that was there, will be there still  I'll let it pass, and hold my tongue  And you will think, that I've moved on....   I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be     August of 2004 this song came out.  It seemed to capture everything I was feeling at the time when S left.  It was a strange twist of fate that it played on the radio only moments after he walked out my door for the last time.  It was then that I knew it'd be fine and it was okay to still love someone even if they won't be there.  And once again six months later this song captures my thoughts.  S told me he would never say goodbye and I believed him.  He said he always wanted to be my friend, I believed him.  Again six months later M told me he'd never say goodbye and I believed him.  I have lost two people who were very close to me.  So here I sit pretending that I'm okay and if I saw either one I'd pretend everything was great, but it's just not.    I'm too afraid to get close to anyone.  To be free and open and let myself love.  I'm not afraid to fall in love, I'm afraid of loving too much.  I never gave care or worry to being vulnerable but now I try so hard to make people know that I don't care and I'm too strong to let anything get to me.  Well that's not true.  The only two people who I could talk to and who understood the real me are gone.  The ones who knew my insecurities and knew my thoughts before I even thought them.  How can I let another in?    ""Better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all"" fuck that"

AF3SAZJ,female,27,Is it possible to be elated and pissed at the same time?  I'm staying put in my house.  No moving for me.  I'm happy but at the same time still mad at the roomie for even starting the ball rolling on this.  I do feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I seem to have a smile on my face that I haven't seen for weeks.
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Life is just full of surprises.  The day before I am supposed to sign my lease I have two opportunities for other places to live.  Kit Kat's roommate has been canned and may not make it to live out the lease and in my current situation, Roomie's boyfriend may not be moving in after all.  Argh.  I told her that if she wants me to stay I will stay (shit I don't want to move and let's face it, it'll save me a good chunk of change), however I told her that whether he ends up moving in or not I will be staying until the end of October, either way.  In other news, I went for a late walk last night just when it started to thunder a little.  Well I shouldn't have taken that 3rd block cuz I got soaked!  It was awesome though.  I love thunderstorms and love running around in the rain.  The new kitten slept at the foot of my bed last night and Smokey stayed in my window all night.  Awwwww.  I might actually have to get a cat if I get my own place.  For some unGodly reason I'm starting to like them."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I talked to S today.  it was very weird.  It was pleasant but very weird.    it's odd how you can totally put somebody out of your mind just by not talking or seeing them.  Then the second you hear their voice or see their face that all changes.  I haven't talked to him since I got new tires and that was beginning of winter...or maybe I've talked to him once since then??  When I was on my way to meet Jax at BW3's?  That was before Christmas.  It's been so long I don't even know any more.  I don't miss him.  Well okay I'd be lying if I said that because of course there's some part of me that must miss him.  But it's a different kind of missing.  I finally realized that with S it's all or nothing.  There is no line of being friends, it's either we're together or we can't talk at all because there are too many feelings involved.    Yes I realized this all by just hearing his voice.  Just seeing his number come up on my caller id was enough for all kinds of thoughts and feelings to be dredged up.  I see his truck atleast once a week (no I'm not a stalker, his girlfriend lives in an area that I pass often) but this doesn't bother me.  If I were to see him walking to it, that may upset me.  It's odd because I've moved on completely and don't entertain thoughts of us getting back together any longer, but yet talking to him gave me a nostalgia that I can't even describe."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I got home a little after 1am.  I went to the bathroom.  I laid in bed and talked to Kit Kat for 15 minutes on the phone.  I went back to the bathroom.  I left the light off, however luckily the street light outside reflected off the toilet because otherwise I would have fell in.  The seat was up.  My roommate, freshly broken up from her boyfriend-who's side of the bed is still warm, had a man in her room.  Okay ASSHOLE, if you are spending the night in some strange girls house where there are WOMEN living....put the effin' seat down after your middle of the night trip to the pisser.  Oh yea and it didn't make me feel any too comfortable to know that some stranger is wandering around the house in the middle of the night while I'M sleeping in the nude (I spose I could have put pj's on).

I swear sometimes I cannot work with BH to save my life.  He interrupts me every 5 minutes (seriously, I'm not exaggerating) and most times it's for the stupidest reasons...like he needs to know at this exact moment who's attention an order was shipped to.  Like that was important enough to interrupt me while I'm sorting through some complicated project.  Jesus Christ.  And then he wonders why I have 16 things I'm working on at once...well duh!

We were right up center stage where prince sat when he read the magazine of himself and tossed it into the crowd just 1 seat in front of us. The whole moment was beautiful and my mind will never let go of it.

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Here it is Monday again and I may be becoming rather predictable as I am about to ramble on about my weekend.  Friday:  Went to a Texas Hold 'Em poker party at BH's.  Coincidentally three of the players were guys I went to high school with.  A year below me and amazingly they knew who I was and were impressed with the way I ""turned out"", don't know quite what to do with that.  Good night, I was up about $300 early on in the game and left with an extra $150 in my pocket by the end of the night.  I won some nice pots and played some good games.    Later that evening I decided to head out with Short Fry and went to the Drift Inn to socialize with ghosts from my past.  And by the way NB if you are reading this, Chad and Clay say hello and Chad is especially jealous of your recent winnings.  Saturday:  Had my first fight with JB this weekend.  Which led me over to Kit Kat's to meet Marine Mike and hang out with her and Flashdance (is that right Kit Kat?) for the evening.  Then I decided to let up on JB and end his torture by going over and seeing him. All in all our fight was a good thing cuz I learned a some things about myself and about him.  I learned that I am growing up and have a new found maturity to handling ""relationship type issues"".  I learned that I   have   learned from previous relationships!  I am now officially a part of a couple.  I now officially have a boyfriend for the first time in 3 years, it still sounds foreign to me, but it's kept a grin on my face for the last 48 hours.  We'll see how I'm feelin' in a couple weeks when I realize what I've done!!  Oh the horror!  Sunday:  I went to see a very powerful movie with Kit Kat and Old School.  You may have heard of it ""Passion""?  It brought emotions out that I hadn't realized were there, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as I watched a story I consider to be fiction and pondered what the reality of it all really is.  I highly recommend this to even the least religious of people."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I heard those 3 little words this weekend. ""I love you"". Why is this little phrase so god damn powerful? Granted it was said in a drunken stupor, but the conversation preceding and following them told a much bigger picture.  Am I so intimidating that men need to get drunk before they tell me that they love me? Yes these words are hard to say, but I seem to only get them when somebody has consumed nothing but a highly toxic level of alcohol.  Either way, I knew the feeling was there but I'm just not ready to hear it yet. So I know you're on the edge of your seat waiting to hear if I said it back. Well those of you who know me know the answer without even having to think about it. For the rest of you shmucks who think you know me but truly don't. My response to this was ""You don't love me, you're just drunk""...by the way, this is not the proper way to respond to such a statement. The person uttering the words will not only have his or her feelings hurt, they will also be angry that you are doubting their sincerity.   On a less serious note:    Why does Michael Jackson hang out with twenty eight year olds?   Cuz there's twenty of them!  Ar ar ar.  (This joke works better when spoken aloud)"

""i love you for all that you are"" thats good too. ""for all that you are."" nice. cause its not just ""i love you"" its...""i love every part of you"" thats great, man. great.      ""You are the bearer of unconditional things""that too. i love the wording of that. its cool. ""unconditional things""...haha, love!      ""I've never felt this healthy before / I've never wanted something rational / I am aware now""...thats good too. cause...  its that ""im in love and everything seems to make sense now!"" kind of thing. which is nice. i dunno. im just kind of rambling now.... lalaladadi.   and "" 'Good-night my---' he stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me."" i love that part. thats the best part of the whole book. poor rochester!   im in such a randomly good mood.  wow, i really need to do my homework....really really really."
D0SIWII,female,16,"did i just post that post with the title ""note to self: do not post?""  noo...  i hope no one read that. or ill sound like a crazy psycho stalker. or something. i cant view my blog to see if i just posted it without publishing it or if i actually did publish it. i really hope i didnt publish that. no one read it, right? good. So as far as we know im perfectly normal and im not insane, right? and we dont know about the sudden appearance of the eyeliner? good.  ...too bad blogger doesnt work so i couldnt see if anyone commented on that. *shifty eyes*...im gonna be so mad at myself if that was actually posted and read. damn.  anyway, i guess its not that big of a deal... i just get mad when i do stupid things and let people know things i didnt intend for them to know. you know? well, haha, you dont. but...yes...   let all just pretend this never happened.  10 second tom."
D0SIWII,female,16,"as some of you may notice, theres now a ""links"" section...which i created by screwing with the html...ill add more links later. and ill see if i can get a space between the last archives month and the word ""links""...im working on it, dotn worry. and theres also a counter at the bottom that provides me with many useful statistics. i just hope it doesnt get above 1500 or 15000 or something cause then it deletes my acount because im using too much bandwidth or something...but i doubt that many people actually read this. besides, i dont need the counter...and i could always get a new one. anyway, just thought id update everyone so that i dont have to yell at you for not noticing my changes."
D0SIWII,female,16,"yeah, so i got a livejournal thing. which i intend to use somewhat frequently. because i want a blog im not afraid to let people read. this one... i am. what with the emily business and the general candour (british style) of my rants. i dunno...i just dont want everyone reading it. you know what im talking about? of course you do. ill try to still update this one frequently, but i might be writing a lot on the other now. this one can still keep my rants though, my good ones.  so the url is: http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzysoapbox/  it wouldnt let me have the username yellowfuzz13 for whatever reason. so, since i like to get up on my soapbox... fuzzysoapbox. i dunno. just go read it. leave me comments. livejournal is all about the comments."
D0SIWII,female,16,"oh wow, this is weird... i think im going crazy.  read passage to india, am a little annoyed cause i have so much work to do. and i need an extra day cause i lost my weekend. i just called emily and basically said nothing...i just wanted to talk to her but now is not a good time, so i called and said i wanted to talk to her but i cant cause i have homework and she has homework. and then i mumbled about being tired and stuff for 5 minutes and left her alone so we could do our respective homework and told her id call her tomorrow or tuesday to talk cause i want to actually talk to her at least once a week. so i hung up the phone and now im like half crying and i really dont know why cause im in a pretty good mood... and i dont feel bad...so theyre not sad tears... but they dont exactly feel like ""im so happy i love life!"" tears cause nothing marvelous just happened...  so im confused. i dont like it when i dont know why i feel the way i feel. maybe...my best guess is that its just been an emotional weekend cause of this retreat thing and im kind of worn out and i call emily and the little people in my heart are like ""hey! emily! we love emily!"" and then that little tiny bit of emotion just kinda pushed me over into emotional exhaustion. so those were tears of ""oh wow, too much to think about, too much to feel, too much to handle""  but im okay now...  and time for my euro..."
D0SIWII,female,16,"Yesterday and Monday were craptacular days. im not exactly sure why, but... it just got to me, i guess. things get to me some times. not for any specific reason. but im okay now.  yeah, so i feel better today. im not exactly sure why. maybe cause im actually talking to emily? maybe cause i know shes listening? i dont know. i feel better though. much better. and late arrival tomorrow. yay!  and i have to get emily to say shell sleepover sunday. because i would love that. and i will play happy music and we will talk about nothing and i will learn more about her and we will play truth or dare and never leave my room and the velcro will be reattatched instead of slowly but steadily being ripped apart. and you know that ugly noise velcro makes when you rip it.   the velcro will be reatatched. and it will reinforced with superglue and staples and duct tape and... what other adhesive material could i use? spirit gum? haha, i wonder if we could stick our thumbs together with spirit gum... *strokes nonexistant beard thoughtfully and smiles*... shed never let me though. oh well.  still need to talk to her about a little bit more of the unpleasantness, but i think im done for the time... think ive made most of the points ive wanted to make and asked the questions ive wanted to ask... i just want her to give me her word on a few things.   im hungry. i think im going to eat some corn and other foods. and chocolate.  i should write more. i wish i still had time for it.  i hope everyone has a nice valentines day. i have to make valentines tonight and tomorrow night and plan something for saturady (and sunday...emily?). and i hope eric and emily dont do things they shouldnt (no, not that)....well, things i think they shouldnt. actually, you know how proud of her i would be if they go out for, say, 9 months and she never did anything more than hug him and kiss him? that would be awesome. id make her a present. some sort of award. well see though. she has a right to do what she wants to her in her life. well see how things turn out.  a song that made me feel a lot better today in that way songs can: ""Cange your Mind"" by sister hazel. it was on the announcements.  im gonna go eat.  heres to hoping emily and i get a little closer. *raises glass*"
D0SIWII,female,16,"Andrew Shirman is detremental to my blogging.  Actually, so is Emily, in a contradictory way. Cause when i  do  talk to her, theres less to complain about, and less reason to blog.   In conclusion: I talked to andrew and emily for a while today and now i no longer have the motivation to update. perhaps tomorrow."
D0SIWII,female,16,"so while here ive been thinking about who i want to take with me when i come this summer and my parents let me take a friend. last year, as we all know, i took emily. it was fun. lots of fun. felt pretty close. so its coming time again to make my choice again.   last year there was much debate in my head between caitlin and emily because i thought cait would have fun out here and i didnt see her much last year and...i dunno, i wouldve had fun with her, i know i wouldve. but i took emily cause...i dont know, cause i just wanted it more.   and i made that choice with every intention of ""switching off"" between who i took...as in this year i would take, say, caitlin, and next year i would take, say, martha...and the year after that...just...different people each time. because thats fair. and i want to be fair.  cept now im stuck between caitlin and emily again. cause i miss emily soooo much and to spend an entire week with her again would be awesome...but then i also kind of promised myself i would take cait...and it still would be fun to take cait. i dont doubt we would have fun down here.  so...i dunno. im stuck a little, i guess.   i dont know if emily would want to come again though...she probably would, i guess. just the same boring stuff as last time though. but id make sure we did some more fun things...different than we did last time. and i know shes gonna be busy...with job and stuff...  but i could still try, right?  and i have no idea what caits doing this summer...i dont even know if shes taking summer school...but were going after 1st semester summer school anyway cause alex and i are taking first semester.  so...as i believe i mentioned before...theres kind of like a mind vs. heart decision to make my heart says ""take emily! you love emily! you miss emily! take every chance you get to spend more time with her!"" and my brain says ""take turns, caitlins a good friend too, she would have a lot of fun out here and so would you, dont waste all your life just with emily. it would probably mean a lot to her too, since she expects you to take emily again.""  they both make good points.  and then im like ""well, you could bring both..."" cause i think if i argued long enough, theyd let me take both cait and emily... cept cait would feel left out, i think... that or i could cultivate a cool cait and amanda and emily threesome friendship thing. except do i want that? i dont know... i want my best frien d  to be emily. which is selfish and stupid. and it also makes me want to just take emily again.  and...yeah...i dunno  michele told me to take caitlin. but she  would , wouldnt she? and that makes me want to take emily even more...just to spite her. caitlin told me to take emily...and that makes me want to take caitlin. because she would be selfless and nice and want me to be happiest...and automatically suggest i take emily even when i mention im considering taking her or someone else... i havent asked emily, but shed probably tell me to take caitlin...which would make me want to take emily for the same reason caitlin telling me to take emily makes me want to take caitlin eric told me to take emily. but he  would . but that makes me want to take emily more, i guess. because he was trying to come up with things to help me get closer to her. i cant remember things anyone else has told me if theyve given me thier opinions.  im thinking ill end up asking emily. because i would feel bad if i was here with caitlin and thinking ""i miss emily""...feel bad as in...feel guilty...that i took caitlin and i cant just be happy that im here with caitlin. if that makes any sense.  and because i cant help jumping at every opportunity i have to get closer to emily. and because i love emily more. i just do. no offense to caitlin. i love her too. i just...what can i say? we all know how much i care about emily. i cant help but want to spend time with her so badly.  and stuff.  i dunno.  i dont even know really why im writing this. but i felt like it should be written.  and thers a giant bug flying around my room and its freaking me out and i think i might go kill it.  and mayb eill write later about my disgust with the abortion adds in the phonebook. probably not though. already did that once today.  and heres hopnig for winfield. cause that would be cool.  off to kill the mystery bug. night."

D0SIWII,female,16,"this most likely will make no sense:  to be young and one who thinks is not easy. when you can think about what matters to you, and what your philosophy on life is and what relationships really mean to you and so fourth, when you can figure that all out for yourself...and you spout wise words backed up by small (though not without their substance) experiences... and you make idealistic promises to yourself and to others.... and then you go through a period where many of the things you believed to be true are tested... you have to stick to what you said, because you do not wish to be a hypocrite, and you want to stick to your values... its...just...hard..cause...ah, i dunno.

D0SIWII,female,16,"i was thinking about trying out livejournal... so i went to go make an account, right? but its stupid and wont let me do it for some reason. for one thing, it says your password has to be a dictionary word. thats unfair. a password is harder to guess if it isnt a word. and i use the same password for a lot of things. and it isnt a word. so i have to pick a new one. i do. apparently its not a word. i cant find any password that are words. apple isnt a word. oh, and it doesnt want to let me use ""yellowfuzz13"" as my name because its over 15 characters and contains letters that arent a-z and it contains numbers that arent 0-9. right. i gave up. obviously God does not want me to have a livejournal.  i should really be doing my homework. but im lazy and i dont feel like it. so...im not.  emily got her license yesterday. yay for emily.  might  drive over to see me today for a few minutes. ""we'll see."" dont know if thats more of a maybe or a no. but, hey, it is on the way home from lauries. (and why is laurie so special? no...dont want to ask that...probably no reason. im just paranoid.) so that could be a nice break from homework. im hoping for it, though i dont know how likely it is.   i ordered girl scout cookies from heather today. apparently all together my family has ordered 15 boxes. 15! seems like a lot. i guess theyll go quickly, though. have ordered from heather, michele, and my moms pto friend's daughter. irked me when michele said something innocently enough but with an impied statement of ""you only bought cookies from heather last year, dont forget im selling them too. youre my friend too. my neighbor too. its not fair."" blah blah blah... of course shes not that mean, but i know she meant to make me feel guilty or something. in an innocent sort of way. bah! human interaction. crazy. reminds me of that thing on julies profile:  Why do we speak in songs?  she asked, and my only response was to shrug and remind her that often it is easier to take words from others, let others speak that which is in our hearts.  But who is willing to bend his emotions to those of someone else? she asked.  All of us and none of us, I said.  We wish for people to read between the lines.  Subtext, she exclaimed.  In a way, I said.  Those who care about you are supposed to know what's written on your heart.  interesting, no? [sadness alert] mmm, but... what if, try as you may, you dont know everything about those you care about? and its hard to read their heart? not for lack of trying... sigh. i wish i was better at knowing what people really mean when they say things. or what they really mean when they do things. what they truly feel and think. and ive taken to just asking sometimes. but hten i get ""i dunnos"" which is bad cause, hell, what else am i supposed to do if you wont tell me and i cant figure it out myself? but then again, maybe im just trying to read into things too much and theres really nothing of any significance thought and felt but unsaid. in which case we can just conclude that i worry too much and should calm down and enjoy life and what happiness it gives me instead of making myself unhappy thinking about the happiness it wont give me and how much i want it. or something. i dont know. you can word that differently so that it sounds like either side is a good option. i could say what i just said, which makes it sound like im crazy for killing myself over something i should just forget about. or i could something to the effect of its crazy for me to give up and stop trying to acheive something i want so much, so...passionately, because just the fact that i want to keep trying is worth something, and i know i could give up and make life easier, but i dont want to because its so important to me, and isnt that sort of honorable? to sacrifice happiness for...ideals? sort of? or something? you know what i mean? yeah. i know exactly what i mean...  ""Big Balls"" by ACDC is a good song. funny. now thats one long double entendre.  i think ive decided for certain that im not goign to turnabout. for myriad reasons. and there is, in fact, heatherandmichele weirdness as i suspected there would be. which, before anything else, makes me feel bad for emily. who shouldnt have to deal with that. emily who just wanted people to go with her and eric to turnabout. maybe it wont be a big deal and no one will get mad or anything. thatd be nice. but thast one of the reasons i didnt want to go. i dont want to deal with that. because even if it doesnt bother emily, itd bother me. me who worries too much.       and then there are a million other reasons why i dont want to go. well, as i told martha who is/has been bothering me about this. (and is a (if not  the ) source of the michele problems...which annoys me)  martha:  kara:  just because she doesn't have a date doesn't mean she can't come...we can just have some extras...a lot of groups have that me: i know that. i just...the reasons for going arent tipping the scale when i try to weigh them with the reasons for not going martha: :-( me: and this michele thing...doesnt motivate me. Martha: what would motivate u?? me: i dont know me: if i had a guy i wanted to go with...who wanted to go wtih me... and if i would get to talk to emily lots without awkward eric-ness... and if i didnt have to deal with anit-michele (and heather) weirdness... and if i didnt have to dislike any band friends...and if caitlin was going... and if jessica was going... and if i had a dress i wanted to wear...and... if all the guys we were going with got along well... and... i dont know. stuff. me: probably more. Martha: ya me: if you can solve all of those problems for me, id probably go. me: but good luck with that.  those are some of the reasons i dont want to go. yes, some of them are vague. some actually less vague than i originally intented them to be. but thats why i dont want to go in a nutshell. two main reasons: 1. no guy. 2. although i may see emily, i dont think it will be a comforting ""yay, we ARE good and happy friends! why do i worry?"" kind of thing. i fear it may be the reverse, which is to be avoided at all costs if i value my sanity. and maybe that makes me a coward or means im avoiding the problem, or something. but oh well. maybe it means nothign and there is no problem and im just worrying too much. maybe thats it!  or maybe im crazy and paranoid and need medication or something. always a possibility...  though ive always thought i wouldnt want medication if they gave me medication to make me sane. i dont trust people screwing with my thoughts and my emotions and my reality. its all i have that no one can take away from me. and its all that is me, really. they cant mess with who i am. never.  mm, arguing morality with martha again. reminicent of the ""love"" conversation. mmm, never should have started that one... although... all this anti-michele business from the girl who said money can buy love. i dont get her. shes a good kid, i know it...but...i just dont completely get her. i wonder if i still get emily? mmm, i hope so. maybe i can again.  i tried making an omlette for breakfast/lunch. it came out kinda badly. tasted okay but it was a little too liquidy for my tastes. i always have that problem with omlettes...the inside part doestn cook all the way through. oh, and another problem i have is putting what physically are too many ingredients...though as far as taste goes, its usually dead on. crazy omlettles. my hand still smell like onions.  i think maybe ive been thinking too much today...maybe its a sign that i shouldnt give myself so much free time. though its good to think, right? sure...  ooh, now this conversation is deep. im probably making her sad and confused, actually. at least i hope im not. criticizing her philosophy on life...her lack of motivation for trying...and wondering if this is because she doesnt have a good reason for living...you know how everyone needs something to work towards to get up in the mroning? to make the bad days worth it? all taht....yeah... thats what were talking about now. depressing if youre just realizing these things and they shock you...which i dont think im doing to her, but...well, lets hope not. eh, i dont think i am. martha: u said the if u have nothing to work towards then ur life isnt fulfilling...so why does it have to be fulfilling??  sigh... some people i just dont get.   i feel like chinese food. i need to do my homework. i need to listen to some cool music. ive been blogging too long. i wish emily checked her email more often and actually sent me more email. that would make me happier. among other things. i wonder how it feels to know simple things like that...or just your actions in general affect another persons mood so profoudnly. i wonder if its overwhelming. i wonder if she even realizes it.  i decide today that i really want to be able to make people feel guilty. i want to know how to word things so delicately that they sound like an innocent comment but really they kindle a fire of guilt in the back of the mind...and then you drop little comments here and there...and the fire grows...and grows...and... maybe its cruel...it probably is. but sometimes i just want people to know how they should feel. like, dammit, that hurt, you dont feel guilty but you should! you know? ah, i dunno. i shouldnt wish things like this.  i wish...*closes eyes*... i wish...if you know me well at all, you know what i just wished for.  ha...and if you dont know me: its not a guy, its not money, its not my license, its not a grade, its not...anything matieral or stupid.  although...as someone wise once said, ""i wish: for trivial things, i pray for everything else"" or something like that. right? perhaps i shouldnt wish for something so important.  im going to get a cookie.  by the way, who all is reading my blog now? should i stop talking about emily? originally no one read this at all and i didnt talk about people or school...just...ideas. but now its more of a real blog for me. and apparently several people read it now...and jessica i dont care about so much cause she knows me and the people i tend to talk about well enough not to take anything the wrong way or anything. not that i dont trust my other friends who raed this, but... bah. i dunno. dont go crazy or think me insane over things i write. or think the people i write about are insane. or something. wow, i could have written this much more eloquently if i had more time and wasnt as distracted. oh well. basically: some of this is my private life you wouldnt normally hear about, i dont always freely tell anyone everything written on my heart, and maybe theres a reason for that. so keep that in mind while reading."

D0SIWII,female,16,"I was looking at my profile a few days ago to make sure I changed it as I wanted. And I was looking over everything that’s always there and I read my “random proverb” and usually I don’t think much about them…they’re obvious things like “its better to light a candle than curse the darkness” or something. But that day I got a proverb I really thought about. “Live your own life, for you will die your own death”-Latin Proverb. And I didn’t like it. Because I don’t think we really live our own lives. I don’t think we’re put on earth to live for ourselves. I don’t live for myself. I don’t even own my own life. Other people own me. My family owns my life, my friends own my life, people I have yet to meet own my life. It’s not mine. It’s theirs. I think a person lives to touch others, to change lives, to be there for those who need them. Like George Eliot said, “What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?” So I don’t think I live my own life. I don’t think I want to live my own life. My life is not mine, it was never mine. It belongs to anyone who’s life is better now because I exist. It belongs to every stranger I’ve ever smiled at, and it belongs to those few people who will never be the same because of me. That’s why I have absolutely no problem with giving away pieces of myself-pieces of my soul. My soul was never mine, anyway. I told someone once in gym that I sold part of my soul earlier in the morning for free. I got the weirdest look. Like “either you’re joking, or you’re sick.” And I just laughed because…well, just cause I gave away a piece of paper (well, 2) that says “A piece of Amanda” doesn’t mean I’ve lost a part of myself and will now never be a whole and real person. Nothing of the sort! I gave away that part of myself a long time ago talking between bus seats in the rain thousands of miles from home…and boom, it was gone. Maybe I didn’t know it then, but it was. But as i said, it wasn’t mine, it didn’t ever belong to me, it was always someone else’s. I was just kind of holding it till I could give it away. From the day I was born, it wasn’t mine, I just didn’t know who it belonged to yet. Well, there were a lot of things I didn’t know about myself the day I was born. But I’m not getting into that. So I refuse to live my own life, for I do not live for myself. I mean, what am I? what will I be when I am gone? Once i die and am buried in the earth, people will not remember me as I was. Only I will ever know who and what I truly am. People will remember what I did for them, what I was to them…what part of myself is now a part of them. And is not that also what I am? Oh, the question of what I am… “Tell me who admires you and loves you, and I will tell you who you are.” said Charles Augustin Sanite-Beauve. Who am I then, but all I mean to others? And if that is what I am, then I think it is those others who own me. And if I do not own myself, then I cannot live my own life. I will live for the people I love…I will live to love them! And I will live not my own life, but a life I owe to them! And I will die not my own death, but the death of the person who was loved and who meant so much to all these other people. I will not die my own death in that it is not mine! It cannot be mine if my life is not mine. I don’t own my death as I don’t own my life. So screw the proverb, I will not live my own life, and I will not die my own death! A life doesn’t belong to the one who lives it. One is not made only of his own substance. He is made of all things he has ever seen, ever heard, ever felt, ever experienced. And I am not made of myself. I am made of all things I have ever lived. I am made, mostly, of other people. And if that is so, how can I say that I have my own life? I do not."

D0SIWII,female,16,"""anyway, i guess what im saying is...if you really love someone...it doesnt matter what kind of changes life throws at you...you do whatever you can to stay close to that person...and maybe that sounds crazy and like a whole lotta work...but if love 'em, its worth it.""  i am not a hypocrite, i am not a hypocrite, i am not a hypocrite, i am not a hypocrite...  its a hell of a lot easier to say that crap then it is to live it. but im workin on it. and actually, i have a new motivation... im on heather miller's profile...band drum major. emilys sisters good friend. i think i told her i was gonna steal her cape once...when i didnt recognize her and i didnt think i knew her. eh, oh well. but anyway, if shes gonna go through the trouble of appreciating the crazy rants ive made... then i damn well better stick to what i say.   my quotes that have been on her xanga (that i know of, anyway):   ""They say nothing can be perfect...but you can have the perfect friend, the perfect day, the perfect piece of advice, the perfect...a lot of things. Things...as well as people, can be perfect in their imperfection. Perfection is not so much the total absence of flaws as it is the presence of  the most desireable characteristics according to the situation. My perfect day is not the perfect day. Perfection is pretty personal anyway.""  ""if the world does not see fit to give you out of life all that you deserve, those closest to you will be sure to make up for all the times the world fell short.""  ""look at your friends and tell me there's no God...if you can, get new friends""      and, that, actually, is misquoted... assuming shes quoting me, which i think that she is. its really, ""Just look at your friends and tell me there's not a God...If you can honestly do that, get new friends"" but it doesnt matter, its the same message.  yeah, so thats not a big deal or anything... but, i dunno... it made me feel better cause it makes me seem less crazy... and i feel so crazy nowadays."
D0SIWII,female,16,"theyd better let me use my phone on this retreat thing or im going to go psycho insane and start kiling people. probably not, but ill be pissed and cynical. if they want me at my spiritual fitest, then itd be in their best interest to let me use my cell phone so that i can talk to people i like instead of having to deal with all these other people who annoy me all the time...it just might keep me from going crazy. and they couldnt understand how important it is that i talk to emily often enough. otherwise i dont work right. and if im supposed to be having a spiritual revelation or something, then id better be satisfied enough with emily matters to think deeply about God or Life or whatnot. becaus eif im missing emily therell be that little nagging thought of ""why doesnt God advocate my friendship with emily? cause if he did, i think hed be a little easier on me..."" which i know i shouldnt think and i know is the wrong thing to think for a million different reasons. i know it. iknowitiknowitiknowit. but i cant help but think it sometimes. because i dont understand this whole thing very well....and no one knows how to explain it to me either. and its ""for everything there is a season"" vs. ""[love] bears all things, believes all things, hopes all thigns, endures all thing. love never ends."" and the general praise of persistance and giving of the self for something you believe in...  and who wins? and its ""let it be"" vs. ""all you need is love"" vs.... i dont know. so many conflicting theories. and... and... all i want is my friend back and my crazy, idealistic, love-goggled words and proclamations that heather can quote to her hearts content.  and, that. is why i should be able to use my cell phone.  thank you."
D0SIWII,female,16,"So let's hear it for  bastardasswhole  brothers who brake your laptop on new years eve about 5 minutes before midnight and try to blame you for it because the cord was in the way.  Hey, you have eyes MORON, use them.  Dont tell me its my fault because you tripped on the cord and knocked the laptop onto the hard tile floor and subsequently busted up the side of it. Its your goddamn fault.  grr...i hate brothers... sometimes i really wish i had sisters instead.  new years is an overrated holliday.  and i didnt get to talk to emily right before like last year, either. not that i expected to, but...it was nice.  so im pissed cause my laptop is broken and i didnt do anything worthwhile today and i still have a shitload of homework to do (not to mention that no one from my chem group has emailed me back yet. apparently theyre unconcerned about our presentation. bastards.) and i didnt do anything fun for new years and no ones online and have to wait like 3 weeks for emily to maybe sleepover which is the only frickin thing i even cared about doing this whole break. make that the only frickin thing i care about at all anymore. at least care a hell of a lot more about it than i do about anything else. and i probably shouldnt, but screw what i should do and fixing myself and everything.   maybe i should just stop caring about everything. period. and i woudlnt ever have to ask anyone for anything again. and that way i would never be disappointed. ever.  too bad i could never do that. sigh.  and i have no idea about who im going to bring down here when i finally get that chance again. theres the mind decision and the heart decision and there probably shouldnt be and hopefully reality will help me a bit in solving that but who the hell knows?  i was in a better mood earlier. hopefully i will be tomorrow. im going to bed.  at least i have bob. and that ""just in case."" some comfort there."
D0SIWII,female,16,"wanted emily to sleep over today. we all knew that. she has her little party thing with caitlin and rhidi (sp?) today and told me she didnt think she could. but... f**k that. ive waited since winter break and before that...the waiting is crazy....im not gonna let a stupid party ruin my plans. shes gonna come sleep over after her party. so she may be a little late, oh well. ill talke what i can get. she was supposed to call me when she found out how long she was gonna be at this party...but then my familys all like ""youre only getting dinner and lunch if you come out right now to eat with us"" so i have to go, right? yeah, she calls while im gone and doesnt leave a message and i call when i get back but no one answers so i assume shes at this party...so now im in a great position. i get to wait until she gets home and she calls me or gets online (or comes back from being away, actually) and i have no idea when that'll be. homefully any minute now. (hint, hint, emily...) but every minute that goes by is a minute later she'll come over...or, more accurately, i fear...every minute is another reason why she shouldnt sleep over. who comes to sleep over at 10:00, right? she knows (or should know) that the later she comes over, the later im gonna want to keep her up. but, oh, i keep hoping in vain... pleasepleasepleaseplease  ahhhh. this is the stuff that drives me crazy...the hoping in vain and the let down after the hope is gone.. and... ahhh, i hate it. it makes me feel like...well, i get this image if an inflatable clown dummy that someone just keeps punching like a punching bag and the clown just keeps coming back each time....just to get punched in the face again. its kinda like that. and i wish it wasnt. makes me wanna scream that i hate the world...in that stupid teeanger way. and im not a stupid teenager, i just...i just want my friend. is that so much to ask for? dont i deserve it?  anyone who reads this...come on...dont i deserve to see emily more often? doesnt it drive me crazy when i never get to see her...never get to talk to her? cant i just get what i want? what ill comes of it? i just want to see my friend! dont i deserve that?  ahhh.  lets hope she calls/gets online soon.  pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease *crossing fingers*"
D0SIWII,female,16,"this was one of those days where there were so many things i wanted to do that i couldnt decide what to do and then i just ended up doing nothing.  i was gonna make another origami creature and possibly even write emily a note and then make it into a creature and use the origami as a new creative folding technique. but...  and i really feel like talking to emily and i havent yet. i could email her but she never replies and i could write her a note, but its so much faster to type...so why write? i guess im just lazy. and id call but she had track and then dinner and now homework, so shes probably busy. and so im just waiting now, like always, for her to get online. cause im like that.  and i thought about making cookies. but i didnt.  and i have homework i ought to do, but havent done yet. cause im a lazy idiot. just euro and math though, so...not too bad. and theres always study hall.  and i was gonna drive up to coldstone to get ice cream...but... well i guess its my moms fault we didnt do that one.  and i was gonna write...and i wanted to.. but i kinda lost the spirit... i had it after that awesome ""Rhythm and Rhyme"" class with this dude Danny McKleever. That was the coolest thing ever! Spoken word poetry preformances...poetry slam kinda stuff. all his own work. it was amazing. moving, i should say. he was kinda cute too. i mean, he was like mid-twenties to early thirties or something in age, so obviously not right for me or anything. He still had a certain charm though. And he had long dark eyelashes. haha, maybe i have a thing for poets with long dark eyelashes (fiennes as Shakespeare). mmm, poets. :-) its like ""Oh my God,  you think!  you speak so eloquently! you care so passionately about things! you have a heart! i think i love you!"" *swoon* mmm...i want a boyfriend...  odyssey today was alright.   dia numero dos:  1. Tales Told True (Jessica and Casey)- pretty boring. im not really one for story tellers...unless...well i just wasn interested in his stories. i dunno. they didnt thrill me.  2. Neo-Futurists (Brittany?)- This was pretty cool. a little weird, but cool. too political at times, but very humorous at others. i respect the players.  3. Rhythm and Rhyme (uh...well...catia?)- This was amazing. so cool. especially his emphasis on love and hearts and souls and...all that good stuff. the real stuff. ill bet he understands my concept of real. and i decided im gonna hang out in poetry slam coffee houses when im in college. and im gonna date a poet. and were gonna live happily ever after. and im gonna drive up and visit emily every month or so and we will be awesome friends for the rest of our lives.  4. Lunch (*deep breath* kara, heather, lauren, emily, emily, monica, kelly, jessica, sara, olga, and some people i dont know)- lunch was okay... it was better yesterday though. when i had better emily talk.  5. Blues Brothers (Caitlin and Jessica and Kara and Brittany and Emily and...well, Eric)- the thing was pretty boring. had an okay time i guess. wish i could have actually talked to emily though. did mess with her guidebook, however, good fun in that. but...eric...  eric...garg. i cant take it when its hes with her and were all in a group or something. i guess...i guess its just a jealousy thing...im jealous because hes the one she wants to talk to...more than she wants to talk to me. and its...accepted and expected that they sit next to each other hold hands and talk and giggle and stuff. theyre going out, right? yeah, they are. she has a right to like him, doesnt she? yes, she does. but...i hate... its like being teased. Its like shes right...there...infrontof me...but i...just...cantquitetouch...her...no matter...how...close...always...just. out.of.reach. Here she is, heres this person who means the world to me, and i spend so much time waiting to talk to her, waiting to have these chances...and for what? so i can watch him put his head on her shoulder and know its not a good time to...know shes not in my world right now. But its so hard not to want so badly...       I cant ignore it. its like...theres Emily! my friend i love more than anything. and everything inside of me jumps towards her, begging me to talk to her, laugh with her, learn all i can about her. watch her heart beat. understand what invisible forces keep her together, keep her looking up and moving foward. memorize what color thread binds her heart to her mind, her mind to her body, and her body to her soul. I want to trace the contours of that soul like lines on the inside of her palm as she laughs and tells me to stop tickling her. *breath* And all of that, all of that complex, raw emotion and raging passion roars and riots insatiable inside me. and its everything i can do to calm and quiet the calmity of cacophony with a subtle, soothing ""shh, now is not the time, nor the place for such things.""....and i sigh. pushing it all back and telling it to wait...just wait... eventually there will be a time. but push enough of that back and you get this horrible build up of pressure and thats what gets to me sometimes. but sunday released a lot of that, so im not in danger of exploding any time soon. polaski day weekend is near, anyway...   i figured out what i should have said today. caitlin with ""but ive known her the longest"" eric with ""but im her boyfriend"" kara with ""but im the reason youre going out"" and me with...nothing... nothing but the most candid, sincere, devoted thought--or feeling, rather-- of ""but i love you!"" and i kinda laughed and said ""uh...ive got nothing"" but i shouldve said...i really should have said ""but i love her the most"" and gotten into whatever arguments would follow (even if we were semi-joking in the first place), because im pretty goddamn sure i love her more deeply than any of them do, even eric. i mean, i guess its different because its a crush kind of thing, but if you could somehow measure my love against erics, i think id still win. and maybe thats ignorance speaking, but oh well. let see which of us goes most crazy if you take her away. ill bet you anything its me.   well anyway...  Thats what i dont like about this boyfriend business. That she has less time for me because of him and that i dont feel like i can talk to her when hes around. And thats a big reason i didnt go to homecoming or turnabout. do i want to deal with that crap all night? hell no.  but dont get me wrong. eric is a good kid. and if he makes emily happy, so be it. she deserves to be happy.   ...and wow. i spent too long writing this. and its probably a little more personal than id like...but...oh well, i guess. i felt like ranting, i suppose. and in a bombastic, emotional sort of way. been a while since i had a good rant. unless you count that thing from sunday. but happiness rants dont count as much. theyre not...emotional/moral unrest rants. which i specialize in.  or something.  i dunno. i need to do my homework."

D0SIWII,female,16,"i am sitting in my chair facing the window watching the sun set without my glasses on leaning against a blanket tuning out the sounds of ""that seventies show"" from downstairs and ignoring that nagging feeling that i should do my homework because i cant help but wish with all my heart... over and over again... that we could be cool, totally awesome friends again and i wouldnt have to care so much when i couldnt see her... because we would be close enough and talk often enough that it would be like hanging out with her every day. and the sun would shine every day and it would be a perfect 72* with a tropical breeze and there would be no war and no homework and no insensitivity between people and... and the homeless would have homes. and everyone would recycle. and... the world...my world...would be a much more peaceful place if this emily pasch character and our narrator were friends like they used to be.   you know...monica had this thing on her profile once...about what she would wish for if she had one wish...and how she wants very much to help the world...but there are times....there are times when it gets to you and you might just take those tickets.  its kinda like taht with me and my one wish. cept i dont want to go to romania.   sigh.  i guess i just ought to remind myself its worth it....its always worth it. so suck it up and wait it out.  and do constructive things along the way. hmm...constructive things... i wonder waht i should do....  and for some reason i think im mad at eric. i dont know why... but the last couple times anyones mentioned him or ive though about it its kinda been like ""oh,  eric ..."" *rolls eyes*. i wonder why im mad at him? maybe for his lent suggestion... maybe cause im jealous...maybe.... saturday? ah, who knows...  that was something else i was going to tell her: 6 people!  and 18 words... i wanted to know what those 18 words were  i should make a list of these things. is that constructive? hmmm....study hall tomorrow.  a month and five days till i get my questions. 36 days. im counting down. i want those."
D0SIWII,female,16,"So i havent been updating recently cause i was busy with 8th grade graduation and finals and harry potter and martha's party and all... and i get to go to michele's tomorrow. and...i also havent been updating cause ive been happy. and when im happy i have less of a need to complain. but summer school starts tuesday. so dont worry, loyal readers (ha, like i have loyal readers). So finals were blah. i was just like ""let me outta here"" all week. none of them were spectacularly hard. maybe cause i didnt have euro. hardest tests ive ever taken were in euro. crazy euro.      wednesday after school heather and michele and i had lunch at Fridays with our cute, nice waiter dude who we talked about the whole time afterwards and then we went to Oberweis (or however you spell it) for ice cream and then my mommy picked us up and i almost broke her keys and she got mad but its all okay now.      8th grade graduation was cute but kind of a waste of time cause i needed to be studying for chem. I was annoyed by the talkative people in front and behind me. And andrew got in big trouble for causing a scene. which was amusing i guess. And i got to see Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Julis and Mrs. Hayna. that was kind of fun. Aw, woodlawn... i had some great times there.      On thursday i had chem and spanish and chem wasnt murder, but wasnt easy, and spanish, of course, was a joke. I had excruciating cramps though...which made me really angry and made it hard to take the finals...so hard i had to go to the nurse during spanish and lie down for 20 minutes then come back and finish the final. the lying down helped a lot, actually. i was so pissed at my body for giving me inconvenient pain on my last final of the year though. bah.       Lets see...then i came home and called emily to ask her what was up with this saxophone business... and then i went to the mall... and i got some candy and a cool harry potter shirt to wear to the movie last night (albeit from Hot Topic...ewww...but harry potter. so appropriate i just had to live with the fact that it was from hot topic). and...""The Bell Jar"" which i intend to read at some point...and...i thought at least one other thing but i forget. Then i came home and slept and then i went to marthas.      Martha's party was fun...got some nice time talking to people (especially emily...though i still like it better when its just me and her) and some good laughs and a fun harry potter wand which i can now not find. :'(. And we saw harry potter at midnight and it was AWESOME! i loved it. i thought it was amazing. better than the first 2. i like the new director. it had some cool moments. And now i totally wish i went to hogwarts and had a robe and all... and i really want to be a harry potter character for halloween. im thinking of going for a slytherin house member witch person. cause i dont want to be hermoine or however you spell her name. and i dont want to be a gryfindor house person cause gryfindor is the house everybody loves cause its harrys house... and i dont want to be ravenclaw or hufflepuff cause nobody cares about those loser houses...therefore, even though it is a tad evil, i think i shall be a slytherin girl. Like with a Harry Potter (R) Slytherin House Robe costume... if they sell those... i wonder if i fit in child sizes? hmmm...i could try. And i totally want a green and silver tie. And theres this cool place online that sells harry potter patches... and i want a slythin house crest thing to put on whatever shirt im gonna wear under my cloak... and i want a harry potter student hat. and...and...and... aw, thats gonna be so much money. oh well. remind me, guys, that i wanna be a slytherin for halloween. (sorry if ive been spelling syltherin wrong this whole time but i dont feel like looking it up and slytherine looks funny and thats the only other spelling i can conjure, so deal with it)      And emily woudlnt stay up late to talk with me, but its okay, i guess, theres pleanty of time for that later this summer.   And...today i came home and slept and looked at harry potter merchandise on the internet and watched Batman and galled liz to find out whats up with this party on tuesday. and... hmm...i dunno.   i gotta figure out if emily'll sleep over next weekend and when her engineering thing is and all this other stuff for planning my fantastic mr. fox summer. and the field museum and brookfiled zoo and churches and 6 flags and more sleepovers and the park and fireflies and... and..  i also intend to buy the harry potter soundtrack. to either the first or secnd film. not hte 3rd though, it was good, but hte music was somewhat unimpressive. so it should say a lot htat i liked the second one even if the music wasnt amazing to me, as amazing music is something i find key in a good movie.   and now im gonna go see if they have slytherin key chains...  muh ha ha ha ha ha ha.  i go for my driving test on monday. watch out.  i am happy. :-)  ITS SUMMER!"

D0SIWII,female,16,"how odd it is...to wet an ordinary object with tears on accident... and to think...how no one will ever know of that evidence...that once someone was crying. no one will ever suspect, ever think for just a second, that once there was sadness there, once there was fear, once there was love... and its all right there. proof... perhaps long dried and wiped away, but there in spirit. and no one will ever know. no one will ever wonder. no one will ever realize that right there, in their hands...is a witness to what is valued above all, to what tears apart, to what moves. a witness to the undeniable truths at the core of a human soul.  ...the secrets my chem book could tell."

D0SIWII,female,16,"i changed my template. yay. havent quite figured out how to get my links up though. im working on it. and i mean to post a picture at some point. and fix my description. here at Yellowfuzz13's deep thoughts, we're getting a makeover.      in honor of my recently clensed soul, as well. or something. In honor of my acceptance as in integral part of the Catholic Community. with a capital C. ha...something like that.       yeah, so i got confirmed today. It was fun. The bishop was nice. Not some old fogey like i expected. He  did  have a shiny gold ring on his pinky though...which made me think of Luther and Catholic Church monetary power abuses and all that reformation/euro stuff. But he was still nice. So maybe he deserved his ring. And he wore a cool red robe that looked like id be fun to wear. and his pointy bishops hat. ha. And...lets see... i got to do the big important job of lighting my row's candles. stupid open door almost blowing out my candle. And...Father Ron had to tell me to blow out my candle when the bishop started to come over to talk to me cause i was confused because i thought i had to blow it out but i looked around and no one else was blowing their out and i turned to Michele and i was like ""am i supposed to blow this out?"" and shes like ""i dunno"" so i didnt and then...he whispered ""you can blow out the candle""... so i did. and...yeah. damn being first. oh well. got it over with quickly. And i got annointed with some fancy oil on my forehead. its still there, actually. mmm, fancy oil. holy oil, actually.      and...mmm...it was funny when my aunt/sponsor Libby confessed that she could only say the Hail Mary in spanish because it was just like automatic and it was weird and took thinking-through to start saying it in english. Apparently she prays all prayers only in spanish except the Our Father which she forced herself to learn in English. haha. funny to me. Crazy Spanish.       And i got 2 new rosaries. and a watch. and a book. and some jewelry. and...a keychain? i dunno, its not important what i got.       And i saw laurie there with Eric! aw, that was so cute. haha. You think Eric would go to Emilys confirmation if she was getting confirmed this year? i dunno. It'd be weird to have my boyfriend there with my parents and grandparents and all... i guess itd be weird to have a boyfriend in the first place. i cant imagine so many things related to that.      And im really tired and i soooo dont want to go work on our chem project tomorrow and i soooo dont want to do all the million pieces of homework i have. like those 2 essays. arg. i should force myself to do at least one of them this weekend. maybe the spanish one? oh, bah. well see. i wonder if i ever took my english stuff home? i hope so.       And i hope i get to do something with Emily next weekend or at least talk to her on the phone for a while. Then again, when am i not hoping to talk to her? Gosh...i could talk to that girl for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and days... and not get sick of it. Thats why id be perfect to take her to Tucson! but...alas.      Maybe that should be my goal this summer... to see if i can ever get sick of her. When ive talked to her so much im tired of it...then...ironicly...i can celebrate. With party hats and streamers and cake and everything. Minifiesta. And there will be much love. and happiness. abound.      I'm such a loser. I need a life. This is my life? this is what i write about on my blog? ha... im so weird. oh well... ill blame it on chemicals. Seeing emily engouh and talking to her often enough stabilizes some sort of chemical balance in my brain. Without that contact--> imbalance---> :'(. Damned chemicals.  right.  actually...f**k chemicals...love isnt chemicals! i refuse! my soul loves her soul. ha. eat that, science. *does show-off-y dance with fingers and girations*  anyway...  im going to bed. Goodnight, world. Goodnight, God. Goodnight, Emily. Goodnight, everyone who wishes i would individually mention them, because they probably deserve it for one reason or another but im a jerk and only mention Emily cause i like to think she's ""special"". Goodnight."
D0SIWII,female,16,"I purchased this handy dandy new philosophy book last night at Barnes and Noble when i was loitering with Martha and Kara. Its one of those ""the dummys guide"" thigns... well, actually, the real title is,  The Complete Idiot's Guide To Understanding Ethics . well, i think most people would be on my side if i were to say im no idiot when it comes to morals, but... i was flipping through it and it had some simple explanations of many theories...which is cool. so i was reading it this morning...i read about psychological egoists and actually wasnt very convinced with their argument against them, but then again i just cant find it in me to believe (like, really  believe) in psychological egoism anyway, so what does it matter? Its one of those things i wonder about sometimes.       Psychological egoism is, for anyone whos wondering, the theory that humans always act out of self-interested motives and can't help but do so. ""In all cases, where people do things both good and bad, they are only doing things that they really want to do....doing good acts makes us feel really good about ourselves; our brains release pheromones, we feel a sense of self-worth, and it makes us happy"" (Ingram & Parks, 67). And for even mor explanation... ""Physchological egoists claim that (1) we only do things because we really want to, so we shouldn't be praised for good acts and (2) we want the good feelinging that come with doing good things, so doing good acts is really self-serving"" (Ingram & Parks 67). So its kinda like that. The theory that, no matter what you do, no matter how selfless and ""right"" it is... no matter how little you benefit from a certain act tangibly... youre still only really doing it because its going to make you feel good. like consoling a friend on the phone until 1 in the morning on a school night when shes just feeling awful and like life sucks and that nothing will ever get better.... why are you doing that? why waste your time when you need to be sleeping and doing homework and... its just stupid. well, youre doing it because you want to help your friend, right? well... psychological egoism says sure, youre doing it because you want to help your friend, but you want to help your friend because it makes you feel good inside when you help people. so really youre only doing it for that warm, fuzzy feeling. you know what im talking about?      Yeah, so my book talked about that and refuted it unsuccessfully in my opinion, but... the only thing that really stuck out as a good point against it was that ""The assertation that, 'Everything we do is done because we want to,' would be true by definition: To do something is to do something we choose to do; and to choose to do something is to want to do it. So, 'Everything that is done is done because we want to do it,' would mean nothing more than the empty claim that, 'everything that is done is done because it is done'"" (Ingram & Parks, 68). So, duh, we only do everything because itll make us feel good...because we want to.  Making a choice in favor of something is always means you want to do it, and if you want to do it, it means it has to be making you feel good about somethign in some way. you know? So maybe the whole theory isnt saying very much at all... being ethical is about making the best choices regarding those fuzzy feelings, i guess. I dunno. it doesnt completely satisfy me... there are still ""But!""s in my brain saying psychological egoism is true, and then there are the ""oh, shut up""s from the moralists in my head saying ""so what? doesnt take the dignity away from making good decisions."" and stuff... so yeah...  and it talked about moral subjectivity and stuff... but im not gonna get into that.  anyway, what i really meant to write about on here, was about Jeremy Bentham's idea of Utilitarianism....the idea that morality has nothign to do with pleasing God or being commited to absolute rules; rather, morality comes down to nothing more than the attempt to create as much happiness in the world as possible. which...well im not endorsing that or condeming it, but this Bentham guy set up this system for judging how much good will come from your actions. You have to rate things on a scale of 1-10 in 7 categories and tally up the points. Categories: 1. Intensity: How intense is the pleasure? 2. Duration: How long does the pleasure last? 3. Certainty: How certain are you that the pleasure will occur? 4. Proximity: How soon will the pleasure be experienced? 5. Fecundity: How many more pleasures will happen because of this one? 6. Purity: How free from pain is the pleasure? 7. Extent: How many of us will experience the pleasure?  (whoa...just got totally sidetracked for like an hour looking up slam poetry and trying to figure out of there are places/clubs in tucson that have weekly open mike nights or whatever... hey, its a college town. there are crazies. and where there are crazies, there are poets. how cool would it be to go to a poetry slam thing with the friend im gonna get to take over the summer? way cool indeed.)  So let me justify, using Bentham's method, what always seems to leave people shaking their heads...   SLEEP  (on a school night)  1. Intensity: mmm, sleeping's not incredibly intense, but the feeling of tiredness and will to sleep are sometimes, so ill give it a 5 2. Duration: Depends on how long I sleep, but say im gonna get 7 hours.... you know what? im still gonna be tired in the morning cause ill have to get up for school... though it will keep me from dying in class the next day... so im gonna go with 3 3. Certainty: How certain am i that im gonna get a nice, deep sleep? depends if i have something on my mind, but seeing as how i cant fully relax most school nights because therere always tests to worry about...lets go with 6 4. Proximity: the pleasure in sleeping is pretty much the moment you lay down and that period as youre falling asleep...when you know you can just sleep. so its pretty instantly gratifying, i guess. so...8 5. Frecundity: well i'll be fairly well rested for the next day, and thats good, so...maybe...6 6. Purity: I could have nightmares or bad dreams... if i have good dreams its very good... but not always...i tend to dream about things im worrying about... so... maybe... 6 7. Extent: aside from the fact that not as many people will hear me complain about how tired i am, my sleeping helps no one...so 1.  Total: 1+6+6+8++6+3+5= 35   STAYING UP LATER THAN I SHOULD TALKING TO EMILY ONLINE  (on a school night)  1. Intensity: :-) well, i do greatly enjoy my emily conversation...but in person or on the phone is better...so... 7.5 2. Duration: It will keep me happy until the next time i get to talk to her, because we know that the longer the gaps between fulfilling conversations, the crazier i get, so 7. 3. Certainty: mmm...this isnt that high because sometimes she isnt so willing to talk to me...what with homework and stuff...so 5. 4. Proximity: well its good to talk to her when i talk to her, so...um...9? 5. Frecundity: this is kind of a weird question...but... the more we talk, the more we know about each other and the better friends we are...so...8? 6. Purity: this might be lower too cause maybe wed have a serious conversation that wasnt necessarily free from all unfun thoughts...and...sometimes i realize things id rather not realize...so maybe...4...although not always...but...oh, i dunno, i should score this lower on something, shouldnt i? what the hell, ill just stick with 4. 7. Extent: well me and her get to have fun. and people get to be spared from hearing me complain as much about not talking to her... so... but still thats not very many people, so 3.  Total: 7.5+7+5+9+8+4+3= 43.5  35   Ha. Mathematically proven. sort of. But there. im not crazy. its just...true...for me. Id rather talk to emily than sleep. Now dont ever tell me you dont understand why i make that decision time after time.  and we also have an explanation for why i never used to get any sleep at sleepovers. and that was when her score would have been higher. cause 2, 5, 6, and 7 all would have been a little higher, methinks.  Crazy philosophy book. i wonder if it talks about love... perhaps i should look it up...  oh, you know what else i decided? when i take my friend to arizona were actually gonna do cool stuff. like possibly see some spoken word poetry preformances, visit carchner caverns, kit peak observatory... mmm... see a movie? i dunno, thats about all ive got so far... oh, go on a night hike in the desert with the ranger peoples. and go swimming and build forts in the guest house and capture lizards and... um... if she be emily, do some of the looking at the stars, feet in the pool truth or dare stuff...followed by a movie. of course. lovely routine, that.  mmm...vacation... i look forward to taking my friend. mmm, friend. frined(s) i should say. considering my parents never definitely said no about taking more than one. although...hmm... the issue of who is a rather large one this time. i dunno. it can wait at least until after spring break though.   i think i might go drive up to blockbuster and rent something. maybe. im scared of the roads again though. damned lane changes. i hate lange changing. im gonna get killed.  i really wanted to talk to emily too.... perhaps i should call... mmm, after my movie though. if mis padres permiten.  adios para ahora."
D0SIWII,female,16,"okay, i dont really want to quote this cause emily already did, so i feel like im stealing...and i sort of am, but too bad. this will always be here, and eventually shell have to change her profile, so...ha. I read The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros. it was okay. this is my favorite passage and i felt like putting it somewhere, so here:  ""And you could laugh, Sally. You could go to sleep and wake up and never have to think who likes and doesn't like you. You could close your eyes and you wouldn't have to worry what people said because you never belonged here anyway and nobody could make you sad and nobody would think you're strange because you like to dream and dream. And no one could yell at you if they saw you out in the dark leaning against a car, leaning against somebody without someone thinking you are bad, without somebody saying it is wrong, without the whole world waiting for you to make a mistake when all you wanted, all you wanted, Sally, was to love and to love and to love and to love, and no one could call that crazy."""
D0SIWII,female,16,"haha. i just have to post this because it applies to me in many, many ways. or at least...one big, cool one.     c/o Jessica's friend, Chloe."
D0SIWII,female,16,"so today i got my license. weeeeeeeeee. and it was the first day of summer school. not so weeeeee, but not horrible. and i would write a long, comprehensive description of my day if i had time, but its 10:30 and i gotta get up at 6 so i dont have time. the short version: -photo was boring, cool door, mr. myers is cool -license test was nerve-wraking and i totally thought i was gonna fail but my driving dude (deryl) was SUPER nice and i love him for the rest of my life for passing me -long line though, boring, but i beat jenna! -went to crazy liz-sam-cathy-joana party. first place i drove alone with license ever: Cathy's house. (but that shouldn't count cause its not magical). party was okay. -then spent a while working out plans and evetually went to hawthorn with cait and emily. drove by myslef there (2nd place ever). was lonely. -mall was short and not long enough. found the bookstore. cait had fun in a chair. i bought a cookie. went back to caits. took too long to drive home cause i had to turn around at least 5 times, though only 2 not in cait/emily's neighborhood. i dont know if id call that a successful drive. the first two definitely were though.  -drove home successfully. emily laughed at me. got my journal back.  now im tired and must sleep and have to get up early to leave at 7:10 (!!!!!!!!) to drive to school which starts at 8:10. i keep telling my mom thats crazy and that ill have nothing to do tomorrow morning but sit all alone somewhere and listen to music like a loser. but shes being mean so its that or take the bus. *cringe*  well im out for now. more later. huzzah for the book and kyle."
D0SIWII,female,16,"Im pretty bored and i've never had a little ""sub-journal"" thing before, so what the hell? I'm kinda mad at myself right now cause i was gonna look up something on el internet and i dont remember what it was. i hate it when somethings right on the tip of your brain but you cant think of it....hate that feeling. Anyway, im entertaining myself with this while my brother Alex has his birthday party. Theyre in his room right now. Its pretty dangerous to be outside of my own room...theyre all hyper and boyish and they already shot me with a nerf gun, so im avoiding them until they leave to go see thier stupid movie. Hulk or something. big deal to them. Why do men like movies like that? Some big muscley guy that gets angry and smashes things...i know i sure wish i could turn into one of those. if only I had been hit by gama rays! Oh... but, seriously, the hulk is one superhero i just dont understand. First of all, what kind of superpowers are these: jumping, greeness, bigness, strongness, anger? oooh, thatll keep those criminals at bay. And arent superheros supposed to be all noble and courageous and righteous? sorry, i just dont find anything all that admirable about some guy who gets angry and strong and makes things go smash....ooooh, noble. People like Atticus Finch are 5000 times better heros. Finchy made the list of top 100 heros of the movies too...guess which place he got! #1! cool, eh? Not that he's exactly a SUPERhero...but hes sort of the quintessencial good guy, almost superhuman in his morality or something. i dunno, maybe im just crazy. probably am. ive been told that many many times. So anyway, whats nwe with me? um...i just got back from Tucson AZ on vacation...emily came with me. we had fun. saw some movies, spilled some water, splashed some water, drank some water, (there was lots of water), saw the fires, played some truth or dare, had a fun and exciting day, played some 20 questions...fun stuff. we learned some great lessons from the wise Malfron...good old malfron. i miss him. um, what else? Im almost done with Catcher in the Rye but i havent been taking notes so ill have to reread it. poor holden...so lonely. Thats one of the reasons im so lucky. I dont feel terribly alone and misunderstood like a lot of teenagers. I got some good friends that keep me pretty sane. :-D. I'm really very lucky. I mean, i dont win the lottery and all that crap, but im lucky. I've got a loving family and everyone i love is pretty healthy, and ive got great friends, as previously mentioned, and i go to a great school, and i have a roof over my head and i live in a nice neighborhood and im not facing a lot of pressure at school to do drugs or have sex or any of that, i dunno, lifes good. Even if i do get bored a lot. Im very lucky. i try to be grateful for that. and im not saying all this so i can brag about how much better my life is than yours or anything, cause being so lucky kinda bothers me in a way. Ive never really believed there is such a thing as luck because...everything happens for a reason right? people get what they deserve in the end. God. all that. and if i get all this already, well, i havent been any saint or anything, so why? what do i have to do to be worthy of all this? gotta live a worthwhile life and do something great. thats scares me... i mean, what makes me more deserving of all this...this ""luck"" than some poor, starving kid in india? Why do i get it and he doesnt? I dont think im a better person than he is. So i guess i feel like i gotta do something extrordinary to perhaps make myself more deserving. scary though, scary. makes me hope life is fair. i figure the leats i can do is live my life trying to make it fair...not just for myself either. for those of us who deserve that night on that hill, and everyone else. Um, anyway, that got a little deep, didnt it? well, i only got like 120 spaces left, so i guess ill end this now. Maybe this would've been better as a nitwit. oh well. bye all. never stop thinking. Mood: ""thinking....always."" Music: ""Seven Nation Army"" & ""Hardest Button to Button"" & ""Love of my life"" (damn you emily, you have way too much influence on me)  there you go, theres my sub-journal i wrote earlier today."

Can i have it back? i dunno. i dont think so... Oh well... im working at it.  I decided i  do  know a lot though. Maybe not  everything  but, a hell of a lot compared to other friends. Will start trying to learn more again as opposed to regular conversation this week. perhaps. i dunno. we'll see.  Labelmaker though. hahaha.  im just avoiding euro again...nevermind me."

I want to do one of those crazy hugs though. i seriously do. before schools out... or maybe before school starts next year. whichever turns out to be a more realistic goal. maybe the last day of school this year? like in a celebratory, determined way? like.... ""we made it... and things could be so much worse and theyre not and i love you and we have the whole summer to stay just like this...nice and close."" or...thats bad wording, but you get the jist. and then we will go to the zoo!  and take crazy pictures.  and be cool friends. :-D.  and i need to write a spanish essay... but first...perhaps i shall eat some corn?"

Q09F1DZ,male,24,Coffee count: XX   This is a glance of a place i call home for now
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX   Malaysian Idol has hit Malaysian shores for the past few weeks. It showed the best & the worst that Malaysia has to offer.  Last week's show was a case in point.   The best was there was this guy that was rejected in Penang and he went all the way to Kuching to try again and prove Roslan Aziz, Gee & Paul Moss wrong. And he did managed to go the next round. At first I thought this guy was way over his head. When people from the music industry said you can't sing you should accept it. This guy believed in himself and went all the way to prove them wrong.  A good reality show needs a little drama, so there it was in the form of an over the top female contestant that is waay over her head. God, she can't sing but she refused to accept it. Kept whining that the judge was biased and the selection was done on appearance. Sheesh. My hats of to her still, for being brave enough to do all that in front of national television.  is it just me, or is Paul Moss really gay?"

I never thought that I would like driving games, but the game serves as an escape outlet of things you cant do in real life. I just hope I can get enough sleep after this.  Oooh, I'm excited. I might be going to Vietnam, namely Saigon/HCMC for a trip...   I am full of excitement and worry. I might have a chance to see the person I  urlLink missed  most.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"coffee count: XXX    Life's surprises   It is funny how life can throw surprises at you in the most unusual circumstances.

I was in KL meeting some old friends that came back for Chinese New Year for lunch and did some catching up. After that I had some spare time to kill. I won't tell what really happened, but suffice to say it was one BIG surprise. It has something to do with this  urlLink post . It worked quite well in the end, I think you need to move on and you will see things in another perspective and things are a lot clearer.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX   Hmmm, people might be wondering why I have been silent for the past week. I was in a one week course in KL. It was like an orientation course for people that just joined the  urlLink company . It was a very intense course but I think worth every minute. I learned a lot about  urlLink myself  and in the process how other people work and think. I met a lot of new friends, people from Singapore (egads!!), Hong Kong, China, Australia, Pakistan and even Holland. It was very interesting to see how different these people are, in terms of how they interact and communicate.  It is funny how I only knew these people for five days but I'm already missing them. After 5 intense days, Saturday fell flat. So I think I will be feeling a bit depressed for a while. Thank god for email, at least we will be able to get in touch easily.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"coffee count: XX    censorship part 2   hehe, i knew  urlLink this  would happened. I don't know why the officials go overboard sometimes. I know that it is sometimes a sensitive issue, but we should realise that Malaysians in general would have enough common sense to know that it is just a movie, nothing else. I don't think that people will come out from the movie thinking that if you complain enough to god, you will get god's power for a week.(that is the movie storyline in general). I think Malaysians are mature enough to discuss these issues in public, be it in newspaper, blogs etc. Sheesh, Give Malaysians some credit la...  Personally, I think self censorship is best.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX   I should have known. First I ran over a red light. I was busy in a conversation that I did not realised that the light has gone red.   Then I collided with a boar...  I was driving along the Jabor-Jerangau road from Terengganu to Kuantan. It was about 7.45 pm and I was again involved in an interesting conversation with my 2 passengers. Then I saw a boar crossing the road, one guy shouted ""feeq, babi!!"" trying to warned me. Instead the warning had the opposite effect, instead of swerving the car to the road shoulder, I just drove straight on, albeit at a slower speed.   Needles to say, I hit the boar with a thump but I just drove straight on. After a few hundred feet, I stopped on the road shoulder and inspect the damage done. The front bumper was totaled, the hood was dented and all the lights was smashed. There was no sign of the boar's bodypart anywhere. I guess he might have survived the accident.  We had about another 100 kilometre to go and luckily, we can still continue the journey to Kuantan.  God, now I need to get the car fixed before I can go to KL..."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX  Thou shalt not fear   I am back from my Vietnam  urlLink trip . It was an interesting trip to say the least. First I wanted to talk about how I in the end managed to do something that I should have done 2 years back. The report about the trip and pictures can wait...  Well if you have been paying attention, I have this unfinished business with someone that I was seeing when I was in London. We went out, had fun, shared moments together. We were seeing each other frequently enough but we stopped short of calling it a relationship. It was more of a buddy thing rather than strings attached.  In the course of the friendship I developed  urlLink feelings  for him. I tried to suppressed it, and during the time when I was seeing him in London, things was working out well. He has expressed his policy of meeting people  sans  the emotional baggage and I respected his wish. I don't want to risk to ruin a perfectly good friendship on a feeling that I am not sure of. Is it love or is it lust?  Time came for me to say good bye, and I came back home. We stayed in touch, through emails and in the first few months of coming back through phone as well. People says that time heals the wound, I thought that was the case. I thought that I was  urlLink over  him and I could go on with my life. Although I know that back in my mind he is still in my mind.  He moved to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and as fate might have it, I was going there for a  urlLink trip . It was a company trip and I did not say or suggest that we should go to HCMC. I was having mixed  urlLink feelings  about seeing him again.  We met on the first day I was in HCMC. My heart was beating fast and I don't know what it would be like. We talked, asking how things are, was he happy, am I/is he attached. I know what the answer would be, but I need to hear it again to tell myself that it will never happen. I don't do boyfriends was the reply. I though fine, we can still be friends.  I guess after 2 years not seeing him, I can not anymore, put up the pretense that I am ok with the arrangement. The short meeting just stirred my emotions, my very being. I can only suppressed my feelings for another 2 days. So in the dead of Christmas morning, I sent an SMS to him, telling him my true feelings. I got a reply back from him and I still respect his decision.  As I said, I should have done it 2 years ago before I went back, but I was too much of a coward to tell him how I felt. I guess I still am a coward, having to resort to an SMS to tell him how I felt. At least I have get it off me, and it is a great load of my mind and my heart. I think things will not really change much between the two of us (I hope), the whole thing was always in the background but I did not came out and talked to him about it.  How do I feel now?  I still have the same feelings towards him, but I am now relieved that it all came out in the open. No more pretense, no more denial...  I've found my closure, thou shalt not fear  oh yes,  Merry Christmas & A Happy New Year . This is one Christmas i will not forget."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    on my own part II   I have just realised that I am totally on my own in Kota Bharu. I don't have any immediate family around and friends that I can hang out with on weekends. Actually I have a friend in KB, but basically I am all alone.  I need to get out more and find new friends I guess. The thing is, on first impression I may look like a reserved and sometimes people might mistake me as being arrogant. Its just that, if I don't have anything important to say, I wont speak. I don't really believe in small talk.  My coffee intake for the past week has been under controlled. One because in my new office I don't have a pantry to make coffee and two, Starbucks has not opened yet in KB.  I am now looking for a house to rent in KB. I am planning to live alone. I don't like sharing with strangers."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX   I had a quite satisfying weekend, had some things done. I managed to get the house clean, changed a light, got streamyx up and running on my iBook, joined a gym, had a good workout, bought some cushions and managed to cook dinner.  In the never ending quest of trying to loose weight, I am trying to eat healthily at night. So I decided to eat pasta for dinner. What with all the Nasi Kerabu & Nasi Dagang that I managed to eat everyday. I find it quite easy to prepare a simple and a tasteful pasta dish I might say. The recipe could be described in 3 easy steps  1.	Cook the pasta and drain 2.	Mix Olive oil, crushed garlic, tuna flakes and Prego to the pasta 3.	Then just cook everything together!!  And there you go."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    Coffee tasting session   Oooh, I am officially a coffee junkie. I was at Starbucks this evening, reading the papers when one of the waiters (partners, they call it) asked me if I wanted to join their coffee tasting session. It sounds interesting so I said yes. They must have seen me a million times at the shop alone and they were being  nice I suppose.  They were having the house blend mild for me and another customer to taste. There is an art to drinking coffee, akin like wine tasting (oooh, how socialite).   First, you smell the coffee aroma (close the cup 3/4 and smell it) Second, you slurp your coffee. At Starbucks it is the way to drink coffee. Not sipping your coffee quietly like a prissy. hehe. Why you might ask? Because the coffee is hot, by slurping coffee, you get the liquid spread out in the mouth, hence less of a chance to burn yourself. Third, you taste the coffee. Well Duh. I cant really remember what was the fourth step. I think it was how to drink your coffee with biscotti and or cake.  there was also some discussions on how to brew your coffee and the different types of coffee available at Starbucks.   This coffee tasting session is quite a smart marketing technique. Educating your customers about your product or the product in general will actually build up loyalty to your product. If your customer knew your product very well, its advantages, disadvantage (if you let them know), there is a very good chance that the customer will go for a product that they know intimately rather than a competitors.  Starbucks should hire me as their spoke person."

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX    I'm back   I am now back in the office. I came back from Kuching on Tuesday evening. I spent the whole of Tuesday traveling from Kuching to JB to Kuantan. It was boring and tiring. I was wishing that I had an iPod with me all the time I was on the bus. Pictures won't be out for a while. I was not in the mood to take pictures. The landscape is the same but the friendliness of the people are amazing.   Me and my family wanted to go out for lunch and we did not know where to go. So my mum asked this group of girls where the makan place was. They went all the way showing the way to a food court in the rain! Then my mum encountered the same thing when she and dad was trying to find the way to the market. People are really friendly there.   I did a lot of shopping, mostly Pua Kumbu (did I spelled that right?). If you don't know what it is, it is those long weaved fabric that people usually hang on the wall. I really don't know what it is actually used for, just jump on the bandwagon.  Oh yes, I have found a place to live in Kota Bharu. It is a nice cosy(small) flat, just perfect to live on my own. Hehe I have it all planned out, what furniture to put, what kind of theme I will follow to decorate the place and all. I am thinking of getting a before and after picture of the place. Hmmm, can't wait."

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    the root of the problem   I had lunch with a  urlLink friend  at Secret recipe, The Mall yesterday. We were catching up on things as we rarely have the chance nowadays to meet up regularly. The flow of conversation started from our personal lives and then we bitch about inconsiderate neighbours and from then on about the level of civic consciousness of the Malaysian public.  One thing that really annoys me is how we behave on the road. I have ranted about this before and it bears to be mentioned again. Why do we have to jump the queue, why overtake on the left lane, why road hog, why tail gate and so many more why's that I could ask. It is exactly this type of behaviour that parents showed to their children that teaches them that it is ok to be inconsiderate and flout the law. If the parents can do it on the road surely the children can do it at school as well.  I believe that all this inconsiderate behaviour and no regards for the law that adults shows to the younger generation that has now landed Malaysia in the malaise that she is in now. All of us have read or heard on the news of some extreme punishments that we should put on criminals as a lesson to others. Call me a snob, but I think that is not the way that will end the problem. We are merely treating the symptoms.  So what is the root of the problem? I think we should instil first in ourselves the simple sense of what is right and what is wrong. Being civic and respecting other people. Get that right first and if that does not work, I guess public flogging is the only answer...  p.s: to my  urlLink friend  happy birthday"
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXXXX    exams & the park   I had a test today, it was about product knowledge. I did study for it, but I did not expect that the questions would be very in depth and technical. The test was more geared toward technical engineer rather than marketing people.  Good thing that I only left university about 2 years ago, so the last minute cramming still works.  I don't think I did exceptionally well, but it would be ok (I hope). The thing that pisses me off is the very topic that I skipped, thinking that it is not relevant to my job description came out in the test!! I only had a brief look through the topic. How I wish I have photographic memory. I guess I will have to wait for the result and see...  I went jogging after work (actually after the simpsons), I have decided to jog in the park rather than jog on a treadmill. The fact that my gym membership expires this month helps as well.  I had a trial run and it was ok, I think I can go a few laps next time (I only did one lap today, hence the trial run).  Now I need to find some sort of a motivation to get me jogging regularly. I swim regularly but I think I need to vary my regime so I can burn off all these fats faster.... hehe."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: X   I think I lead a pretty boring life but a complicated one on some levels. If I were to choose one film that nearly resembles my life, it would be Lost in Translation. If my life were to be made in to a film, I wonder who would play me?"
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX    Grande cuppa to go   Yes, finally  urlLink starbucks  has opened in Kuantan. I went there 4 times in two days just to satisfy my caffeine fix that can only trully be satisfied by Starbucks. I don't know why, but I am a sucker for Starbucks.   Which leads to another topic, branding & image. We are all bombarded by brands everyday in our lives it is just that we are so used to it that we treat it as background ""noise"". What really sets some brands apart from others are how the brand manage to convert people to it or to ensure that people stays loyal to that particular brand. As a real life example, I don't like  urlLink Nike  and every sports wear that I bought in recent history was  urlLink Adidas . Why? Because I see that Nike is too street wear and not sports wear anymore. That is in my perception anyway.  I have bought a replacement handphone recently, a  urlLink Sony Ericsson   urlLink T630 . My previous handphone was a  urlLink Nokia   urlLink 8310 . Why the change? I was looking for a new phone with camera but without the bulk. Most of Nokias camera phone are either too bulky or the  urlLink ones  that are not that bulky are a year old already. It seems Nokia has lost a customer. I have been using Nokia for such a long time and they have made their phones either too  urlLink trendy  or too  urlLink conservative . Now I have to learn the UI all over again.  So, do you have any favorite/love to hate brands?"

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX   I think I have kind of figured out the type of music that I prefer. I dont like to confine my music to one genre but you would have a type of music that you would feel most comfortable with. My recent CD spree consisted of Joni Mitchell's  urlLink Song to a seagull  (I wanted to know what is so great about her), Eric Clapton's  urlLink The Clapton chronicles  (If you want to know Eric Clapton for the first time, a greatest hit album is a safe bet) and Tracy Chapman's  urlLink Collection  (ditto, actually I bought her Let it rain album before this)."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXXX   I have this running shoe that I bought in my second year in university in 2000 when the one that I brought all the way from Malaysia had finally succumbed to the torture of Uni life. I joined the university gym that time trying to stay in shape. In retrospect i was pretty much ini shape back then. Not much money to eat and had to walk at least a mile from tube station to lecture.  Back to the shoe, it is a Nike with the USA olypmic team (1996 i think) design. One with an emblem with USA in the middle and wings at the side.  That was the best value for money shoe that i got from the Nike store that time. It has been 5 years since I bought the shoe, and it still serves me well.   I wore it to lectures, clubs, paint balling (i can still remember my feet in the mud somewhere in the cold forest at the fringe of london), mardi gras, one night stands and so much more. It was a witness to a lot of things that I did and did not do back then.  Because I have been active lately at the gym and have been running vigourously, the soles have shown signs of falling apart. I think i need to buy a new one before i embarassed my self with a shoe that fell apart while jogging on the treadmill.  So long shoe, you have served me well.   Muahaha. Now I can go shop for that Adidas shoe"
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: -    Running   I wonder why I never did this before, jogging on a Sunday morning. I woke up at about 8 and after rolling on the bed for about half an hour, I decided to jog at a nearby park. I don't know why but I was a bit hyper active since yesterday, I had to work yesterday because I need to clear up all my work before I move to Kota Bharu. After a long drive (I had to visit a site 100km away) I went for a swim. Have not swim for quite a while (where did the usual counter lady went to?) and did a few decent laps. I was still charged up and thought of going for a jog, but it was already 8pm. I don't want to get raped jogging alone at the park hehe.  And here I am sweating, writing this blog.  Hmmm, in my previous  urlLink post  I said change is a good thing, and now it is near. I am going to KB this Tuesday with my boss and after that I will be based in KB. The best thing is I am not officially transferred yet, so I will be staying in a  urlLink hotel  for maybe about a month before I get my transfer letter.  Anyhoo, I need to start packing."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXXXXX    Nap & Drive   I had a whole load of coffee today. I was traveling for the whole week, so I need the coffee to keep me awake while I am driving. I find that I need to take a nap when I'm on the road, usually after lunch. Hehe. I will stop in a safe place (rest area, mosque), set the alarm on my mobile(30 to 45 minutes), set it to silent, turn down the air con a bit, recline my seat and have a nap. It is always better to stop and have a nap rather than being drowsy while driving. After that, I feel refreshed and ready to take on the road again. It struck me while I'm writing this, that  should be how we need to tackle life. You need to stop for a while, gather your strength and continue.   On a similar vein, I almost had an accident today, I was driving happily, the road was straight and wide, the  sun was shining, I was the only one on the road and everything was good. Then suddenly this motorcycle decided to turn right and in the process right on a collision course!!! I honked him a few times, and I think he was kinda paralysed and did not try anything to get out of the way. I stepped on the brake half way (the car doesn't have ABS, if I stepped all the way, the wheels would lock up and I would loose control of the car). I swerved to the right and managed to avoid hitting the guy. Unfortunately, I think I hit his handle with my left side mirror and it was broken. I stopped at the side of the road, put on the hazard light and waited for the guy to come over. Which he did. Then I asked him if he is ok, he said he was and he said that his brake was not functioning. We just shook hands and went our own way. I did not want to make such a big fuss out of it as I think both of us were responsible for it and I was pressed for time. Thank god that nobody got hurt.  I'm meeting up with some old friends tomorrow, time to get the camera out."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX    Saigon, Monet & Van Gogh   it has been quite a while since I blogged. Anyhoo, this is about my  urlLink Vietnam  trip, or precisely about the things that I bought in Vietnam. I had a fascination for Monet & Van Gogh works when I was doing A-Level. My general paper teacher asked us to do an essay on an artist and I picked Monet. That was the time my interest in Monet & Van Gogh started. Back to my trip, Saigon was full of  urlLink galleries , they are not the snobbish type though, the galleries are like roadside stalls and I suspect their presence is for the  tourist market. I was soo happy to see the galleries, one was even conveniently located besides the hotel I was staying. That was the first place I checked and my favorite paintings were there! It is Starry night by Van Gogh and Waterlilies by Monet. I bought the two, I think I got a fair price. I don't think you will get such price for the reproductions. They were quite cheap that I am now in the dilemma when trying to get it framed. The frames cost more than the paintings itself!! I will get it framed and hang it in my room and one in the living room. hmmm nice"

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: X  of men,elves, hobbits and harems   Hehe, I have watched the end of the Lord of The Rings trilogy. I think it was a a good film to end the trilogy. I'm not sure what was the complain about. For me it was the most touching film of the three. It was about friendship, courage, love and a whole lot more. It will never replace the book, but it is a great complement to it. The movie gives a clear face and place for the people and location in the book. The one thing that was hovering in the background in the movie was the theme of intimate male bonding experience (read:  urlLink homoeroticism ) was it just me or was it Peter Jackson :p.  I have also bought 3 CDs today  1.  urlLink Sarah Brightman : Harem 2.  urlLink Alicia Keys : Diary of Alicia Keys 3.  urlLink Michael Buble : Michael Buble                     pictures courtesy of  urlLink amazon       I am listening to the CDs while I'm writing this blog. Harem is the first Sarah Brightman CD that I bought. I have read about it somewhere and I think the review was quite favorable. I am now in the phase of trying to expand my musical horizon. I want to hear music of all kinds, not just the radio friendly tunes that is dished out to us daily.  Alicia Keys is an exception, I'm not sure if the songs from this album is radio material, but it is quite good nonetheless. Michael Buble sings old classics (Sway, kissing a fool) something like  urlLink Robbie Williams   urlLink swing when you're winning  album. Nice as well, good for chilling out.   That is all for now.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    friends   I had a long break, 4 days to be exact. I did not planned anything for the break and luckily some old friends from high school decided to spend a few days in Kuantan. I got a call very early on Thursday morning (8 am), I was still groggy and I did not recognised the number. The person said he was a supplier by the name of Hassan. I never knew a supplier called Hassan but decided to meet him anyway as he offered to buy me breakfast (hehe). I drove to Teluk Cempedak and to my surprise it was my friends from high  urlLink school .  kena tipu je . They drove down from KL at 4 in the morning and arrived about 7 in Kuantan, just in time for breakfast. We went out for Bowling and then had a swim in the South China Sea in the late afternoon. Then we had a sumptuous dinner followed by snooker. We planned to watch a movie but the seats available were too near to the screen.  What struck me most during this reunion of some sort is how they all have changed. All of them have started work and hold responsibilities. A very different person that I knew in school, carefree and borderline juvenile(kind off). I am glad and proud that they turned out great. One is doing his masters and will be joining the family business, then one is working with  urlLink MINT  (Malaysian Institute of Nuclear Technology, the other is working with a company that produces pipeline in the oil and gas industry and another is a pilot in training with  urlLink SIA .  I went jogging on Friday, since the gym and the pool was closed that was the only option for me to sweat it out. I am now paying for it, my legs still ached from the run. I have not jogged for quite a while, so the run must have shocked my body thus the aching legs. I think I need to jog more.   Have you seen  urlLink body challenge ?

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    It is the most tiring week I had so far. I was traveling since last Thursday, which makes it effectively one week on the road. I am used to it already, the long hours driving, the cold lonely hotel room, chat rooms that promised a lot, but never did manage to deliver. hehe.   I was handing over the area that I cover previously to my successor. On the boss direction, we had to cover the most of Pahang (Bentong to Kuala Lipis to Jerantut to Temerloh to Jengka to Kuantan) in two days!! It was not really a direct order but he insinuated the intent anyway.   For the two days, it was a 12 hour road trip visiting dealers. As I said earlier I'm a bit pedantic with figures, so I kind of rushed things to make sure we make it on time. I turned down most makan invitations just to get to the next destination on time. It goes against my better judgment that I should actually make time for my dealers to get to know me and my successor better. What was on my mind was to get them introduced first and figure out each other later.   I am not really a social person, so watching my successor handling my ex-dealers gave me some pointer on how to handle my new ones. My successor has been doing the job for over a decade.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    falling in love   If you are to fall in love, what kind of person would that person be? Romantic, blunt honest, a jerk or the shy quiet type?

Do we look for people that complements us, people that we aspire to be or just a friendly face?  I have never got a chance to really be in a proper relationship before, the one that I had was more of a physical intimacy rather than emotional. Now that the chance presents itself, I am moving away. Is this a sign that I will be forever lonely?  this post was brought to you after a  urlLink sex & the city  marathon."

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"coffee count: XXX    a very special libran   syafeeq alias doesn't know the meaning of the word 'enough.' It's not that syafeeq is greedy or that he lacks self-discipline - far from it. syafeeq goes out of his way to share, care and be fair. That's why he never quite knows when to stop. To draw the line you have to be a little insensitive. How, precisely, should it be measured? With a magnifying glass? Or with a microscope? syafeeq alias is extremely sensitive and keenly perceptive. He is a Libran, born under the sign of the scale. syafeeq knows in his heart that no matter how meticulously you ever weigh anything in this world you can always reach a different conclusion if you apply a more refined set of measurements. syafeeq knows that those refinements are infinite. Hours have minutes, minutes have seconds. Seconds have nanoseconds. No wonder syafeeq alias is never sure what time it is!  Some people are prone to assume that syafeeq has his head in the clouds. They think that he lives in a world of his own full of lofty ideas and complex theories. Other people have the temerity to watch syafeeq at work in this way and to suppose that syafeeq is indecisive! Where on earth do they get that idea from? Actually syafeeq is one of the most decisive people on the face of the planet. he absolutely, definitely knows what he wants but he only knows it from one second to the next. To the untrained eye this appears to be an inconsistency. What they fail to see are the countless nanoseconds during which syafeeq's sense of purpose is solid as a rock. syafeeq, though, knows what people are thinking and so, to keep them on their toes he makes a point of declaring his intentions loudly and clearly. he makes quite sure that these brave statements never differ from day to day.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX   I bought the book last year, in June I think. I thought I should get back on my reading since I have been neglecting my readings for quite a while. I used to pride myself with the amount of books/novels that I read. The environment also plays a part. When you are on the  urlLink tube  for a good hour, a book is always a good companion. Mostly everybody reads on the tube.   So I resolved to at least read a chapter before I go to bed every night and try to read as much during long boring weekends.  Here comes the good part. My mother found the book on the coffee table after breakfast and went on saying that a book titled ""Little Women"" is not meant to be read by a man, reminding me that my lecturer uncle also gave the same comment a few years back.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXX   I have this thing about numbers that borders to obsessive compulsive(OC). If I jog on the treadmill, the speed must be rounded or to the half kilometer/hour mark.

And the total distance must be exact as well. 4 or 5 kilometer. 4.3 or 5.1 kilometer is a big sin. Of course sometimes I do bend the rules and that is why I said it was bordering on OC.

I joined the meeting at 1.30. Then I had to catch up on work that has been piling up at Kuantan when I was in KB. I am kind off double hatting at the moment, they have not found a replacement for me yet in Kuantan. So the work is divided between me and my boss.  Oh yes, I have bought a new toy as well. It is a  urlLink Bluetooth   urlLink headset  for my  urlLink phone . Now I don't have all those pesky handsfree wires in my way. It is truly handsfree.  Now to get the iPod mini"
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"woohoo!!!  At last i managed to get a comment system running on my blog, at least i think so. I managed to do it in the first try!!!

I put in a comment about a blog by barns ( urlLink  http://barns.blog-city.com ) and he  urlLink mentioned  my comment on his web site!! i was pleasantly suprised. He said that he can't put a comment on my blog, and that is how it all began. Anyway i guess i need to put a comment system running so people can give their own thoughts on things that i wrote.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XX    Birthday party et al.   Yes I did celebrate the anniversary of my blog yesterday. Any reason to throw a party, hehe. The party was actually just calling up friends ( urlLink adren  &  urlLink faxx  among others) and we had a fruit  urlLink flan  as the birthday  urlLink cake . We then went for a game of bowling. It has been ages since we played, and surprisingly, everybody played quite well.            Earlier in the day, We went to Ikea because I wanted to find an  urlLink easel  for a  urlLink painting  that I bought in Vietnam before. The plan is to stretch the painting on a stencil and put it on the easel, to my disappointment, the easel was sold out. I suspected that most of the new restaurants at the newly opened Ikano Power Centre had bought the easels to display their menu. I got boomerang hangers instead...  I am in the process in getting a piece of real estate in KL.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: X   I don't play tennis, but every year I will not miss watching  urlLink Wimbledon . It all started when I was in London and my room mate got me hooked on Wimbledon. his enthusiasm for the match rubbed off on me. I guess the nostalgic feeling for all things London is still around.   The thing about Wimbledon is the will to win shown by the players. You see giants  urlLink fall , The  urlLink comeback  of olds, new bloods taking over and the gracious  urlLink exit  of a winner. It is all about the drive to win and to overcome the odds. Something that I severely lacked."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"my mom bought me a thong for the first time on tuesday.  it was hilarious.  as we walk through victoria secret, my mom keeps gravitating towards the flannel pajamas, i keep pulling the slutty lacy get-ups off the rack and holding them up saying ""oh no no mom, boy's don't want to see me in flannel.  boys want to see me in this.""  she asked if by boys i meant parker.  after some scent smelling and robe discussion, we make it to one of the many thong tables in v.s..  now this table displayed the more 'respectable' thongs.  as we are combing through the color and size selections, i spot another thong table across the store.  ahhhhhhh, the t-backs.  the skimpiest of skimpy panties.  as i begin to select which 4 for $28 i want, my mom keeps suggesting the more benign, traditional colors.  somehow this would make her feel better about her scandalous purchase.  i'm a big fan of panty flare, so naturally i pick the hot pinks and bright blues.    the funniest shit of the entire purchase is that my mom is going to give the thongs to me for christmas.  she is going to wrap them up and put a tag on the present that reads 'from santa'.  then i have to open the present in front of my brother and ernie, my mom's 'friend'."

I know what your thinking, this girl has it all.  So, this weekend was yet another piece of evidence of all the jack asses out there looking for nothing more than a piece of ass.  I just don't get these dudes.  What a shallow, meaningless life to live.  To each their own, just leave me the fuck alone.  It was fun, and anything but restful.

'what time do you get off work?'  i hate it.  i absolutely hate it.  but i guess i just need to quit my bitchin' and suck it up.  cause time ain't going away.  at this time, i have to go.  it's almost time to get off work."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"hey julia.  sorry for my absence.  it has been a CRAZY last couple of weeks.  first, there was the beach.  the day after i got back, there was work.  in addition, the day after i got back, there was moving.  after several evenings of moving, there was some social time with special people (not that kind, that kind).  now, there is a week in denver for work.  where i am currently.  soaking in every minute of this beautiful, perfect, peaceful weather and more development in the boss relationship arena.  let me just tell you that life is really good right now.  i'm feeling positive and strong and happy and where i want and need to be.    the new apartment ROCKS, and you are all invited to stop in.  i've gotten from visitors that it feels like a 'bistro', 'cafe', and 'coffee house'.  all of which i was going for, so i think mission accomplished.  sylvia and i have a rockin' patio, where we sat this past weekend for literally hours on end as multiple friends stopped by to do their part in the patio sitting.    my birthday is coming up on friday, and i've made sure to tell every person i've come in contact with about it including, but not limited to the starbuck's cashier, our waiter at yia yia's, the front desk lady at amerisuites, and well you get the point.  lots of birthday plans in store.  friday, the day of, i will fly in from denver early and treat myself to a pedicure.  that night the old school crew (amy, carey, joy boys) will be meeting at jazz on sixth for some birthday dinner and cocktails.  saturday is eeyore's birthday party, where i will play bongos and twirl in a skirt.  saturday  night, dinner with the pops at the hilton.  my dad recently completed building this hotel from ground up in downtown austin, and they have an amazing restaurant in it that i have not tried and have been dying to.   i am so proud of him, and i know he is proud of himself, so this will be a real treat to get to admire his work together.  then, the best of all.  sunday, my mom is having a barbecue.  the best of the best will be joining me for some amazing potato salad (sorry b), ribs, whathaveyou.  hopefully my friend ricky's band will be providing us with some tunes (check out his music at permakids.com).  and there will be beer flowing from a keg.  i am so looking forward to this.  talk with ya'll when i get back.  and btw, denver weather makes my hair wonderfully straight and perfect and how i am always striving to get it back in austin.  reason number one to move here if there is ever a calling.  note to kristen:  i respect how you feel about me.  i disagree with forming such an opinion about someone based on a silly blog where my true identity and who i am at the core is not revealed.  but again, i respect your right to do that.  the thing is kristen, you might not of picked up on this, but EVERY SINGLE PERSON who comments on my blog is a FRIEND of mine.  we know one another.  maybe not directly, but through a close friend we've established a connection.  i feel comfortable revealing and joking about things that happen in my day to day life.  yes, i smoke pot.  yes, occasionally i indulge in other extracurricular activities.  yes, i enjoy drinking socially.  yes, i love to party.  but this does not make up WHO I AM.  i won't go into who i am here, because i feel confident that the readers who mean a flip to me already know.  i am not sure why i even feel compelled to humor you with a response to your outrageous assumptions.  but again, it's my blog.  i invite you to continue reading my blog (which is bizarre that you would want to not only read, but check back several times throughout your day, considering your dislike for me).  all i ask kristen, is that you keep your ugly comments to yourself.  like lauri or jen or whomever said it, this is a happy place.  kristen, please respect my happy place."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"please don't hold this against me, but i just got back from red lobster, or the slobster as amy calls it.  we went so that carey could give me my birthday present.  my present was a homemade card that her students made (carey is a blonde-haired-blue-eyed-english-as-a-second-language-elementary-school-teacher).  a few things about carey:  carey used to be a cheerleader in high school.  she still does routines like two bits four bits six bits a dollar when we are out partying.  carey gets drunk and takes her shoes off and runs thru bars.  carey called me after leaving my house saturday night to tell me that she got home and was hungry, so she decided to make a pizza.  she woke up in the morning with the entire pizza face down on the kitchen floor and her shoes in the bathtub with tomato sauce spread all over her shower.  carey is very open with her body and her bodily functions.  carey always smells good.  carey also happens to be the 'whole package'.  she is quite a catch, if you can catch her.  she is beautiful, and smart, and educated, and true, and genuine, and funny, and really really cares about people.  she can see the beauty in anything and anyone.  if you can't tell, i think the world of her.    okay, i have to talk about this.  i apologize for the change in pace here.  but i'm kind of in a weird place tonight.  i got a call from my mom that a good friend of my brothers, and a friend of our family, died of a drug overdose last night.    it is a demon robert has battled for years.  it is a demon my family has always battled.  it is a demon i am very familiar with, first hand.  addictions are scary.  all addictions.  but especially those that put you in the darkest place you can possibly be.  i know the battle can be won.  i just wish robert would of come out the other side.  robert, you are a beautiful person.  i hate that you lost the battle.  i know how hard you fought.  we all hurt."

5QXUY9G,female,25,"I love keeping busy.   There is no pace too fast.   I'm a high energy girl.   I like constant stimulation (shut up Brian).    This is not necessarily a bad thing, because of all the unique experiences I get be a part of.  But it is not always a good thing either.  When there is no down time, no time to reflect, no time to sit quietly with only my thoughts, I lose touch.  I lose touch with what I want, what I don't want, what my plan is, what my plan isn't.  I think I lose a little bit of my control.  My grip on reality.  Although this past week and weekend will go down in the hall-of-fame, I recognize that I need to slow down, if only for a short while.  Put the breaks on, if you will.    I don't want to go in to too much detail about my recent experiences and hook ups, because my writing has been lacking as of late and I can't give any of it justice with my words.  And a lot of it is a personal journey and private.  But trust me on this one, the only word to describe this week is: SCORE.  Big time.    What I would like to say about all this might sound a little shallow, or conceited, or whatever.  But obviously from the archives of this blog, you can deduce that how I'm perceived has never been a major concern of mine.  But I would like to talk about the beauty and gift of being a female.  Most of what I got to be a part of this weekend was solely based on the power of this tool.  You can hate on it, you can deny it, you can pass judgment.  I, for one, am going to use it.

Fuck what your mother, father, sister, brother, ex husband, ex boyfriend, or whomever did to you.  Where you've been was their fault.  Where you are is yours.

5QXUY9G,female,25,"Kids, I have made two November (pre-new year) resolutions.  Here, I will make my small blog audience aware of my resolutions, in case you see me pigging out on a 4 course meal or wishing I had that new Porshe, you can remind me of blog entry dated November 5th, 2003.  As Ellen DeGeneres would say, I'm bringing resolutions back to daytime.  Resolution #1 I have began an eating regimen that involves eating 6 small meals a day (every 2 hours or so).  With this eating schedule, I will still maintain a menu excluding starch and sugar that I have lived on and off of for the last three years.  Yes, I realize I am late on this bandwagon, and that fitness gurus have been advising the general public that this is the way to go for years now.  But there you have it.  I am going to go against my genetic odds and fix my fucking metabolism once and for all!  Now, hopefully this is not just ""post-vacation I ate like a fucking starving pig depression.""  Historically, I have been able to really discipline myself into making the right food choices...and I certainly hope that this time history will repeat itself.  Resolution #2 I am going to stop wanting what I don't have.  I sincerely feel that I have had an extremely blessed life, both with material possessions, family and friends.  But despite this recognition and genuine appreciation, I constantly desire more.  I am going to strive for satisfaction with what has been bestowed upon me.  I want to concentrate on not frivolously spending money and appreciating my family and friends, despite what they may lack or what they have done in the past.

(i thought about this the other night, but i think i have more clarity when i'm high.  should of wrote about it then.  now i just sound like a 'tard.)  and speaking of food, i am so sick of the low carb, atkins, net carb bullshit.  i know most of my readers, and i know ya'll have already thought this thought a million times.  but since i'm on a bitching roll today, let me press on.  if you want to eat healthy people, i promise you it is NOT found in this processed crap.  eat natural, eat fresh, eat stuff that grows from the ground, and more than anything...eat VARIETY.  i promise, i lost 50 pounds with this mentality (and guess what, i've kept it off, unlike my atkin's friends who can only keep the weight off when on the 'diet').  of fuckit.  i am going to be at a wedding, in the bahamas in (hold on, let me refer to jessie's counter) 38 days, 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 54 seconds.  and i will be there with some of the dopest people in the entire world.  p.s.  sylvia, i will try to be naked less often in the apartment.  i will try not to stumble into your room naked on sunday mornings to see if you want to go to breakfast.  i will try not to get up  and go to the kitchen naked to get a drink or see if there is a boy in your room.  i am only human, but i will try."

5QXUY9G,female,25,"in light of jessie's fuck all the motherfuckers post, this might not have the same emotional impact.  i have a date on sunday with a guy i showed an apartment to a few weeks ago.  he is a little strange, okay he is really strange, but i'm looking forward to it.  strange people amuse me.  when he called me to set up the date, he said something about having a frisbee, needing to pick up some meat, and me distracting a random dog owner at the park while he steals their dog.  sylvia's induction into the club went off without a hitch.  i was able to recreate my 21st by scoring a free shot for myself at almost each bar we visited.  after sixth street, we got naked and went fishing with a net in a creek off red bud trail.  sylvia then said 'enough is enough with you sleeping in the hammock amber'.  rather than waking me up like usual, she left me there to sleep out the morning.  i migrated to the bed later that morning, and woke up sleeping in the wrong direction.  i am now going to measure my nights by where and how i wake up.  if i wake up 1. in a hammock or 2. sleeping the wrong direction in my bed or 3. in someone else's bed or 4. with someone else sleeping in my bed, this will be the sign of a successful night.  i'm off to the dentist to get my teefers cleaned.  do you think if i request it they'll give me gas for a regular cleaning?  i could really use the gas right about now.  OH YEAH, AND FUCK ALL THE MOTHERFUCKERS!"
5QXUY9G,female,25,"thank goodness for the internet.    i forgot to keep my promise to you and capture on film (or digital camera memory card) the horrendous gifts from the dad's girlfriend before returning them this afternoon (which, by the way, you can only get in store credit with a gift receipt...oh well, i'm sure eventually talbots is bound to have something i want).  first, i went to foley's to return  urlLink the shoes .  i was so embarrassed to be in possession of the shoes in the first place, i approached the cashier with ""so, apparently, my dad's girlfriend thinks i'm a hooker.""  she just laughed, and so did the old lady next to me purchasing her easy spirits.  then, on to teacher's heaven, talbots, to return  urlLink the dress .  she smokes crack.  a lot of it i suspect."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"Radio stations are on my shit list.  I hate them.  Not only do we have to suffer through the same playlists over and over again, but they torture us with annoying d.j.'s (especially on the hip hop stations) and horrible commercials.  But the worst thing about radio stations, the thing that I find completely irritating, is when they play brief bits from some of their more frequently played hits just to give you a snapshot of what their station is about - followed by some annoying commentary.  The songs they choose are usually catchy, and despite my distaste for radio programming, the catchy beats usually catch my attention, only to disappoint me with a five second tease.  It's bullshit."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"deep thoughts   by: amber ferris   it's amazing all the unexplainable bruises caused by a night of drinking  the more people at a gas station, the slower your gas pumps  i don't find it strange that when i cuddle with parker, he wraps his arms around me, or that i call them arms  one should not find it flattering that a guy would stalk her or slip her GHB  wine was not meant to be served out of a box, ever  crawling in to a bed that's been made and has clean sheets is perhaps the best feeling ever  people order flaming dr. peppers because they like to see flames come out of people's mouths,  they taste like poop  every artist does not need to have a christmas album.  seriously."

5QXUY9G,female,25,"so, due to the pot brownie consumption and the pouring rain, halloween ended up being a pretty subdued event.  after inhaling some jack in the crack, and catching a fantastic re-run of oprah, i think we were in bed by 1 am.  nice.  today is an amazingly perfect day in los angeles.  brian is fixing to suck it up, quit bitchin' about his headache (apparently motherloads doesn't believe in putting mixers in their cocktails), and take us to an outdoor museum.  yipppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  smile, no complaints.  life is good."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"It all feels so premature.  We made the funeral arrangements today.    We selected the flower spread, red roses.  We chose the verse to be printed on the prayer cards that are to be handed out to funeral attendees, the 23rd Psalm.  We picked the casket, pecan wood.    There will be no obituary printed, however.  She insisted.  She didn't want everyone in San Antonio reading about her, ""It is none of their damn business if I die.""    So Grandma, no obituary.  I agree with you, it's kind of silly, and if I didn't like attention so much, I'd probably request the same for when I go.  Grandma, this is not an obituary, but more of a tribute.  A tribute to a survivor.  Las Vegas is not the only place with bad odds.  We shuffle the deck of life, and sometimes we get a lousy hand.  But unlike Vegas, we don't get the choice of folding and walking back to our hotel room.  We're forced to play our cards just as they've been dealt to us.  Not a single moment of rest.  Not one bit of slack.  Every day was a struggle.  Every year was a battle.  But a peaceful passing.  And now a restful sleep.  I love you Barbara Jean Ferris.  Thank you for the name and all it represents."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"i am up at this ungodly hour, despite the fact that i have to work at 9 am.  ugh!  something strange is in the air.  i'm in a funk.  i don't feel exactly right about my mood.  usually, i'm pretty good at putting my finger on why i feel the way i feel.  perhaps it's that i started my fucking period two weeks early, perhaps i ate too much cheese and reeses peanut butter cups today.  whatever it is, i take solace in knowing it will pass and soon enough my stomach won't feel like it is contracted and out of position.  as quickly as this feeling has come, it will pass."

5QXUY9G,female,25,"i don't know why i always feel weird putting the plastic separator down on the conveyer belt to divide my groceries from the others in line?  this weekend was fun and felt like a lifetime.  it's strange how some weekends can feel so long.    friday night i had a really enjoyable date.  when i answered the door i was greeted with a beautiful arrangement of flowers.  i've never gotten flowers on a first date.  parker's been given bones.  i've been given drugs.  but never flowers.  it was a nice treat.  we had dinner at this really great italian joint on barton springs.  vinny's is by far one of the best italian places i've tried in austin.  the food is authentic, the prices are unreasonably decent (i had talapia and i think it was in the ballpark of $9), the waitstaff is friendly and very 'austin', and the salad dressing is so good i asked the waiter if he could cancel my order and just bring me a bowl of dressing (to which he responded ""would you like that served warm""...""however most people have it, i suppose"").  but the best thing about this place is that despite how long it has been around, it has not been discovered (i.e. no wait on a friday night).  after dinner, we headed over to flipnotics.  my friend chris had invited us to see a friend of his band, deadman.  what great entertainment.  for you austinites, i believe they will be playing at antones july 5th.  definitely worth checking out.  we stopped by 6th street to have a few drinks with a group of my friends, just before the storm hit.  it rained.  it rained and rained and rained.  we decided we wanted to get wet (brian, that one's too easy).  so we left the bar to take a stroll in the storm most sixth streeters were seeking shelter from.  there is something really carefree about walking in the rain without an umbrella, without trying to salvage your hairdo, without worrying about your mascara running...with the sole purpose of getting drenched.  since we were soaking wet, we decided to continue the wet theme and headed to the jacuzzi at a spa store he manages.  nevertheless, we had fun, we enjoyed one another, and we behaved fairly decently (this was determined based on a comparative scale).  he called me the next morning to assure me that i behaved very appropriately (something i always have to check on the 'day after') and that it was the best date he's been on in quite some time.  with only a few hours of sleep, sylvia and i got up early to head to my mom's for a trail ride with james.  it was quite an adventure with some minor snags on the way.  parker, being the daredevil that he is (actually he's just not always the brightest bulb, but we'll go with adventurous here), kept a dangerously close distance from the horses.  it didn't take long for him to get completely trampled by helen.  in all the three years i've had him, i've NEVER heard him cry like that.  it was very scary, but aside from shock, he came out of the experience unharmed and a safe twenty feet distance from us.  aside from this and my stirrups being too long, the ride was perfect.  after all the trauma, james made us some cocktails to unwind.  it was downhill from there.  anytime you start drinking at 1:30 in the afternoon, nothing good can come of this.  after a few toddies at james', we had some lunchy lunch at guerro's (we were in s. austin, we had to hit it up) and then headed home to meet scotty at club porch to hang our two new chair hammocks.  then, a celebratory evening with the open door policy, as usual.  we had a revolving door of mixed company.  they came in shifts that kept the apartment lively and filled with laughter.  it was one of those nights where the conversation is not simple.  it was ponderous, and deep, and inquisitive, and educational.  another great evening.  the sun rose and then we slept.  aside from all the great goings on of saturday evening, i received the most delightful phone call.  a dear friend of mine from high school, whom i've remained in contact with, but very infrequently, called just to tell me how much my friendship meant to him.  the funny thing is, he has no idea how much his friendship means to me.  robert was my first 'crush' at bowie high school.  i adored him.  our relationship never went to that level, but we were close friends.  but, one thing about our friendship stands out in my mind and heart to this day.  as you all know from previous posts, i was overweight thru most of highschool.  a very traumatic time for a female to be overweight.  robert loved me regardless.  furthermore, he asked me to prom.  not out of pitty, but because he sincerely wanted to go to the prom with me.  robert was very good-looking, very popular, and could of had the pick of the litter.  he chose me.  i can recall to this day some of the shallow dumbfucks of bowie highschool making comments and gossip about the fact that he was going with me.  my love and respect for him is even deeper for that reason, regardless if we talk every day or once a year.  robert is a beautiful human.  sunday served it's purpose.  the most movement in 1512 was when i got off my ass to take a shower.  even the dogs did not have the energy to do anything more than nap.  tonight we had dinner in celebration of nicole's sixth anniversary of her 29th birthday.  and since i dropped the ball on her actual birthday...    HAPPY BIRTHDAY NICOLE!!!!  I LOVE YOU!!!  YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN PINK!!!"

5QXUY9G,female,25,"it's weird.  in relationships (romantic & friendship), i tend to be a bit possessive and have somewhat of a jealous streak (it's the taurus in me).  although it seems to be true in all my relationships, it becomes undeniably apparent in my boyfriend/girlfriend type relationships.  however, for the last year - on and off - i have been involved with a young man that all my typical rules of attraction seem non-existent.    we see each other when our schedules are compatible.  no strings attached.  i am somewhat busy, he is very busy.  it usually works out that we will talk every other week or so, and see one another once a month or so.  in the down time, i don't get those typical feelings of 'why hasn't he called'?  it's not that the attraction is not there, but somehow i can embrace him when he is present, but completely disown my feelings for him when he is not.  he has a great soul.  he is a thoughtful lover.  he is interesting, unique, talented, sweet & respectful.  he is also very young & immature.  i don't see a future with him, and from the looks of the progression of our relationship thus far, i don't believe he sees one either.  we've never really had 'the conversation' or asked one another for anything more than what has been offered.  sometimes i wonder if i'm really okay with the situation, and sometimes i have friends question if i'm really okay with it, especially considering this has not been typical amber operation.  i was thinking the other day about how i feel things so deeply.  when i have an emotion, any emotion, i can feel it through my entire body.  it consumes me.  but somehow, with this guy, i am able to shut it off.  i honestly don't usually put that much thought into this.  however, after spending a fantastic night with him this weekend i read my horoscope, and now cannot stop thinking about it and trying to figure out what the reality of the situation is:   Dear AMBER, Here is your horoscope for Saturday, November 22:  Indecision masquerades as extremism. Taurus sets up an elaborate diversion to keep reality at a distance. Imagine what you could do if you poured all this energy into the right channel.    BTW, my friends, don't think i've gone off the deep end.  i don't live or die by my horoscopes.  but sometimes i find them interesting, and thought provoking.  am i really okay with casual relationships?  or even more so, am i really okay with long-term casual relationships?  am i really okay with this?  am i disguising feelings?  i've honestly felt okay with it up to this point, but maybe all this thought is my hearts way of saying that it is time to pour my energy into something that might prove more fruitful."

JT8KR5K,female,24,"Well, I'm doing alright today. I'm moving all of the boxes from moving outside, since they're supposed to be picked up by the moving company soon. I'll be glad of the extra space that it opens up. I worked an extra long shift yesterday, 10am-9:30 pm, with an hour lunch around 5:30. I haven't done a shift like that in a long time..... (Note to self: don't volunteer for such a shift unless absolutely necessary.) Anyway, I didn't get to see John at all yesterday because of that. You know, he had the whole weekend off, plus he got off work Friday morning around 10am, so he had most of that day, too. Of course, he was asleep until I got home around 7pm, but that's beside the point. I don't think he did anything around the house at all. The least he could do is, I don't know, something. Dishes or something. I shouldn't have to be the one that does everything. I keep thinking about Mark. I can't stop thinking about our conversation from the other day. Am I really only merely content, or am I happy? I'm really not sure. I want kids, and I think I want them with John, but sometimes I wonder...... Is he REALLY who I want to be with? I know it's crazy. He is just so childish sometimes, and doesn't seem to have any self-control for most things. I'll admit he's getting better, but it's not enough..... You know, I'm not sure if I really respect him anymore. Part of it is my fault, but it's on him too. How many times has he told me that he's quitting smoking? Too many. And he has yet to quit. Oh, he says he's trying, but that it's hard. Problem is is that as soon as anything bothers him he doesn't try to deal with his emotions, he depends on the nicotene to deal with it. I want him to quit, I really do, but I guess I don't believe him anymore when he says he's trying. I know he's afraid that he can't, which is why he won't admit that he won't really try. I know that he can, I just don't know if he will. Why can't I get Mark out of my thoughts? He's a really deep thinker, and he wants me to be, also. Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable, because then I have to confront things that I'd just rather let be. You know, the old ""if you ignore it, it might go away"" thinking. Sometimes I wonder if I'm wasting my life with the wrong guy. Mark said that he thinks that I married John to get out of Alaska. What if it's true, but I just don't want to admit it? Why did I marry him? Do I really love him, or am I just imitating it in hopes that I'll convince myself one day that it's true and real? Such awful thoughts. He might be going to Kuwait in January. I don't know how I should feel. Upset? Relieved? Torn? Is it bad for me to not care if he goes? OK, OK, it's not that I don't care, because I really don't like having him gone, but I don't mind the being alone part as much as I used to."

8UUFOZD,female,26,"I've known all along that I can't read.  I've been carrying  The Surgeon  by Tess Gerritsen for 2 days now and all I've managed to read is the back cover plus the flippin prologue!  There's some psychological barrier that prevents me from concentrating for long periods when I know there's more than a couple of pages to read :(  I bet there's a medical term for it like  libriphobia  or something...  Actually, I might be doing quite well compared with my attempt to read Fyodor Dostoevsky's  Crime and Punishment , which took me like 5 years... to only read 30 or so pages of the book!  Kwok, I don't know how you managed to finish it.    So what did I do instead? Listen to music - just my usual compilation of pop-R&B.  My favourite at the moment is Trick Me, Kelis.  How funky is that?!  Fuck It and F U Right Back both have quite a catchy tune! :)   My excuse for not reading? There's simply not enough room on the Tube for all the commuters AND their reading material - books, mags, and worst of all, broadsheets...  Also, music makes me feel good and that can only be a good thing when you are sardined on the Tube during rush hour.  You know there's a scientific basis too.  Maybe you've heard of music therapy?!  And to quote journal research by a chink called Patrick Chiu - ""Confucius, Plato, and Pythagoras believed that daily exposure to music would enhance one’s health"".  So there you go!  *singing* There you go, lookin pitiful Just because I let you go There you go, talkin bout you want me back But sometimes it be's like that..."

I made him sit in the car whilst I waved frantically at the Clio driver, trying hard to get his attention.  The driver didn't see me. :(  Anyway, it's gorgeous, apart from the grey side vents which are a little OTT... Maybe they shouldn't have made them grey."

You think we both wild Lis'? ;)  Actually, Lisa's much more sure of herself than I am of myself.... but we both like to have fun!  Missing you Cupcake! xx"

Since then, I've had a can of coke and a large tea and will prob need to maintain a constant level of caffeine in my body to stay alert....  I didn't remember that I start 8.30 today, until it was 8.30!  And there was me, taking my time to wash my hair and put on my make up.  I even used some gold glittery tint on my face (Boots No.7 range): it's gel-like and creates a very subtle sparkle.... So what if it's Monday morning and I'm putting glitter on my face!?  England are going to win and score at least 2 goals tonight so this is in prep for the celebrations!"

Nationwide congestion charge - taxed per mile driven and only a 'maybe reduction' on petrol duty.  Overall, governtment's revenue would go up. Well, it's not like I'd be driving much even if i got a car, but still, I hate tax of any sort and was peed to read this (on someone else's Metro!).  Don't they already recieve like 15p or somthing per litre?  They say they want to improve traffic flow, oh yeh right.... they're just trying to balance their books!  Prob won't be spending more to improve public transport because they reckon that it wont take many of the drivers off the road.... Sort it out!  Did I also read possible higher rate stamp duty on property or was it higher council tax on expensive properties?  I'm almost feeling sorry for the rich who actually work hard for their money...."

8UUFOZD,female,26,"Man it was absolutely awesome!!  The crowds were great, really lively and a brilliant atmosphere.  The streets were busy and full of F1 fans thinking they were spiderman and climbing up buildings scaffolding etc.  I was down Haymarket as well were the cars were starting from and just about managed to glimpse the tops of the cars as they went by.  But the noise.... OMG... the noise these cars makes was awesome!  At first when I got there there were some pretty impressive exhaust notes already, but these turned out to be just the pace cars.  When the F1 cars started their engines you knew about it!  Even though they were about 200m away, it felt like they were revving away right on top of me!  And then when they went past......  HOLY COW!  As one guy put it ""I think I've just come"".  It wasn't an engine making that noise, somehow they have bottled thunder and harnessed it to power these machines and boy, is that thunder ever pissed off!  Really glad I went because I'll never get to hear an F1 engine being revved like that again so close to me.  They were doing the wheelspins close to where I standing and I swear the were hitting their 17,000 rpm limiters. Actually the noise is like a giant electric drill magnified a thousand times laced with a bit of thunder and topped off with a bit of petrol.   Kee Law is demanding commission for this! Now let me explain why I've posted his email. I think it's good description... pretty much  described my feelings ....there's similarities to what I experienced probably becos i was at Haymarket too (Eros end) and I spotted people climbing the Clydsdale Bank building opposite and said to Kim - ""they think they're spiderman?!""  How freaky Kee! Also, it's how he described the F1 cars as if they were living.  At the time, I was thinking they sounded like living creatures too!  Couldnt pinpoint which until Kim said 'elephant'!  So yeh, they sounded like elephants going beserk but amplified... and since the noise is, ahem, a turn on, I can imagine elephants making these noises when fighting over a mate or something!  As for the bloke that Kee quoted.... well, that just reminded me of the time I was in the Civic Type R.  Since then, any sound of revving has this funny effect on me ;)  Also, I could swear that for the rest of last night, cars, vans and motorbikes were revving everywhere I went...."

8UUFOZD,female,26,"Quoting a manager from where I work: ""My greatest lesson in life is if you are not enjoying something for any length of time, change. Don't let this become a way of life"".  That seems like a very simple way of looking at it.  But what about also looking at why you are not enjoying something... then that would also help you to find something that you do enjoy.  Otherwise, you might end up changing it for something which is only a quick fix and which you might not enjoy in the long run....."

Even then, you can always ask for variations in any of the dishes to suit your own taste.  I've never had a bad meal here which is probably why this restaurant has been around for as long as I can remember.... well over 20 years!  What do I like to eat in Mayflower?  Well, if I wasn't restricted by the size of my stomach, the meal would go something like this:  Steamed king scallops topped with fried garlic and vermicelli, plus a spring onion and fresh chilli soy sauce Iceberg lettuce wrap of mixed meat with hoisin sauce Lobster and noodles with ginger and spring onion Battered milk balls(!) with stir fry of asparagus, prawn and mango and a sugar dip (there are several versions of this and it's my favourite dish) I can't choose between aromatic pancake duck or aromatic duck with the yam on it Spiced honey pork cutlets Frogs legs deep fried with chilli salt (squid version is good too but as you can see above, there's already loads of seafood) Chinese broccolli with minced prawn 'Hang and fry' chicken plus this gunky creamy fermented sauce called 'lam yoo'  And just in case I'm still not satsifed: Toffee banana and vanilla ice cream Chilled red bean drink"

Oh, and there's the sound of the engine which I have to tell you about another time.  As for Dan's, well he has just confessed.  He says, ""tell u the truth, i dont even know the specs"". Some minutes later (he's prob has just grabbed the car brochure), he adds - ""its abt 5-6 sec car....280 bhp , 0-60 in 5.5 , top speed... let me find ouf"".  Off he goes, again?

I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others -  they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned that you can keep vomiting  long after you think you're finished.

Today, I called Luke 3 times, each time he said he'd call me back after a few minutes but he didn't.  So i gave up with him and called up and spoke to Sagna, she was no help, so i tried Jimmy again and he'd given me the wrong extension number and ended up speaking to some girl (didnt catch her name) who said Jimmy was busy with someone.    Then Luke DID call me back, woohoo! but then he said he had to go away and call me back later... boohoo..... Eventually, he called back then I realised I'd ordered a replacement card cos it'd been damaged but tried it anyway....  Only to get another call back to say it had been declined.....

Well, I think I'm a bit too late in trying to arrange something with the catering manager at work and in trying to apply for the fund raising program with Krispy Kreme - I can't get hold of their advisor and applications must be made within 2 weeks....  Maybe I will just stick to eating their donuts.

8UUFOZD,female,26,"This is just a short list, in no particular order, of things I think girls get obsessed with including me! Yeh, yeh, I know, I'm way too old to be calling myself a girl but you know what I mean! Anyways, the list:   Perfect jeans  I spent several months hunting!  and finally bought 2 pairs in 1 week. One is Meltin' Pot (don't know it's origins) and the other is from Zara.  I think Anita said there are some jeans from Brazil which are really good and give you fabulous legs.  And I just read that Zanuk jeans give you a nice arse, as spotted on Cameron Diaz (I love her!).  Guys don't generally have this obsession cos they wear their jeans fairly loose but maybe some of them should start doing us girls a favour by obsessing a little too!  This brings me on to...   Does my bum look big...  Um, I have to question this one.  If your bum is too big, wouldn't any other part of your body be big as well? Like your thighs?!  I wouldnt mind it big if it looked pert too!  I actually hate my arse cos it's flat.  There's just no way mine is sexy, even though someone once told me I got a sexy arse....  I mean, I know for a fact that I have a more obvious asset!  It's true that you should never tell a girl she has a big arse.  Even if you've got to lie, tell her it's sexy, and she will adore you!   Black trousers, black coat, black cardi, little black dress  These items are for when we want to look good without standing out or for when we are feeling fat! They are what I call the 'slimming staples' of our wardrobe and like the jeans, we usually have several... never too many!  They're versatile... but if made of cotton, tends to fade so we definately need loads!   Calorie and fat content  Maybe not all girls are calorie counting but most seem happpy to let you know how many calories and grams of fat there is in what you eat! I read somewhere though that people who are overweight tend to under estimate how many calories they have eaten, and those who are underweight tend to over estimate...interesting huh?  I'm OK at guessing but it doesn's stop me eating anything if it tastes good... my taste buds will not be fooled by low fat versions of anything!"

Yet again, I am faced with the undeniable fact that you are a huge, bowl-legged hypocrite.  You are a smoker who complains about second hand smoke.  'Nuff said.

N8USHL4,female,24,"So, this morning I had to go back to Middlesex Probate for the 3rd day in a row because those people are entirely incompetent.  I get there, I wait in a long line to get the file I need, find out they LOST the file, wait an HOUR for them to find it, wait in another long line to get the will allowed, go back to the desk and wait in another line to give them back the file, then wait in another long line to order a copy of a document.  It took almost two hours.  So I am really really angry when I leave there to go get the bus back to the office.    In case some of you don't know, on Monday they began busing people in between Government Center and Lechmere station, while they do construction.  This is supposedly going to take a whole year, and it's hugely inconvenient.  It takes about 20 minutes in between on the bus instead of 5 on the train.  So I went to go get this bus.    I had an argument with the bus driver.  I haven't bought my new T pass for this month yet, because I am lazy, but I've really only been taking the bus, then using the transfer that I get from that to get home at night.  So, I only brought 90 cents with me for the Lechmere bus back to the office.   The bus driver stops me and insists that it's 1.25 for that bus since it is replacing the T, therefore he requires a T fare, not a bus fare.  I tell him that although that may sound logical to him, 1) it's still a BUS, 2) I don't have any more change on me and I am NOT getting off the bus, 3) I think the extra 15 minutes it takes me to get to where I'm going because of this mess is worth the extra 35 cent savings and 4) it's not my fault that the MBTA has decided to inconvenience me for an entire year with this busing sh*t, so he's not getting an extra 35 cents out of me.  This happened right after I had left the courthouse and I was feeling particularly confrontational, since I had to be all peaches in cream at the probate desk in order for them to help me, when I really just felt like jumping over the desk and bashing their friggin skulls together.  I think the bus driver could tell that I was homicidal, so he just let me go without further rebuttal.  That was probably a smart move on his part."
N8USHL4,female,24,"Once upon a time there was a man who was walking down a cold, dark lonely road. In the middle of that road lay a very large snake, which suddenly turned his head and began to speak!            ""Help me, Mister!"" the snake said, ""Please help me!  I'm a cold-blooded reptile and without warmth and nourishment, I'll die on this cold, lonely road.  Please pick me up and put me under your coat so that I might warm myself.""            ""But you're a poisonous snake,"" the man said.  ""And if I pick you up, you'll surely bite me.""            ""I wouldn't bite you if you saved my life,"" the snake told him.  ""I'd be very grateful.""            The man thought for a moment, then reached down, picked up the snake and put him inside his coat.  And when the snake had warmed himself and vitality returned, he suddenly struck out and bit the man.            Ripping open his coat, the man hurled the snake back down on the cold pavement.  ""Why did you do that?"" he demanded.  ""You said if I saved your life, you wouldn't bite me!""            The snake, with a sneer on his face, looked up and the man and said, ""Mister, I'm a snake.  You knew what I was when you picked me up!"""

N8USHL4,female,24,"Today's Tip of the Day is:  When you go outside for a cigarette break, don't take your whole pack of cigarettes with you.  Just take one cigarette(or two, if you don't get a break very often and therefore become a chainsmoker for 15 minutes, twice a day).  That way, when the soiled masses start coming up to you and asking you for one, you can honestly tell them ""sorry, I don't have any more, I only have this one.""    Seriously, every time I step outside this building it's like a plague of assholes decends on me.  Dozens of people ask for a cigarette.  Even when I tell people I don't have one, they still act like assholes.  Sometimes people will say ""yes you do, don't lie to me."" or ""yeah, right"" or ""ok, then can I have some money instead?""  fuck those fuckers.  I am DONE giving out cigarettes during work.  So I only bring one downstairs with me.  And the next one of those dirtbags who accuses me of lying is going to get a cigarette all right: the burning one that was in my hand just seconds previously will all of a sudden come to rest right in the person's eye.    I am not cigarette welfare."

N8USHL4,female,24,"i'm sitting here with my brow furrowed and i can't even do any work b/c all i want to do is sit in a chair and scream my face off.  i'm back down at my old desk.  however, my old desk (and my old job) currently belong to this old woman named sandra.  about 3 months ago i was told that i was being moved from my job as assistant to two people to assisting the director.  sounds like a promotion, but really it wasn't.  it was just an annoyance.  but, i'm a trooper, so  i agreed.  also, i hated my two bosses, so i was psyched to get the hell away from them.     however, when i moved to my ""new"" position, i spent the first month and a half basically working two jobs-- my old one and my new one b/c the old lady they got to fill my position is totally incompetent.  i put up with that, too b/c i'm a masochistic idiot who doesn't know how to assert herself professionally.     it wasn't until very recently that i finally got comfortable in my new role.  i wasn't working for my old bosses at all.  i was almost enjoying the monotony of it all.  and then bam!  sandra's son dies.  then, she gets hospitalized for having a seizure.  and now she's been gone for weeks.  i got a call this morning asking me to come back down to cover for her while she's gone-- INDEFINITELY!  argh!     so.  i'm back at my old desk.  however, it's obviously not mine anymore.  and it's literally covered in filth.  there's papers everywhere.  there's a mountain of dust and grime caked up on the keyboard.  it's like this desk was excavated out of a coal mine.  how can one tiny old lady be so disgusting?  god.  i don't need this.     i love how i'm always the one to get fucking fucked around here.  it's just not fair.  i'm back down here cleaning up her mess-- both physically and fiscally.  again.  i'm done.  this is just it.  i'm currently living my own worst case scenario.  i'm right back in the job i loathe working for the two worst bosses in the history of the world.  i can't quit because i'm too poor to live WITH the job...imagine the horror of living WITHOUT it.  i may not get the financial aid that will allow me to go to school in the fall.  so, i'll have to forfeit my acceptance to school which, quite frankly, is the one good thing that's happened for me all year.  i have yet another stupid boring crush on a boy (which, believe me, i'm really pissed about.  i don't want this extra stress in my life right now.  my self esteem is bad enough already.)       i feel like i'm going to burst into tears right now.  i'm just so frustrated and i feel powerless.  yes, this is my life.  smell that?  yeah.  that's not success you're taking a whiff of.     i'm just sick to death of everything.  i give up.  can i resign from my own life?     o.k.  mid-blog update.      i feel moderately better than i did earlier.  nothing is fixed, nor do i see any solutions to my stupid predicaments...     but, steve asked me if i'd like to go for a walk.  and i was like, ""hell yeah!""  and then diane was going out for her cigarette break, so i was like, ""yeah.  you're going to have to give me one of those.""  she was like, ""oh no!  i don't want to corrupt you.""  please.  corrupt this!  don't worry-- she gave it to me.  and it was awesome.  even thought it was a virginia slim ultra light menthol (gag).  it was the greatest.  then, when i was walking back from the delivery/pickup i got catcalled.  normally, that makes me feel awful and self-conscious.  but, i really like my outfit today.  i feel really hip and cool.  i have on these great earrings which jason said made me look like a ludlow cokehead.  hot.  so, i'm basically strutting down the street in my impossibly high platform wedges (which i've worn exactly once since i bought them last  year because, well, they're impossibly high and they hurt my stupid ankle.)  anyway, i'm walking down the street and i hear these guys talking as i walk.  it's on the periphery until i hear someone yelling, ""what?!  you can't even say hi?  god!""  and i turned around because i wanted to know what all the commotion was about and the guy is looking right at me, yelling.  so, i screamed out, ""you're talking to me?  why??""  and he goes, ""because you're the only sexy woman on the street wearing a green shirt.""  and i burst out laughing and said thank you and walked on.  then, this woman (another total stranger, naturally) walked up behind me and goes, ""well, that was cute.""  and you know what?  it kind of was.  thanks, stranger!  as pathetic as it sounds, you made me feel ever so slightly less crazy and useless today.     sometimes being sexually harrassed on the street can be the best thing that ever happened to you."
N8USHL4,female,24,"Ok, before the women of the world get out of control with their bitching about frizzy hair in the summertime, let's just take a moment to remember something - at least they  have  hair.   I would like nothing more than to try to tame a massive bush of free flowing, out of control clumps of hair.  Every morning, as I patiently preen the 5 strands that are left on my head, I think, fuck those bitches who complain about frizzy hair, or about having 'too much' hair.  If you don't like it, shave the shit off and give it to me!    As embarrassing as it is for a man to start balding at the uncommonly early age of 24, how bad do you think it is when the same thing happens to a woman?  For christ's sake, I look like fucking gollum.  Pretty soon there will be nothing left.  Anyway, just wanted to give a view from the other end of the spectrum.  The ""I'm a balding woman at age 24"" spectrum, which definitely does not have enough of a voice in the media, nor enough lobbyists in Washington.    On another note, I TOO think Paris Hilton is unbelievably creepy.  She is one of the reasons I am an atheist.  I think a fairly good horror movie could be made based on my reaction to her existence.  If I ever saw her in the street, I would probably just lose my mind right on the spot.  She is that disturbing.    I just got bitched at by some fucking woman at the Cambridge District Court.  Apparently she is so much smarter than me, even though she has been filing papers in a basement from the beginning of time, and will continue doing so until the end of her miserable little life.  Who's the smart one now?"
N8USHL4,female,24,"ok, so I read the Robert Jensen article that Aimee provided the link for.  The man is obviously well read and articulate, and I agree with his Anti-Empire political leanings.  However, all that happy horseshit aside, I can't really totally buy his article ""critiquing"" the 9/11 film.  I mean, some of the shit might be true, but......    First, who ever said that Michael Moore was trying to make an Anti-Empire movie?  A lot of Jensen's comments seem geared towards the fact that Moore should have made an Anti-Empire movie, not an Anti-Bush movie.  While I may agree with that statement in some ways, I'm not the one who made the damn movie.  Maybe Jensen should make his own fucking movie.  Maybe he should give his time, money, and energy to the making of an Anti-Empire movie.    And by the way, Jensen seems to think that if the movie had been made the way HE wanted it to be made, it would have changed the world!  He makes it seem as if people would rally around in opposition to today's two-party system, and there would be a revolution of such force that the government as we know it would be toppled and oppressed people everywhere would rejoice in their new found freedom from tyranical rule!  RIIIIIGHT.  Hello, Mr. Jensen?  This is France.  It didn't work for us.  Get the fucking net.  Anyway....         It seems like there is this constant competition among people to see who can be the MOST left wing, the MOST liberal, who can point to and condemn the most instances of the subtle racism that plagues our society.  It kind of reminds me of that episode of the Apprentice where one girl says to the black woman ""that's the pot calling the kettle black"", to which she responded ""there you go with your racist comments again.""  HAH.  And the sad thing is, some people didn't even understand why the comment was so hilariously funny!  fuckers.        Although it's true that Michael Moore did not emphasize the treatment of Arab americans since 9/11, I fail to see that the mere fact that a white man who was harassed by the FBI for making anti-Bush comments was included in the movie therefore makes it racist.  PLEASE.  Also, about the Coalition of the Willing - Iceland was also listed in that segment.  Iceland is one of the whitest places on the PLANET.  Also, Morocco DID offer to send in monkeys!  How is showing a picture of running monkeys, when Morocco offered to send them, in any way racist?  Just because they are monkeys?  I think THAT is racist.    I think the point of the segment was to show that the other nations who were a part of the coaltion have basically no military at all, and were therefore only useful in Bush's attempt to make people think that other nations supported our military actions, when in fact every nation that mattered in the military sense did NOT support our actions.  I did not get the feeling that Moore was pointing to the fact that the other nations weren't WHITE as a way of making fun of them.  Paranoid much?  But then again, I'm about as white as Powder, so I guess I have no right to discuss issues such as these.     I'm not saying Moore's movie is great, or that it couldn't have been done better.  What I am saying is that the film has a purpose - to get Bush out of the White House.  And I think it can help with that purpose.  And getting Bush out isn't the ultimate solution to all of the nation's problems, that's true.  But let's be real people.    This ain't no fucking revolution."
N8USHL4,female,24,"sorry, sara...  but, i have to rebut.  at least you have hair?  believe me, if i didn't have a head shaped like a troll doll and didn't actually need to keep a job, i would absolutely shave my head clean.  anything would be better than the countless useless fuzzy strands i currently have populating my scalp.  as soon as the weather hints at moisture, my hair balloons up to the size of a hula hoop.  i'm all curls and frizz; no substance.   every day i go through the same tribulations.  i wake up and spend ages doing my hair.  treating it right with shampoos and conditioners and the right amount of indirect heat.  when i'm done, i've got a coif of enviable, gorgeous hair (well, maybe not that enviable.  it's still two-toned like a mo-fo).  then, as soon as i step out into the human soup that is new york city, it starts rebelling.  at first it's just the cantankerous ones up front at the crown.  then, word spreads and by the time i get to work at 8:30 in the morning it's full-on mutiny.  i look like i just went through 40 hours of shock treatment.  and then was set on fire.    looking my absolute worst every single day might not chafe quite so much if i didn't have a glimpse of how good it *could* be-- it almost was...if only i never ever left the house.  damn.  that kills.  why do i even bother?  oh, right.  because i look like shit in hats.  oh, and p.s.-- this applies to my hair year-round, ladies and gentlemen.  year. round.

In fact, he's probably just seeing that picture that I uploaded a few minutes ago and spewing his brains out at work.  He has quite the weak stomach, and I'm sure that picture is enough to send him over the edge.    Second, who are we?  Sonny and Cher?  We don't do things together.  Separate is as separate does.  Joint blog.  Makes me want to retch.  That's almost as bad as him expecting me to take his last name.  On the list of shit Sara will never do in a million years, it's pretty high up there.  Although, it's quite a long list, so maybe that's not saying much.      Third, I will hate everything that Joel wants to post.  He will post severe weather warnings, french vocabulary, gardening tips, and new recipes that he has found.  Seriously, watch it happen.    Anyway, I just wanted to share with you all Joel's comments after I told him I will absolutely not do a joint blog with him:   ""Fine, I will take this in my own direction.

N8USHL4,female,24,"I'm sorry aimee, but on a scale of 1 to suck, your argument is definitely towards the suck side.    How can having frizzy and unmanageable hair be worse than being a bald woman?  It just can't be.  Plenty of people have frizzy hair just like yours.  When someone sees you on the street, they may think 'damn, that's some big hair, she should use frizz ease' or some shit like that.  On the other hand, when people see me, it's like 'oh my god, I can see her scalp, that's really nasty.  I wonder what's wrong with her.  think she has cancer?'  Huge difference.  It also doesn't help that I'm the size of a hobbit, so everyone can look down and see the scalp quite easily.    I too would shave me head if I could, and just be done with it.  But of course, I also have the same reasons as you do for not being able to do it.    So you see, I win.  Or rather, I lose.  In a big, big way.

N8USHL4,female,24,"i'm trying out this new feature where i can simply send an email to my blog  and it will publish automatically.  this could either be totally awesome or  the worst thing that's ever happened.  ....we'll see...  not to worry-- i don't have pink eye.    yesterday i woke up and my eye was all gross.  the previous night it had been itchy and watery and meagan suggested (half-jokingly, i think) that i might have pink eye.  but, when i woke up and my eye was crusted shut i thought, ""hell, maybe she was right.""  as soon as i got to work, i looked up conjunctivitis on webmd to see what my chances of survival were.  as can be expected from webmd, one of the first things that popped up was cancer.  fabulous.  but, before i could begin planning for my eminent demise, i thought i might want to get a second (medical) opinion.  so, i called to make doctor's appointment for later on in the day.  when i walked into the office, i was confronted with a woman who was essentially my shorter, older, asian twin.  she seemed to have the same general distaste for human interaction that i do.  and the same tendancy to talk to fill the awkward silence-- a silence that only seems awkward due to our own inherent social ineptitude.  as soon as i walked in the door i launched into my explanation as to why i was darkening her doorstep.  she laughed right in my face.  nice bedside manner, by the way.  apparently, not too many people make an emergency appointment because they think they have pink eye based on a diagnosis from webmd.  with that out of the way, we started talking over each other.  both trying to reassure the other that there was actually nothing wrong with me so we could end the agony of conversation.  it went a little something like this:   doctor: so, how's your ankle?  giving you any trouble? me: now that you mention it, yes.  it's been making a horrible clicking sound, it hurts when i walk, and i can't rotate it at all.  but, it's probably nothing, right? doctor: oh, that doesn't sound good.  maybe there's water on it.  or, maybe it's nothing.  you're right.  it's probably nothing. me: oh, good.  it's probably nothing.  thanks. doctor: yeah.  probably...  she looked at my eye for about half a minute before issuing her diagnosis: ""well, i think it might be a little infected.  maybe some dust got into your eye.""        ""dust"".  i believe that's the scientific term for ""shut up, crazy, and take your prescription for placebo drops on your way out.""    i left the office feeling healthier than ever.  i was limping from the wincing pain in my ankle and my eye was watering and itching like hell, but i had a huge smile on my face.  i'd heard it from a professional that i was sound as a pound.  and that's all i needed to hear.  who am i to argue with medical science?"

N8USHL4,female,24,"i went to see ""farenheit 9/11"" tonight.  taking into account my recent post about it, it will surprise no one that i had some issues with the film.  i got a lot of comments after my first post about how i wasn't seeing the big picture-- that it's amazing that a film like this was not only made, but was also successful.  and that plenty of people wil see this film that may never have gone to see somehing like it before.  it could open people's minds and get them to think.    but, the question stands-- thinking about what?  what i got from the movie is that george w. bush is the reason everything in the world is in the shitter.  9/11?  bush's fault.  poverty in the u.s.? bush's fault.  civil unrest in the u.s. and abroad?  bush's fault.  the weight of the world is on his shoulders.  of course, he deserves plenty of the blame.  but, ALL of it?  come on.  that's the most naive assessment of u.s. history i've ever seen.  and it's a dangerous assumption.  what proof is there that were gore/leiberman in the white house that so much would be different now?  does anyone not remember clinton and his relationship with iraq?  or wha about a little something called plan colombia (i'm looking at you, too, joe lieberman)?  that was not only A democrat, but THE democrat, dudes.  hello.  it's this kind of journalistic laziness that i abhor in mr. moore.    i don't know...  it's late and that movie clearly made me a little emotional.  i've been feeling more and more disenfranchised (in general) lately and this movie only served to push the point home.  my voice isn't being heard.  my views are not represented by my government.  when i look at the faces of george bush and dick cheney and john kerry and john edwards, i can't see that they have my best interests at heart.  i can't even count on the so-called ""liberal mouthpiece"", michael moore, to present a cogent argument that can hold at least a teaspoon of water.  i'm not saying that we should all boycott the election.  and i'm not saying that it doesn't make any difference who is in the white house.  i'm certainly no bush lover.  i absolutely believe that it matters.  and i'll definitely be voting and possibly campaigning for john kerry.  however, i don't think it's particularly prudent to turn a blind eye not only to what has been going on, but to what is in store for the future.    maybe i'm the naive one.  maybe i'm the crazy one.  maybe i'm just being a hater.  who cares?  these are just the thoughts of one sad girl on a balmy summer night."

But listen to this - how about a guy on a BIKE that is talking on his cell phone?  Doesn't that seem like an even worse idea than driving and talking on the cell at the same time?  I think so.

Just when I think my day is going poorly, something like this happens and makes my entire world brighten.  Now that I have witnessed that man crashing to the pavement, I feel like my demeanor has been scrubbed clean of all the dirt and filth it had accummulated since this morning.  Nothing short of seeing an asshole get his due does that for me.  Ah, what a wonderful world."
N8USHL4,female,24,"i started writing this blog earlier today.  it was all about human relationships and buddhist philosophy, if you can believe it.  some maudlin bullshit about how we depend on other people to make us happy, when we should really look within ourselves to find peace.  can all that noise.    i'm in a bad mood today.  it's humid as all hell, my hair looks like a brillo pad dipped in animal fat, and i have a splitting headache.  i have to decide between being a good friend to my roommate and going home to wait for her boyfriend to get in from scotland OR being a good friend to someone at work and going to a doctors without borders lecture.  i pretty much lose either way b/c i'm not in the state of mind to be social tonight at all.  all i really want to do is go to my room and cry.  it's a crying kind of day."

N8USHL4,female,24,"Wendy is my best friend in hell.  She is my muse, my raison d'etre, my sugarplum fairy, my black Bridget Jones.  And, thanks to recent developments here in Massachusetts, she can someday be my wife (it would be worth it just for the look on Donna's face).    So this post is dedicated to Wendy, without whom I would never have had a 60 year old stripper slapping me in the face with her sagging, wrinkly tits while I was on the can.  Such are the wonderful things that can happen to someone lucky enough to be friends with Wendy.    Cheers to the girl who introduced me to Popeye's, Jeff Buckley, Tony's, the Claremont, Community, and Rue.    I love wendy like a fat kid loves cake.  I would tell all of you to go out and discover the wonder that is wendy, but then you would all fall in love with her too.  And that can't happen, since I am not willing to share.    Back off sluts, she is mine."
N8USHL4,female,24,Why did i let sara convince me to do this thing??
N8USHL4,female,24,"You joined because it fucking rocks, that's why.  I know you have many fabulous things to say, and you need an outlet to say them in.  Next time your stupid boss is staring at you while you work, just start blogging and see if she says anything."
N8USHL4,female,24,"For father's day, I took my dad to trivia night at the Raven in Waltham along with the usual suspects.  It was fucking ruling.  We kicked so much ass, we set a record for highest score ever.  I think we only got 4 questions out of 30 wrong.  Well, by ""we"" I mean everyone else sitting at the table.  For those of you who don't know, I SUCK at trivia.  really horribly.  But I do enjoy playing and writing down the answers in my type-writer like handwriting.  The only answer I contributed was that Mickey Mouse turned 75 years old last year.  So sad, so sad.  We got a free round of watermelon martinis plus 30 bucks in cash for winning.  Rock.  Didn't get home til almost 3:00 though, but I am surprisingly not too tired.    Back to work for a while.  Aimee, you should post on your blog more often.  Your entries are way funnier than mine."
N8USHL4,female,24,"Is this thing on?  I'm not really that good with computers.  But Wendy told me to start a blog, and so I have, because I always do whatever Wendy tells me to do, especially in the S&M sense.    Some may say ""Sara, you don't want to start a blog.""  To these people I say ""But I do.  And I'm sorry, but it's not going to stop.""    All right people, prepare to be disgusted, horrified, insulted, degraded, and many other things you thought you would only feel back when you were an alter boy."
N8USHL4,female,24,"The way my desk is set up at work is quite advantageous.  I have walls on two sides of me and there is a cubicle wall on the other two sides.  There is only a small opening to my desk area.  I call this the ""door"".  The entire area is really private.  Nobody passing by can see my computer screen, which allows me to play hearts, cribbage and partake in any other risky activities at my leisure.  I listen to music freely and liberally.  Strategically speaking I have one of the best seats in the entire office.   However, a certain grotesquely raffish “Person X” often disrupts my serene little corner.  I can't tell you how many times I've been busily working or even worse, playing hearts, when all of sudden I hear booming ""so what are you doing back here"".  I fucking hate you X!  One of these days I am going to wheel around in my sleek n stylish black Aeron chair and stab X in the neck with a freshly sharpened pencil.    Most people consciously announce their approach with a paper shuffle, cough or even a soft knock at my ""door"".  X on the other hand displays absolutely no office decorum.  Sometimes X will even stand behind until I notice somebody is there.  I fucking hate that!    With that said, today’s french phrase of the day is:         On est tous dans le même bateau"
N8USHL4,female,24,"In rebuttal to Sara's comments on her blog, I feel that I must back up my previous statements with some more information.  It is true that I have been smoking off and on for nearly six years.  However during this time period, I feel that I have always had my cigarette smoking under control.  What it usually came down to was money.  Cigarettes are not cheap.  If I didnt have the money, I simply would not purchase any cigarettes that week.  On average I would smoke about 5 a day, and I am still not much over that amount.  Smoking is something that I enjoy during the summer months.  In summation, I am far from a hopeless addict.  I am merely acknowledging the fact that cigarettes are now a part of my life.  Hipocrazy maybe, but not hypocracy."

N8USHL4,female,24,"After years and years of denial, I'm finally throwing in the towel.  I am addicted to cigarette smoking, and I really enjoy it.  For those that do not know me very well, this is a huge step for me.  I've been trying to become addicted for years now, without much success, but now things are much different.  Cigarettes are by far not a new thing for me.  I drew my first breath back in my freshman year of college, when smoking was really fun.  It made me all dizzy, and contrary to many, alive.  Yes, cigarettes make me feel alive even though the health problems that cigarette smoking causes are undeniable.  The whole idea of making a conscience decision to partake in an activity that is proven to be deadly is totally invigorating.  I like to compare it to base jumping.  Base jumpers strap parachutes to their backs and jump off of tall things and float to the ground.  This is one of the most dangerous sports in the world, and I'm sure the adreniline rush must be insane, while at the same time addictive.  Each time I light up a cigarette, take a deep drag, and feel that familiar tightening in your chest, and then the long pleasurable exhale, I think of the base jumpers, except I'm seeking a nicotine rush instead of an adrenline rush.  Both smokers and base jumpers know that if they continue their habits long enough, they will probably die from them.  However, that wont stop me.  Perhaps I am justifying a dirty habit, but its taking risks in life that make us live.  I'll probably just end up quitting during the winter like I usually do because I hate smoking when its cold out, its just not very pleasurable.  But for now, pass me the lighter!"
N8USHL4,female,24,"so, i'm sitting on the train quietly reading my horrible book (as i lay dying-- faulkner can kiss my ass, by the way) and listening to my headphones when a blind man walks onto the train.  and by ""walks"" i clearly mean, ""rampages"".  he storms into the train flailing his stick at all and sundry, presumably to get his bearings...but, he was swinging that thing with such fury he almost hobbled me.  he came to a stop right in front of me.  as i was reading and couldn't hear anything, i didn't notice that he was blind.  i just thought he was an asshole and i almost punched him in the face.  when i looked up, it became obvious to me that he was blind and he definitely expected me to get my sight-having ass up out of my seat and relinquish it to him.  which i would have done b/c i'm sort of a nice person.  but, the woman sitting next to me saw him first.  obviously, to prove her extreme martyrdom, she gives me this exasperated look (like she can't believe i didn't get up since he's standing in front of me) and very deliberately vacates her seat.  excuse me, but my foot is broken.  don't i deserve a seat if for no other reason than i got there first?  jackass.  so.  the blind man sits.  and proceeds to make a huge production out of it-- all shifting wildly and whipping around his backpack.  yeah, i know he can't see.  but, at this point, he's hit me with his cane enough times to know where i am.  not to mention the fact that we're sitting next to each other.  where else would i be?     he goes on to pull out this huge ledger-style braille book.  now, i don't know much (or anything, really) about braille, but i have to believe that you'd read braille in much the same way you would read anything else.  this guy was running his hands over the pages with such rapidity i thought he was having an episode.  after every few pages he started rubbing his hands on his face-- up and down, back and forth, and then kissing his hands.    my first instinct was that he was praying.  so, i stole a glance in his direction so i could figure it out.  because, by now, i'm invested.  upon closer inspection, i realized that he's not praying at all.  he's just totally fucking insane.    after sitting next to him awhile, i didn't really notice the slight jostle i'd get every time he started in on his facial machinations.  but, i did start to think about what it would be like to be blind.  so, i closed my eyes and tried to imagine what his experience would be like.  then, i got really freaked out b/c i got really disoriented and thought that if i was blind, i would be falling all the time.  and then i felt sad.  it's no fun being blind.  especially when dumb bitches like me refuse to give you a seat on the train and then get mad at you for being crazy.  and then make it their first entry in their blog."

N8USHL4,female,24,"i generally hate sundays.  it's just my least favorite day.  it always has been.  sundays make me think of homework and stressing about school the next day.  they make me think of sitting in a stifflingly hot and humid church with fans pathetically ruffling the hair on the back of my neck enough to make me remember how miserable i am.  if sunday had a sound, it would be the blues.  or funk.  if sunday had a taste, it would be cinnamon.  disgusting.      however, for the past four years, my good friend, t.v., has given me at least one thing to keep me from sleeping the miserable day away.  that one thing is a little show called ""six feet under"".  and up until last night i thought it was absolutely the bee's knees.      why?!?!  why would alan ball perpetrate such a heinous crime on the viewing public?  does he have any idea how much money we pay for cable every month?  i demand reimbursment for both my time and hard-earned dollar bills, y'all!  he took the one solitary character that i have heretofore found no fault with.  i thought michael c. hall was brilliant.  i thought the character of david was expertly drawn.  in short, i loved him.  and now he's been ruined.  he's going to have to deal with the aftermath of this ridiculousness for the remainder of the season, if not the series.  grr!     that episode was just so impossible to watch.  it made me uncomfortable and frustrated.  two things i don't look for when watching t.v.  i get enough of that jazz in my own life.     i had a lot more steam when i first started writing this blog.  but, then i talked to the monkey.  she made some good points.  she said that perhaps one day we'll look back on this episode and realize that it was genius.  maybe she's right.  maybe i'm not giving alan ball enough credit.  maybe he's pushing the envelope right up to the edge...      OR maybe he's pushing the envelope right over the edge of the desk and we just watched sfu jump the shark.  in which case, he can go ahead and accept my engraved invitation to  kiss my ass.      obviously, i'm too invested at this point to bail out now.  so, i'll be tuning in next week to find out if my favorite show just got that much better...or if i lost one of the only things that kept me going on sundays."
N8USHL4,female,24,"So I've been very busy these past few weeks, caught up in a little thing we at work call ""Universe Creation"".  Let me explain.  Aside from the Big Bang, which theorists believe was the cosmic event that gave birth to the actual universe as we know it, every quarter the ICC (Independent Consultant Cooperative) creates a universe of client data (what I like to call the mini bang).  (As an aside, I was reading a scientific journal the other day and apparently astronomers have uncovered evidence that disproves the Big Bang theory.  This group of rouge scientists have found red shifts in extremely distant galaxies that indicate these galaxies formed around the time of the Big Bang.  Part of Big Bang theory stresses that galaxies must have formed at a later time after the initial cosmic event.  These extremely old, and distant galaxies do not fit into the Big Bang puzzle, which I thought was very interesting.  However, this discovery could just be useful to Bible bangers and creationists, but enough of this for now...)  Back to Universe creation.  Every quarter, portfolio returns, characteristics and holdings are uploaded to the ICC universe of client data.  After the deadline has passed, all this data is combined, crunched, accelerated to the speed of light, and then sent through a cosmic worm hole where it is then ready to present all nice and neat to our clients.  Actually, for those that are familiar with statistical analysis, we are just creating a population of data, where we are able to compare sample data (specific client info) against all peers.  This is especially useful when comparing returns.  Given the competative nature inherent in all human beings, we want to see how we did compared to everyone else.  Our universe allows this to happen.  We are able to determine mean returns for fixed income, equity, and international equity asset classes, amongst a whole slew of others.  Portfolio returns can also be ranked in their respective universes (parallel universes, he he, I can go on and on with this nerdy humor, somebody stop me!).  And so, my deadline is this saturday, so I've been mad busy, and probably busier after this weekend as reports begin to generate.  Just call me He-Man... Master of the Universe!!!"

N8USHL4,female,24,"so, as you are all aware, we went to play trivia last night at the Raven.  Well, there WAS NO TRIVIA!!!!  So pissed off.  The waitress explained to us that since the Yankees were playing the Red Sox, the trivia guy wouldn't be able to use the microphone as that would disrupt the commentary of the game on the TV.  Two things are wrong with this statement:   1) They knew the Red Sox were playing the Yankees LAST week when we were there, yet there was no mention then of there being no trivia.  In fact, the guy made a huge point about inviting us all back next week for more trivia.  It was a ploy to get us to go back.    2) They weren't even playing the TV commentary!!!  They played loud music the WHOLE time, so what the hell are they talking about?    Makes absolutely no sense and I am pissed.  I mean, my Dad drove down from New Hampshire for trivia.  So he was not happy either.  Fuckers, fuckers.    Well, we did have a good time anyway.  So there's that.  Also - Joel, I believe I saw your friend Rich(?) while I was there.  You know, the guy from Bentley that I never liked.  He is still a COMPLETE asshole, evidenced by the fact that he kept staring and staring at me, and I finally said hi, and he didn't respond at all.  what a jerk, I always hated him."

AH4BJED,male,25,"I ran into a girl across the hall from me a little while ago who asked me if the noise last night kept me up.  I asked her what noise she meant.  She said she and some friends were playing loud music and screaming in the hallway between 4 and 6 in the morning.  I kind of remember hearing something in the middle of the night,but if it woke me up I fell right back asleep... so I told her I didn't really notice.  And she told me it woke my next-door neighbor up, and she went out in the hall and asked them all to be quiet.  But apparently I slept right through.  My question is: what the heck are people doing making noise in the hallway -- what are people even doing awake?!? -- at 4 in the morning?  Maybe this is why people think law school is hard.  If you're gonna be up at 4 in the morning, just staying awake the next day is going to be hard, let alone reading and thinking.  I just don't understand..."

AH4BJED,male,25,"I got one e-mail so far for all-request Independence weekend (see below):   ""I get the day off Tuesday.  OK Monday too - but I have things I have to do that day.  Now Tuesday is open for anything.  So...I'd like your opinion on what I shoud do on Tuesday.  OK, it's more of a suggestion than an opinion.  How's this - barring a suggestion of illegal activity... I'll do whatever you suggest.  Hmmm.  I'm placing a lot of faith in your opinion today."" Interesting.  I guess this gives me the opportunity to riff on what would be a perfect day.  I can try that.  Let's see...  1. Go to sleep early the night before, but don't set your alarm clock.  So you're nice and rested for the day.  2. Get in touch with some friends you haven't seen in a while, but really like spending time with.  See if they're free too.  That'll make the day better, whatever it is you do.  3. Wake up and go to a bakery.  Get something just baked that smells good.  Eat it.  Get some fresh-squeezed juice too.  Probably orange juice, but grapefruit will probably do too.  I don't know if they fresh-squeeze cranberry juice.  It sounds sort of messy.  4. Go for a long walk, with those friends you convinced to take the day off with you.  Talk about the meaning of life.  Find a frisbee on the side of the road.  Toss it around for a while.  Make a bad toss and find yourself chasing the frisbee into a perfect spot for a picnic.  Find a supermarket nearby, buy some fresh ingredients, use the restroom (since by now surely you'd have to go -- the orange juice, the long walk...), and have a picnic.  Linger for a while.  Talk about your hopes and dreams and where you think the frisbee came from.  5. Stumble onto an outdoor concert, featuring a band that isn't very well-known now, but you think you hear some potential.  Buy their self-made CD, even though you know you probably won't listen to it more than once or twice.  Offer them your picnic leftovers.  Serendipitously run into an old friend there.  6. Wander toward the ocean, if there's one in proximity (otherwise a lake will do).  Go swimming.  7. Dry off.  Probably use the restroom again.  Head back home with your friends.  Talk some more.  Share some stories.  Laugh.  Breathe in the fresh air.  Eat some freshly-picked blackberries.  Find a stray dog looking for a home.  Discover an unexpected tax refund in your mailbox.  8. Cook a light dinner, everybody pitching in, preferably with some vegetables you found at a farmer's market, perfectly ripe and in season.  Listen to the birds and crickets.  Ignore the termites.  9. Say goodbye to your friends.  Restroom again, perhaps.  Curl up on the couch with a good book.  Watch something TiVo thought you'd like.  Write a love ballad.  Fold the laundry that's been on the chair for a week.  Yawn.  Brush teeth.  Put on your favorite CD, and let it lull you to sleep.  Not a bad day, right?"

AH4BJED,male,25,"Expectations for the summer, before the job starts:  1. I expect to learn just how many shades of blue there are.  I don't mean sadness.  I mean blue like in dress shirts.  I expect to see lots of blue shirts, all similar but subtly different from each other.  I expect it will be a real education. In blueshirtness.  I own 4 blue dress shirts right now.  If I were to give each of them a name, they would be ""Shiny Blue,"" ""Textured Light Blue,"" ""Dark Blue,"" and ""Blue I think is blue but a bunch of people told me it was gray.""  But I expect to also learn what ""Bright Blue,"" ""Powder Blue,"" ""Electric Blue,"" ""Striped Blue,"" ""Pinstriped Blue,"" ""Blue with white collar,"" ""Used to be blue but ended up with the whites in the laundry and got bleached,"" ""Wishes it was blue but is really sort of pink,"" ""Stained blue,"" ""Sky blue,"" ""Hole in the collar blue,"" and ""Magic marker blue"" all look like too. I'll be keeping a list.  2. I expect to be able to more fully articulate the differences between Lexis and Westlaw, what one has and the other hasn't, which one gives better free assistance over e-mail, the pricing differences, which one has a more enthusiastic sales rep, which provides better training, which is more likely to lead me on wild-goose-searches where I end up finding interesting news articles about people I went to elementary school with, which is the more ""sensitive"" legal research service, what the difference between a Boolean and Natural Language search is, how many digits of my Westlaw password I can memorize without my brain exploding, which is more forgiving of rookie mistakes like selecting the wrong court system to look in, which loads faster, and which smells better.  3. I expect to participate in a lot of summer associate events, in fact probably the same number and exactly the same type as my friends at other firms around the city.  In fact, I expect to see large packs of summer associates from other firms leaving Wolfgang Puck's ""Le Hamsterie"" right as my firm's group is entering; sitting next to us at the Yankees game (where Gary Sheffield will have been expressly instructed to hit a foul ball directly into our section so that one lucky summer associate gets to go home with a souvenir.  Yankee tickets bought by the law firm: free; Concessions bought by the law firm: free; Gary Sheffield hitting a foul ball right into your section: $100,000 check from the law firm to Gary Sheffield; if that really happens: priceless); down the row at Wicked: The Musical; three lanes over at the bowling alley... oh, wait, lawyers don't go bowling.  Bowling is a blue-collar sport.  Lawyers, despite wearing blue shirts, only play white-collar sports, like accounting.  4. I expect to get tired of eating in nice restaurants, since I hear I will end up having a lot of nice lunches.  Which will actually be a shame, since eating in a nice restaurant should be a treat, not necessarily an everyday activity.  But it will be a nice shame, sort of.  Part of me thinks this all may be overblown and I'll actually get to make some lunch plans with friends in the city and not be ""booked"" every day with work-lunching.  But obviously until I start I have no idea.  The perfect business meal for a nice blue shirt: soup, pasta with red sauce, something parmagiana, and liquid chocolate raspberry spinning gyroscopes of staining liquid for dessert.  Or perhaps I'll just order the dry cereal with white rice, so even if I pour it all on my lap, I can still walk back to the office clean and ready for an afternoon on Lexisicing.    5. I expect to like it.  I mean, everyone says it's a lot of fun, I'll get to meet some students from other schools, meet some lawyers, figure out what it is lawyers do, go to some cool events and activities, eat in nice restaurants, see some things besides the inside of a classroom, really what's not to like.  Except for the sense that I'll be becoming ""one of them.""  But I suppose I did that when I sent in my law school deposit.  I don't know.  I guess I'm hoping that not all lawyers live up (down?) to the generic lawyer reputations, although really many of the people I met during the interview process seemed like very nice people, so I don't really think I should be concerned.  But I don't know.  And not knowing what to expect kind of makes the anticipation fun.  A little bit."
AH4BJED,male,25,"Dean Kagan announces Law School Easter Egg Hunt   Jarvis Field to be filled three feet deep with plastic grass   Following the unfortunate demise of the Jarvis Field Ice Rink (see Ice Rink Stolen! above), Dean Kagan announced today that the law school will turn Jarvis Field into the grounds of a massive Law School Easter Egg Hunt.  The Field will be filled three feet deep with plastic grass, and 1800 Cadbury Crme Eggs will be hidden inside, incurring a cost that will cause the law school to raise tuition by 15% next year.  Students will be invited to the Egg Hunt by section, along with section professors, who will join the students in digging through the plastic grass for the eggs.  I believe the Easter Egg Hunt will improve student morale tremendously, said a beaming Dean Kagan.  I have heard the clarion call that students want more out of law school, and this, I am certain, is exactly what they want.    Reports stolen from Dean Kagans office have uncovered that the Dean plans to turn Jarvis Field into a seasonal land of pleasure, which will be home to new projects for each major holiday.  For Thanksgiving, the Field will become a giant pen for turkeys to roam free, until Dining Services slaughters them for lunch.  For Memorial Day, the slain bodies of soldiers will be buried in the ground beneath in a moving and gratuitously expensive ceremony.  For Arbor Day, perhaps the most extraordinary plan of all: grass will be planted, and Jarvis Field will be turned back into a Field.  I am expecting student resistance to that one, said Kagan.    Other reports stolen indicate that, like on Law Review, there will not be affirmative action for women in the Easter Egg Hunt, and that even if no women find any Easter Eggs, none will be provided to them.  A coalition of three chickens and an egg (the egg came forward first, incidentally) sent the newspaper a top-secret letter outlining their dissatisfaction with Kagans position and imploring the student body to take a closer look at the Easter Egg Hunt results and demand action.  Data from peer law schools indicate that while at Harvard only 30% of all eggs in past hunts were found by women, at Columbia women found 54% of the eggs, at the University of Pennsylvania 48%, at Yale 62%, and at Barbaras Law School For Women, 100% of the Easter eggs were found by women.  The Committee on Eggs released a report this week saying that despite the suspicion that more eggs will be found by men than by women, because women have eggs inside of them and men have sperm, the overall differences will be negligible.  The report has been banned by the library for being particularly idiotic, leading Prof. Alan Dershowitz to speak out about the issue.  These students should not be silenced.  Even if theyre comparing Easter Eggs to other wholly unrelated eggs that are probably not painted with bright colors, and if they are I hope its not lead paint, because that harms children.  Dershowitz also insisted he did not plagiarize his speech, just because he felt like talking some more.  In addition to the Easter Egg Hunt, said Dershowitz, I demand Dean Kagan also hide matzoh in Jarvis Field for Jewish students to find.  After making this demand, he returned to his office to add an appendix to his latest book, The Case For Israel, regarding matzoh, and how it may be hidden somewhere in Israel, although he is not sure where."

Only quibble I've got with his latest post is the last line, and it's more a quibble with my original post than with his post -- his post makes it seem like I think people who are scoring below 160 should in fact take a course.  I really don't.  Practice tests (real questions!  not fake test-prep-company-written ones!) are the way to go.  If you don't have the willpower to take some LSAT practice tests without an underpaid prep-course instructor forcing you too, is law school really the place for you?  And, just to clarify, I never actually taught a prep-course.  I did the training but it was too late in the cycle for me to teach a whole course before law school started last fall... but it was still interesting to go through the process and see the materials they use and strategies they teach."

Check it out if you dare.  Tonight at a cappella rehearsal, we had to discuss Harvard's anti-hazing statute.  There's a law, it seems, that requires all student organizations here to sign an anti-hazing pledge.  Because hazing is obviously a big problem for a cappella groups.  And the Jewish Law Students Association (eat that pork!  you must eat that pork!).  And the technology law journal.  And moot court.  From the statute:   269:17. Hazing; organizing or participating; hazing defined  Whoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime of hazing, as defined herein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.  The term 'hazing' as used in this section and in sections eighteen and nineteen, shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include  whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug, or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity  which is likely to adversely affect the physical health, or safety of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation.   ""Exposure to the weather"" is awfully vague.  There's always some sort of weather.  Making someone enjoy a beautiful day: hazing.  Asking you to eat the ""welcome to our church"" cookies: hazing.  Making you hold the door for the person behind you (""forced physical activity""): hazing.  Better examples of stupid things that would count as hazing: coming later when I'm more creative."

AH4BJED,male,25,"In case you miss tonight's evening news:  ""Good evening, and welcome to a historic night for Iowa, and for the nation, as the 2004 Election Season truly kicks off with Iowa's First-In-The-Nation caucus.  All indications are that tonight's caucus is experience the highest turnout in years, and the race has never been closer.  We've got reporters on the ground in Great Bluffs, Giant Falls, and Super Floodville waiting to give us their eyewitness accounts of the excitement they've seen today.  But first, a video clip that shows all of the candidates smiling and waving to cheering audiences that demonstrates absolutely nothing about the race.  Our intrepid senior political analyst reports:  ""Thanks. I'm here at Sue Ann's coffee shop, which for over a hundred years has been a bellwether for Iowa caucuses.  However the waitresses at Sue Ann's go, so goes the state of Iowa.  And today, the waitresses are deadlocked.  Three for Dean, three for Kerry, three for Gephardt, three for Edwards, and that crazy guy out back for Kucinich.  From my vantage point here, at the center of the storm, I've seen all of the candidates and their throngs of admirers march past, on their way to a rally.  If the excitement is any indication, this caucus may draw more than thirty-one times the number of people who attended the caucuses last time through.  Of course, we can never be sure of anything here in Iowa.  It's earned its reputation as an unpredictable state.  Especially the weather.  Why, here comes some weather right now!  Back to you in the studio!  ""Be careful there!  That was our senior political analyst.  Now we turn to our senior elections correspondent, at John Kerry headquarters for more about what the Kerry camp is saying about the caucuses.  Over to you!  ""Thanks.  It's mayhem here at Kerry headquarters, where of course it's too soon to tell what the results will be, but people here are certainly excited.  The candidate has been criss-crossing the state today, from Moose Jaw to Antelope Head, trying to rally supporters.  Turnout at Kerry events has been rising over the last few days, and the candidate is said to be ""psyched"" by all of the last-minute support.  Kerry groundworkers have been rounding up voters, and driving them to their caucus sites.  One of those voters is here with me now at Kerry headquarters, waiting for the results to come in.  How are you, ma'am?    ""I'm great, thanks.  I'd never been to a caucus before, but I am so excited about helping John Kerry win the nomination that I braved the cold and headed over there.  I hope I'm celebrating with a goat and a bottle of whiskey tonight!""  ""Thanks, ma'am.  If all of Kerry's supporters are as excited as this woman, he may have a lot to smile about tonight.  Live from Kerry headquarters, now back to the studio.  ""Thanks for the report.  That was our senior elections correspondent.  We now turn to our senior field reporter over at one caucus site he'll never forget!  ""Thanks!  I'm over here at Millie's Barn, perhaps the most rustic of the over 10,000 caucus sites throughout the state of Iowa.  Remarkably, just three hours ago, this barn was not here where it is now.  Last night, it is reported that a Dean supporter came and disassembled the barn, and threw it in the river over there (camera pans to river).  Apparently, there was concern that this would be an Edwards barn tonight in the caucuses.  But the good people of Iowa have rebuilt the barn, and it will be open for caucusing tonight!  A remarkable story, but just one of hundreds of remarkable stories I'm sure, on this night of caucusgoing.  Back to you in the studio!  ""Great story there from our senior field reporter.  Now, we turn to our senior campaign correspondent standing with John Edwards in the middle of a pile of hay.  ""Thanks.  I'm here with Senator John Edwards, who certainly seems upbeat tonight.  Senator?  ""Yes, I've been excited to see the growing crowds over the last few days, and I think I'm going to end up with a good showing here in the great state of Iowa.""  ""Any predictions?  ""We all ran great races, it's so close, anything would be a victory for us here.  I'm not going to start guessing numbers.""  ""Anything would be a victory?  3 percent?  ""3 percent.""  ""There you have it, John Edwards guessing his turnout at 3%.  Thanks, Senator.  Back to you in the studio.  ""Thanks.  Now we all know that races can be won and lost based on turnout.  With an analysis of how turnout might affect tonight's caucus, we turn to our chief election bureau head.  ""Thanks for having me.  The key thing to know about turnout is that when turnout is high, more people are voting.  This is critical for all the candidates, because it means that to win, they need a greater number of raw votes than if turnout is low.  So in order to increase their percentages, it becomes more difficult for every candidate, regardless of how popular he is.  Candidates hurt by high turnout are the ones who don't have that many people supporting them.  Candidates helped by high turnout are the ones who have a lot of supporters.  It's a very complicated situation.  But it's something you really have to keep in mind when analyzing tonight's results.  ""Thanks to our chief election bureau head for that.  When we come back from this commercial break, we'll take a look at the crucial undecided voters and wonder whether they will ever decide.  Also we'll talk with our senior Democratic analyst on the ground at Dean headquarters and our senior news correspondent standing with a random group of screaming girls.  Stay tuned to your news leader for comprehensive election coverage here in Caucus '04: Iowa Strikes First!"""

AH4BJED,male,25,"Tonight I went to the annual banquet for the law school drama society, where the graduating 3Ls all get ""toasted"" and people say nice things about them.  It's a nice thing to do, makes people feel good.  It goes on forever, but I think it's a good thing.  What struck me was a common theme.  People kept saying things like, ""You're so talented. I hope you don't waste too many years at a firm.""  Or ""You're such a great person.  I hope you end up doing something great. Something besides being a lawyer.""  It's all said so matter-of-factly.  Like of course being a lawyer is a horrible thing, and obviously it will be sad and tragic if this is your fate.  And then everyone goes off to his or her law firm jobs after graduation.  I don't quite understand this.  I understand why individual people think practicing law is not for them, and they want to do something else, but they've ended up here, and need to pay off loans, or need to support a family, or have no other passions, and so this is what they will do.  I understand this completely completely completely, on an individual level.  What I don't understand is how this works on an institutional level.  How the industry can survive and thrive when *everyone* feels like this is not where they should be, and *everyone* sees it as a bad thing to end up as a lawyer, yet everyone ends up at a firm, and new students come in every year, and it perpetuates itself.  Maybe the drama society is a self-selected group of people particularly not drawn to law practice.  But I don't completely think that's true -- I think it's true for some people, but for at least a substantial part, the mix of people in the drama society is not tremendously different from the mix in the rest of the law school.  No one here envisions themselves happy as a lawyer.  I don't know what they envisioned before coming to law school and whether what they've seen is different, or what the deal is exactly -- when people's feelings changed, and why it seems to be too late for anyone to do anything about it -- and even more important, why the industry hasn't changed to reflect this, or what can be done to change this -- or something.  This is not completely articulate, and I'm sure there's a logical flaw somewhere here.  But really -- people in law school are generally not happy.  I'm relatively happy, but it's because I like school and have found lots of fulfilling things that keep me busy and made a bunch of friends and maybe I'm really not relatively happy but just like to believe I am, I don't know -- but I just don't understand why if everyone else isn't happy, they're still here and doing things they think will make them continue to be unhappy in the future.  This is vague.  And I shouldn't write weblog posts at 1:45 in the morning.  Time for sleep."
AH4BJED,male,25,"Because the author is trying to do two things at once -- share his own experiences and provide universal advice -- I think he overstates how widespread his experiences are.  He's really skeptical of professors writing recommendation letters in time for deadlines, and I'm not sure that's a universal problem.  He recommends Kaplan test prep because it worked for him.  He talks about studying at a level he never had to before.  He talks about his summer law firm treating him impersonally.  He talks about the frustrations with course registration and with who Cornell gaves tenure too.  All things that may not apply to everyone, everywhere.  No question, there are also some great parts of the book -- a crisp, clear description of gunners, of the Socratic method and its plusses and minuses, of how to judge a summer experience, of what's involved in Law Review, of how worried people get about the bar exam.  And some of his stories are interesting -- about cheating on exams, about dating at law school, parts of his description of journal elections.  If you're going to Cornell, I'd say this is probably a must-read.  You'll get a lot out of it.  If you're not going to Cornell, I'd say there's nothing wrong with this book -- it's certainly comprehensive, it's not a bad read, it's got some advice... although, I honestly liked Law School Confidential better.  Because it incorporated lots of people's experiences, it didn't get bogged down in the idiosyncracies of one person's life, and I also thought its advice was clearer, better, and more universal.  If you're reading law school weblogs, you're probably going to read both of the books anyway, regardless of what I say.    Take his experiences for what they are -- I don't think they're as universal as he paints them.  And don't let the book scare you into not doing as many activities as you think you'd like to, and as you think will make you happy.  And get more than 4-5 hours of sleep a night, Really.  Okay -- how you can get my extra copy.  I want to make this fair and not just give it to someone I know -- because I can just let them borrow the copy I get to keep if I know them.  So I'll give this until end of day Monday so as not to disadvantage people who only surf the web during the week.  Send me an  urlLink e-mail  telling me you want the book.  If anyone has a reason that's really super-compelling, I'll give them the book.  If not, I'll put all the names into a hat and pick one.  You pay nothing -- I'll spring for shipping, whatever it is.  Hope this was useful."

AH4BJED,male,25,"[A fictional study group tale that was supposed to actually make sense, but just sort of degenerated into pointlessness.  I'll have some actual words about study groups tomorrow, once I get this train of thought out of my system]  October 15, 2002  Dear Diary,  I can't believe it!  One of the cool kids asked me to join his study group!  I mean, it's not that I'm not cool.  Especially here.  Where nobody's cool.  But in law school, like everywhere, there are the cool kids, and there are the not-that-cool kids.  And it just sort of falls into place like that.  I don't know if the cool kids here were cool before, or nobody here was cool before and they're just the coolest of the uncool.  But anyway, it just seems to happen that one group of kids is cool, and the rest aren't.  And everybody knows.  But maybe I'm doing something right (or wrong, as the case may be) because there it was -- right below the e-mail about the resume workshop and above the e-mail about the overdue library book.  The e-mail from the cool kid about joining his study group.  Maybe it's that new shirt I bought last week.  Or the new deodorant scent (switched from ""Mountain Fresh"" to ""Valley Clean"").  Or the twenty-five page outline I've already made that I happened to mention in conversation yesterday.  No, it can't be the outline.  It must be the new shirt.  But boy am I excited.  Because it's not just the cool kid who invited me -- the study group is filled with cool kids.  There's the kid who only shows up to class on Wednesdays, ""just because.""  Now what could be cooler than that?  There's the kid who's always wearing the hat.  Hats are super-cool.  And there's the kid who's going out with the professor.  The married professor.  The married professor with the wrinkles and the cane.  Now that's unbelievably cool.  And it's the three of them, and me.  So I must be cool too.  Or at least cool by association.  Maybe we'll all go do cool stuff besides studying.  Like go get ice cream.  Or hang out on a street corner without any real purpose.  Or swipe study guides from the law school bookstore.  Or graffiti the dorm building.  I can't wait for our first meeting tomorrow at midnight.  Midnight.  I guess that's when cool people do their schoolwork.  October 17, 2002  Dear Diary,  I'm pretty tired.  Only three hours of sleep.  And my left arm is sore from the punching.  They called it my ""initiation,"" but if I didn't know better, I'd say they just wanted to beat me up.  Study group is nothing like I imagined.  So I got to the bar at midnight -- we met in a bar -- with my laptop, my outlines, and this great study guide I fashioned out of a roll of masking tape, three copies of Black's Law Dictionary, and some magic fairy dust.  And the cool kids were late.  Two of them showed up at about 12:30, kind of drunk, and looking like they'd been doing something naughty.  I think one of them mentioned they carjacked an elderly man on the way over, just for kicks, but I'm not totally sure.  They might have just been talking about one of the cases we're reading.  The third guy -- the coolest one -- didn't show up at all.  But I'm sure he had a good reason.  Anyway, they didn't come as prepared as I did.  They accidentally left their books at home.  And their outlines were lost, they said.  But I'm sure they'll send me a copy as soon as they find them.  So first they took my study guide.  We've decided to all share materials -- apparently that's what the good study groups do.  Whatever one person makes, he has to give to everybody.  But that's okay, because they're all really cool about it.  I'm sure they would never make an outline and not share it with me.  Unless they decided I wasn't cool enough.  Anyway, then they said they had to initiate me into the study group.  They took turns spitting on me and punching me in the arm.  I guess this is what cool people do.  And then they stole my pants.  They're such cool guys.  We're meeting tomorrow to talk about Contracts.  Not until three in the morning, though.  October 19, 2002  The study group split up.  Apparently I wasn't cool enough for them.  We met yesterday, but only Jimmy showed up.  He asked me if I wanted to hang out a little first, before we started studying.  Of course I said yes.  He asked if I could drive ""getaway.""  It was pretty cool.  Jimmy has an awesome car.  A Lexus SUV.  So we drove to the bank, and I waited outside.  Jimmy came back a few minutes with a big bag.  He told me to ""step on it.""  But it turned out he meant the gas pedal, not the bag.  Oops.  And then he punched me a few more times and stole my laptop.  I think my next study group is going to be with the uncool kids."

We've decided to experiment with the idea of a ""symposium"" -- we invited some of our favorite legal bloggers -- professors and practitioners -- to contribute pieces regarding their perspectives on legal education, a topic we thought would be of interest to most of our potential readers.  What's cool about the legal blogosphere is that there are students, there are professors, and there are practitioners -- who in ""real life"" probably wouldn't have the opportunity to engage in too many conversations on relatively equal footing, yet we link to each other, we respond to each other's posts, there's a dialogue already across lots of legal weblogs.  We're hoping that our symposium can organize and foster even more dialogue, and bring a bunch of people's thoughts together and begin what could end up being an interesting conversation.  This might be a failed experiment.  It just may not spark that much interest.  That's fair.  I don't know if people really care to read a bunch of essays about the value of legal education, and whether what we've put together really will start a conversation or just pass in the night unnoticed, like some of my less successful attempts to be funny.  But we thought it was worth a shot, and maybe we've stumbled onto something that has a waiting audience.  Maybe not.  It's cool either way.  In any event,  urlLink check it out .

AH4BJED,male,25,"Every time I'm home on a break, there's always a little something new to see.  When I came home for winter break, we had a new back porch.  Last summer, we got a DVD player for the first time.  And last spring I discovered that my mom had bought new toilet seats for the upstairs and downstairs bathrooms.  This time, it's TiVo.  Well, almost TiVo.  They switched from Cablevision to DirectTV, because it's cheaper, and DirectTV came with a TiVo-like digital video recording system, and even the TiVo remote control that the New York Times lauded a few months ago in an article I'd link to if it wasn't too far in the archives to make it cost money (but you can find it on Lexis for sure).  I like TiVo (and I'm going to call it TiVo instead of DirectTV, because that's who makes it and it's really what it is), but I thought I'd like it more.  I have some friends who have it, and love it.  I'm intrigued by the ability to pause live television, and then come back and watch it about 10 minutes behind so you can fast forward through all of the commercials.  The ability to record a ""season pass"" of every new episode of a program is cool.  The ease of use, to set up recording, or to play something back, is fine -- although I'm okay with programming a normal VCR, so this isn't really doing all that much for me.  And, as the Times promised, the remote control is nicely contoured and easy to use (although the TV-power-on button is really hard to find if you don't know where it is, and flummoxed me for a good three or four minutes).  What I expect is sort of cool is the TiVo recommendations, where it gives you programs based on what you've already recorded.  My mom turned that feature off because it was giving her stuff in Spanish for no reason she could come up with.  But I've turned it back on while I'm home, because I'm curious what it will give me, now that I've recorded The Apprentice, a ""freeview"" concert on the ""music choice"" channel, and a few episodes of a show I read about on the Sundance Channel called Tanner '88, a fictional behind-the-scenes ""documentary"" of a presidential campaign, that initially ran on HBO in 1988 and is written by Garry Trudeau (Doonesbury) and directed by Robert Altman (famous movies I can't name).  They had 4 episodes back-to-back (-to-back-to-back) on yesterday and I recorded them.  I've watched one and it was okay, but didn't compel me to immediately watch the rest, although I'm sure I'll get to them before the week is through.  But it strikes me that there's nothing *bad* about TiVo -- they've done a very good job creating a set of features no one can really dislike.  It's not like a computer, where you have to learn stuff and buy stuff and plug stuff in, and do all sorts of time-intensive activities at the start that can make it prohibitively painful to start -- although obviously computers have enough benefits that many, many, many people have decided it's worth the initial investment to become able to use one.  But TiVo presents none of those problems, and although the upside isn't like what you can get out of a computer, it's reasonably cool.  So I expect this will become standard stuff pretty soon.  Man, this post isn't funny at all except for the gratuitous toilet mention up top.  Oh well, yesterday's was hopefully funny, and maybe something later."
AH4BJED,male,25,"I was getting worried because I couldn't think of a newspaper column idea for next week -- but then they told me that next week there's no newspaper.  So I'm off the hook.  But the reason why there's no newspaper gave me a good idea for a column.  Ah, the conundrum of it all.  Anyway, the reason there's no paper is because it's ""flyout week,"" when the 2Ls go to callback interviews around the country for their law firm jobs for the summer.  By ""around the country"" I mean New York and DC.  Because those are the only places anyone gets jobs."

AH4BJED,male,25,"urlLink Waddling Thunder  responds to my post about LSAT prep courses being a waste of time and money (you'll have to scroll down a bit).  Says he skipped a logic game and things turned out fine.  I'm a bit impressed, actually, because it probably means he got most everything else right, since he got into Harvard.  But just because there's a data point against it won't get me to give up my point so easily -- I still think it's generally unwise to rely on a strategy that involves your skipping a handful of questions, thus ensuring no points for them.  And that it's reasonable to say that strategies that encourage going into the exam planning to skip chunks of the exam are strategies generally designed not for people scoring at the higher end of the scale.  That said, if Waddling Thunder did in fact go into the exam with the intention of skipping a logic game, my question would be whether that strategy was formed after taking a bunch of practice tests and figuring out that, for him, it was the right strategy, or whether he took a prep course and blindly accepted their test-taking methods.  The former seems perfectly sensible.  The latter seems less so.  Not a real powerful or revolutionary point I'm trying to make here, just warning that if you want to score a 180, or something close, the market-leading test prep courses may not be the right way to go to help you get there."

AH4BJED,male,25,"""The Standard First Day of Class Speech,"" Take 2  I posted something a few days ago called ""The Standard First Day of Class Speech.""  I've done a rewrite.  So some of this will look familiar; it's not that I've forgotten I posted it, or anything like that.  ""The First Day of Class""  I'm Professor Lawreviewandsupremecourtclerkship, and this is Space Law.  Welcome.  If you're not signed up for this course, see me after class and I'll put your name on a sheet of paper I will intend to bring to the registrar, but instead will accidentally drop down the sewer grate, forget all about it, and you won't know anything until the end of the semester when you don't get a grade for the class and it's too late to do anything about it.  If you're on the wait list, keep waiting.  If your schedule doesn't say Space Law, and you're expecting a different class, you may be in the wrong room, here at the wrong time, or a combination of the two.  I really can't be sure.  What I want to do this morning is get all of the procedural stuff out of the way, talk about how the class will operate and what you can expect.  Then I want to jump right into the first assignment, which I'm sure you've all read even though the bookstore hasn't ordered the casebooks yet.  As far as seating goes, I notice you've filled the room starting from the back, meaning that there's not a seat free in the back two rows, yet the first seven rows have just two people in them.  One is the guy who came in late; the other is the guy who came in first.  If I had a backbone, I'd tell everyone to move down and fill the bottom few rows; instead, I'll just act like I don't notice, and wander aimlessly around the room while I teach, up the aisle, down the aisle, trying to find a spot where you can all actually see me, I can hear you when you speak, and I don't look like I'm just teaching to the two people up front.  I'll expect everyone to be prepared for every class.  To that end, I will assign a panel each day who will be the only ones called on, and the only ones for whom I will actually know if you did the reading.  This will help me ensure that everyone does the reading.  At least once during the semester.  I'll assign you to panels based on whether or not you volunteer; people who do not volunteer will very likely find themselves not on a panel.  This will not affect your grade.  There are some topics that are particularly dense, that I'll just have to speed through at a pace unlikely to make any of you learn them.  This will accomplish nothing, but I'll talk for an hour about them anyway.  Other topics are less doctrinal and more public policy-oriented. For those, I'll bring in my new mp3 player and open up the floor for discussion while I check out the new John Mayer album. Since you won't be graded on your class participation, and, heck, hardly even on your final exams, there's no real need for me to listen to anything you have to say anyway. There are a few topics that are so dismal that I will cancel class at the last minute and expect you to learn them on your own. I may test on them.  It depends on whether or not the professor I steal the test from tested on them.  Attendance in class is mandatory unless you're not here, in which case it's optional.  Please don't e-mail me regarding an expected absence from class.  I have no reason to care.  The final exam will be hard, and hardly read.  Your grade will be based exclusively on the ratio of consonants to vowels in your last name.  A few times during the semester, I will print out a new syllabus that is identical to the old one, but I will insist there's something different about it.  On the occasions that I do make a change in the syllabus, I will not tell you and will not print out any copies for you.  Occasionally I will provide handouts in class. For these, I will make approximately three-quarters of the number of copies I need, and usually touch them while they're still hot so the ink smears.  I plan on using the overhead projector a bit, but I will make sure not to plug it in so that I can spend 20 minutes at the beginning of class futzing around with it. On the rare occasion I have a video to show, there is no reason to expect I will actually get it to play, and even if I can there's no possible chance it'll be the right video.  More likely than not, it will be a video of my wife and me in a compromising position.  In the alternative, it may be a video of me and one of your classmates in a similar position.  The casebook for the class is ""Space Law."" I wrote it three years ago and it's now in its fifteenth edition. Every three weeks, a new edition will come out and you will have to buy a new copy.  This is required.  I'll be assigning random pages throughout it during the course of the semester, usually corresponding to nothing in particular and occasionally pages that haven't yet been written. Version 8 of the syllabus, which you should all have, goes into more detail.  There is a paper requirement for the course that I will not enforce.  There will also be a five-minute break in the middle of class whenever I'm bored and want to run back to my office and take another anti-depressant before continuing.  There's a sign-up sheet outside my office for anyone who wants to go to lunch with me.  I can't imagine why you would.  I'm available for third-year paper advising.  My wife just left me.  See you tomorrow."

AH4BJED,male,25,"First day of classes!  8:30 AM: Contracts.  The professor walks in, and immediately starts asking questions and calling on people off her seating chart.  Question!  Bam!  Question!  Bam!  Question!  Bam!  She was sharp, she was really sharp.  She should teach a ""how to keep students awake"" seminar to undergraduate professors.  Because no one was even thinking about anything besides contracts in that class.  It was like being on a quiz show, sort of, with 80 other people and no one knowing when it was going to be his or her turn, or what the subject of the question was going to be.  So it kept everyone, uh, on our toes.  But no disasters.  She got to probably 60 of the 80 people in the class with at least one question or another, and everyone's so concerned they'll be called on that no one remembers at the end who gave a good answer, who gave a bad answer, who did what.  It all just blends into an hour and a half long adrenaline rush.  They should conduct kindergarten the same way:  Lights up on a kindergarten classroom.  Maybe a dozen students all over the floor.  No teacher yet.  Students are drawing with crayons, playing with toys, whatever.  A teacher walks on, a little overdressed for the occasion.  She puts down her briefcase and pulls out some cards with big colored shapes on it.  She holds up a card with a blue triangle and points to one girl.  She talks fast.  the kids don't.  TEACHER: Ms. Smith, what color is this? (No response) TEACHER: Ms. Smith -- Sally -- what color is this? SALLY SMITH: Uh... TEACHER: Can anyone help out Ms. Smith? (One boy raises his hand) TEACHER: Mr. Johnson. BILLY JOHNSON: Blue. TEACHER: What shade of blue? BILLY JOHNSON: Huh? TEACHER:  You said blue.  I said what shade of blue? BILLY JOHNSON: Dark blue. TEACHER: Dark blue.  Okay.  How do we know it's dark? (No response) TEACHER: Ms. Rogers. BECKY ROGERS: What? TEACHER: How do we know it's dark? BECKY ROGERS: Dark blue? TEACHER: Yes, Mr. Johnson said that already.  It's dark blue.  How do we know? BECKY ROGERS: It looks dark. TEACHER: It LOOKS dark.  Okay.  How do you know? BECKY ROGERS: What? TEACHER: How do you know it looks dark to me?  Maybe it just looks dark to you.  How do you know?   BECKY ROGERS: I have to go to the bathroom. TEACHER: How do you know? (Billy Johnson raises his hand) TEACHER: Mr. Johnson. BILLY JOHNSON: It's dripping out of her skirt. TEACHER: Very good.  A fact.  Urine is dripping out of Ms. Rogers' skirt.  OBjective, not SUBjective.  Now what if it wasn't urine?  What if it was realy apple juice?  Mr. Sanchez? JOEY SANCHEZ: People don't pee apple juice. TEACHER: People don't pee apple juice.  All people? JOEY SANCHEZ: Yes. TEACHER: What about people you haven't met yet?  How do you know they don't pee apple juice?  What if some people did pee apple juice? JOEY SANCHEZ: Then they could go where people are starving and give them something to drink. TEACHER:  Interesting.  Now we're moving towards policy.  From facts to policy.  Very nice, Mr. Sanchez.  But back to the issue at hand.  Before Ms. Rogers peed on the floor, she said she knew this was dark blue because she saw it.  Is that compelling evidence?  What do you think, Ms. Jackson? (SARA JACKSON shrugs her shoulders.)  TEACHER: Use your words, Ms. Jackson.  Think back to the reading last night.  Is that compelling evidence? SARA JACKSON: See Spot run? TEACHER: No, we'll get to The State v. Spot in tomorrow's class.  Today we're focusing on the dark blue triangle.  Anyone know how we can prove this triangle is really the color that Mr. Johnson and Ms. Rogers are insisting it is? Mr. Phillips, if you could put the dump truck down for a moment and join us? DAVEY PHILLIPS: It's dark blue because we all think it's dark blue. TEACHER: Cultural convention. Interesting.  Now who can tell me about promissory estoppel and the interstate commerce clause?

AH4BJED,male,25,"This is post #1200.  The new Blogger interface tells me so.  Getting to round numbers are fun.  1200 is a big number.  And I've been doing this for not quite 2 years (a year and 10 months), so that's a little less than 2 posts a day on average, if my math is right.    Anyway.  Over at  urlLink NeoTokyoTimes , which is one of just -- counting in my head, give me a second -- 5 law-or-law-student blogs I check fairly regularly (bonus points to anyone who wants to guess the rest of the list; I'm defining fairly regularly as close-to-daily), there's a comment I find thought-provoking:   More and more I'm beginning to believe that my tendency to play social butterfly has too often left me in the lurch when people who decide to do things invite only their ""primary friends"" of which I am not considered. People don't believe that I consider all of my friends ""primary friends,"" and that they must think that they're considered by me as ""secondary friends."" I suppose their assessment is probably correct. More than ten ""primary friends"" probably means that they're actually all secondaries. This is phenomenally sad. I have nothing tremendously substantive to say in response, but it got my attention because we don't usually get to know how other people think about stuff like this.  And when I read ""social butterfly"" in the first line, the image I get -- and it's just because the term makes me think of the obnoxious phony people schmoozing at cocktail parties, trying to shake everyone's hand and figure out whether you can help their career, and if you can't you're useless and they're off to find another conversation -- is of someone who's collecting friends like trading cards, not necessarily of someone who cares about his depth of relationships, so it's interesting just to know how someone else thinks about this stuff.    For me -- and this may be revealing too much about what goes on inside my head, I suppose -- I have some of the same worries, but coming from the other direction -- just to use NeoTokyo's terminology because I don't have anything better -- I feel like I have pretty good intuition when I meet someone whether he or she is someone I'd want to be friends with, whether I think he or she is a good person, who I'd want to know.  But the relatively tentative, shy part of me isn't always sure how to translate that into actually becoming friends, and I think I tend to overthink stuff, trying to figure out how to ""convert"" the acquaintance into a friend, but also wanting to make sure I'm not wrongly thinking the other person would want to be friends with me.  (Of course, this is only magnified when I'm thinking about whether if I ask a girl on a date, I think she's actually interested or not -- I feel like I have good instincts as to whether I'll like somebody, even just after meeting them for a moment, but I don't feel like I trust my instincts at all about whether she likes me back and am usually pretty clueless... and I'm not sure how one gets better at that... but probably everyone feels the way I do, on some level, unless they're just so taken with themselves that they feel everyone must like them... which may not be terrible for the one who feels that way....)  These are some massive run-on sentences with all the dashes and ellipses.  Sorry about that.  And I think I'm revealing too much about the inner workings of my head.  Oh well.  I'll live."

AH4BJED,male,25,"Today I had computer training, which is about how it sounds.  Despite hopes for something disastrous and/or uproariously funny to happen, just to make the day more interesting, it was all pretty normal.

This, I'm sure, has nothing to do with the firm, but the elevators in the building have little screens that show news, weather, sports, etc while you're riding up or down.  It strikes me as a little bit sad.  Not that it's not nice to have something to read, but is 45 seconds in an elevator really too long to go without some sort of stimulus?  I don't mind 45 seconds of contemplation in the elevator, solitary thought or reflection... but apparently society doesn't have time for that anymoe and we need elevator entertainment.

Expanding on that theme, a brief rundown of all of the things I've been told will make the first year of law school a success (and, no, this is not going to be yet another comedy sketch disguised as a weblog entry):  Read the cases once. Read the cases twice. Don't read the cases. Re-read the cases before class.  Re-read the cases after class.  Re-read the cases during class.  Write briefs.  Brief in the book.  Keep your briefs short.  Make your briefs long. Don't rely on your briefs. Your briefs can be useful.  Take lots of notes. Don't take too many notes. Don't take any notes at all. Get outlines from upperclassmen. Write your own outlines.  Buy commercial outlines. Join a study group. Start a study group. Study groups are great. Study groups are useless. Join your group early and meet every week. Wait until the week before exams. Study in your room. Study in the library.  Study in the morning. Study at night. Study in the bathroom. Study with the TV on. Study in silence. Study in the dark. Study in your sleep. Don't study.  Grades don't matter. Grades are arbitrary. Grades are meaningless. Grades control your future. Raise your hand in class. Never raise your hand. Cut off your hand. Go to your professor's office hours. Have lunch with your professor. Shine your professor's shoes.  Do your professor's laundry. Ignore everything your professor says.  Read hornbooks. Read treatises. Read restatements of the law. Read the exam answers off your neighbor's screen.  Read quickly. Read slowly. Sleep a lot. Sleep a little. Binge. Purge. Starve. Pay your bills. Join activities. Don't join anything. Have fun. Do work. Make friends. Everyone's your enemy. Be prepared. Stop, drop and roll. Say no, go, and tell someone you trust. Only you can prevent forest fires. A watched pot never boils. One in the hand is worth two in the bush. Save your money. Save your soul. Read the cases. Read the exam carefully. Read your professor's mind. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. Set your alarm clock. Don't forget chapter three. The correct answer is (c). Save the whales.

AH4BJED,male,25,"Some thoughts about nighttime activities for law students:  We received a flyer in our mailboxes about a Harvard-MIT Valentine's Day matchmaking service.  I think it's safe to assume that this endeavor was probably MIT's idea.  The ninety-eight to two male-female ratio presumably does make it pretty difficult for MIT guys to get dates.  Of course, I'm absolutely sure that's the only thing standing in their way.  I went to the website to check out the questionnaire.  And, indeed, they're looking to match people up in terms of the most important qualities that two people need to share in order to be compatible:  1. My idea of the perfect Saturday night is: (a) studying at home; (b) studying in the library; (c) studying in the student lounge; (d) recharging my graphing calculator  2. My favorite computer programming language is: (a) Java; (b) Pascal; (c) Basic; (d) the one I used to program my last girlfriend  3. My career goal is: (a) to one day be a guest on ""Charlie Rose""; (b) to move to a secluded cabin in the mountains; (c) to grow a long and unkempt beard; (d) to get rid of the voices  4. My favorite movie is: (a) A Beautiful Mind; (b) All About Eigenvalues; (c) Quantum Mechanics Lecture Series Volume 5; (d) Quantum Mechanics Lecture Series Volume 4  5. My last kiss was with: (a) my mom; (b) my dog; (c) myself; (d) my roommate, but we were both drunk  6. My favorite fashion accessory is: (a) my brown glasses; (b) my green glasses; (c) my black glasses; (d) my glasses with the masking tape  I filled out my questionnaire and sent it back.  Twelve seconds later, I received an e-mail telling me that my top three most perfect matches are the woman who alphabetizes signed promissory notes in the financial aid office, the automated student organizations activity notifier (it's a real person; her first name is Jennifer), and Stephen Hawking.  However, I wasn't able to set up a date with any of them, because all of my nights are busy going to law firm receptions.  I find it ironic that some of them are held at the House of Blues.  Because what better way to describe a law firm than a ""House of Blues?""  Can't get much bluer than sitting in an office all day searching Westlaw.  ""Join us for cocktails and conversation.""  ""Cocktails first.  We need you as drunk as possible in order for us to have any chance to convince you that we're different from all of the other firms.""  If I could bring myself to pass up the reception for Sleepy, Grumpy, and Doc LLP, according to another e-mail, I could attend the Jewish Law Student Association's Board Games night, featuring Taboo and Pictionary.  The card set for Taboo: The Orthodox Edition (suitable for any religion, in fact - I'm trying for an equally-offensive punchline regardless of what you believe in) has twenty-one thousand cards, with such ""taboo"" activities as ""smiling,"" ""conversing with members of the opposite gender,"" and ""thinking marginally-dirty thoughts about undergarments.""  And Pictionary might be a challenge as well - how exactly can we draw a picture of God?  Especially with this one lousy crayon.  But the very best way to spend our nights is at none of these activities.  It's at the cafeteria, enjoying ""this afternoon's lunch at tonight's prices.""  I think that should be the dinnertime slogan.  Just like the slogan for the soup should be ""yesterday's side dishes, in last week's broth,"" the slogan for the calzones should be ""last week's leftovers in last month's extra pizza dough,"" and the slogan for breakfast at the cafeteria should be ""what on Earth are you thinking??""  MIT just sent me another e-mail.  Apparently my new ""most perfect match"" is Lara Croft, Tomb Raider."

I could go for an easy joke here, probably involving Michael Jackson; I could try something more ambitious, like fake profiles for a bunch of law student personality types (and, in fact, I'll probably try that later and see what happens); or I could make this one of those posts where I tell you actually how I feel about something and aren't necessarily trying to be funny but use the word ""peanut butter"" somewhere in there for a laugh.  Read the article; take a little nap; when you come back before the night is over there'll be something here, either trying to be funny or not, depending on how quickly the Robitussin I just took kicks in and stops my nose from running.  (There's also a really interesting article about  urlLink John Edwards  and behind-the scenes preparing for one of the Democratic debates.  I like this kind of stuff.  Once again, the NY Times Magazine stopping me from doing real work.  Cool."
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys...how was your day? Mine was ok...gettin better every day! Alrighty guys..i think i'm startin to show some progression on gettin over the whole bubba deal! It's just that..when i have absolutely nothing to do..he's on my mind..so, i tend to stay busy...b/c when i don't think about him...i don't miss him!..but, it's all good..i'm startin to get over him...which i'm really glad of! But, i think that i'm thinkin this other guy is cute..but, i haven't decided on that one yet..so, i dunno! Guys, it seems as if i'm losin all my friends! I dunno what it is..but like, all my friends are like..leavin me...but, yet, i'm gainin new friends left and right too!...so, i dunno...it's crazy! I dunno about the guy status right now..i think i might just lay low...but, yeh...that one guy is cute...and then, there's this other guy, who is cute..and who'se startin to talk to me more also...but, he's kind of talkin to somebody...so, i'll hafta see how that goes before anything happens! And, i think i might like an ex-boyfriend...AGAIN...gees..it's crazy! And i don't know that i wanna like him...i mean, i can't help it...it's just somethin that's like..attracting me to him...but, it's great....but yet, it's horrible...so, i dunno?! He's just soo..funny..and..i dunno..somethin about him gets me everytime....! Not too many people can get me..unless i've just come to like em...and bubba got me alot..and still does...and this guy does..sometimes..but, i haven't figured out how i feel about him, or anybody for that matter..yet! But, i guess i'm gone..bye bye...Love, Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! how's it goin? yeh..it's alright here too! haven't written in about a week! Well,nothin's really happened! Abbey came over..(love ya chik)...and then i went to her house...haha..we had a great time!   Guys..i don't know what to do! I had a friend say somethin about me, behind my back,and it hasn't been the same since! I haven't talked to him, since it happens, and it's hurtin. I want soo bad, for things to go back the way they were, but, i don't think things'll ever be the same between this person and i. My heart hurts, because i don't see how anyone, could clame to be your friend..and then talk about you, behind your back! They say they were kidding, but, it still hurts, and it doesn't make it right! I'm tryin the best i can, to not think about it, and just let it go..all of it...but, it's hard, and it's goin to take a while! And to be quite honest, i probbably won't ever get over it, but, i'm gonna try!   Well, there's one more thing! See, a while back, i went through a real hard time (for me) and, it was stupid..needless to say! And, i had a friend, (we'll call her sally) who would talk about this girl (we'll call her jackie)like she didn't even like her! I mean, sally would talk about jackie, and say stuff, like crazy! And, i'm not gonna lie, i said some stuff, but, it wasn't too bad, and it was mainly, more about the situation i was in..than jackie! Well, now, it seems as if sally & jackie are best friends, and also, sally is being so two-faced and is contradicting herself, on everything she says! She'll say something, and then turn right around, and talk to jackie and be like..oh, well, i doubt it'll happen! I just..had to get that off my chest, because it seems as if sally has changed, and we WERE best friends, but now it's like we don't even know each other and i just wanna say, who are you?    sorry guys, i had to talk about those two things, because it's real funny how things happen, when you honestly don't need them to, but, it's not a big deal! Things and people both change..sometimes for the better..sometimes not..it's life:you have to deal with it! But, i'm gone..bye!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! Omg...bubba came over last night! He's soo cute...but... shhh..don't tell him i said that! Newayz, yeh, he came over last night..and i was like....soo happy all night...well, except when he got me upset..and i almost cried..but, that's a different story! And it was just great...b/c i really really like bubba..and i just..can not even tell you how much i like him..it's like when ever i see him..i get weak in the knees..and my heart beats slower and faster at the same time!...it's like my heart just melts!...but, that's another SHHHH! Newayz..ok, well, my best friend...cato...is suupppper pissed at me..b/c i didn't tell him that i've liked bubba since 8th grade...and i didn't tell him..b/c i was tryin to make it where i didnt like bubba...b/c i just..didn't think that he would ever like me...and it's crazy..b/c cato's pissed at me..and i can't stand it when he's mad at me!...and then there's pickett over there who'se laughin at me likin bubba..and won't tell me why that's soo funny, so, yeh, now i'm pissed at jason too! newayz!! Well, i guess i'm gonna go drownd my sorrows in a bottle of vodka..haha..j/k i don't drink!...bye bye!.....Love, Lauren!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! Ok, well, that person that i didn't want to read my blog, read it, and now, she thinks that if she were to choose brandon, then, she would lose our friendship, and to be honest, she wouldn't. I mean, i don't like him, well, not anymore. And i mean, she can't help she likes him, but, it aggrivates me, because, like i said, we swore up and down that we would never do anything like this, or whatever, with one of our ex-boyfriends. And i mean, if i were to talk to one of her ex-boyfriends on the phone all the time, or go somewhere with him, or even act like i like him, she would be upset, and maybe even mad. She might not tell me, but, she would tell other people. And the thing is, i've asked some people, how they would feel about this whole ordeal, and they said that they would be soo mad, but, i'm not mad, i'm just...i dunno...dyin! I mean, i can't stop them from going out, and i can't stop them from liking each other. Alot of people have told me that they don't agree with what she's doin, b/c we're best friends, and i dunno.  I just flat out don't know anymore. I've talked to a teacher about everything, and she told me to tell kasi how i feel, but, i just can't. I don't know why, but, i just can't. And i know i'm holding back, but, that's the only thing i know to do b/c i know she's hurtin too....b/c she likes him, and she reads what i'm sayin and everything, but, then again, you know, the teacher i talked to, said, but, what about you, you've got to be happy too. And that hit me, b/c i do need to be happy, but, i would rather her be happy, even if it makes me hurt this much. I dont' know why in the world, it's hurtin me to see them like this, but, it does. My only guess that i feel this way, is because she's my best friend, and he's my ex-boyfriend. I just hope, that she doesn't think that i like him, i mean, i do have some feelings for him, but, then again, i have liked him since the 6th grade. IT'S SOOO CRAZY!!  newayz, on to another subject! I'm thinkin that i still like my ex-boyfriend from last year, alot, b/c he really and truly was everything i've ever hoped to look for in a guy. he was the guy that what my first true love. And, honestly, i would do anything, for him to feel the same about me, but, he doesn't; he doesn't even know i like him. He is talkin to a girl from another school, and honestly, i don't think would ever date me again. It's just sooo unfair that i'll probbably always love him, until i find the guy that can give me everything this guy did, and more. And i did find a guy who gave me that, but, my actions, and his words, were hurtful, and it didnt work out, and i wish soo much, that we were still goin out, but, we aren't,and he's not even lookin twice at me, but, i'm workin on getting over that, and i've almost got that down. But, i've tried and tried to get over the ex-boyfriend from last year, and i just can't seem to do it. I dont' know what it is about him, but, i just can't! But, i'll let ya know how it goes with everything! Bye bye, Love, Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! what's goin on? yeh, i just got back from georgia yesterday. I went for atlantafest with my youth group...it was awesome! We had the best time! It's like i'm a whole new person..b/c i'm choosing to let go of everything..and just not worry about things anymore...because it's a waste of time!...when things happen, they happen..and you can't change it, so, move on! well, that's all i've got to say for now..so, i'm gone..bye!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! how's it goin? umm..it's goin ok! I feel alot better..bout the whole bubba thing...and i think i'm basically over him...but, it's still a lil rough around the edges! And, i found out today, that the ex-boyfriend that i might like....said that he only went out with me..b/c of my ""body""...which i soo totally do not have! And, it hurt...bbbaaadddd... so, i dunno what i'm gonna do!..i mean, i think i might really like stephen alot..and honestly, i never quit likin him...but, theren't not a chance in the world that stephen would wanna go back out with me! But, it's handlin itself...maybe it'll handle itself right! But, i dunno what to do about him yet...he's just soo..complicating!...it's crazy!..and, i think i have a lil *CrUsH* on Brently Prestwood!...but, i dunno bout that one either...b/c i mean, i could like..meet him, and he be a total jerk or somethin...which i'm sure's not the case...but, you never know!....but, i think i'm just gonna go up and introduce myself to him....b/c..WE AIN'T NEVA SCAAAED...right baker?..hah..i love you girl!...you mean the world to me!..but, newayz...yeh, ima just march myself right up to him..and be like..i'm lauren..and stick my hand out for him to shake..and hopefully he'll go, i'm brentley..and we'll shake hands..and then, i guess i'll just be like..i'll see ya later B...heh..isn't that cute?..but, newayz...i guess i'm out....i'll tell you about anything that's happened..if anything happens later on today...bye bye..Love, Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey again guys! Listen, um, i just wanna know if all ya'll out there will pray for me, b/c right now, i'm goin through one of the hardest things in my life that i've ever had to go through, and it's literally killin me!, and i don't know how much more i can take of it! I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope that a person i know doesn't read this, b/c it'll come hard, but, i haven't said anything to anybody, except for one person, and i feel like i'm holdin it in, so, i have to do somethin! Ok, here goes: one of my best friends in the world, and i, have drifted apart, over a guy.  She knows it, and i know it, but, we just, do'nt talk about it.  It's over an ex-boyfriend, and that's what kills me. We've been best friends, for the past 3 years..this bein our 4th, and everyday, for those past 3 to 4 years, we've sworn up and down, how we would never do anything or go anywhere or whatever, with an ex boyfriend.  We swore how we wouldn't like them, how we could'nt like them, and that, we just, flat out, wouldn't do that.  Well, i went out with a guy last year, and my best friend, started likin him.  Well, that was fine, you know, i could handle that.  Well, then, i go out with a guy this year, and then we break up. Well, he comes over halloween night, with my two best friends and i, and then, later that night, he kisses me.  Well, honestly, i started to like him, again, and was goin to talk to him, about maybe gettin together again, but, that night, my best friend, starts text messagin him, and i know how she is.  Once she starts talkin to a guy for a lil while, she starts to like him, so, i was just like, well, nah, i dont' think i like him.  And honestly, we kissed, and i, do think, that, that should have told her that i liked him, and did have some PRETTY STRONG feelings for him, but, it didn't, i dont guess. And, we've talked about how i feel about him, and her and all, but, i just can't bring myself to tell her that i had, or may still have, these feelings for him.  I mean, now, it's like...neither one of them, have time for me anymore, and i know that sounds, conceited, but, one of them was my best girl friend, and the guy, well, we were workin on our friendship bein best friends, and now, it's like...BAM, it's gone. and, it hurts.  It hurts, to know that everysingle one of my other best girl friends, wouldn't dream of datin one of my ex-boyfriends, whom of which i've liked since 6th grade, but, yet, one does.  It hurts, to know that my best friend and i swore up and down to each other, that we wouldn't ever do anything like that, or like this, or anything with one of our ex-boyfriends, but yet, she does it. It seems like i'm always the one getting shorted, but, yet, i always hold up my end of the bargain.  And, i'm sick of it.  She did it with another ex-boyfriend of mine, and now, she's doin it again. I find it highly funny, how she just switches over from one of my ex-boyfriends, to the other one.  And, i guess, it just aggrivates me, but, i dunno. But, that's all i had to get off my chest for now, bye bye, Love, Lauren"

YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! Alrighty, well, i found out today, that kasi and brandon are goin out! Yeh, i'm pissed....b/c she knew good and well, that it upset me that her and brandon were talkin in the first place! But, i guess people now days, weren't like people before! I mean, people used to be sincere, and when they'd been friends with somebody for almost 4 yrs, and they'd promise never to go out with or do whatever with ex-boyfriends, they meant it, and they wouldn't! But, people now days, are different! And the thing is....i've got people who i thought were my best friends, doin this crap...i've got people goin off on me, b/c i'm upset! I mean dagum, every single person i've talked to about it, said that they would be pissed! I mean, i'm not gonna lie about it...i am suuper madd! I mean, i do not like him, in any way, but, it's the fact that she was my best friend, and he's an ex-boyfriend, and yes, i realize that it's EX...but, it's the fact that that's like an unwritten rule....best freinds just aren't supposed to date ex-boyfriends...and yeh, last year, i did it to kasi, but, kasi said that we swore we'd never date the ex-boyfriend if we had feelins for him, or if we just, were upset by it or whatever, and last year, kasi said that it was ok, and that she didn't like the guy i dated. Well, she brings it up, and she told me that it was fine...and that she didn't like him, so, i dated him, but, then again, we did only date for like a week! I just don't see how she could do this! She says that she doesn't want me to be mad at her...but, yet, she does this! And, i mean, it's like...she crossed over into territory, that shouldn't ever be crossed by best friends! So, by her doin this..i'm guessin i do need a new best friend, b/c we're no longer best friends! I guess i'm lookin for a new best friend?...but, i gotta go now, bye bye! Love, Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! How's it goin?..yeh..goin pretty good here too! Well, nothin's really happened since i've last written..but, i did try out for flag!..i guess i did ok..but, anyways! Ok, well...time to update from the last write! Um, i don't think i like the guy...because..he's just...not me anymore! And that's that!..and the fact that he has a girlfriend..and doesn't like me! Haha..yeh..that's great! But, anyways! I don't really guess there's another guy out there right now! OMG..guys! my guy friend from florida (i love ya babe) scared the mess out of me! He was talkin about somethin..that i've never heard him talk about before..and i just..worry about him sometimes! But, i love him!!...yeh..dont wanna talk about him too long! So, that's all i gotta say..so, i'm gone!..bye!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys!....Ok, kasi, i don't know what the heck you're problem is, but for you to tell me that, is completely rude. I would never even THINK about sayin the stuff, that you said to me, to you! And the whole deal with the russ thing...umm, you told me to go for him, and you told me that you didn't like him! And yes, i did tell you that i didn't like Brandon, and i don't!...and i did tell you to go for him, but, then, the truth came out, and you found out that i didn't want you to date him! And with the whole rusty and allison thing...there was nothin between me and rusty! I talked to him one night....AT CHURCH.....b/c i had hardly nobody else to talk to! And for the record, i never said that you couldn't talk to brandon as friends, but, i just said that it upset me that you would like..go to the  movies and go places and everything with him!....and it bein behind my back...at that! And hypocrite?....omg kasi....you're the one bein the hypocrite! Who'se the one that swore that she'd never date an ex-boyfriend?...yeh,that was you....and i just don't get, why you wanna go back on your word? And for you to tell me that i'm just tryin to get attention...c'mon kasi...who'se the one tryin to get attention now?...kasi, i came to you Tuesday on the computer and said that i was sorry for everything, and that i was tryin to get over it, and all, and then, i get back on Thursday, and i've got  you yellin at me, i've got christine yellin at me, and then you just bust out that you're datin brandon! If that's not wantin attention i don't know what is! And you're sittin here tellin me how everybody is sayin how you should be mad at me?..well, everybody that i've talked to, says that you shouldn't be mad at me, and that you shouldn't be doin what you're doin! I've talked to ppl in upper grades about it, and they said that they can't believe you're doin what you're doin...i've talked to ppl in college, and then, i've also talked to some adults! And i've only had one person tell me that maybe i shouldn't be as upset as i am....but, they still told me that you should'nt be doin it! And, i've had a couple of people tell me that they think that brandon is only datin you to get back at me...but, you know, i dunno! And for you to sit there and tell me, that i'm used to gettin all the guys, and bein lil miss thing...and for once i'm not...honey, lemme tell you somethin, you know good and well, that i don't think that! You know that i don't think i could get all the guys...you know this kasi massey, but yet, you choose to sit there, and write hurtful things..b/c you feel threatened! That's the only reason i can get that you would still be writin crap like this..after i apologized, for somethin i don't even need to be apologizin for! You, obviously, feel threatened by me!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"I want someone to hold me in their arms, and tell me I'm beautiful...Just to make me feel good, because I know I'm not! I want to feel special, I want someone to give me hugs for no reason....Someone to hold my hand and make my heart go crazy, someone who won't get tired of me (because I seem to be doing that a lot lately)! I just want someone who wants to talk to me and who wants to always be with me....I just want to be with that someone!    so what's new? Yeh, alot here too! the friend i wrote about last..is doin ok, i guess! He says he's doin ok, but, i don't believe him..for some reason! I guess i can just see the way he is...compared to way he used to be,and it's different..but, not drastically! I really hope he realizes that he's such a great guy, and that he deserves somebody who sees how great he is!   I'm having soo many mixed emotions right now, it's stupid! I like this one guy..but, there's this other guy, whom when i'm around, drives me crazy! I love being around him, and always want to be around him, but, it gets a little twisted! I can't explain it, because i don't want people to know, but, i feel like such crap! It seems that whenever something good happens, something bad happens, but, is kind of good, if that made any sense! I'm between a rock and a hard place, because i don't know what to do! I don't want to hurt anybody, but, i have to do what feels right...but, right now, i don't know what that is! but, it'll all come together, so, i'm goin to try not to worry about it!   -Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! How's it goin? yeh, it's just ok here too! Well, i was at stephen's house last night...it was barbara, will, blake, vanessa, cameron, destin, stephen, and me! We just like...sat by a fire, watched movies, played games...and watched some ppl get mad at each other..yeh, i mean, it was pretty funn! Well, the whole stephen thing is  out! Like i've been tryin to tell ya'll all along..he doesn't like me...and i could have told ya'll that from the beginning, but, it just took me this long..to actually realize it! And when i found out, gees, i was like..soo upset...i almost started cryin..but, hey, that's life..right?..life's got it's ups and downs!..you just gotta learn to deal with em! So, it's over...i'll hafta quit thinkin about him, i'll hafta quit meltin when i see his face...and i'll hafta quit thinkin that maybe there's that lil chance that we could actually get back together! It's really over, i'll hafta quit thinkin that maybe he likes me...and i'll move on! It's gonna be hard, i'm not gonna lie to you, it is goin to be very hard, but, i'll manage..i always do! I don't know how long it'll take me...but, i'll hafta do it!...there's no way in gettin around this one!...Gees, the ONE guy i have to go after...i can't get...and it's killin me!

Gees,i don't know how that would hit me...i know it'd hit me hard...but, i don't know how i would take it! I mean, I like him soo much...and i know there are other guys out there..that like me...but, i just..don't think of them the way i think of stephen! Like, i mean, i think of stephen, somebody who i would take, and introduce to my grandfather! And, i've never felt soo strongly enough about somebody to introduce to my grandfather! I hold my grandfather, very close to my heart, and if he doesn't aprove of a guy, i just...basically don't see him anymore...i would tell a guy, that i could date him, or whatever..if my grandfather didn't aprove! And i know ya'll are like..well, what if you really like him?..but, i'm sorry, if my grandfather doesn't like a boyfriend..then, i don't date em...and if my grandfater doesn't like somebody...then, i don't like em! If Stephen and i do go out, i honestly can sit here and tell you, that i would take him to my grandfater, and introduce him to my grandfather, which, is different for me, b/c i've NEVER introduced my grandfather to a boyfriend! NEVER! And i'm scared, b/c if i do introduce stephen to my grandfather, if he doesn't like him, i'll be heart-broken...and i don't know what i would do!

Alrighty, i've decided that Stephen's the only guy i like,and the guy i wanna go out with!, but, the problem is...getting him...b/c i'm pretty sure that he doesn't wanna date me:(..which sucks a big one!!...But, on the other hand, i do think that jonathan and brentley are cute, but, i mean, who doesn't..and that's all i think, is that they're cute..I DON'T LIKE THEM...i just think that they're cuties! But, newayz...yeh, i think that jonci and some other ppl might come and stay the night tomorrow night..and we're gonna roll left side's house..haha..it's gonna be great..b/c he thinks that i'm not gonna do it..so, yeh, i'm excited! Guys, i can not tell ya'll, how much i like stephen..i mean, i've never stopped likin him, since we were goin out! I mean, i liked bubba alot there for a lil while..and it was killin me, b/c i liked stephen just as much too...and i just..never told nebody..but, chacha over there could always tell ;)..girl, i love you soo much!....and it's just crazy...b/c knowin that you like somebody soo much, and then, you knowin that they won't give you the time of day...it sucks..big time!! But, it's like..whenever i'm in a crowded room..i look over..and i always tend to look where he is!..i don't know why..but, everytime i look over at him...and i just...wish we were goin back out!...like, today, i looked over at him, and then, he looked at me..and we were standin there..for about 5 seconds..lookin at each other...and then somebody's stupid tail had to pull my backpack..and loose that *LiL mOmEnT*..but, it's all good..we have alot of em..nah, not really..haha but, newayz!!

Yeh, ok, well, he busted out that he had been thinkin about it..and he didn't think that we would work out..yeh, so, that's got me upset...b/c ever since brandon and i have broken up (except stephen)..it's like i'll like a guy..and i'll go for him..but,when i finally have him hooked..it's like..i don't like him anymore!..and with cameron..i was fully able to like him!..i dunno if any of this is makin sense..but, whatever! ..i mean..i know his feelins are his feelins..but, he could've told me from the get-go instead of bein all like, yeh, i like you..and gettin me into it..but, it's all good! I'll move on..hopefully...i always do! But, newayz..onto Justin! See, justin's a sweetie!...and i love talkin to him and all..but, he's just soo dagum stuck on this nicole chick!..i mean..gees!

He still talks about her, he still thinks about her..he still text messages her..he still calls her!..i mean..c'mon...there's just some things that come with commen sense!

I mean, his ex-chick is like..crawlin back to him..and he's basically takin her back!...he says that he's tellin her that he doesn't want her back and all..but, i don't believe it! He's better off without her..honestly, but, i don't think he's strong enough, emotionally, to see that! He needs to get out there..and see that there are soo many girls out there.that would be so lucky as to have justin for a boyfriend! He's truly a great person!..and he deserves somebody better than his ex-chik!...but, who am i to tell him who he needs to date and who he doesn't need to date?..nobody!..But, newayz...alrighty..i'm gone..but, i'll keep you in the know..WAIT...OMG..ME AND CATO GOT THINGS WORKED OUT!!..i am soo glad!

I went to movies, i went shoppin, i did a lil bit of everything i guess! but, it's really good to be back! Well, the whole stephen thing, is goin nowhere!...i mean, i don't think he likes me..and i mean, i know that should'nt stand in my way of likin somebody...but, why like somebody...who you don't even have a chance with? I know i tell everybody not to give up, and just go for it, but, stephen's known that i've liked him....forever...and he knows that i've liked him even after we broke up...and, he hasn't done anything..and i've flirted like crazy..so, i'm guessin this is it? I mean, one minute, i'm soo close to askin him out, but, the next, it's like...what am i doin? I like him soo much, but, it hurts...big time, to like somebody soo much, and know that you don't have a chance in the world..with them again! And now, it's like..i'm the one left thinkin of him, and he's not even lookin at me!:  I woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been tryin' my best to get along But that's OK There's nothing left to say, but  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been So  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you  And on with my life  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and all your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah  And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday  *You'll think of me* :::Keith Urban::: Well, this is it guys, i guess, i'll hafta, get over stephen, and get back out there in the game!

Kasi and i...got things i guess, sort of worked out! I mean, i just, couldn't argue with her nemore! I can't argue with anybody right now! My self esteem and everything, is soo low right now, and i don't know how to boost it up. I mean, it's crazy! Well, wednesday, i went to my g-mas's house...and i forgot how much i love it up there! I'm goin to start goin  up there more! It's soo awesome! I mean, i can't even begin to tell you, how much, i love it. I mean, i while back, i was all hatin to go up there and stuff, but, now, i mean, it's like, that's the perfect place to go, when i need my mind cleared! My g-parents don't ask questions..they just comfort!..and it's great! But, the ex-boyfriend that i mentioned a while back, is a HUGE jerk. And i can NOT stand likin him as much as i do, b/c he's soo cocky...and i dunno why! I mean, he just needs to get the snot beat out of him by a girl! OOO you know how he was talkin to a girl from another school?...alrighty, well, the reason he hasn't asked her out...is b/c she told him no, the first time he asked her out, and then, i guess not too long ago, she told him that she didn't want a boyfriend....but, they could still talk or whatever!..haha...i was like..ok, well, why would you lie to somebody about it?...that's just stupid to me! but, whatever floats your boat! Guys, i'm still havin a really hard time....dealin with the whole brandon and kasi thing. I mean, i know she says that they're just friends, but, i mean...he's an ex-boyfriend, and she's a ""best friend""...and somebody brought it to my attention that if she knows how i feel about this...about it upsettin me and all....and she still hasn't told him that they can't...whatever....then, maybe...she's not the best friend i thought she was?!...but, i dunno...i just want it all to stop...i want everything to stop!....but, maybe she isn't the best friend i thought she was?...b/c, she did go to the movies with him...behind my back...with no intention on tellin me...and best friends would't do that! so, maybe this person was right, by tellin me that i might need a new best friend?..i dunno....pray for me!..bye bye!

So, i'm askin stephen out!...and then, she showed me this: ..I wanna be the girl that he goes to bed thinking about,the one thought that never leaves his mind.The girl hes never had these type of feelings for,and even if he marries someone else, I wanna be that girl that he tells his kids about, and be known as ""the one that got away""I want to be THAT girl he can't get over..! Guys, i wanna be this girl...to stephen! I don't know why i'm likin him soo much, but,i am, and i'm not just gonna sit here and let him pass me by!

YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! How's it goin? yeh, it's just goin ok here too! Well, last night, my dad and i went to sonic, and to blockbuster, and then came home and watched Leage of Extraordinary Gentleman, and my dad fell asleep about in the middle of it, so, i finished watchin that by myself..and then, when that was over, i watched How to Deal, with Mandy Moore!..it was a cute lil o movie! But, i'm sittin there..and the things that happened in the movie...made me realize..that that's how stephen and i would be..if we were still goin out! And, i've realized, that i'm gonna go for stephen, even if it takes me askin him out :(..i'm scared to ask him out..i've never really asked a guy out before! Wow...but, newayz...i just...don't know how he feels..but, i guess i'll find out soon! I mean, all i can say about this whole this...is, i dont know....and maybe that's all i'm supposed to know right now?! It's just all crazy..but, one thing i can say i do know..is that i like stephen..alot! And i know ya'll are prolly thinkin that i go from guy to guy, but, i don't!...I know i said i liked bubba...ALOT...and i did...but, stephen never left the picture...he was just shoved into the corner! And it took me a while to get over bubba, b/c i've liked him since the 8th grade..and honestly, i think he'll always have a part of my heart...but, that's fine..b/c i don't like him...i like stephen..and always have..since the first day i met him...and laid eyes on him! I liked him when i was likin bubba....but, it took bubba tellin me that him and i could only be friends, to realize it!...and i'm soo glad that bubba and i didn't work out...b/c i would hate to be goin out with bubba, and then me realizin then instead of now, that i like stephen soo much...and breakin up with bubba...b/c of that!..that would just kill me!

I mean...i've liked him for soo long..but, i just never really thought it was there..and i guess now i do...and it's like..he's changed! I mean, the guy i new before...wasn't the guy i know now! It's like he has this tone to his voice that says i don't care about you or your problems, and it kind of hurt my feelins yesterday because i would say somethin..and then he's just kind of act like he didn't care, and i dunno...maybe i'm just bein such a girl, but, i dunno! It seems as if i'm not knowin alot of things right now! And, maybe it's just that before...this person actually liked me, and i guess his voice showed it...but, now, it's like...i dunno....so hard, and not soft like it used to be!..gah, i'm gonna start cryin! hah..what a wuss! But, i think there's more to it than that! It's like there's somethin there..that's he's not tellin me..that's behind why he is the way that he is, and i don't guess he's a bad person..i just think...there's somethin behind the image..and into the soul, that he's just not lettin out..and i can't figure out, what it is..and it's killin me! maybe it's just me..but, it seems like, there's somethin there..that he's just not tellin!

Well, see, i do like cameron..i think...and, i mean..it's like..he won't talk to me! I mean, i put forth the effort to talk to him..and all he's got to say are one word answers, and oh or yeh, and it's makin me mad! B/c he barely talks to me..and usually, i can read most ppl like a book, and i can't him..i don't know if he's feelin me..or not..i don't know what's goin on! I mean, he KNOWS for a fact, that i'm interested in him, but, yet, he doesn't talk to me! The cameron i became interested in, was the cameron who made me laugh all night long, was cameron, that doesn't care what anybody thinks about him, and would talk to a brick wall, if nobody was lookin! But, obviously, i'm ""comin on too strong"", and he's changed..so, i guess that'll be that?! I hate it..with all my heart..but, it is the way it is!..so, yeh! But, i dunno how it's gonna turn out..prolly for the worse..like everything does..but, hey, it's all good!..but, newayz..o, yeh, i saw justin today..he gave me a hug!..hehe..but, newayz..i'm gone! bye bye!

This summer's gonna be awesome!...i'm goin into it with no boyfriend..so, that's a plus! Well, the guy that i've been writing about..still has on clue! And, i haven't told him..i really haven't talked to him..so, i mean..you know! well, today was a good day!..nothin special happened..except this soo amazingly great thing..but, can't talk about..because i'll get busted..haha! i mean..it wasn't bad..but, you know! Alrighty..well, i'm gone!..everybody be safe at graduation...bye!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys!  Gees, i'm sick..and it's horrible..i can barely talk, i cough every 5 seconds, and when i cough..i sound like i'm coughin up a lung! When i get up, i get dizzy, and one minute, i'm hot, the next, i'm cold! I HATE IT!! Well, as i said, i met daniel last night, and he's such a sweetie! he's cute too! We were holdin hands ...sortof... haha..can't really explain that one!  but, it's cool! Well, jonci and i went over to lindsey's last night, and we had the best time, except for the bein sick part of course! We're both sick, at the same time, but, her fever was goin away, and mine was stayin, so, i dunno! I need to go to the doctor, but, i'm scared it's goin to be somethin REALLY bad, because when i try to breathe, my tonsils and throat are badd...and my tonsils aren't in too good of shape! But, ima quit my belly-achin now! Newayz, guys, i've got a problem! ok, i think i might have feelins for this daniel guy, but, i haven't decided on it yet. But, there's this guy, who'se name is bubba, who'se i liked all last year, and all this year..just about...well, when i wasn't goin out with anybody! well, a coupla months ago, bubba and andrew come over to my house..and i was likin bubba...alot...and then, andrew kisses me, and i pull away, and tell him, that i can't kiss him....b/c i like bubba alot...well, i guess andrew tells bubba that i kiss him or whatever..and then bubba, just like...stopped likin me..and everything..well, bubba talks to me yesterday for the first time in i dont' know how long..and calls me, and honestly, it felt great! Bubba is actually a guy, who i can play around with, and have fun with, but, be madly in love with at the same time, and i've missed that, when we haven't been talkin! but, i mean, i think i might like bubba, but, then again, i've got daniel there too, and i don't know what to do! And, i've got this ex-boyfriend problem, you remember, with the ex-boyfriend that i might still have feelins for?! Well, the thing with the ex-boyfriend, is that he was my first ""true love"".  I know what you're sayin, i'm only in 9th grade, how can i know what love is!  Well, the truth is, i can't, and i honestly don't think anybody else can either, but, it's different with him! It's like, whenever i'm around him, if i have a boyfriend or not, or if he's got a girlfriend or not, i just..want him to hold me, and i feel like i wanna spend the rest of my life with this guy, and it drives me crazy, b/c i'm soo positive that he doesn't like me like that, nemore, and it kills me to know that i still feel soo strongly about this guy, but, there's nothing i can do to change it! And, i can't say anything, or do anything, b/c he's talkin to a girl, and i wouldn't be suprised if he was goin out with her now...and, i just, can't say anything! But, it makes me soo mad b/c, i know that i gave my heart away to this guy a long time ago, and i never really got it back! But, newayz..pray for me...bye bye...Love, Lauren"

YHGJXE8,female,15,"*we may think that the one we love is the only one worth it for us, but, havin a broken heart is just a part of life; one that must be endured and overcomed. However, it's pointless to stay that way. Love doesn't mean holdin onto feelins and bein devoted to someone you can't have anyway. It's wanting what is best for the other person even if it means not getting what you want. That's not to say that the pain shouldn't exist or will fade away just like that, but true love desires the happiness of the one you love. Knowing before hand could have saved you that piece of your heart for someone else; someone who will share a life with you so beautiful that you'll cry tears of joy at the thought of it as opposed to the tears of pain that led you to where you're sittin right now.*    Guys, this was given to me, by one of my good friends, and i thank her soo much, for giving this to me. I know that i still like bubba..and care for him alot..but, with help from God, and my friends, i'm movin on..slowly, but surely..and i've realized..that i'll be ok...in the end."
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! what's goin on? yeh, nothin much here either..bout to hop in bed! Well, nothin new's goin on..just same o' same o'! Oh, i think i might have two guys in the picture! Maybe..but, not sure! I'll hafta see how it goes with em..and see what all they're about first..and i'll get back to ya on that one! FINALLY..I HAVE NOOO DRAMA IN MY LIFE!! i love it to death!!! it's the greatest thing in the world! haha..i'm soo excited! Yeh..but, anyways! I guess i'm gone now guys..bye!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"have your feelings ever so hurt, you didn't know what to do? See, i have a ""friend"" whom i trusted with my life; i mean, i had more trust and faith in him, almost more than anybody, and then i found out that he said somethin he shouldn't have! And, what he said, is something that could ruin everything, if it hasn't already! I understand, that you shouldn't care what people think, but, the thing is...when it comes down to it, you're going to care, if they think you're a slut or not! And, when i found out last night, that this person said these things..it crushed me!...absolutely crushed me...because it's the principal of the matter, that he would actually go behind my back, and say what he said, knowing good and well it's not true! I guess what i'm just tryin to say, is that my heart hurts, and i just wanna cry, because this person, is somebody i cherish very much, and would have done anything for, but, to hear, from a guy who you like, and would like to date...that somebody who's supposed to be your best friend, and your partner in crime...is talkin about you...the way that he did...was just..too much to take in all at once i guess because, i just...don't understand why he would say that...even if he was ""just kidding""?! And, i found out some other stuff he said..and, it's down to the point now..where i just..need to stay away from him for a while...because i can't take his crap anymore!! My heart's hurting wayy too much, and, i can't take it! So, i'm through with it! I'm through with all the crap that i've had to put up with in the past, i'm through with all the laughs, i'm through with all the heartbreak, and tears, and crap!....i'm done!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! How's it goin? It's great here! Ok, so, this week, for spring break, i went to New Orleans with my youth group on a mission trip, and it was so amazing! Everyday for like 3 or 4 hours, we went to a park, and played with so called ""less fortunate"" kids, and they were soo amazing! I can not even begin to tell you, how many life lessons that i've learned, just from kids that are way younger than i am! And ther are people that sit there and say that they're less fortunate just because of what they have, or don't have, and what kind of places they live in, and it's not right...because those kids..were so amazing and this trip was one of the best experiences that i've ever had..and i will never, ever forget it! It was just so amazing..and brought alot of things into perspective! So, yeh, the guy status: still single! There's not really a guy i'm liking, or anything, so, i'm just..contempt! I mean..i think that i'm ready to find somebody that i can really relate to, and understand very well, but, you know, he hasn't come along yet, so, i'm just...patiently waiting! And, i haven't introduced myself to this person yet..because i don't know if i want to introduce myself to him anymore...i'm starting to think that it's not the right time for me to be dating right now..but, you know, if that somebody that i can relate to and understand comes along..i guess that'll be the time that it'll be right to date!...but, anyways!..i guess i'm gonna go now..bye!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! How have ya'll been? I've been ok! Gettin better, and movin on...day by day! OMG...i'm in love!!..haha...umm...not really love love but, love!..haha..if that makes sense! I've liked this guy...bubba...for a while, and i was talkin to my youth minister wednesday, about my situation i thought i was in, and i got it showed to me, that there are many things that catch your eye....but, only few things that catch your heart....pursue that! And i realized that i REALLY REALLY REALLY like Bubba..and he's the guy i wanna be with (haha..maybe a senior though audrey) and i'm not gonna let that pass me up, so, i had decided that i was gonna ask him out, and then, i get on the computer, and he's on so, i was like yay! So, i'm talkin to him...and was like..so, who you likin..and he goes..i dunno..and i was like..oo..well, i was gonna ask you out.but, i dunno now...and he was like...why?..and i was like..well, i don't want you to say no to me...and he goes oo ok..and then, yesterday, i imed him and was like..hey bubba..and he goes hey, look, do you still wanna date? and i was like...umm..yeh...and he was like..ok, well, how about us doin somethin then seein where it goes from there..and i was like..ok...so, he called last night..and we were supposedly supposed to do somethin tonight..but, i dont' guess we are..b/c i haven't talked to him, today..so, i dunno? But, it's all good...i really hope everything works out with this one though! But, i gotta go now, bye bye! Love, Lauren!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! Alrighty, this last week, has been a living heck! I've been deathly sick, and then, my best friend and i are no longer friends! So, yeh, i've had better weeks! I mean, i went, and apologized to kasi, and i just don't see why she was goin off on me and why she wrote that way harsh blog! It's stupid!..i mean, hello, she says that we're best friends and all, but yet, when it comes down to it, she says that i have to have all the guys, and be ""lil miss thing""...i mean, if this is what she thought about me, then, obviously, she didn't know me well at all!...i mean, dagum...your best friends aren't supposed to be the people who think that about you, or, at least, that's what i was told! But, it'll all work out...it better....or else i've spent every night almost for the past two weeks, cryin...and i don't normally cry..over things like this!..so, yeh, it better work out...but, i'm gone! Bye Bye! Love, Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"GUYS, lemme tell you!!...kasi and i talked..and we're good...gah..i can NOT tell you how much better i feel!!...gees...but, i still have to worry about jonci and allison..but, i'm not that worried about allison!..i just hope jonci and i get things worked out! but, i gotta go now, bye bye Love, LaUrEn"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys!..gees, i haven't written in like....FOREVER! yeh, but, anyways! How's it goin? Yeh, it's goin great here too! Well, i'm leavin saturday to go on a mission trip with my church to new orleans, and it's gonna be GREAT! But, the guy status is still the same: single! And i'm thinkin it's for the best! I mean, if a guy comes along, that i have feelings for, then, that's great..but, if they don't..then, that's fine too! But, i've just...got alot of things on my mind right now..and i honestly don't think it would help that situation at all, if i had a boyfriend right now! But, i am going to introduce myself to this guy who i think is cute!, but, i dunno that he'll like me, or anything, but, it's all good! Ok, i'm about to lay out some stuff..that everybody thinks..but, just..don't say..and it's been botherin me for a while now..so, i've GOT to get it off my chest..so, here goes!: I think it's soo funny how one day, you can be friends with somebody, but, yet, when they start datin somebody, they just..completely change..and act like they don't even know you! I mean, it just kills me, with this one guy..b/c him and i used to be friends..and he used to be a great guy..and probbably still is..but, you know..he just..makes me feel so inferior..and i don't stand for that at all...nobody should feel the way that i feel when i try to talk to him..so, i just...don't talk to him! and i mean, i want to..i really do..but, i just..can't!...it's too hard!..but, whatever..that wasn't as bad as it could have been..i held back..but, NO REGRETS! I'm out..bye guys!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys! Gees, the message tonight at church was AWESOME! I can NOT even begin to tell you how good it was! Guys, i can not even begin to tell you, how important it is that you know who christ is, and that you accept him, as your personal lord and savior! God created this earth, and the whole universe! He created everything, and i just don't see how people could sit there, and say that they don't believe in him, or they know he's real, but, just, choose not to accept it! I mean, why would you want to spend all eternity in Hell? It's just stupid! And for the people, who say, well, you can prove where hell is, and where Heaven is, well, lemme tell ya, Heaven is above Hell, and Hell is under Heaven! How do i know that God is real, you ask? Alrighty, you've got the bible, you've got personal testimonies, i mean, you've got all this stuff, around you, and you just sit there and act like it's a ""coincidence"" that it's there! I mean gees! C'mon now, if there was no God, then, there would be nothing! But, you know, if you wanna go to Hell, and ignore that you could go to Heaven, and live with God, himself, then, that's a decision that you get to make! But, i'm gone..bye bye! Love, Lauren"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"hey guys! what's goin on? yeh..nothin much here..haven't written in a while, so, i thought i would! Well, tomorrow i'm goin to atlanta, georgia for atlantafest with my church! It's gonna be soo much funn!..i'm excited! Well, i've got a lil problem! There's this guy, and we're talkin i guess, but, i'm at this time in my life..where i've just..decided that i don't need, nor do i want a boyfriend! And, i'm soo scared to tell him, because i don't want to hurt him! that's the last thing, i would ever want to do...because he's such a great guy! and what i hate..is i'm goin to have to do it by computer..because i'll start cryin...and i can't cry in front of him!..and i think that people should have better respect for people than to do it by e-mail, or im..but, i've got no other choice...so, that's that!  Guys, i'm really needin prayers right now! i don't know who reads this..if anybody at all..but, i'm having a really, really tough time right now..because i don't have somebody in my life anymore..who was a good friend of me..and it's hard. I just..don't see how anybody could talk about somebody, who'se supposed to be their best friend, the way i got talked about..even if they were just kidding. And what gets me the most..is that it's not just somethin stupid..it's something that could change my reputation..and i do understand that you're not supposed to care what people think..but, the thing is..it was done by a friend...someone whom you're supposed to be able to trust, and have secrets with..but, instead..they sell you out, like they never even cared, and i personally don't see how anybody could do that!"
YHGJXE8,female,15,"Hey guys!..how's it goin? Yeh, nothin much here either! Last night..was soo much funn..haha..i stayed the night with Jonci last night! We went to the movies and saw Lord of the Rings,and there were some lil chicks behind us, that just would not shutup!..haha..i thought we were gonna roll up in that mug..haha..right jonci? hah, we crazy! And we were ridin in her car today, and we were at the end of this road, and then, she was gonna do a u-turn, and asked if there was a car comin, and there wasn't..so, i said no..well, she starts to go..and i was like...WOOOAAAHHHH..and she like, slams on brakes..and i go..there's a car comin now...hah..it scared the crap out of her..and me too!! Hah...i couldn't quit laughin! But, newayz! Yeh, i'm still likin stephen!...it's soo crazy, b/c..i mean, i dunno how he feels about me...and all!..i mean, sometimes, it's like.he's sendin these lil messages sayin that he likes me..and then, other times..it's like..what the heck are you thinkin likin me?..it's just crazy..and i haven't decided yet, if ima go after him!..i mean, i do like him...dont' get me wrong...but, i just..don't know how he feels! But, i think that i'm just gonna go after him neways! I think he might be playin hard to get (which he's doin a really good job of, by the way) and honey, if he wants to play hard to get..i'll come and get him...there's no problem there!...but, i gotta go now, i'll keep ya in the know about what happens!...bye bye! Love, Lauren"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Alright, I am SO going down to Cityside (the LYS) tomorrow and picking up a Chibi needle. I'm weaving in interminable ends on Shapely right now so I can maybe start knitting the edging sometime tonight, and an angled tip would really help. If only there were some spell I could cast and *poof* all the ends would be invisible! I think every knitter dreams of such a spell, really."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Kelly's scarf Shapely (if it's not done) Bistro top Simple and Sleeveless (from Purl Stitch) A couple random hats (bucket/stretchy mesh/etc.) Charlotte Kureyon felted ballerina slippers Socks (?)  This may seem like a long list, but when it comes to knitting projects I'm very ADD. And I never know what I'm going to feel like working on, so even when I head to campus I pack two or three different projects. So this list may change between now and the 24th. Especially if I manage to scam some yarn from my mom tomorrow ;-)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Especially in expensive Noro yarn.  This Shinano is pissing me off anyway, even before the lovely knot I discovered this morning.  I don't know if it's just this batch, but the random patches of unspun roving alternating with what amounts to thread is highly irritating.  The scarf doesn't look bad (except for one patch where 3 rows in a row had roving in the same spot, so there's a big lump there), but it's annoying to work with.  I'd also like to hear back from Interweave about the fact that I haven't received the first issue of my subscription, when the subscription e-mail said it would be mailed on July 22nd.  I e-mailed them asking about it on Monday.  (I e-mailed Vogue Knitting the same day b/c I haven't received the fall issue of that either, and I had a response within  half an hour  saying a replacement issue would be sent out.)  Growl.  I've been making progress on Kelly's sweater, and sending out loads of yarn to people who are all too happy to help me destash.  Yay people!  Sent out my first SP gift last week too.  I'll be anxious to see her reaction."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Well, I think I'm going to frog the beige hat. It's going to be too big, and I don't think I'll wear it anyway. So, now I need something else to do with one skein of wheat heather Wool-Ease.  Did another couple inches on the side wall of the kitty bed last night while I couldn't sleep. About halfway through. It's slow going because, truthfully, it's kinda boring. It's just straight garter stitch. So I just need to get it DONE.  My nerdy-ass self put together an AppleWorks database last night for my yarn stash, just so I can keep track of what I have. It kept me calm too. I'll continue working on it tonight, because I need something to keep me calm again.  Later, there will be pictures. I have one more hank of Kool-Aid yarn to wind into a ball, and then I'll take pictures of that and all the FO's since the last photo-post. Promise! (Besides, I finally replaced the batteries in my camera.)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer high-end/natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you?  Well, sort of.  I haunt the LYS regularly and have an extensive collection of Noro and Brown Sheep, but I also have a load of Wool-Ease that I use on occasion.  I reserve the Red Heart stash I already had for trying new stitches and techniques.  I mostly avoid acrylics because I like soft stuff, and acrylic doesn't usually fit that.  Encore is an exception...it seems to have enough wool in it to be okay.  The next HP scarf I make is going to be in 100% wool though, b/c I live in Maine and need the extra warmth.   2. Do you spin? Crochet?   Well, I bought a drop spindle beginner kit, but I haven't come anywhere close to figuring it out yet.  I may like it, I may not, I don't know.  I'm capable of crocheting (laboriously) and have a couple crochet books, but I MUCH prefer knitting.  Probably because I'm better at it.   3. Do you have any allergies? (smoke, pets, fibers, perfume, etc.)   I claim to be allergic to cigarette smoke because I hate it THAT MUCH, but not really.  I'm sensitive to perfumes, but again, I don't know if that qualifies as allergies.   4. How long have you been knitting?    Ages.  I used to knit squares when I was a kid, and attempted to knit a sweater for the last boyfriend (I gave up on the sweater before I gave up on the boy, actually.)  It's only been recently that I've actually made stuff.   5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list?    Yeah, the Amazon list is under himeykitty at hotmail dot com, if you look it up by e-mail.  I suppose I should link it somewhere, but I usually use it for my own reference.   6. What's your favorite scent? (for candles, bath products etc.)   Vanilla, citrusy stuff, fresh grassy-kind of stuff.  My current obsession is The Body Shop's satsuma.   7. Do you have a sweet tooth?    OOOOOH yeah.  I feed it quite well on my own though :-)    8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do?   Knitting, that's about it.  I do decorate-y things on occasion.   9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (if you want to make her a CD)    Chick-rock, classic rock, hard rock, world music (especially African, Middle Eastern, and Celtic) and trance.  I'm always on the lookout for completely random cover songs.  Tori Amos and BNL are good for those :-)   10. What's your favorite color? Or--do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer?    Yellow, blue, brighter pastel-y types, and darker browns.  Pretty much any green except the really bright neon ones.   11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets?   Live alone, owned by one cat, have a boyfriend who I only see on weekends (he lives two hours away, bah).   12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know)   Not sure yet...to save up enough money so I can stay at home and knit?"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"This thing feels absolutely phenomenal, and despite the slowness of knitting, it's knitting so smoothly and looks great.  So once it's done, where the hell am I going to wear it? I don't think these things through well at all."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Looks like y'all want me to list what I have here before I throw it on eBay.  I can do that.  I need to write up a small webpage with the list and take a bunch of pictures and stuff, then I'll let you know the address to that...just so I don't have to post a big long entry going on and on.   urlLink Lisa  wanted to know how much I'd want for the Kureyon.  It averages about $8.50/ball in stores and $65-70/bag of 10 on eBay (except for the really popular discontinued colors, which I do have a couple of...I saw a batch of 5 in color #70 go for over $90!), so I think probably $6 a ball from blogreaders.  But look for that in the next week or so.  I have to buy batteries for the digicam.  (BTW, if anyone's interested, I do have some needles and a ball of Schaefer Elaine up right now.  Needles end tomorrow afternoon, Elaine ends Tuesday afternoon.  Username is himeykitty2.)  In actual knitting news, I'm plugging away at the WIPs I have and started a flower washcloth from  Weekend Knitting , just to have something small going.  I did a few rows on Charlotte Friday afternoon.  Those rows are getting long, and after doing the math I'm going to add over 100 more stitches before I'm done.  Over 300 stitches in the last few rows!  That'll be fun to bind off.  I need to get moving on my Christmas list...I have 5 months as of today.  I should start Roy's DNA scarf, as that's probably the most complicated thing to do.  I just have to find sport weight alpaca first.  Have to go to Cityside (soon!) and see if they have the kind I'm looking for."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"This hat came from VKOTG's Caps and Hats.  I made it with Wool-Ease, which is actually awesome yarn considering it's mostly acrylic.  I took out one pattern repeat and every time I measured the gauge it was right AND I made a size smaller than my head, but it was still too big.  It's not meant to be folded up like it is in the picture.    This was just me not checking gauge and using yarn that's probably a bit heavier than called for.  It's the Gathered Hat from Hip To Knit, and if you look really carefully you might be able to see the cable sort of on the right (your left) side of my head.  Probably not, because it blends in fairly well since I used tweed yarn.  Another member of the Wool-Ease family here, this is the Thick & Quick.  Forgive the flirtatious look.  I always give the camera weird looks when I'm taking pics of myself.    Got this pattern from a knitblogger, Will Knit For Food (I'm too lazy to find the URL right now, I'll edit and add it in later).  Made from one (almost) skein of Noro Iro.  Still needs blocking...the brim won't roll after it's blocked, it'll sort of hang down.      Wrist warmer.  There are two, but the other one looks exactly the same, so I figured you'd get the effect from seeing just one.  From the same crappy Red Heart yarn as the Kittyville hat.  Just a K1P1 rib rectangle seamed up the side with a hole left for my thumb.    Since Tiffany wanted to see my progress on this...The colors are totally inaccurate.  For some reason my flash decided not to work, and I was standing between the chair and the overhead light.  You can see the waist shaping on the right side (because I pinned it out so you could!) and the poofiness up at the top is caused half by being smushed onto the needle and half by the short rowing.    Goodness!  Where does the bed end and the kitty begin?  She's been in it almost constantly since I finished it Thursday, so I think it's safe to say that she likes it :-)  It's the Princess Snowball bed from SnB, sandstone Fun Fur for the side and black for the bottom (which you can't see, b/c there's an Ayla in the way)."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"You know, I haven't really finished much lately.  I keep starting things, getting bored, and frogging.  And miraculously, that didn't happen with Shapely, and here she is:     Those colors are totally not accurate.  The old ""take picture of self in mirror"" doesn't lend well to color accuracy.  The yarn is from Elann.com, Endless Summer Sonata Print, and it was pretty much all stockinette stitch, all the time.  Now prepare for cuteness.  Are you prepared?  Okay, here we go.     You can't really get a good look at the hat, but it's the only picture I have of Taylor actually wearing the dang thing and not whipping it off as my camera went ""clicky.""  (See how his hand is blurry?  I caught it just in time, because his hand was on its way up to pull it off.)  It's the Bottom's Up pattern from ChicKnits.com, the smallest size, which is still too big for him, and the yarn is Lion Brand Lion Cotton.  It came out nice, but the cotton was hard to work with doubled on the brim.  My hands hurt just thinking about it."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"After I posted all that, I finished the Kittyville hat (well, except for the pompoms on the strings).  It's made out of cheap-ass Red Heart acrylic yarn, and I think I made the hat part a bit long:"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"This scarf is the first thing I have EVER finished.  (I've known how to knit since forever, but really started doing it seriously recently during a bout with depression.)  It's in the process of being blocked, here's detail of it pinned out.  It's chestnut heather Lion Brand Wool-Ease worsted, the pattern is the faggot lace scarf from Knitting for Dummies.     This hat, modeled by yours truly, is made of the same yarn as the previous scarf.  The pattern is ""Most Basic Hat"" from Hip to Knit.     This basic garter stitch scarf is of Crystal Palace Yarns Splash.  I fell in love with the color scheme and like the way it knit up.  It took me only an afternoon of off-and-on work.  I plan to make at least 10 more *grin*.     And this is the Kitschy Kerchief from Stitch N Bitch, made out of some completely random sport weight yarn with a German name that I can't remember.  (It's a tweed of a dark rose, dark grey, and either black or navy blue, I can't tell, it seems to change in the light.)  I'm going to make a solid colored one in seed stitch at some point.     (xposted to  )"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"The more and more I think about it, the more I want to try the TKGA master knitters program.  To the point where, once I get my next paycheck, I'm ordering level 1.  I know there's a knit-along already, but if anyone wants to sort of buddy up and do it with me, comment or leave a note on the tagboard.  (*ahemJessieahem*)  I finished the Deco-Ribbon bag today, well, except for the sewing-y stuff (the lining and the handles).  I might hire my mom to do that for me, because, well, if you've read anything I've ever written EVER, you know my dislike for sewing.  Of course, I was in a weird mood today and put it on my head, and it's the perfect size for a crazy, almost kitty-ear-looking hat.  If I pull the corners in and tack them on the inside, it would be really cute.  Decisions, decisions.  I guess I'll call it done and decide what to do with it later.  I'm realizing that if I want to knit Christmas presents, I'd better get going on it, since next semester will be a lot more busy than the summer (duh!).  I've got one done, but big deal, it was probably the simplest and fastest one on my list.  Yes, I realize every new knitter says ""Oooh, I can knit everyone I've ever met something for Christmas.""  I also realize every new knitter says ""Oooh, yes, I know every new knitter fails miserably at knitting lots and lots of presents, but  I'll  be the one to succeed.""  My solution for that is, knit the most important ones or the most complicated first, and if I don't get to the last ones, no big deal.  I also finally figured out what to do with Michael's afghan.  Doubled Homespun (I know, I know, but I have a couple cones in colors he likes, and that's an easy way to get it GONE!), big needles (that I need to buy this weekend), and seed stitch.  Easy enough, quick enough, and he's already impressed enough that some random older cousin will knit him something.  Okay, now that I only have two projects on the needles, and one will most likely be done by Friday, it's time to start something else.  Any ideas?"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"A nice, big blocking table/board/SOMETHING.  I'm blocking a scarf on my ironing board right now, which sucks for two reasons:    The pins aren't staying too well, since the foam is a total of maybe 1/16"" thick.     The board isn't nearly long enough for the scarf, so I have one end of it doubled over.  It's a mostly acrylic blend, so it should dry fairly quickly anyway.      So a blocking table would be wonderful.  I might have to put my head together with the Boy and design one to build up in his dad's shop one weekend."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Like I said in the personal journal, I'm taking off for a couple weeks on a trip. Expect lots of FOs when I return!"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"So I've been tempted off and on to send for the TKGA Master Knitter's certification program.  I know I can knit fairly well, but would something like that make me better or merely frustrate me?  I guess what it comes down to is, non-knitters think I can knit well.  I don't know enough knitters, but I got compliments on my tank top in the yarn store on Friday from people sitting there knitting (and people who work there).  Do I just want validation from people who are good-good-good knitters?  Or would I rather not have them judging me right now?  Would it take the fun away from it, or add more fun as it improves my skill?  Hmm."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Alright.  That crap I was spewing about trying to clean off my WIP list before the trip?  Well, I just joined a sock knitalong.   urlLink Broadripple  from knitty.com, to be exact about the sock.  I'm going to do this sock thing, dammit!  Of course, that means starting another project...."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"This time it's a beaded mohair scarf. Mine's out of ""marmalade"" (uh, orange :-) ) Rowan Kidsilk Haze. Mmm, soft. I'm having so much fun stringing the beads onto the yarn *eyeroll*  Last night I finished a bucket hat out of Noro Iro, and now I just have to block it. I should have distributed the decreases better on the brim rather than pair them up next to each other. The brim has an odd point on it now. Other than that, I haven't finished anything since last entry. Le sigh. I've been so depressed I haven't even felt like knitting."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"DONE!!!  Damn thing's 6 1/2 feet long. I didn't even use up both skeins of eyelash like it says to in the instructions in SnB (had to throw away some tangled bits), and the scarf was only SUPPOSED to come out to 4 feet. Hrm. Pictures will have to wait, b/c it's almost 12:30 and I should really be in bed and asleep by now.  Yarn shopping in Portland in a couple days, woohoo!"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Okay, I added a new commenting service.  It's pretty much just like other blogs now, name, e-mail, website, comment.  Now I can actually respond personally to comments that people leave.  Of course, now I can't see any comments that were left on the built-in Blogger commenting system, but whatever.  Comment away!  (Jessie, I did get your comment on the last entry e-mailed to me.  If I don't end up posting my yarn here, I'll e-mail you with what I have for Kureyon.)  Edit: Okay, so the screwed up thing is, even when there are comments through the new system, the link on the page says ""0 comments"".  I'm gonna try to change that, but until then, don't be misled!  Edit again: Fixed it!  Yay me!  (For those who read this through the LJ feed, I'm sorry, I probably screwed things up good by editing this entry so damn much.  I'm done now, I promise.)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I've been carrying Sarah's HP scarf around to work on while riding the bus, but as I was telling Kelly today, it's really getting too big to bring with me.  It's not even halfway done, and I think it's almost 3 feet.  So...what to bring?  I should make something out of the 2 skeins of beige-y Koigu I have kicking around.  Gloves?  BTW, I put two more batches of Kureyon up on my give-my-yarn-a-good-home page.  I think if something goes unclaimed for a week, that's when it goes on eBay.  Projects I've neglected the past few days: the sweater and Charlotte.  My friend Tiffany admired my entrelac swatch today (I hung it on my bulletin board, because I'm a dork like that.)  Of course the non-knitter appreciates the most fiddly, complicated thing I've done!  *grin*"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I was talking to the ladies at the LYS (by the way, I have an interview for a part time position there on Monday!) and mentioned my fear of colorwork.  I'm the type of person who will knit random complicated lace and cable patterns for fun (somewhere along the lines of the math nerd who will do double and triple integrals just because (s)he can), but I'm scared of simple Fair Isle type colorwork.  So today I'm picking up my trusty copy of Knitting for Dummies, I'm taking out two different colors of OTNSY (Official Trying-New-Stuff Yarn), and going to it.  So far so good, but lord, all the ends to weave!  Started a Chinchilla chemo cap the other night.  That stuff sheds on the hands like a Persian cat in Death Valley, CA.  Needless to say, I got impatient before I put it down to pick back up another, less hot day.  Wonder what the feasibility of making a felted sleeve for my laptop is.  I have all this random Cascade 220, and if this FI thing works, I could use some of it for that."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I meant to take a picture of my progress this morning before work, but guess who got up a weeeeeee bit late.  I finished row 86 last night, out of a total 154.  ""Yay!"" you say.  ""Over halfway done!""  Unfortunately, this close to the end the rows just keep getting longer and longer and looooonnnnnggggeeeeeeeerrrrr.  I haven't figured out how many stitches will be in the last row, but I know it's a lot.  There's a lot on the needle now.  I think the 29"" circ I'm using will be long enough for all the stitches though.  I'm going to change the color order a bit, so I can have more of that pretty pink/yellow mix that I mistakenly cast on with when my intention was to use it last.  See if I cast on another Charlotte when I'm overtired again."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I found a  urlLink website  for a group that makes hats for cancer patients.  I think I might put my needles to work for that....my academic advisor has cancer, so the idea kinda hits home for me."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Until today.  Because it's so bloody hot.  *fans self with Elann newsletter that came today*  I want to knit, but even in A/C I can't bring myself to.  But otherwise, it's been good.  I've made good progress on the Slyth scarf, I've pretty much doubled my progress on the sweater, I've considered working on Charlotte (of all my projects, it's hardest to work on her with the cat around, because of course she's attracted to the Good Stuff, not the acrylic blends *grin*), and I made a washcloth, and actually wove ends RIGHT when I finished the knitting!  I NEVER do that!  (No pics yet, still have to block the thing.)  BTW, hi, Secret Pal!  *waves*"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,urlLink Here.
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"In one of the knitting communities I'm in (I can't remember which one and I'm too lazy to open my friends page and check), tonight (and possibly every Thursday night) has been proclaimed UFO night (UnFinished Object night), meaning finish something that's unfinished tonight. I suppose I finished something, but it doesn't really count since I started it today. It's a cabled/seed-stitch hat out of some of the rest of that Wool-Ease T&Q denim twist yarn. The pattern's out of Hip to Knit, and the damn thing is wayyyyy too long. Kinda big too. But I can fold up the ribbed edge to help with the length and it's all good. I wasn't sure how it would turn out with the twist yarn and the stitch pattern, but it's not bad. Either way, it'll keep my head warm at hockey games next year. (Note: seed stitch in a bulky yarn is my new favorite thing. So cushy feeling....)  I'm working on a PDA cover out of the same cotton/spandex yarn I made the lace hat out of, but I think I may frog it. The stitches are really uneven....I think my tension's off, because my stockinette is usually fairly nice looking. I still need a cover though...I think I may make it out of some Kool-Aid yarn I have though. Or the random Plymouth Floral Splash I couldn't resist picking up on sale at the LYS. Or one of my half-used skeins I have kicking around. Or....okay, I'll stop.  Now, should I go to bed or work on Tiff's scarf? That might bore me to sleep at this time of night, since it's just knit knit knit knit. Argh. I need to step up to more challenging stuff, and soon."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Lots of stuff to show you today!  First off, we have something that arrived in my mailbox on Saturday from an unnamed source in New Jersey:   Sooo soft, and the colors are so intense.  Apparently my camera is tired, because it hasn't captured a color accurately in any sort of light for a couple of weeks now.  Go  urlLink here  for a look at what the colors really look like.  The yarn is similar to Point 5 (which is droolworthy in itself), but MUCH bigger hanks!  Thank you Secret Pal!  If she starts off this strong, I'm wondering what other goodies to expect :-)    And of course I realized I haven't posted any pictures of the finished Feather-And-Fan scarf...here it is!  Plymouth Indiecita Alpaca in raspberry...I used probably 2 1/2 skeins. Also incredibly soft.    This is not really gray.  Honest.  It's a soft sage green that goes perfectly with my bathroom.  This is the pattern from Weekend Knitting.    The sheddy Chinchilla chemo cap.  It turns out soft and silky, but I'm still covered with red fuzz that's been floating around my apartment waiting for clearance to land, apparently.  More of a darker burgundy than the picture shows.  Now I just need to find someplace to send it.  I'd like to send it to somewhere local, but there are national organizations that collect them too.    Now a UFO to go with all the FOs in this post.  Obviously when I'm done with Charlotte I'm going to have to find a better camera, because you MUST see the colors truly.  That green in the middle should be way more intense than the picture shows.  I've got 16 rows to go, which may lead those unfamiliar with the pattern to say, wow, you're almost done!  Let me put it this way....the first row of the pattern had 7 stitches in it.  The row I'm at now has...well, I don't feel like counting now, so let me estimate around 275 stitches.  And I'm just going to keep adding more until the end!  Each row takes around half an hour now, so that's another 8 hours of work before she's done, not counting blocking and edging.  That's a lot of knitting on teeny size 6 needles!"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"--I'm going to wear Shapely on Friday to the yarn store field trip/Stitch and Bitch. If anyone will appreciate it, knitters will.  --I think I'm going to frog the Eros scarf. Garter stitch scarves are boring as heck when they're not made in Splash, consequently taking only about 4 hours to complete. I think this shade of Eros wants to be a shawl or something. Though not with only one ball. I could buy another, the yarn store has PLENTY in the color. For now, back into the stash with you, Easter Color Eros.  --Which brings me to the question, what to work on at S&B? Andrea's scarf will be done by then. So will the cloche hat. I'm bored with the socks. Charlotte is way too complicated to talk and knit on at the same time. (Well, maybe not complicated. More involved.) Wow, is that really everything I have going? Maybe I'll do some designing/swatching for Michael's afghan. (I'm having thoughts of reversible cables in thick yarn.) Or swatch for Kelly's sweater. Who knows? Anyone got ideas?"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Yes, finally, the promised pictures.  I was a big dork and didn't feel like modeling stuff myself, so I hired my trusty teddy bear, who didn't complain one bit.    The completed Booga Bag from the knit-along.  Noro Kureyon #124.    A full view of the scarf you've only seen detail of previously.    One of my Maineiac hats for next season.  Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick Denim Print.  Cast on, knit in the round, decrease, and end.  Easiest.  Hat.  Ever.    Same pattern as above, but pastels.  Plymouth Yarn Yukon Print.    Another Kitschy Kerchief.  I couldn't get this to look right on the bear, so I (reluctantly) modeled it.  I was too lazy to tie it though.  Lion Brand Polarspun.  I am never using this stuff again.    Flash is bad, mmmkay?  If I had more AA batteries, I'd retake the picture, but it'll have to wait.  This is Knitaly 100% wool in red speckled and black.  The Windy City keyhole scarf from SnB."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"So I'm procrastinating on finishing Broadripple Part Deux.  Grafting the toe and weaving in ends on both socks is all I have left (I finished knitting the toe this morning before catching the bus--gotta find every moment possible to cram knitting into, y'know?).  That leaves me with 3 projects on the needles.  4 seems to be a healthy number for me, and everything I have going is on medium-sized needles.  So I need something on big needles...sounds like Michael's afghan on ass-kicking 35s is the way to go.  Hopefully that'll go fast, because the needles feel like they're going to be really awkward, not to mention working off two cones at the same time.  I need dowels and scrap wood to make a holder before I begin, I think, otherwise I'm going to tie myself together with black and blue Homespun.  Not cool.  Maybe I'll trek over to Aubuchon between work and WW.  Still awaiting the TKGA kit.  Despite all the other stuff I have going, I'm really looking forward to starting it.  Whatever I do, I always want to be better at it, and knitting is no exception.  Bought Space Bags for the yarn stash last night.  For some reason, they aren't helping me fit any more yarn into the cedar chest, probably the shape the bags ended up being after they were vacuumed out.  But I just about cleaned out my 3-drawer thing, except for the kitchen cotton in the top drawer, which doesn't deserve to be in something as cool as a Space Bag.  Realized I have way too much Noro for my own good.  I think the orangey-rusty-red Silk Garden I have is going to turn into a cardi for the fall.  Either Rosedale (from Knitty) or just a simple top-down V-neck (which I have the pattern for from Knitting Plain and Simple).  Probably the V-neck."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"But I realize this about myself, and have endeavored to redeem myself today.  (Granted, the pics are all out of date because I took them a few days ago, but anyway....)    A random hat that got lost in the shuffle of FOs.  It's out of less than 1 skein of Colinette Point 5.  It's too big...next time, I use sz 15 needles rather than 17.  Free pattern from  urlLink ChicKnits .    A finished pair of socks!  Again, ignore the scary white legs that my cheap camera interpreted as gray.  I'm most likely never going to wear these, but I'm proud of them anyway!    Mmm, green Kool-Aid.  I think that's probably 10 or 15 rows up the body of the bag (I'm at 30 now).  Patons Classic Wool dyed with some combination of Kool-Aid.  Kiwi something-or-other?  I don't even remember now.    The stitches go marching two-by-two, hurrah, hurrah!  Yep, a whole swath of 2x2 ribbing in rose heather Wool-Ease.  Yes, Kelly, I am working on it, and you'll have it under your tree!  The ends are woven in on Elise's Christmas scarf, and eventually I'll take a picture of that too.  Most likely after I block it, which will be closer to Christmas.  Right now I'm knitting up lace swatches to choose a pattern for Karen's scarf.  I wish more pattern books would specify which stitch patterns are reversible *sigh*"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Yes, I have been knitting in between trying to figure out who gets what for Christmas and how to store my yarn.  I have pictures of each project-in-progress (except for one, but I'll get to that).  First off, Charlotte.  The whole thing:    The edge, with the pink-and-yellow yarn I love in focus:    Now, Broadripple.  One and a half socks done:    Please don't mind my glow-in-the-dark-white leg:    Feather and fan scarf:    And up close and personal with Miss Feather-and-Fan:    Amazingly, the colors in every picture are fairly true.  Charlotte (the full view) and Broadripple are a little washed-out, but what do you expect from a cheap digital camera anyway?  Next one I buy will have a better macro mode, so I can get better closeups.  I don't have any pictures of Kelly's sweater yet (Pinup Queen from Stitch N Bitch, if anyone's wondering) for two reasons.  One, it's an inch of 2x2 rib.  Not the most exciting picture in the world.  Two, I left it at a friend's apartment, so I couldn't take even a super-boring picture of it.  Kelly's seen it though, and she approves."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I finally made the decision to get rid of all my cheapo Red Heart.  Yes, they have this knack for gorgeous colors that I can't resist, but there is no way I'm going to make ANYTHING out of all that.  I rubbed the end of a skein on the underside of my chin and it was painful.  Like I'd wear anything made of that.  That's just going to go to Goodwill.  I also weeded out a bunch of Lion Brand/Bernat stuff....some Wool-Ease in odd colors, the Boucle and Homespun that I will never end up using, and a bunch of Fun Fur...would anyone be interested in that?  I don't want to go to the bother of taking pictures, coming up with prices, blah blah blah, because the whole lot of it isn't worth more than $20 or 30.  I put a list on the destashing page, so check it out and make an offer if you want any of it.  This destashing thing is making me feel sort of free.  I'm trying to declutter in all aspects of my life, not just craft-wise, and it's a good thing.  In knitting content...well, I really have none.  I ran along on the Lace Rib Scarf today while running errands (the pleasant part of taking the bus: free knitting time), and I plan to do a couple more rows on Charlotte tonight, but other than that, I'm just posting to babble about reducing stash.  Go me, and stuff.  Or something.  I should take more WIP pics.  I've got decent progress on a bunch of stuff, so they might be interesting.  *shrug*"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"--Ball yarn for Chickami --Work on Slyth scarf on bus and on car ride to Skowhegan tonight --Work on sweater --Do a couple rows on Charlotte (which is easier said than done...the rows are getting LONG!) --Continue to reorg (and WEED OUT!) yarn stash --Shop for SP --Start listing stuff on eBay --Finish something, gawd dammit!  It's been hot and un-knitty-motivating lately, much as I want to, but it's a bit cooler now, so maybe something on this list will get done!  (I know the shopping part will be done today at least *grin*)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Took a couple FO pics tonight.    Grr.  Apparently my camera's flash has issues with the color red.  Anyway...this is my first crochet project ever.  It's from one of those scarf kits they have at Craft World.  It's made of Lion Brand Jiffy Thick & Quick in a red-based rainbow color, whatever they feel like calling it.  You can see that my tension loosened way up as I kept going.  The beginning of the scarf is way stiff, not scarf-like at all.  (I was wrapping my yarn the wrong way as well.)    This is a knit string shopping bag from Plymouth Fantasy Naturale (100% mercerized cotton).  The way it's hanging, it almost looks like a cute little cami.  There's a pocket at the bottom that it tucks away into, but I still need to sew a button on.  (Have I ever mentioned that I hate sewing?)    No, I'm not hiding on purpose.  The hat really is that big.  Next time I'll make the next size down.  The yarn is Bernat Handicrafter Cotton (NEVER AGAIN!).  Mom, this is the hat I want to make for Kimmy's son.  I might have to size down the pattern though, I'll know after I see the kid and measure his head.  I don't know how big infants' heads are.  There might be more pics later, I'm seeing the end of Shapely's back.  (Then, the sewing.  *cry*)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I've done very little knitting since Friday's Stitch N Bitch.  There, I finished Broadripple Sock Numero Uno.  (I didn't cast on for Numero Dos until today...very bad me.)  Other than that, I finally frogged some stuff that I was planning to frog, I knit a hat out of chenille and promptly frogged it when I realized that I had cast on too tight and I hated the pattern anyway, and I looked at Charlotte and thought about how much I should work on her.  Of course, I realize this at around 11 pm most of the time, a time when I'm still awake and will be for quite a while, but at which I'm not nearly functional enough to work on something that's that fiddly and attention-requiring.  Well, I did make a small dolphin.  Started it Friday night, finished knitting it Saturday on the way to Amanda's, finished putting it together in the car sitting in Amanda's driveway, and immediately gave it to her.  She liked it, and laughed a little at the copy of Island of the Blue Dolphins I gave her with it, as the small dolphin was made out of blue-ish gray yarn.  (Hence its title in my sidebar, Island of the Blue Dolphin.)  Didn't get any pictures of it, because my brain in its infinite wisdom allowed me to forget my camera.  Blah.  I've got start-itis right now.  I feel like starting a new project, but I really should finish something up before I do that.  And of course, I haven't the least bit of a clue what I'd like to start.  I finally found a pattern for my cousin's afghan, but I don't have the yarn, and I certainly don't have the huge-ass needles the pattern requires.  Size 35 needles aren't usually on your list of needles to stock up on.  I could start on Kelly's sweater, but I don't really feel like making something I have to swatch for at the moment.  I could make yet another scarf or hat...ugh.  I could make a Chickami, but the thought of endless stockinette....yes, I could use a stitch pattern, but then comes the deciding what pattern to use, blah blah blah.  (Side note, one of these days I'm going to design a tank top in a pattern that scallops at the bottom, sort of like feather-and-fan stitch or something else chevron-y.  When I'm smaller and can pull it off better.)  Okay, enough rambling.  I'm going to go work on the Deco Ribbon bag, since that's reasonably close to done."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I'm nearly finished with the Windy City scarf from Stitch N Bitch...38 rows to go.  I should be able to finish it this evening.  Next up is my first foray into circular knitting...a simple roll-brim hat in Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick Denim Twist.  It's a strand of slate blue and a strand of navy twisted together.  I'm going to be knitting a lot of blue accessories between now and the beginning of next hockey season.  That way I'll be the girl in the spirit section wearing a different handknit hat or scarf each home game.  Yes, I'm a nerd.    I'm also participating in a Booga bag knitalong starting...soon?  I'm using this yarn for the bag:   It's Noro Kureyon #124.  Yummy.  Also, stay tuned for Kool-Aid dying, socks, catnip mice, and a whole bunch of other stuff in the near future!"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Note Ayla attempting to help.  I've just started the waist shaping on the front.  The front will take a little longer than the back, alas, because of the short-rowing at the bust.  I have to admit I'm still not entirely sure how short rows work...I did exactly what the pattern said to, with the wrapped stitches and everything, down at the hem, and I *still* have little holes.  I have to get this figured out by the time I make Kelly's sweater (Pinup Girl from SnB), because it *features* short rows.  I'm not giving my best friend a sweater full of holes unless it's supposed to be full of holes, goddammit.  If you're actually looking at this page (rather than reading from your friends list), you may notice that I have two projects 95% done.  Basically that's code for ""I have to sew the dang things together, but at least I'm done knitting them.""  If I'm lucky, my evening will be spent with a needle sewing.  (Not that I need the wrist warmers, since it's getting pretty warm, but it would be nice to finish the kitty bed for Ayla so she can stop nosing at the current knitting.)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"-- Finish the waist decreases on the back of Shapely (on row 7 now since starting the decreases, the last decreases are on row 17) -- Do a couple inches on the abandoned beaded scarf -- Wind a few hanks of Fantasy Naturale into balls -- Possibly work on Eros, but that's not a definite  It may seem late to add all this to my tonight list, but I slept in today, so I'll be up for a good 2-3 hours more tonight.  I've decided I'm not starting anything else until I've taken 2 things off the in-progress list (and no, Tiffany's scarf doesn't count since all I have left on that is weaving in two measly ends). Ideally, I'll clear the list and won't start anything else before the trip so I can start fresh. (I'm counting the Monday night I spend at my grandparents' before we leave as part of the trip...I'm such a cheater.)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Well, guess who did absolutely nothing on UFO night!  That's right, I went out last night and by the time I got home, I didn't feel like knitting. Today I'm not letting myself knit until I get some good cleaning done, and I've made reasonable progress so far, but it's still gonna take a while.  Yesterday afternoon I started the back of Shapely, and the other day I bought yarn for the Bistro Top. Fantasy Naturale, like the other yarn I wanted to use, but in a medium pastel rainbow colorway. I'd link to the colorcard, but the variegateds aren't on it, just the solids. Bah! Bah, I say! Maybe I'll start that soon, or save it for a car project for the trip. With me, who knows? I'm also thinking of furthering my crochet knowledge and trying this pattern for a cloche hat I found. It didn't come with a picture, so I have no idea what it'll end up looking like, but it's worth a try, right? I bought a bunch of cheap-ass cotton at Wallyworld the other night, so if it doesn't work, I'm only out a couple bucks."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Which, since this is a knitting blog, is extremely relative.  The good news is, I have a completed front of a Shapely Tank! Wooo! After I bound off the straps, I held it up to myself and decided I needed a few more rows b/c the armholes seemed to end too high...so I got to rip out two bind-offs. That was fun *eyeroll* I completely screwed one up, but once the edging is knit on you won't be able to tell. I just discovered a Tank-Along...if I can't join with my already-in-progress tank, I'll just have to make another (maybe not the Shapely though...I'll be ready to try something new.)  The bad news is, I don't have enough of the Fantasy Naturale for the Bistro Shirt. In fact, I'm short by 50 yards. Gah. And I know for sure that the store where I bought it is sold out of that color, much less the dye lot.  I'm finally teaching myself how to crochet...well, let's be completely honest. It's finally clicking. Yesterday I bought one of those Lion Brand scarf kits that comes with the hook/needles and big bulky yarn. I didn't think crochet hooks came that big! Anyway, it's a simple single crochet scarf, which I'm assuming is the crochet equivalent of a garter stitch scarf, out of Jiffy T&Q. Fuzzy. A little fuzzier than I like, but whatever. Anyway, the scarf itself seems sort of stiff, super thick too, thicker than it would end up if the yarn were knit...is that odd, or is my tension way tight? (I know a couple people who read this crochet, so I'm hoping they can help!)"

1Z33ZR6,female,25,"And one of my UFOs, of course, is blogging about my FOs.            These are all Kool-Aid dyed Patons Classic Wool Merino.  (The colors look much more vibrant in person, my digital camera is a POS.)  The bigger balls are ~200 yards each (one full ball), and the smaller ones are ~100 yards each (half a ball each).    This is a simple mesh hat I made out of about 2/3 a ball of Cascade Fixation (cotton/lycra blend).    This is the infamous Coney Island Fireworks Scarf.  It's made of navy blue Brown Sheep Cotton Fleece and blue/copper Trendsetter Yarns Metal.  Never again.  Never friggin' again.    And another scarf made out of beautiful, beautiful Crystal Palace Splash.  This one will be going to hockey games with me next year.    Tonight's UFO is my kitty bed.  I got through quite a bit of it last night, and I have about 5 more inches before I can sew it together.  I'm hoping to finish the knitting tonight, as I think I'm going to need help sewing it together.  After that, I'm hoping to work on the beaded scarf for the   knitalong, or starting a Shapely Tank with some random stash yarn.  And I've decided against frogging the beige hat, so I'll seam that up tonight, if only to free up the needles."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"HOLY SHIT!!! I just turned a heel, and it was SO COOL how it worked!  Okay, the knitting geek is going back to the knitting now :-)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Fireworks scarf: still annoying me. Not only is it boring, but now the eyelash yarn is irreparably tangled, despite keeping the ball in a baggie.  Kittyville hat: needs ears, pom-poms, and end-weaving (why is it that weaving in the ends is the part of the project I hate the most?)  Booga bag: DONE! It's hanging from my coat rack as we speak.  Kool-Aid yarn: tried some last night. I have a aqua/lavender hank that didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped, and a red/pink/purple one that looks pretty cool. Next time I'm going orange/yellow/red. Maybe tonight as a matter of fact!  Tonight I'll probably start the homespun sweater or the cat bed and weave ends into other projects while I watch more hockey. And try to figure out a good way to store my double-point and circular needles. Then, a photo post should be forthcoming."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Why my sock is bad: --I can't stand the color. It's just some random stash yarn that came with a grab bag I ordered. --I can't get even tension for the life of me. It makes the sock look all pebbly. --I cast on too tight, so the top edge pulls in. --I can't see how this damn thing is going to fit around my pudgy ankle. --This would look so much better in a variegated yarn, since the ripple stitch would be more obvious, but I chose a solid. --I haven't gotten to the heel yet. That's gonna be the hard part. --I can't think of a good way to store needle #5 when I'm not working on the sock. Somehow sticking it in the middle of the solidly wound ball of yarn isn't satisfying me.  Why my sock is good: --No ladders! --The pattern is incredibly easy to remember. The stitch repeat is conveniently the number of stitches on one needle. --Working with DPNs is easier than I originally thought. --I think my tension might be starting to even out. --It's going quickly. With probably a total of an hour of work, I've got over 2 inches done.  Right now, the goods are good enough to outweigh the bads, despite having less of them."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I have gotten so little knitting done lately.  Between the wedding (no, don't get excited, not mine!) over the weekend, and trying to set this thing up last night (and I still have way more customizations to add), I've done nothing except try out mistake rib in cruddy Red Heart yarn  last night  early this morning when I couldn't sleep.  I'd really like to get a few more rows done on Charlotte sometime in the near future.  I'm well into color #3 at this point, so row-count-wise I'm halfway through, more or less, but the rows are going to start getting sooooooo long.  I'll probably work on it tonight, if I can keep the cat from playing with the Koigu.  (Hand-painted yarn is not a kitty toy!)  Now I have to think about Christmas presents.  I've finished one (yay!), which isn't as cool as it sounds...it's just a Splash scarf.  They take, like, 3 hours.  Ooooh.  So much work.  (This one's in purples, for Russ's sister.)  I should really get started on Sarah's HP scarf.  She's going to be back from Russia soon, but then, she lives in Arizona, so it's not like she'll need it in the near future.  Maybe I'll procrastinate on that one some more.  I still need to post some pics.  Maybe that'll happen tonight too.  (I know, Mom, I keep saying this and never doing anything about it.)  If you're reading this, go over there ---> and post something on the tagboard!  It's cool, y'know?"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I came to a lovely realization today.  I can knit standing up...provided said knitting is on circular needles.  Yes, I know this is probably rather stupid and legions of knitters have been practicing their craft on foot since the dawn of time.  But, for me, it means that time spent standing at the bus stop need not be wasted!  Huzzah!  Since the last post I: --finished knitting Elise's scarf (just in time, as I was thoroughly bored with the stitch) --finished Broadripple (they're too big, but thankfully they're cotton so they'll shrink a bit) --started like 17 other projects (okay, not really, but my list has gotten more ADD than usual) --came up with like 17,000 other projects I want to do (less of an exaggeration than above) --finished my Christmas knitting list (at least until I remember all the other people who I want to knit things for) --subscribed to Interweave Knits (first issue is to be mailed on the 22nd) --took no pictures of FOs or even WIPs (sorry!)  Now a run-through on the knitalongs I'm participating in:  Tank-Along update:  I think I'll start a Chickami fairly soon.  There are things about Shapely that I don't particularly like, so most likely I won't make another one, at least not for myself.  Charlotte Women update:  Yeah, I haven't done any more since the last time I posted.  I'm not super-motivated to rush through it, as I won't be wearing it until mid-December, so I'm just taking my time.  Lace-Along update:  Finished one scarf, looking for a lace pattern to start the second (like I said before, I am SO SICK of fan-and-feather)  Sophie-Along update:  I hate picking up stitches, in case anyone's wondering.  The Kool-Aid yarn is working up nicely.  Almost to the first set of decreases (I'm on row 8 of the body I think?)  And I'm off."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I've made a LOT of progress on Shapely since last post. Tonight I got to the bust shaping and have done one set (out of 12!) of the short rows. I've done a lot of stockinette stitch today, and have come to the conclusion that I hate purling. Maybe it's all those garter stitch scarves I've done and all the practice I've had at the knit stitch, but my purl rows take twice as long as my knit rows. Maybe next scarf I do I'll purl every row for the practice. It'll look the same.  I think tomorrow's official UFO will be the beaded scarf. I've screwed up so much (already!) in the second row, and mohair's so hard to ""tink"", that I think I need to just start over. I'm not looking forward to casting on 237 stitches again, but every scarf I've seen posted in the knit-along site looks so good that I'm inspired to get cracking on mine. Not tonight though. My eyes are too bleary. But before that I'm seaming up everything that needs seaming and weaving all the ends that need weaving! (I need to start weaving ends as I go. Argh.)"

That can hurt people’s feelings.”  Free emergency counseling for the lactose intolerant and their families. “This one’s close to my heart, since I am a lactose intolerance sufferer and I know the pain and shame that it can bring.”  Psychic Surgery’ and ‘Touch Therapy’ to replace conventional medical procedures. “We’re cleaning up the health-care system one hug at a time. Just remember: there’s no waiting lists for hugs!”  Hot air rainbow ballooning political summits. “It’s hard to be cranky in a rainbow-shaped hot air balloon!

But it’s his homeless iniatives that Carl takes the most pride in. “Traditionally the problem has always been that the homeless are seen as incapable of maintaining a normal existence. We think that’s just a bunch of conservative hard cheese. The real problem is that our homeless people lack the technology to compete in today’s fast paced world, so we’re going to issue each and every panhandler on the street Blackberries and Power Books. It’s time we brought our street people into the twenty-first century and made them able to compete with the tough overseas market.

Well, we're sitting here in a cloud of second hand smoke, we sure aren't getting any healthier, defeating the purpose. Might as well light one up. - Amy  2. Isn't it possible that the stress we are causing to our bodies and minds is worse than the health risks associated with smoking? - Keiran  3. I don't need one I just really want one. It's not because I'm addicted, I just really want one. - Every smoker trying to quit"
T10Q2TK,female,25,"i just wanna remind everyone to vote ndp tomorrow. and believe me, it takes a lot for me to encourage voting. i do believe that it is critical at this point to vote rather than pretend there will be any real participatory democracy anytime soon.   so go vote, don't smoke!!!

T10Q2TK,female,25,i give in....i can't take it.

T10Q2TK,female,25,"I have barely left the apartment, except for a trip to the supermarket.  sleeping as much as possible is an important part of my regimen, and staying up as late as possible for no good reason too.    The ultimate goal - forgetting that I'm trying to quit anything.   The penultimate goal - not smoking.  Why is not smoking a lesser goal then forgetting about it?  Well, since I'm not smoking now, that goal has been achieved.  As long as I'm not thinking about it, I'm not going to smoke.  I'm not going to fall walking down the street and accidentally land face first on a lit cigarette.  But if I'm thinking about it enough, sooner or later one of the times that I'm thinking about it will be when my mind is weak and making excuses.  Oh, the excuses.  A vast arsenal of them just waiting for the right moment to take root and convince your mind that it's ok to have 'just one'.  Well, here are a few excuses that I think make it ok to smoke.  1. You're over 75 or are facing a certain and imminent death (no longer than 2 years away with no hope for a cure).  2. You're undergoing surgery without anaesthetic (piercing and tattooing don't count).  3. Smoking is an integral element of a MacGyveresque attempt to save the world/drive out the tyrants of a small Latin American village/prevent a nuclear meltdown (must have written permission from Richard Dean Anderson).  I would like to point out that just because one person squeals like a pig and goes 'wee wee wee' all the way back to cigarettes, it doesn't give anyone else an excuse to quit.  Excuses are for babies.    Hmmm, I wonder when my desire for the money is going to kick in and I'm going to start encouraging smoking amongst my comrades...."
T10Q2TK,female,25,"Smokin'... See the thing about quitting smoking is that I don't ever really want to. I've been 'quit' for a week now and I hate it. I know the REAL reason I want to smoke is because I'm addicted but the reasons that I'm telling myself in denial have nothing to do with being addicted.  I was remembering a friend today who was so graceful, elegant, and beautiful. When she smoked her girlie cigarettes you felt like they were beautiful and graceful too. I want a pack and I want to take a slim lovely out of it and smoke it with all of the grace I have in me. Unfortunately I am not so graceful and I just want the smoke.  Someone told me the other day that in Cuba, where waaaaaay more people smoke, their average age of death is only like 2 years less than ours, and they're the crappy years anyway. So smoking takes 10 years from your life expectancy, well, I don't really look forward to 70-80 or 80-90 anyway. I'd rather smoke my smokes now and enjoy them than have to have my diaper changed by my own child, or maybe even a stranger in a 'home' I was put in.  Anyway, so I'm still not smoking and I'll do my best not to but god damn, I really fucking want one. JUST ONE (the crying plea of the addict)  AAAAH."
T10Q2TK,female,25,"Don't worry guys, we still love ya. I almost cracked today. If it weren't for that dasterdly, desperate duo of Frank and Beans (Fransisco & Keiran) I'd have been a scab too.

T10Q2TK,female,25,"Finally I am feeling some positive results.  See, I've been sick since the day before I quit with a massive chest cold (I'm sure worsened by quitting) and have yet to feel any sort of positive change in my body. Until, that is, last night when I decided to meet KiKi in town for a drink. I got there on my bicycle with ease and on the way home I felt like Wonder Woman. I was peddling like there was no tomorrow. Half way up steep hills and like a bat out of hell down straightaways. It was great. Now I was still a little winded when I got home but that I believe is because I'm a lazy ass bastard, not in fact because I am a smoker. Cause I AM NOT!! My lungs felt bigger and stronger and more able to help my feeble body through aerobic exercise.   There are benefits to this after all.   Ahhh. I needed something like this or I was going to crack ."

W824VM6,male,23,"Its not easy leaving a job that you like, especially one in which you have florished in. My time at Lord Wandsworth College has been great, and its great to know my work was appreciated. Here is just ONE of the references i recieved form staff who wanted to help me on my way. Quite a good one, and it certanly goes along way in helping me find other work!   Reference -  Will joined the IT staff at Lord Wandsworth College in September 2002 on a fixed term contract.    The College had invested a great deal in establishing a whole school network and required some software support and some expertise in web page design.  Will very quickly showed himself to be an effective worker in these areas and very soon established websites on the schools intranet for those departments which requested them.  Given guidance on content, he was able to transform these ideas into effective websites which caught the imagination and had a very real visual impact on the end-users.  Will learnt a great deal from the tasks demanded of him by the school and was always willing to pick up new ideas and learn new techniques as required for a particular task.  He would often try the find the ideal or exact tool for a particular job and gained a great deal of satisfaction when he mastered it.    After a short time Will was given responsibility for standalone computers which were dotted around the school campus.  He was able to support these effectively and could relatively easily put right hardware and software problems with these machines.    Will likes to work independently but can work as part of a team and did so with the two hardware technicians and the Head of ICT at the College.  He works best when given specific guidelines on the task to be achieved.  Will is a polite and confident young man who had a good record of attendance and punctuality and did not miss any time through illness."

Robbie decided to take full advantage of this and lifted up her little skirt, pushed her thong to one side and gave her a good seeing to (as any Stoke lad would!). ""Its your turn now, Will""  grinned Robbie  But Will started crying.  Robbie asked ""Why are you crying,  Will? What's wrong?""  Will sobbed ""My head won't fit between the railings""."

W824VM6,male,23,"coz there funny, ...!!   Replies Put on Child Support Agency Forms   The following are all replies that women have put on Child Support Agency forms in the section for listing father's details: These are genuine excerpts from the forms.  01. Regarding the identity of the father of my twins, child A was fathered by Jim X. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of child B, but I believe that he was conceived on the same night.  02. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my child as I was being sick out of a window when taken unexpectedly from behind. I can provide you with a list of names of men that I think were at the party if this helps.  03. I do not know the name of the father of my little girl. She was conceived at a party on Acacia Avenue where I had unprotected sex with  a man I met that night. I do remember that the sex was so good that I  fainted. If you do manage to track down the father can you send me his phone number? Thanks.  04. I don't know the identity of the father of my daughter. He drives a BMW that now has a hole made by my stiletto in one of the door panels. Perhaps you can contact BMW service stations in this area and see if he's had it replaced.  05. I have never had sex with a man. I am awaiting a letter from the Pope confirming that my son's conception was immaculate and that he is Christ risen again.  06. I cannot tell you the name of child A's dad as he informs me that to do so would blow his cover and that would have cataclysmic implications for  the economy. I am torn between doing right by you and right by the country. Please advise.  07. I do not know who the father of my child was as all sailors look the same to me. I can confirm that he was on a ship berthed at Norfolk.  08. Peter X is the father of child A. If you do catch up with him can you ask him what he did with my AC/DC CDs?  09. From the dates it seems that my daughter was conceived at Disney -  maybe it really is the Magic Kingdom.  10. So much about that night is a blur. The only thing that I remember for sure is Delia Smith did a program about eggs earlier in the evening. If I'd have stayed in and watched more TV rather than going to the party at Miller Drive, mine might have remained unfertilised.  11. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my baby- after all when you eat a can of beans you can't be sure which one made you fart."

W824VM6,male,23,"ok, so i pinched this from my fellow B'stoke blogger  urlLink Frank ... but iam sure he will understand as this is amusing.   This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was in the local newspaper and even Jay Leno mentioned it. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.  After the wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the brides and his family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception.  As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyones chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.  He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked them to open their envelope. Inside each manila envelope was an 810 glossy of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a private detective to tail them.  After just standing there, just watching the guests reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, Fuck you!. Then he turned to his bride and said, Fuck you!.  Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, Im outta here.  He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While most people would have canceled the wedding immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong.  His revenge.making the brides parents pay over $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the brides and best mans reputations in front of 300 friends and family members.  This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might get a MasterCard priceless commercial out of this?  - Elegant wedding reception for 300 family members and friends$32,000. - Wedding photographs commemorating the occasion$3,000. - Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui$8,500. - The look on everyones face when they see the 810 glossy of the bride humping the best man Priceless."

W824VM6,male,23,"This artcile was taken from the Saintsfc.co.uk website, i think this reflects Southampton and its people very well.   Hiley Controversial is a personal comment piece by web site editor Graham Hiley. It dos not reflect the views of the club or any of its staff.    A hastily scribbled sign in the back of a Southampton mini-bus said it all. It read: ""Cheer up Arsenal, you won!"" To look at many of the Gooners anyone would think they had lost the FA Cup final!  They may have won the trophy but bizarrely there was little joy from their fans many of whom were sitting there with faces like a slapped Arsenal! Contrast that to the Saints supporters who were determined to party even in defeat.  Although they lost the match, they were winners off the field. Even when Arsene Whinger's side were going up to get the Cup, it was the hordes of yellow and blue who were making the most noise.  The announcer said it was his ninth Cup Final and he had never seen so many supporters of the losing side staying behind to applaud their side. And never can the fans of the winning team have been taunted with chants of: ""Shall we sing a song for you?"" while they were celebrating success!  But then somehow that epitomised the difference between the two groups. Maybe it was the fact it was their first final for 27 years, but Saints supporters really captured the spirit of the occasion.  The Arsenal contingent arrived late, filling their end of the ground only in the minutes before kick-off. The Saints got there well beforehand, determined to wring every ounce of emotion out of the day.  The Doom and Gooners turned out in their replica shirts as though it were a uniform; there was no sense of fun, no silly hats or spontaneous fancy dress. For most of the match they sat impassively with arms folded.  The south coast section was filled with painted faces, wigs, kilts. They had come dressed for a party not an event.  Well before kick-off, the north end of the ground was a bouncing, swaying mass of yellow and blue. With the roof on, they really made the rafters rock. The other end of this magnificent stadium was strangely subdued even when their team were winning.  They would have been far more animated and passionate if their side had lost, that's for sure! There was very much a feeling that the Arsenal fans wanted success for its own sake rather than for what it meant.  Having missed out on the coveted Premiership title they demanded a trophy, any trophy just so they did not end up empty-handed. We can't have the one we really want so we'll make do with this one!  But maybe that is the knock-on effect of so many distant plastic fans attaching themselves to a club. They are the sort who know the price of everything but the value of nothing!  And they were fuelled by an arrogant expectation of victory as of right; anything less would reflect badly! It seemed the fear of failure somehow outweighed the pleasure of winning.  They came, did what was expected and moaned about the traffic on the way home. They almost went through the motions of celebrating as if it were expected of them rather than truly savouring the moment.  Meanwhile the Saints supporters were giving an emotional and genuinely warm ovation to their side who have achieved so much this season. The players looked moved by the response as they tried to shrug off the unworthy feeling that they had somehow failed the fans.  Not so. We are all in it together - the players, the supporters in the stadium, those watching at home or in pubs or even abroad. There was hardly an empty seat as Gordon Strachan's men trudged mournfully round the pitch to the dressing room.  Those who left once the team had gone past their section were astonished to find an equal number of Arsenal fans skipping their celebrations to get back to suburbia half an hour earlier. How can you leave when your team is parading the Cup?  Can you imagine the party if Saints had lifted the trophy? It would be going on for weeks. Arsenal fans will no doubt look down their noses, patronise plucky Southampton and sneer that it is an indication of lower expectations.  But the truth is that Saints supporters share a much stronger bond with their side because of it. We felt the pain of the team and vice versa. Players, staff, fans, local media and indeed anyone connected with the city all desperately wanted to see Chris Marsden lift the trophy.  And when it did not happen, the pain did not turn to anger but to a defiant desire to milk the moment anyway. In the traffic jams which are an integral part of any game at the Millennium Stadium, it was the yellow and blue flags which were flying highest.  It was Southampton supporters who were leaning out of windows, swapping drinks and banter. The Saints songs rang loudest, the south coast cars still proudly decked in their colours which should now stay up round the city as a symbol of pride in the team despite the scoreline.  Most of the London-bound drivers had brought their flags and scarves inside - in case they got wet! They might have got the trophy but Saints had the spirit of the occasion. And that is something you cannot put a price on."

DSO5GN9,male,24,As I write this I am waiting for 6 cd-r's to copy the entirety of my work this week.  For those of you who don't know Stampede (our middle school outreach) is this coming week.  As a result I have been editing video upon video for our program.  This year a lot of the creativity for the up front action has offered me a chance to spread my wings.  I ahve put in a good 60 hours this week.  Am I tired? Yes1  Am I cranky.  Surpirisingly no.  I am good spirits.  I have enjoyed my many hours putting the randoms shots in my head onto the screen.  My hope and goal is that my videos wouldn't be a distraction to the gospel.  I count it an extreme blessing to be able to do what I do. I sometimes lose sight of how fortunate that God allows me to serve Him in the capacity that I do.  I know that I would love Him even if I couldn't be a youth pastor.  But I am sure glad He allows me to be one.  I have also enjoyed working with our new high school pastor.  I love to interact with people and bounce ideas off with them.  Our new high school pastor loves to bounce ideas with me.  That has really ministered to me.    Thanks to everyone for your prayers and support for Stampede and for our minstries.

Today, it's a big, fat YAWWWWWN!    As a Christian, I must ponder how the idea of life on other planets will affect my faith.  If we find intelligent life, will those creatures have a soul as we know it?  Will they have contact with God?  Will they have a sin nature just like us?  Will they need Jesus?  How does that change my reading of Genesis?  These questions are far beyond me.    My guess is that unless the Lord returns soon.  We will find life on other planets.  Maybe just a few microbes here and there.  After all, if we find conditions that could have been suitable for life right next door, who know what lies in the Galaxy?Suddenly I feel so small and insignificant.

DSO5GN9,male,24,"Whoo hoo!  Well we got a new (to us) car yesterday.  My wife got up early and checked out some internet sites and found two possible vehicles.  We went to the first dealership (after getting lost a few times) and much to our chagrin the place was closed and we couldn't even find the particular car we were looking for.  So, we headed to our distant second choice...Carmax.    Walking through the door there were about 16 sales people ready and willing to help us.  I thought we would be mauled at first but actually it was quite pleasant.  Our sales lady came up to us and said, ""Hi!  My name is Rehab, just like the Bible.""  I didn't have the heart to tell her that Rahab (not RE-hab) was a prostitute.  Although Rahab did act in faith and keep the Israelite spies, so she couldn't have been all that bad.    Rehab took us around for a few minutes until I found the car we saw on the ad (a 1999 Hyundai Elantra).  The reason this car wasn't high on our list was because it is a 1999 which is older than we wanted.  Despite my misgivings we checked out the car.  It looked great, the body and inside were nice, no real signs of even normal wear and tear of a five year old car.  The best part is that it only has 48,000 miles on it.  That means the previous owner drove it less than 10,000 miles a years.  After taking a test drive my wife and I were convinced.  So, we purchased it.  So, I am now the proud owner of a brand new (to me) car.  I would highly recommend Carmax.  Even though you know you are paying a little more than you could get away with, they treat you right.  Any problems with the car are taken care of before you leave the lot and you can get an actual, real warranty, which is more than you can get with used cars at another dealership.  So, today is a happy day!"
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Pulse   On Friday night I spoke on Postmodernism to our new small group leaders.  I don't know if I made my point, but was just excited to try it to see if I could.    A cool thing was that I saw an Imax movie called ""Pulse"".  The movie chronicles music around the world driven by percussion.  Its amazing to see citizens of earth get so wrapped up in the movement and rhythm.  American Christianity has failed in the area of passionate creativity.  Some might argue that we have passion for God (though there is ample evidence to suggest otherwise), but where is passion blended with creativity.  Most of American Christianity is a cheap parlor trick.  Where are the Lewis', the Rembrandt's, and the Handel's?  Yes, there is something to be said about the plain and simple Gospel, but isn't our king worthy of more than the three chord bubble gum pop, paint by numbers, simple rhyme and meter we've been offering him lately?

It's a hard thing to see yourself apart from your career, especially when you feel like your career is a calling.  Maybe that is what I am uncomfortable with.  What God has made me to be is not my career.  I am His child.  I am uniquely Kevin.    Maybe that's it or maybe I just need a babysitter to come hang out with me while my wife is at work.

DSO5GN9,male,24,"Friday  Well, I finished my classes yesterday.  One final on tuesday and I will be completely done for the semester.  One of my prof's challenged us to remain faithful yesterday.  We were studying 2 Timothy.  He said, ""If you ever feel like you want to quit Christian ministry in any capacity, call me up.  I want to encourage you.  I want to cheer you on.""  Then he started to cry, then I got some tears in my eyes.  It was really moving.  This prof has been really amazing this year.  I definitely under appreciated him.  He wasn't the best speaker, but was so humble and affirming.  He knew my name even before I said anything to him.  I realized just how much the heart of a man is vital and crucial to his effectiveness.  Dr. C doesn't have it all together, but he loves Jesus with all his heart.  I remember one day in class we were talking about him having a different philosophy on women in the leadership of the church than the elders of his church.  He said that he still lets his wishes and desires submit to his authorities.  This is a profound scholar of the New Testament.  If anyone has authority and knowledge on this subject, he does.  Yet, he chooses to submit in humility because God has placed those leaders above him.    Another time in chapel he shared about how he had put his work over his wife.  He was honest enough to say that he had screwed up and given in to the wrong priorities.  He is 65 years old and going strong.  Man, if I become like the Jesus living in that man my life will be well spent.  Thanks Dr. C for showing me how to love our heavenly Father more.  Who is impacting your life right now?  How are they doing it?"
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Just Chillin'   Just a brief check in for you all.  Tonight we make chinese food (Wontons and Egg Rolls).  I could live off pork dumplings.  Last night my wife, two friends, and I babysat for a two year old.  The first order of business...change a diaper.  I am so not ready for kids!  Poop gives me a gag reflex!    Thanks for all your prayers.  The difficult situation is dealt with and we are moving forward.  There is still some pain on behalf of the families involved, but I have done what God requires of me.  Once again, I really felt prayed for, so thanks."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Off to Denver!   Tomorrow, at the butt crack of dawn we leave for Denver.  I am excited to have a chance to travel and rest.  These past months have been a great time of ministry and growth, but they were also very busy.  I've never been to Denver so I am looking forward to it.  I'll be honest, have the pre-trip jitters.  I'm not nervous, but very excited.    School went well this week.  I actually ate lunch with a few guys from the youth ministry class on Tuesday!  I know that sounds really dumb, but considering the fact that I usually eat alone, I was pretty stoked.    One of my prof's talked briefly about postmodernism in class.  He said, ""Postmodernism is nothing!""  It stung pretty bad because I thought he would be someone who would be a little open on postmodernism and Christianity.  It may seem that postmodernism stands for nothing, but I think that is mostly because it is still in the process of deconstructing the current situation.  Here are some things I know postmoderns are  for : 1.  Postmoderns are for community and relationships. 2.  Postmoderns are for transcendence and mystery. 3.  Postmoderns are for authenticity. 4.  Postmoderns are for experience.  There are many more things postmoderns are for, but these are just a start.  What are your thoughts?"

DSO5GN9,male,24,"Utah Bound  I leave for Utah this afternoon.  I don't know what these next few days are going to be like.  I know my dad's family doesn't get a long.  My dad hates his dad and sisters.  They never talk.  Me, my brother, sister and parents are going to be together for the first time in a while.  All this and I am supposed to grieve for my grandmother...I am not even done grieving for Trevor yet.  I still see him in my dreams every once in a while.  I guess what bothers me the most is that I really longingly want to comfort and minister to my family.  I want them to feel the love of Christ.  That's not preaching, but honest to goodness Christ comforting.    Oh, Lord I feel so insignificant, so feeble.  I am no good at helping my family see you.  Every time I try I see them back away.  Father, bring my family into your family.  My heart aches to see that my parents have no hope, not only for the future life, but for the life of today.    Kara read me something from our Celtic Prayer book the other day that talked about the sin of the world being unbelief.  If that is the case then I am a sinner on par with the Stalins and Pol Pots of this world.    I don't believe God will save my family.     That is my sin, that is my unbelief.  I long for times when I can go to my dad and say, ""Isn't God good?""  It's more than seeing my earthly father in heaven.  It's about feeling close to him now.  But frankly my hope is waning.  I'm not the most consistent of prayers with regard to this, but I keep coming back to it.  With all these funeral I realize that my time with my parents is slowly drawing to a close.  I want these last years to be the best they can be, but I fear they will not.  ""Lord, I believe, but help me in my unbelief."""
DSO5GN9,male,24,"San Antonio  This past weekend we took a trip to the city of the Alamo.  There was much relaxing and laughing to be had.  We stayed at a really nice hotel on the riverwalk and ate great food.  It was really good just to get away for a while.  We went to the Alamo (of course) and saw some really cool spanish missions.  Since it was Easter sunday, we weren't at church, but we did church by ouorselves and that really made the weekend enjoyable.  Thanks sweety for such a great time!"
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Well, this weekend was fun.  I met the ""potential dude"".  He seems pretty cool.  His first question to me got us talking about late night talk shows.  I was impressed when he said, ""I love Conan's antics, but his monologue stinks!""  I must say I disagree with him, especially when Conan does the ""string dance"".  Anyone, however, who can appreciate it when Conan goes bowling with a huge whale costume as the ball is ok by me.  Saturday I finally broke down and bought a new pair of flip flops because my old pair (of about four years) had more flop than flip.  We had some close friends over that night and spent the night laughing and playing ""hide and go seek"", which is every bit as fun as it was when I was young.  We also spent a good 20 minutes figuring all the funny ways to use the word 'teat' in a sentence.    Over all a great weekend.  Lot's of laughs.  Good times."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Final Christmas Party   Last night our young marrieds couples class had a pig-out glut fest.  As always I made my world famous Chinese dumplings.  By the looks of the empty plate I brought home I assume they were a hit.    We had some interesting conversations, including afterbirth and fecal matter.  We all laughed a ton.  What I noticed was that the group really had a good time together.  We shared embarrassing moments and developed some camaraderie.  My hope for our group is that we make some more strides for personal intimacy.  So that we may encourage on another and truly know how to pray for one another, not just for decisions to make or relationships to be built.  I would like to be able to know what frustrates people enough to pray for those things.  I don't know how much intimacy is possible, but I know that is what God wants for His people."

DSO5GN9,male,24,"Another Video Made   I made yet another video this week.  I find that I enjoy putting creativity into something that I can see the results fairly quickly.  In ministry you don't get immediate results that often (especially working with middle schoolers).    I have been renewed in my passion for students as of late.  I am enjoying the time on campuses I have been spending.  I also have been paired up with a really great co-leader for our small group.  He is a lot older than I am and he is awesome at connecting with our group.  At first I was a little jealous because he was doing so well, but I realized that my pride is not healthy.  God is using him and I should be excited that we have leaders who have the vision to connect with and love our students.  I also need to see him as an example as someone who I can learn from."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Guys and prayer  Last night was one of the best times we've had in our couples group.  We shared prayer requests and then split off, guys and girls.  As guys we prayed for our spouses and each other.  I have been extremely encouraged by the intimacy and spirituality that has grown in our group recently.  It looked pretty bleak for a while, but now it is really awesome.    While on the subject, I have something to confess.  In a lot of ways I am anti-establishment...Especially anti-Christian establishment.  I have been in ministry long enough to spot the ministries out there that are fake and the ones that are extremely cheesy.  Whether it be Christian fly-fishing, Christian breath mints, Christian diets or the myriad of other things that Christians grab onto to legitimize making a buck.  My confession is that I have had the same ideas about Christian wrestling.  I guess I lumped what I thought was a cheesy idea in with the rest of them.  What I learned last night (with the help of a brother named Travis, who happens to be a wrestler) is that I need to shut up a little.  Travis is a great guy who has broken many of my stereotypes concerning wrestlers.  He is a genuine guy who loves the Lord and wants to make an impact on other people.  For him, wrestling is a hook to bring the Gospel to other people.  I can respect that.    Being anti-establishment I often point out how others are quick to make judgments about my point of view, but quite consistently I make the same snap judgments.  I am sorry for that.  I want to thank Travis for unwittingly breaking down some of the sin in my own life.  To all the wrestlers out there trying to spread the Word of God I say to you, ""Let's get ready to rumble!"""
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Ocean Dreams  It is a beautiful day!  I really just love spring!  I get to start wearing flip-flops and shorts again.  Ok, so I started wearing shorts when the weather was 45 degrees.  I am convinced that Texas hasn't taken the California boy out of me.  I still LOVE hot weather.  I still love anything to do with the ocean.  In fact, I still have a bottle of Pacific ocean water on my desk that is about six years old.  Man, I really really want to go to the ocean right now.  Tuesday night we were helping a lady from our church in a garage sale and she was selling some CD's.  One was the Beach Boys and one look at the CD made me ache for the ocean.  I like the band and all, but me thinks it has more to do with the ocean than anything else."

DSO5GN9,male,24,"Back to school   Tomorrow I start back in school.  I'm excited but am reminded of the experiences of last semester.  Being a commuter student to a campus over 40 miles away it was hard to build relationships with other students.  I spent alot of time alone on campus.  The few friends I did make graduated last semester.  It was kinda hard.  Ok, really hard, but it reminded me of my first semester at TCU where there was much loneliness to be had.  I will be in a few introductory classes this semester and also have a youth ministry class, so I am hoping that I will be able to build some relationships with friends in those classes.    Another thing that has been wierd is that my pastor asked me to stop teaching at an alternative service we have that is geared for young adults.  My primary focus is on middle school ministry, but I love teaching in different contexts.  It has been a joy trying new things and being a little more real with a group of peers.  I'll submit because he's my boss.  I feel bad because the guy that is running the ministry is already working with no support.   Teachers are hard to come by.  I feel like this will really cut the legs from underneath him even more.  We've already lost two good pastors lately, I don't want to lose another close brother in Christ."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Ears Can Bleed   So this morning I attempted to rid myself of a few extraneous hairs on my body.  I noticed that my ears were getting especially bushy.  Normally I am quite adept in the hair removal process.  After all, it does cover every square inch of my body.  Well, this particular time I must have been a little groggy from just waking up.  I missed my hair and got my ear.  It hurt but I didn't think anything of it until about 30 seconds later.  I felt a liquid running down my ear.  Sure enough, the ear was gushing.  I used to think you needed a massive head wound to get this much blood.  Ok so I am exaggerating, but it did surprise me.  Anyone with an ear piercing tell me, did it bleed that much?  That is enough reason to not get a piercing.  I don't even think my tattoo bled that much.  Well, I have got to go get a transfusion.  Have a great day!"
DSO5GN9,male,24,"BTW  Oh, I also went to a Catholic Mass for Ash Wednesday this morning.  I sat next toa youth pastor friend of mine.  It was a good service.  At the end of it my friend said, ""It was nice worshipping with you.""  I said, ""You, too.""  And I meant it.  I have come to appreciate the continuity between Christians of other traditions and those of mine.  Christ is so much bigger than my preconceived notions of Him.  He is much more glorious than the Bible church movement.  I don't know what I am giving up for Lent.  Anyone got any suggestions?"
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Electric Sex  How do you talk about sex to junior high boys?  This is the second time I will be taking a group of guys through the ""sex"" talk.  I look at the world around them and I weep for the pressures they will have to face.  I wonder how can a young man make it through the teen years and still be pure?  It used to be that you had to go looking for sex.  Now it comes to them.  E-mail Spam, TV shows, songs (including Britney Spear's song on self gratification).  What is sad is that what the media is selling to these young men will never, ever be realized in their life.  It's a lie that will never be fulfilled.  I feel for these young men.  I pray for them.  May God fill their hearts and satisfy their desires, not the alluring glow of electric sex.  The hard part is that I know that most likely they will not come through life unscathed.  Just as we all have been scarred by life.  I can't live their life for them.  I can't be with them every second to make the right choices.  But the Spirit is with them and if they do shoot themselves in the foot let's just hope it's only the pinky toe."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"I'm one of the Village People    Last night the wifey and I saw The Village. Shyamalan has a well-deserved reputation for making a quality film with an awesome message. The Village did not disappoint me at all. The movie is visually and thematically stunning. Sure there is the surprise twist that we've all come to expect from M. Night, but that didn't detract me from enjoying the flick.  We often expect greatness from great people (in this case, a director) so that it becomes routine to us. I think this explains some of the mixed reviews this movie has received. We get spoiled with greatness. Lance Armstrong is another example of this. The man has won 6 straight Tour De France's, a feat no one has ever done, but we expect Lance to win. So when he does, no big woop."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"So, what have I been up to?     Not much.  Last weekend we tubed the Guadalupe River and had a blast.  This week I have been leading games for our church elementary aged day camp.  This weekend we are going to Houston.    One surprising thing about this summer is the amount of wakeboarding I have been able to do.  Because I work at a church and my wife works at a church I find that a lot of my activities involve church.  I have very few things in my life that allow me to escape.  One of those is disc golf.  The other is wakeboarding.  I am not very good, but I am just not getting to the point where I can get up and move around.  It's starting to get fun.  I love the water, so being on the lake is about as relaxing as it gets for me, even if I am being pulled all over the place.    There is something kinda quieting about being all by yourself out on the water.  I find that my mind blocks out the noise of the boat.  Being from California I have always envied those who surfed.  Maybe I enjoy wakeboarding because it is the closest thing to surfing I have ever done.  Maybe I am trying to make wakeboarding into a zen experience for me...into something it's not.  I think God enjoys the thrill and rush I get from the sport.  I think the joy I get from being on the water is a gift from Him and I love enjoying the little gifts from God."

I can drive it, but I don't want to do too much driving on it in case something is wrong.    With all this said, I am a little frustrated.  These past few weeks have been really crappy.  I know they could be a lot worse, so I am thankful.  I am trying to have the attitude that Job had.  He told his wife, ""We accept the good from God, why shouldn't we accept the bad?""  That is a good philosophy.    I have to thank my wife who took care of me immensely yesterday.

As Mark Oestreicher asks, ""does a little dose of Buddhism thrown into a belief system somehow kill off the Christian part?""  I don't know.  I have often cited the Mormon's as a very very twisted religion, theologically.  Ironically, I firmly believe that there will many Mormon's who we'll see in heaven.    What is the Gospel?  What are the essentials to the faith?  When Paul went to Ephesus for the first time, the Ephesians we living off of the baptism of John.  They were waiting in faith for the Messiah.  If no one had told them about Jesus, where would they be?  Jesus, on the other hand, seemed to really enjoy pointing out how knowledge had corrupted the pharisees.  Jesus seems to care more about religious the dangers of religious super-pietism than anything else.  Well, I'm rambling.  What are your thoughts?"
DSO5GN9,male,24,"The Uke of Love    A few months ago I procured a Ukulele (An Ukulele???).  Being a lover of all things Hawaiian I thought it would add to my music playing enjoyment.  Once I figured out that the tuning was similar to a guitar I picked up on it quickly.  So far I have enjoyed the soothing sounds of the mellow Uke.  What I've really come to love is unepected benefit to having this instrument.  My wife has for a long time wanted to learn the guitar.  Learning has been hard for her due to her smallish hands and less than calloused fingers.  The Uke is a great fit for her.  The neck is small and the strings are easier to hold down.   Thus, my wife and I have been playing music together, mostly at night before we go to bed.  I have enjoyed having another hobby together.  I must say she is a fast learner.  She can already smoothly transition between most of the major and minor chords.   I find that I love my wife for the harmonies we make, both on and off string instruments.  I love you honey!"

I realized yesterday that my body can't take the spinning and bumping like it used too.  I feel old.  The students were screaming, ""More, More!  but my body was yelling, ""Stop!""  It worries me.

DSO5GN9,male,24,"The Passion   So I was just listening on the radio a review of the movie from a regular, non-Christian radio station.  The reviewer made a great point.  Why is it that Christians praise this movie as the best movie of all time and yet will denounce the evil horrors of movie violence in such films as ""Kill Bill""?  I know that The Passion is history and Kill Bill is not.  But it raises the issue of how Christians are being seen by non-Christians because of our shameless promotion of this movie.  I do think this story needs to be told.  I do believe that the story is the most powerful story ever, but I wonder if this movie is really for the Christians and not ""the greatest evangelism tool ever made"" as some have said.  It will be interesting as to how non-Christians will react.  My hope is that we will see this movie a bridge to open dialogue with other people.   My fear is that non-Christians will in large part not be as affected as we Christians are anticipating.  This is not because the Gospel is less powerful than we make it out to be, but because we will have substituted this movie for building loving relationships with non-Christians.  I will see this movie and I anticipate being moved deeply, but I imagine this movie causing more Christians to kindle afresh the joy of knowing Jesus who is Lord and Christ rather than non-Christians coming to faith.  I could be wrong (Lord, knows I have many times before) and I pray I am.  My hope is in the Holy Spirit and in the love of the saints and the power of Jesus Christ.  These things will be the means of salvation for all people who will believe."

2GXT57U,female,23,"I gave up soda, but not ice cream. Now, when I want soda, I can just eat icecream instead. It is so smooth and sweet... It is so sublime. I would give almost anything for a cup of it right now, but I feel as though I should have given that up too, or that perhaps I should at least resist it as though I had. It is an honorary sacrifice to stand with the soda in support during the banishment. No soda will suffer alone. I pine for ice cream.  I read a book written by a man who smoked a pipe, and half of the words in it were ""fancy that"" and the other half were, ""I haven't any butter, for the maid stopped by today, and she is so fond of fresh butter that I told her she could have some on her toast, but she took advantage of my genorous offer and hid it all in her petty coat. I don't see how she ever got it home.""  It was not a very long book.  I'm very very tired, and the T.V. is on. Reggie, can you think while the T.V. is on?  I ask Reggie questions while I know he cannot be thinking.   ""Reggie, can you hear when the T.V. is on? Can you see, or smell, or speak?""  Reggie turned to me and mumbled something about the dome.   ""The dome?"" I asked. He mumbled again. There's a dome outside of the house next door. That is, around it. It's clear, and is made of a sturdy material, like scratch resistand plexi-glass, or some such thing. It covers the whole house, and I think it's been there ever since the baby was born. I naver saw anyone come and construct the thing over the house. it was just there one day.   Reggie kept trying to talk, but the T.V. was on, and so his senses were warped... like home made paper, and he was still saying something about the plastic dome, so I stopped and listened, and here is what he said.   ""Noke evem sisisisisi over the wall,"" he said.   ""Over the wall?""  ""Yes, kuskus usukkumuh umuh th that tis swut Teye said.""  ""You cannot see over the wall. There is a roof over tha wall, and a plastic thing over the roof. There really isn't any way to get in.""  ""Aliens."" he said.   ""No aliens,"" I told him, ""Just a baby, and a lot of people singing every night. Probably a cult over there. Probably moving things with their minds. They say that's how they built the pyramids.""  Reggie focused, but not enough.   "" They  didn't build the pyramids,"" he objected, pointing to the house.   ""No, not them,"" I corrected, ""The impervious  they .  They  built the pyramids, using just their minds. All at once they made the rocks float.""  ""With slaves dragging beneath them,"" added Reggie, ""And ropes hanging above them. And wheels rolling behind...""  ""By the power of the mind.""  ""Yes, by the power of the mind.""  ""And that's how they got that dome up over that house, too.""  ""I can't think of any other way."" And it's true. I can't. They must be egyptians.  After we had that all cleared up, I read my book again, for the tenth time.   ""Why do you just keep reading that one line over and over?"" asked Reggie, who seemed to be focusing quite well.  ""Are there more lines?"" I asked. I hadn't seen any other lines, but it turned out there was a whole book full, at least a thousand before that line, and at least a thousand more after. I thought,  Well, this make it rather complicated, as I have recommended this book to many people already, being under the impression that it was quite short and concise. As it is I don't think many people will like it much at all. I can see where I missed all those lines before... in retrospect, if I study myself very closely, and the book not at all.   Well, Reggie pointed out that if I was wrong about that, then possibly I was wrong about the pyramids and the plastic dome over the neighbors house, but I still haven't any better explanation."
2GXT57U,female,23,"Today will be a nice day, I guess. I will do whatever I have to, and then I will come home and do whatever I have to again. If I'm lucky, there will be a chinese buffet somewhere between. I'm going to gain 20 pounds this month, eating chinese food, but it will be good weight. It will be for the tail I'm growing. I'm using all of my controlling powers to grow wings and a tail. It's easier to grow wings because they are just flat and thin... hmm... unless I want good strong wings. Then, I guess I will have to start by growing an extra pair of arms on my back, and then elongating the fingers, and growing extra skin and all... Hmm. That will be hard.  A tail is kind of complicated too, because of all the little joints and everything, but it at least doesn't entail growing any extra parts -- just making my spine longer. Maybe I'll do without the tail and just go for the wings. Tails kind of get in the way. Wings, on the other hand, they can be very useful as long as you now how to dress with them. The secret to that is wearing tops that wrap around, rather than going over the head. I expect I would get a lot of attention if I had wings, unless I decided to simply live in the trees, and just swoop down every once in a while to snag some lunch. In that case, I might need a tail.  It's probably kind of hard to just swoop down at a Chinese buffet, because of the roof, but I could always send someone in for me, and then swoop down and take it from them. It's not really preditorial though, if I hired someone to go in there. My legs aren't really built for a flyer, but I guess I could fold them up under me.  Now, if I'm going to have wings, I think I should have pointy ears too. That shouldn't be hard to do. It probably won't really help me hear or anything, but it would look nice, and I could grow my hair out and make it all purple and green and irridescent to match my wings. It sounds gaudy, but I can see it all in my head and it doesn't look bad. I would wear a lot of flowers and stuff, and my little wrap around top. Now, what to wear on the bottom, that's a problem. It looks nice to wear a flowy black skirt, but think about it: if I'm flying around a lot and wearing a skirt, then people are going to be able to see my underwear. I'd better just wear my green puffy pants and a sash. That's better anyway, because I don't want to spill sweet and sour sauce on my nice black skirt. I think I'll just throw out the tail idea all together."

I told it that these days we use metal nail files or emery boards, but it'd better by the metal kind, because I don't know how well cardboard would hold up under his claws.

2GXT57U,female,23,"A Poem  Rain pours down in blankets. The sky is utter blackness Behind the darkened clouds I would see only more black masses My body facing skyward, Behind, the bed of fall Alone. Does darkness take me? Alone, and that is all.  Alas, so the sun hides and the rain shrouds my eyes And I see another shadow  Charging onward in the skies And I hear not a whisper but a moaning in the the trees.  Is this the superfluous call that death makes to his seized?  Alas, so the waning of night approaches And I still see not the light of day.  Alas, alas!  So there is crying in the distance And spittle on the breaking light of day!  Do I brave to call upon hope? A fatuous prangster!  Do I chance to speak the tongue of love? I refuse such an answer!  Weigh the mammoth revelations of a truth,  Or a purpose to this rough perseity And never brave to gaze above The sight of mine own eyes Or ponder on the of thought deity?  Live beneath this darkness,  For it is fruitless and it will not hurt my eyes! And searching ever upward For those ever luming  Omens in the skies!  Live this way and fight Not for love, for hope, for anything  for which we fight in foolish pride  in thinking we will win. Live beneath this darkness And do not hope or search or love And never life  be toilsome again."

I find the experience quite pleasurable and hope that thou doest feel the same. Thy whilst write me, I hope, I implore thee.  -SuperEgoman   Dear SuperEgoman  Your flowery turn of phrase has me all melty inside. It inspires me to write poetry. O, mocking fish O mocking fish I hardly ever mock thee. I threw a fish  And made a wish. It turned the lake to sake.  -Mulya.   Dear Mulya,  A fish!!?? Why would thine write about a fish and not a dog, or a fluffely, fluffely kitten? Those are creatures worth writing about. Fish are slimy, and they eat worms.  -SuperEgoman  I don't like cats. I like fish. -Mulya  Dear Mulya,  I am shocked and chagrined. My heart is full of rage. My head is exploding with anger. You are a terrible person. You are a brainless flibbertygibbet, a mindless ninkumpoop, a wall-bumping bimbo, and an unthinkably thimblewitted moron. Everything about you is weak and insignificant. Write back, luvvy. -SuperEgoman  I, being a disgusting excuse for a person, did not write back, but the next day, he rightly confronted me.  S.E.M.: Why didn't you return my email?  Me: I didn't know what to say!  S.E.M.: Ha! Your powers of comprehension are too weak for my enormous brain-thoughts! I have rendered you speechless!  Me: You told me I was terrible and weak. I didn't feel like answering.  S.E.M.: How could you answer!? I slew your attempts with my uncanny wit!  Me: You're a narcissistic a**hole!  S.E.M.: Oooo! That's a big word! Try this one for size: Antidisestablishmentarianism. Ah ha! Your scathing yet accurate description of my character stands no chance against my twelve syllable vocabulary!  Me: Curses! You're right. Just standing in your presence is making my brain collapse! I am writhing in pain. Ah! I am convulsing! Ack! Cough, choke, I'm dying. Cough, choke, I die!

2GXT57U,female,23,"It was icy and horrible out today, but it was still nice. The ice was melting because the weather was not cold enough to sustain its tenacity, and I know that it was a disappointment to someone, because I heard a voice in the wind saying, ""We've got cold ice today. Let's keep it all nice and cold. It's got to stick to everything now.""  Whoever it is that works on our weather every day was having some trouble with the machines, and had really had their hearts set on ice for the whole week. What we have right now has lasted the whole day, but I don't think it's going to stay all week. Most of us are pretty happy, but I feel sorry for the workers, because their supervisor was really getting after them. It wasn't their fault though. Like I said, the machines were broken. Maybe by tomorrow, they'll be working again, but I hope not, because I like it when it starts to get warmer.  I think I know what the problem is, not with the machine, but with the weather company. They don't want to keep producing snow, so they figure if they just keep it cold enough, the streets will be covered in white for longer periods of time, without them having to use the resources to produce as much snow, plus they don't need as many workers that way. I think it's really sad when the weather people start cutting it that close."

I said to him, ""I would rather you were not here."" but he wanted very much to be with me.   ""But you are a rat, and I am a girl,"" I said. He did not speak. Zinky never spoke.   I met some kind of bird one when i was only a child. I followed it for years and years. I followed it when it ate and when it drank. i climbed trees and waited for it to alight.   It said to me, ""You are a girl, and I am a bird. Where will we go that we can be friends together and still be free?""  I said, ""Heaven can tell,"" so it flew away, into the sky.   Now there is Zinky. I said to him, ""Stay away from me.""

I remember, because he had grey brown hair and he was balding. Nobody had to tell me that, and there were square lights, and I was very upset. That's when he turned me up-side-down, and hit me on my foot.   Other:  And what did you do?   Mulya:  Well, I started to scream. That's what any baby would do, isn't it? Anyway, that's where I was born... in a hospital, and do you have any other questions?   Other:  I do. Did you write the story about the toad and the frog? I wondered because it gave me terrible nightmares.   Mulya:  I did. It wasn't supposed to scare anyone.

2GXT57U,female,23,"A major misunderstanding in the modern world is that there are not people walking this land who turn into wolves, but whether it is a conscious transformation, or an uncontrollable one, there are certainly plenty of people alive today who have, or are in the process of, turning into wolves. There are, as a matter of fact, known cases of both willed and forced human transformations into wolves. Often times, people who are predisposed to wolf transformation are inclined to heighten their chances of developing it by acting in a wolfish manner (eg growling at passers-by, becoming extremely territorial to the point of violence, attacking with teeth and fingernails) victims of this growing phenomenon are also known use these same tactics to aggravate the condition.  I would like to point out that while, in nature, wolves are not necessarily violent, they are generally not trustworthy of people, and will growl in warning, or attack if pushed to do so. Regretfully, humans who have become wolves do not have the commodity of isolation from non-wolf humans, yet still feel threatened by their presence. Yet, much like natural born wolves, they can learn to adapt.   One must ask himself: Why do those who have the choice to restrain their wolf attributes in luau of a sound, human life decide instead to feed and harvest these tendencies? The answer lies in the social structure of wolven domains.  More to come: In my next blog, I will be discussing the social advantages of being a wolf in modern American society, as well as the emotional voids that being a wolf can fill.  I will also talk about what signs to look for if you have cause to suspect a wolf epidemic in your workplace or home."

This is something to think about.) and tell about my day.  My day was surprisingly short. Just when it should have been morning, it was noon, and then right when my quiet evening was at a beginning, night fell. Then I socalized. I had three voices too, but mine were the guys I sat with, and I didn't listen to any of them. I was too busy choking on clouds of black smoke, which I fanned with a menu, until the fellow next to me got scolded by the other fellow next to me, and everybody switched hands and blew towards the fellow across from me, who choked less and didn't seem to mind.  I came home to my comfortable green walls and my computerized nest, where I punched buttons, turned dials, and pacified myself with the safe green glow of tiny little electronic dots on these things and those, informing me that all was well.   ""Everything is in working order.""  When it comes to little green dots, no news is bad news. It is the worst of news.

2GXT57U,female,23,"Some day the world will be a better place. People will not feel bad about who they are. Schools will not teach things that make people feel bad... like math. When students are learning math, it is hard, and it makes them feel bad. Some day, students will not have to learn math, or English, or any other subject that makes them feel bad.   School will be more like a play ground, and children will be free to play and fight and run around as they please. Teachers will not oppress their natural, creative tendencies.   After these students graduate, and grow up and take over the world, and all of the people who might have tried to make them feel bad by being older or smarter or wiser then them will be dead, or locked up in homes to peacefully wilt out of existence. Then, it will be time for them to really mold the world into what it should be.  No longer will humanity be oppressed by society or language, or manners or clothes or dishes. No longer will children suffer under the yolk of modesty, cleanliness, responsibility, or brotherhood. They will live as they were intended to live, naked and free. They will live in gardens and eat from troughs like sophisticated pigs. They will do as they please. No one man will owe debts to another. They will take everything they need from the ground. Water will rain upon them, and they will drink. Fires will burn, and they will be warm.  How proud will they be, the self sufficient men! To have pride is to know that one has succeeded.

I heard them say it on the news, and I heard them saying it on the other side of the door while I was hiding behind it this morning. The big people are coming.  The big people are coming! They approach!   As the distance between us diminishes, I cry out to my loved ones, ""Hurry! Hide, at once! I hear them outside our window!""  I saw a boy riding past on a brown pony carrying a letter with a red ribbon around it. I tried to stop him, but he just kept on going. I called out to him, and asked him what the letter said.  ""I don't know,"" he called back, ""I can't read! But the letters are this: T-h-e space b-i-g space p-e-o-p-l-e space a-r-e space c-o-m-i-n-g!"" He was riding on his pony, and I on my bike, following. His name was Madison. I know because I asked him, right before we were seperated by the speed of his animal. I wonder where he was going.  He came back about an hour later, still on his pony. He introduced it to me.   ""This,"" he said, ""Is Dolly. She is my pony, and I am a pony courier.""   I had heard from a friend that the big people were coming, and I asked Madison if he knew anything about them.   ""Not much,"" he admitted, ""Except that I know it's very bad if they find you. If they find you, they'll make you disappear, but if they see you working very hard -- I mean very hard, harder than you've ever worked before -- then they might let you go. That's why Dolly and I got this job. I wouldn't want them to make her disappear either.""  I've heard all kinds of things about them, but I have never seen them. Once I thought I saw them. There were several men standing about in a construction site. They were very big, bigger than any men I had ever seen, and they were all dressed alike, too.   They were laughing and talking and eating sandwiches, and suddenly I heard one of them say, ""Hurry and get to work! The big people are coming!"" I went up to them to ask about the big people, but one of them just threw a hammer to me and told me not to look up until the big people were gone.  ""If they see you face, they'll steal your soul,"" said one man.  As we worked, I heard footsteps approaching. Louder and louder they got, until each one sounded like a clap of thunder. When they had gone, I asked the men what they were building.   ""Nothing at all,"" they told me, ""Why if we ever finished, the big people would come and take us away, so we just keep working and working.""  ""My job is to build it,"" said one man.  ""And my job is to tear it down,"" called another man from the back.  ""They can't take my soul by looking at my face."" I told them, ""Only God can say where my soul goes.""   One man shrugged, ""All I know is that the big people are very big."" When he said it, I saw a sweat break right above his brow, and I knew at once that we were dealing with a powerful force.  I heard them say that the big people were coming today. We'd better all run for our lives."

""You're in my room!"" I exclaimed, ""A woman's room, and what's more, I am a stranger! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?""  Again, he shook his head, and then, as if this were not insulting enough, he blew in my hair -- an act of sheer incolence, if you ask me!  I proceeded to scold him, ""How dare you be so cavalier! Didn't your mother ever teach you manners? What a world we're coming to, where a man can just traipse into a woman's room and assume he will go unnoticed!""

You're the reason it's become this way!""  At that, he blew on me again, and shook his head some more. Suddenly I felt sorry for the man. As I stepped back to get a good look at him, I noticed that he was very thin, and at least a foot shorter than myself. He also had a very big head, and was, over all, quite malformed. Perhaps he was merely looking for acceptance, and in his search came upon a home. Perhaps there was something warm about this home, something inviting that made him feel as though someime inside must feel the same as he did. Someone inside would be understanding. I realised that during our whole conversation, he had not said one word.   ""Can't you talk,"" I said. He shook his head 'no.'  ""How awful."" My heart went out to him. I told him that he could stay a while until we found a better place for him. I didn't think that this was too harsh, as a guest cannot expect to find perminent lodging among perfect strangers. I did, however, request that he stay in a different room, as it was not proper for a man and woman who were not married to be staying together in one room, but he disagreed, and blew in my face again.   ""Now see here!,"" I fussed, ""That is a very rude gesture which I do not appreciate! If you keep doing that, I shall have to ask you to leave at once!"" Again, he blew in my face, desheveling my hair-do.  I attempted to lead him towards the doorway, but it was at this time that I noticed he had tied himself to the wall! I could not imagine what would have driven him to do such a thing. I informed him that if he did not untie himself and leave at once, I would call the police, but when I thought about what he may have already been through, I could not bring myself to do it.  I resolved to bring him to Reggie's attention, and ask what he thought might be done with the man.   Reggie, patting me on the back, chuckled in his assuring way, and apoligized.  ""For,"" said he, ""It is I who invited this man to stay. I thought that he would find this place and you hospitable, and I suggested that he tie himself to the wall in case a strong draft occured. One can never be too careful.""  ""It is drafty in here, "" I agreed, and that is how I came to let this man stay in my room, but I still don't think it's quite proper, and no matter how many times I have asked him, he will not desist his shaking and blowing around.

He picks up a white, wooden box. It's my box that I've had since I was a kid, and I always liked it because there is a picture of a girl on the lid who looks like me. There is a boy too, holding the girl's hand, and he looks like a boy I used to know. Billy was his name. He was my first boyfriend, when I was twelve years old.  ""What's in the box?"" asks Reggie.   ""Nothing."" I tell him.   He taunts me, ""Tell me what's in the box.""  ""No.""  ""Tell me what's in the box, or I'll tickle your knees.""  ""No!"" I say, ""Okay,"" and I open the box.  The inside of the box is pink satin with a triangular mirror on the bottom of the lid, but when I open it, I don't see a mirror. I see my face, because I am in that box.   It's filled with papers that look insignificant. The first one, on the top, is a sketch of a girl with horns, that has been outlined with a black permanent marker. Beneath the girl is a name, and beneath that is the phrase, ""good fortune."" She is my other alter ego.  Next is an orange paper that reads, ""Actors theater of Louisville EMPTY SEAT PASS."" It is from the time I didn't go on a date, but ended up having a coke and a good conversation after the play. There is a playing card, a king of diamonds with my name on it,  that a magician gave me. We used to talk on the phone. There is a paper with some poems that I wrote during algebra class in my first year of high school:   ""Put down that gun!"" I said to the nun, but never did she listen. She blew off my head,  and now I am dead. Boy! She's been practicin'!   My teacher was a nun. No wonder I had to take algebra twice.  There is a ""magic"" card, a letter to God, and the remains of a burnt paper cup that nobody else knows I have. My friends and I once had a fake saonce in front of the church, and as the pastor walked by he said, ""Be careful kids."" We should have been formally shooed from the premise, or maybe dragged home to our parents by the ears, but nobody had time, and anyway, at least a third of us grew up into well adjusted adults, and I got a burnt paper cup out of it.   There are several notes from the brooding poet I dated in highschool, a couple from the other boys I liked, and a picture of a monster by my friend Erin, entitled, ""Fangtallor Antenna-Head."" There is also the moon in my box. Someone once gave me the moon, and I have it still, and if you don't believe me, ask Reggie. He is looking at it now. It is the size of a penny, but thinner and lighter, and it is silver. Whatever is in the sky now must be what they use to replace the moon whenever it gets stolen.  Reggie turns the moon over in his fingers, and I dig through more papers. It is amazing how much I was able to fit in this tiny little box. There is a painted rock from my aunt.    She gave it to me at the time when the average rock filled up my whole fist, and she said, ""A rock is the best kind of pet to have. You can wake up in the morning and smile at it, and it just smiles right back."" Of course, it's face was painted there, but it was true all the same. I named him Roch, which, in German, means ""glory.""  I find cards with pictures of Jesus and Mary from Catholic funerals, a receipt from a boutonniere that dates back to before grocery stores had ""plus"" cards, a silver dollar certificate, and a note with a phone number from a man named Eugene who wants me to call him any day of the week after 5:00. I wonder if the offer still stands.  I also find a note from Billy, the one who looks like the boy in the lid of my box.   A picture of an eye, A picture of a heart, and the letter ""U"": It is written in pink. On the inside of the note is an invitation to his band recital, but I just realized that. It says that he is having one, and until this moment, it never occurred to me that he was telling me because he wanted me to go. I went to a dance with Billy once, and he had skinny shoulders. I read the note twice, and then put it back in the box. I have to save this one, because Billy is dead.  ""Reggie,"" I say, ""God-machine, give me back the moon. I'm putting my box away."" He gives it back to me. I slip it in between an old memory and a ghost. As I close the box, I notice that the hinges are broken. I think about the humanity of my box and imagine people crying at my wedding some day.   I have a silent thought, but I finish it aloud, for ol' Reggie's benifit.   ""Actually Reggie,"" I start, ""If you really must know, all little girls get replaced, but sometimes they leave behind white, wooden boxes."""
2GXT57U,female,23,"I didn't write for a whole month and two days because I did not feel like talking about wolves any more. I prefer not to write about wolves at all from this day forth.

The Easter Bunny  3. Geraldo Rivera  4. The Tooth Fairy  5. Peanuts (also called goober peas)  6. Wood elves  7. Banchees  This concludes my list."
2GXT57U,female,23,"On a house on the top of a hill was a window that had been broken, and inside of this house were Little, a man whose soul was laden with guilt, Mr. Bighead, a man whose head was large, and who often took the liberty of permitting people to be just the way they were, and Joy, a woman who simply was.    The three of them, as well as many others, had lived in the house for many years. The house had no doors, and the window had never been opened for air. Everyone in the house assumed that this window was a moving picture, and had never before attempted to open it.     Often times, before the window had been broken, people in the house would gaze upon it, and ask each other, ""How do you think this picture was made?""     From the window they could view a vast heap of land, several trees, and far below, a house with people that walked in and around it. When the picture became white, the house got colder, and they lit a fire in the fire place. When it turned green, they fanned themselves with paper and consumed enormous quantities of ice.     It was Little who broke the window, and frightened the people, who had always presumed the other side was flat and gray. Little was prone to fits of rage, for he could not live with himself and the guilt he felt for being alive in the world, and breathing up the air of his fellow people.        On a day, when he was feeling particularly vulnerable and inferior, his friend, Joy, said to him, ""Hello Little. You look a little drawn out today.""    ""I'm sorry!,"" cried Little, and he emitted a shriek, ""It isn't my fault I'm alive!""    ""You have every right to be sorry for being alive,"" said Mr. Bighead, ""But I will thank you not to scream. Screaming is so elementary.""      Joy interjected, ""I don't think that's what you mean. I think you mean juvenile, or childish.""    ""So you do,"" replied Mr. Bighead, ""It is your right to have your own feelings about what I mean to say.""   Joy grinned and said, ""As long as you're happy.""    Little smashed his head into the window.    The next day, the window was still broken, and the picture was letting in lots of wind, which did not seem at all logical to the house tenants. This upset Little all the more, for the people in the house were all very worried, and it was all his fault.    ""It isn't my fault!,"" he screamed, ""It isn't at all my fault!"" and he flailed his arms about in the air until he had fainted.     ""It isn't his fault,"" said Joy, and kissed him on the nose.     ""It is indeed his fault,"" replied Mr. Bighead, ""But he has every right to believe that it is not. I won't try to take that away from him.""    The other people in the house demanded that someone look at the other side of the broken picture, and find out why it was blowing air at them.     Mr. Bighead volunteered Little for the job, saying, ""This is his fault, which is quite all right, for he is perfectly entitled to be at fault. He can look at the other side of the picture if he feels privlaged.""    Little lifted the window, but the picture did not move, and the frame did not detach from the wall.     ""I suppose I will have to step around to the other side of this picture. When I do, I will have to become very flat, so that I will be between the picture and the wall. I hope that this can be done. "" Everyone agreed that this seemed quite plausible, but they were all very surprised when, instead of becoming flat, he turned up walking around inside of the picture.     The people gasped.    ""Did you know,"" said Little, ""That out here there is a house just like the one that we often look at in our picture!? You can't see it, I think, because... You must all be inside it!""    Then Joy and Mr. Bighead stepped out and joined him. Astounded with this new discovery, they invited the rest of the dwellers to step out as well, which a few of them were inclined to do.    Suddenly the house was swarming with reporters and helicopters with many lights and cameras. One of the reporters approached Little, and then jumped at the sight of him, for there was still a shard of glass sticking out of his left temple.      ""Do you live in this house?"" she asked.    ""Yes,"" said Little, ""But it isn't my fault! I have lived in it all of my life!"" and he began to wail.    ""You'll have to excuse my friend,"" said the amiable Mr. Bighead, ""He is exceptional. He became that way when he was born. We think it may have been something that couldn't be stopped. Anyway, now that he has a piece of glass sticking out of his head, he is bound to be aggravated, but it is his prerogative.""    ""And who are you?"" asked the reporter.    ""I am Mr. Bighead,"" he replied, ""They call me so because I am a big man with big body and a big head. My brain is enormous, too.""    ""Well!"" The reporter was so impressed, she could hardly think, ""We're all here because no one has ever come in or out of this house before. What will you all do now that you are outside?""    ""I imagine we'll go on a journey."" said Mr. Bighead.    ""Where too?"" asked the reporter.     He thought earnestly and then replied, ""All around the world, I would guess. We will go all around the world and see what it looks like.""    ""How long do you think that will take?"" asked the reporter.     ""Oh, about a day,"" said Mr. Bighead, ""When Little wakes up from his hysteria, Joy will take him by the hand, and we'll all go looking around the world and writing down what we see.""    ""Oh?"" said the reporter, ""And then what?""    ""And then we will go back home."" said Mr. Bighead, ""We will have a lot of work to do in the morning. I'll be reminding Joy a lot.""    ""Of what?"" asked the reporter.    ""Of everything we saw while we were out. It won't be hard. I'll have written everything down.""  ""But whatever for?"" asked the reporter, ""Won't she remember?""  ""Oh yes,"" said Mr. Bighead ""But this way we can get it detail for detail. Joy is a mighty good painter, and we need her to paint a picture of the outside.""    The reporter stretched the microphone towards Mr. Bighead and asked, ""What will you do with such a painting?""    He sighed, as though exasperated by such foolishness.     ""We will replace the old one,"" he said, ""The one that Little broke last night. Then we will all be comfortable again."""
2GXT57U,female,23,"The noise that beating wings create with the pavement is even more fascinating than the cicada mating calls, but the latter outweighs the former in sheer pandemonium. The beating wings and the male chorus combined is almost overwhelming. Cicadas are the loudest insects on record, as far as I know. I had a chance tonight to simply stand outside and listen to them, as it is the beginning of the second week of their brooding emergence. Things are getting wild around here.  On my birthday, which was a good week and a day ago, I saw the first one. We named him Herbert and brought him to my picnic as the guest of honor. (Never mind me. I'm just the birthday girl...) My sister made a cake that looked like a cicada, which I believe was also dubbed Herbert. We ate him, but not the real cicada, who ended up flitting clumsily along the street with the rest of his kind. They are notoriously clumsy creatures, and until recently, I didn't even think they could fly more than a few feet.  About halfway into that first week, or maybe more towards the end, my sister and I discovered clusters of them inhabiting some bushes in the park. A few days later, we couldn't go anywhere without seeing them. Today, I saw one in a restaurant. The waiter and the cooks fidgeted nervously when it went weaving over our unprepared meals, but there was  nothing they could do to stop it. The insect was faster and more agile than I had ever expected a cicada to be, and if they had been able to get rid of it, not one of them could estimate just how swiftly another one would come in to take its place, and I didn't dare them to try.  Then, tonight, I saw them as I had never seen them before. In the past couple of days, the noise has been like everyone in the neighborhood mowing their lawns all at once, with the occasional incongruous chirping of a male hasty to find his mate. Tonight, when twilight had ended and the sky was black and bleary after a wanting evening, a street light shown over an empty cement patch, and I saw them again. They surrounded the light the same way moths do, only they were even more hearty a swarm than I have ever witnessed in the insect world. On the ground were the ones who beat their wings unsuccessfully. The sound is almost like a thousand little tamberines, each one with its own peculiar rhythm; each one apart from the rest, in theory, yet lost in the turbid bumble of the congregation. From the trees came the same fervent chorus that plays throughout the day. It never seems to stop.   Every once in a while, the clap and snap of wings would grab my attention as one of them launched itself off of the ground, and I would feel the flick of its body on my shin. Then I heard a howl in the distance. I thought, at first, that it was some other animal, but peering into the distance, I could make nothing out. The sound grew, and abated in cycles. It was yet another song of the cicadas, who continue to arrest and enchant me. They have not yet reached the peak of their season, at which point I imagine they will come upon us like showers, and we will watch them from windows as we view creatures in a glass case at the zoo, only this time, we will be the ones who are encased. For now, it is their time to flourish, and ours to wait, like good mortals who cannot direct the universe in the interest of our comforts. After a seventeen year wait, their is no doubt of who will make the greater compromise."
2GXT57U,female,23,"It's that time of night, so there isn't any use trying to think of things that are trying to think about me wanting to know what you think they might be, so I asked you to stop, but you didn't stop because you thought that you would find out, but you didn't find out, and now I am just telling you to forget about it so that you won't go on like this, but you can't forget about it because you've gone on like this for so long, and now everyone else wants to know too. See? You shouldn't have promised them anything. Now they're all waiting at your front door, and you're thinking about them and watching them and hoping that they will go away, but they aren't going to go away until you tell them what, and you won't know what until I tell you, and I'll never tell you because I don't know what, because its not my job.We went walking and you still had to keep an eye on your front door, and they were all setting up tents, so you left out the back because I told you that would be a good idea, and now you're trying to figure it all out from me, but see, i already told you: I didn't know. Now I'm trying to figure out something about you. Why can I see through you? Just because you are tranluscent blue and made of water, and I'm not blind, doesn't mean that i should be able to look right through you, or maybe it does. Like I said before, I don't know. Then we go back and I begin to wonder why I always have to do everything in present tense. Well if you wan tto tell them, then go right ahead, if you think I'm lying to you and actually i do know the thing and I have just been refusing to tell you, and no, I don't think that you look good in that dress because it belongs to me. I saw a man wearing a black mini-skirt and a pink baby-tee today, and he smiled at me, and I thought it was much too cold for him to be wearing an outfit like that and that if he wanted to dress like a woman he could take a tip from me and buy a sweater and some jeans. I am a woman after all, even when I'm covered from head to toe in cotton knits and knotted in my red wool scarf. It was cold today, so when a man in a dress shook his hips and flicked his wrist at me with a smile, I just wanted to tell him to put more cloths on. i think he thought I was boy. I've never looked like a man, but I've often looked like a boy when I was bundled up tight. I thought about being knitted rigth into a knitting, and being part of a scarf or a jacket instead of just wrapping it around me. I also thought about making things hard to read, because that's kind of like being in a knit. Its like counting strands of fiber that have been knitted togather. There, you see? I told you. People are always asking why. Now I understand why thy do that because I was looking through you, and now I see why you want to know the answer when you look at something. If this doesn't make a lot of sense it's because rabbit. The end."
2GXT57U,female,23,"A story about things I have never written before:  ""I really don't like vegetarians,"" said Miki to her friends for no particular reason. They take away all of the fun. If I were an animal, I would rather be cooked than live on a farm all of my life.""  ""City girls!"" smirked Rody. He was a dashing fellow who came from nowhere at all. Everyone loved him and thought he was just the bees knees, only they wished he wouldn't carry a hatchet in his back pocket. It seemed rude somehow.   He was sitting next to Rhondina, who had the power to turn into an acorn. All she had to do was say the words ""Huzza kuzza, I am an acorn."" and she would be an acorn. It came in handy many times, only the night before she discovered that her transformations also occurred when other people made this statement. She and Sir Hobbington had been making passionate fun beneath a coconut tree at the time.   Later that day, SueAnne hit Henry in the head with a pineapple and  everyone laughed afterwards. Fifteen minutes later, poor Henry had an attack that drove him completely mad.   The six of them all went out for lattes at the local cafe, and he ordered a coney. The others asked the waitress to humor him, but they didn't serve coneys, and so neither did she. At last he came to his senses, as everyone agreed he should.  Then, Paper Jones made a fatal mistake. He fell into the fish tank. Most everyone had the feeling that he did it on purpose, although they didn't know why.  Later that day, Miki started complaining about vegetarians again, Rody smacked Mad Henry in the head with a pineapple, and Rhondina turned into an acorn.   Happily, SueAnne had a plate full of livercheese and onions. Almost everyone felt that the entire situation was absurd, and resolved never to do it again.  The end"

At the ball, everyone thought that Teeni would have the best time, but in fact it was Marina, and she said that was mostly due to the fact that no one else was alive.  ""That would put the rest of the company in rather an ill light."" said Teeni of the situation. Presently, she collapsed with the rest of them, and marina swallowed the key.   When it was all over, nobody made a sound, and that was the way they liked it.  The end"

2GXT57U,female,23,"I couldn't write for a few days because I was floating around in space. Actually, I lie. I was still within the Earth's atmosphere, but I might as well have been in space, because it was just as lonely up there.   I had eaten a lot of sugar that day, even thought the doctor says it's bad for me. I can go a goodly while without indulging, but then I just splurge, and the terrible thing that happens is that my body gets very upset with me, and punishes me. Usually I get extremely nervous, and shaky, and my head starts to feel light, as if it would float away. That's why at first I really thought it was my head that was floating away, but, in fact, it was my whole body.  A few people tried to stop me by pulling at my legs, but I was afraid they would tear off my cloths, so I kicked them away. Then they tried tugging at my feet, but all that happened was that I lost my shoes, and then I just had cold feet, and I was still floating away, so it didn't do them a bit of good anyway.   I floated pretty far, but I didn't see that much, as I was terrified to look down for a long time. When I finally did gather enough courage to take a peek at what I was missing, I had already missed it, for there was nothing but sky below me.   I stayed that way for at least an hour before I started wondering if anyone was worried about me.  I doubt anyone is really worried about me  I thought, pouting, but there was no one there to see me pout, so it didn't do me any good. I decided I'd better write a note and make sure that someone out in the world would understand my dire situation, and possibly send up a helicopter so that I could be on television.   ""To whomever this concerns,"" it stated, ""This is Mulya. I just want you to know that I am floating several miles above you, and am quite all right. Please send food and media attention.""  I crumpled the letter into a ball so that it would fall at a speedy rate, and tossed it over my shoulder for good luck. About six hours passed, and I floated another fifteen or so feet. Then, I felt something hit my back. It was a cicada, and it had landed squarely on my clean angora sweater.   ""Get off my sweater,"" I said. I noticed that it was carrying a message in its mouth.  ""srhifur iuffh eriu eufn heyy sdhd how yoiu ufr up there4."" It was a letter from Reggie. I turned it over and wrote, ""Turn off the TV."" This time I wadded the note into a very tight ball, and threw it violently, thus speeding up the mailing process. The cicada started to fly after it, but I stopped him.   ""Stay with me,"" I told him, ""and I'll let you sit halfway on my angora sweater,"" and so he perched on my sleeve and kept me company.   Another cicada landed on my head, next. This one was also carrying a note from Reggie.   It read, ""Please don't wad your papers so tightly, or throw them so hard. That one landed right on my head. I'm trying to think of a way to help you""  I wrote a reply that said, ""Okay. Thanks,"" which I rolled up even tighter, and licked, just to make it harder.   We wrote back and forth like this for a long time, and by the time we were done, I was covered in cicadas, and my angora sweater was ruined. The cicadas all had wet legs from hanging around stale rain puddles, and they clung to me as if I were their only hope. It made my sweater wet. I guess, since wet sweaters are very heavy, it was enough to get me back down to the ground. Either that, or I used up all my floaty sugar. Either way, I was nothing but cold, wet, and hungry when I got home, and I never saw one helicopter."

2GXT57U,female,23,"I forgot to mention that when I stepped into my time pod yesterday that I read a little something about how it worked that terrified me, but as soon as I was too frightened to go through with it, it was over. The instructions booklet said that I would go through an electromagnetic conductor in order to transform all my electrons into positrons, and my protons into electrons. It was kind of like popping the plastic packing bubbles that the machine came in, and then unpopping them in another dimension. That's a bad analogy. It was, essentially, popping my present self away from my past self like a bunch of little hooks being unhooked a few at a time, but at such a high speed that it seemed simultaneous. I thought, ugh, for about a nanomillisecond, I'll be all half and half, and look like I'm all filled with holes or something, and I was afraid it would hurt.  What I thought was, I guess it picks me up and moves me, so that I reconnect in another place and time, but this is not so at all. The machine itself has to weave in and out of time because it holds onto the user, and drags part of that person through a loop, kind of like pinching off a piece of a loaf of bread, but without actually changing the body structure. (It's like a quark, if I have the word right -- those little things in atoms that jump time. More energy than machinery.) Then it goes back in time and finds the person again (that's me) and redirects the body path, then connects the loose end to the pinch of a body, which is now set up to be pushed out of the loop and continue moving through time without growing. It's a funny thing, because I think it's all loose in time. I mean, it kind of forms a line, but it's just a temporary fix before it has to go back into the loop, and it keeps getting reused. It's kind of hard to explain right because I haven't read the whole manual, but I skimmed through all of the important parts.  Anyway, the idea of having my body pulled apart, even temporarily, and affixed to a piece of me, was kind of unnerving, but it wasn't like I would have any scars or anything. It was tearing me from the future part of my body, which is just like me in the present, only in a different nanogular hypercubic millimeter, or something. Like I say, I didn't read very far. Anyway, it felt really weird. If you've ever eaten salmon roe, you might know what I mean. That is, if you've ever rolled caviar across your tongue and the roof of your mouth, and felt it popping in your teeth and heard it in your jaws, apply that feeling to your whole body, and you have something similar to atomic posi/negative switching. Very odd indeed.  Anywho, like I said, I was going to visit myself, and then when I saw me there, I just kind of started talking nervously, without even introducing myself, and I was abashed to discover that I didn't even know who I was, and furthermore, when I told me that it was me, I didn't even believe me. That was a real disappointment, so I made up my mind to go visit other people.   Come to think of it, I think maybe I do remember running into myself a long time ago, and being kind of disappointed, like, ""Come on, if you're me, what are you doing wearing my old cloths? I'm going to get rid of those cloths tomorrow."" I never did get rid of those clothes though."

WA6IKI5,female,23,"UPDATE:    Damn its been a while since i logged on to this. Blogger is moving up in the world, they even have comments now. I remember when they didnt have that shit and people had to use the freebies around the web. Well im no longer apart of the retrosoul fam. At some point in time i decided to put this blogging thing on hold. It became time consuming and i basically wasnt inspired anymore. Not to mention, life changes. I started grad school and was a couple of months into a new job. So all in all the best decision for me was to hand in my bloggin punch card hince was the only reason why i decided to leave retrosoul. That was back in september of 03', i think but dont quote me on that. Anyhoo after not blogging for about 2-3 months, i decided to come back to the game. Now i own my own site entitled ""Brown Suga Dreams"" over  urlLink here . That is where i occupy most of my time. I still dont blog as much as i like to, but the paste is starting to pick up.   Right now, im halfway through my graduate studies. After this summer semester, i will have 5 classes left. Of those 5 only 3 are actual classes, the other 2 are internship and practicum. So im really excited about that. Will be even more estatic when i finish with this stage in my life. However, school wont be over for me. I then have mad plans to get a doctorate in psychology. Then again that will most likely occur 3-4 years from now. Lol why am i telling you guys all this. I was just simply suppose to update this journal and keep it moving. Two sentences have turned into over 20 most likely. Okay im out. If you want to read more about me and my life, hit me up over at Brown Suga. One."

0W5F653,female,25,"Ralph Nader makes me angry. Very, very angry.         I am all for question the validity of the two-party system, and I agree that it's broken and needs fixing. But surely there are better ways to fix it than to ruin two elections. Yes, two elections. This is exactly what will happen if Nader doesn't take himself out of the race. Dubya will get the boost of having people vote for Nader who otherwise might have voted for Kerry, just as he took votes away from Gore in 2000.         And let's be real, kids. If Nader hadn't been on the ballot in Florida, there wouldn't have been a recount. His thousands of votes would most likely have gone to Gore, thereby cementing the fact that  Gore really won the election.            I am amazed at the size of Nader's ego, to think that he will single-handedly be responsible for smashing the system and initiating party reform. Keep on keepin' on, but  DO NOT MAKE ME SUFFER THROUGH FOUR MORE YEARS OF DUBYA.            No to Nader in 2004."

0W5F653,female,25,"Music for the Day: The Killers - Hot Fuss           Glad to be here in one piece. Someone who must have been really eager to get behind his desk this morning almost plowed into me as we played stop-and-go on 495. I heard squealing breaks and looked in my rearview and there he was, about an inch from my bumper. I don't get rattled easily behind the wheel, but that got my heart pumping a little faster. Rush-hour here sucks. Too many damn people.             It is also already nice and muggy outside. But I guess that's what happens when you live in a swamp.             Nothing of real import to discuss yet, so I'll just sit here blabbering on about how much I heart the Killers album. It is phenomenal. J.P. told me I would like it more than Franz Ferdinand, and at the time I scoffed, but now...I might be inclined to agree. It is just phenomenal.

0W5F653,female,25,"Storming again. As much as I like storms, I am not looking forward to navigating the doutblessly flooded streets and sidewalks on my way to and from metro.       I thought I would throw in some Jeff-isms before I head home, to work on getting the cash for the Zutons gig tonight. Since it has been ages since we've seen each other, I sent him a jpeg of me, from Halloween (I was a tarty French Maid)...      ""Well you look lovely as a maid. Quite lovely indeed. Still the same Megan. I miss you more now...""    ""I guess that's what counts... being thankful for stuff. I'm thankful for what you have given me and especially that you contacted me again.""

So here is an example of how life can suck. Last night, I wanted to go see  the Zutons  at Iota, since I am now within walking distance of the club. I go to an ATM to check up on funding, and I have...$8.32 in my account. Not only do tickets cost $12, but you have to be able to withdraw at least $10. So no Zutons for me. Instead I go spend some quality time with Paul and Brendan, and watch them shoot rubber bands at each other while I sit on a stool playing Text Twist. Wicked. I did watch  the Graduate  last night, though, which was super. Yet another movie that draws gasps of disbelief from people when I have to admit to never having seen it. At least missing the Zutons was good for one thing.     Tonight, however, I do believe I am hitting the town.  Two If By Sea  are at the Black Cat tonight, and  Brooke and Mark  are in town from Wilmington. So it could be a late night.

I bought it after seeing Nada Surf live last September, a show which opened my eyes to the fact that they are so much more than that one big song they had when I was in high school (you know, ""Popular""). They are so wonderful. Made my commute to work that much more enjoyable. Nada Surf on the discman, and Iris Murdoch in hand to satisfy my literary craving. Excellent.    So last night was wonderful. Moms and I had a lovely dinner at Austin Grill. It was busy in there at first, but since we only got there about 7:30 the place thinned out as we were working our way through our quesadillas. I think Moms enjoyed it, which is good. I wanted her to have a great time on her birthday.     Once we got home, we switched on the tv and surfed for a bit, until at 10:30 the future VP of this country began to speak. If John Edwards is not someday President, then I feel Armageddon will have happened. He has ""It."" He has that  je no se quois ( please excuse my spelling, I've never taken French). He is the perfect politician, Chris and I think he's a bit Kennedy-esque (though doubtless he's more wholesome). John Edwards rocks my world.

It's hard to want to get out of bed when the sky is seven shades of gray and the air is tremendously humid. I wanted to stay in bed and sleep, but alas I couldn't.     Had a message from Jeff awaiting me this morning. All I can say right now is that it made me very happy and very sad at the same time.     I fell asleep reading last night, how sad.

My nickel-sized spider bite and I are forever in your debt.         Robert's blog entry about high school combined with the descent of hundreds of high school kids upon my office have made me think about high school. I feel like so much has changed since I was in high school, like some sort of line has been crossed. Kids seem to be much less innocent than they were ten years ago when I was a freshman. All the girls seem to want to emulate Britney and her plastic wunderkind and all the boys want to be pimptacular. They all want to grow up too fast. I remember feeling lots of pressures back in the day, but we didn't look like little Britneys. And the biggest thing I let myself worry about was getting into college. Now it's changed. Kids are trying to grow up so fast, and we who are older and possibly wiser look and them and want to scream at them not to rush things. At least, I do anyway. Sometimes I long for the days where everything was simple and all I had to worry about was what to wear to school and whether or not I'd be able to stay awake during first period. But maybe I'm alone in thinking this. I feel like a grandma waxing poetic about ""the good old days"" when I had to walk 15 miles to school barefoot on ten feet of snow."

I think it was really well done. I loved that he was showing his nervousness; it just makes him seem less political and more normal person. I thought he made excellent points and definitely should have left the right-wingers quaking in their cowboy boots. The more I see of Kerry, the more I like him. I think he'll make an excellent president. I must remember to try and volunteer for the campaign...I was also moved to tears when Kerry's co-vets were on the stage, introducing Max Cleland who ultimately introduced Kerry. It was so touching, and really puts the character of Kerry in an even more positive light.         I can't wait for November."

0W5F653,female,25,I can imagine my future.  It is   not   a pretty sight. You know those people who walk around with the aid of a walker and orthopedic shoes?! And that old lady in the commercial for Capri Sun who takes forever and a day to walk down her front walk?   That's going to be me  . I have such bad ankles from my time as a high school rah rah that going up and down stairs so many times in shoes with not much support has me hobbling around like an old woman after too much time here on my ass in my chair. It is awful and horrible and depressing. And painful. And I only make it worse with my choice of footwear. What's a girl with an addiction to high heels supposed to do?!?!
0W5F653,female,25,I could fall asleep  right now.  The sun is nice and warm and the a/c is cranked up and I am starting to sit and stare equally at my computer screen and out the window.

Who knew moving stuff from just a couple rooms could be such a physically and emotionally draining experience?????    This weekend I must have gone up and down the stairs at my new apartment something like fifty times. Carrying heavy bags and boxes half the time. My feet/ankles may never be the same. Apart from the furniture and about ten boxes of books, moms and I moved all of my stuff. And that's a lot of stuff. I was at home again yesterday, exhausted, yet I still went over to moms and got even more stuff from the house. It hurt when I laid down to go to bed last night, my ankles hurt like mad. But thus is the price of moving, I suppose.    But my apartment is wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. It's almost totally tidy, and then it will be perfect. I love it.    More later, but please excuse me whilst I go and tend to some blisters..."
0W5F653,female,25,"Music for the day: Elastica - BBC Sessions       We had one hell of a storm here late yesterday afternoon. At one point I swear it was right over my office. I haven't seen hail like that in quite some time, and the thunder/lightning were rather impressive. It offered a welcome diversion from the boredom that was the close of business yesterday.       I've begun reading  Boredom . It seems to me that Alberto Moravia must have had issues with his parents, as his protagonist always seems to have a neurotic mother and philandering, missing in action father. Thus far it's enjoyable, but I'm only about 30 pages into it.       Went to moms' for dinner last night. I am very glad to see her when I go over, and very glad at the same time to be in my own space. She is the most wonderful person, and the most important person in my life, yet I am happier in my apartment than at home. This is probably weird   .     Not much else to tell, yet. More email from Jeff, which means Megan is a happy girl this morning."
0W5F653,female,25,"Music for the Day: The Hives - Tyrannosaurous hives     Oh how I adore the latest Hives record. I bought it last night when I was buying the book for moms and I listened to it this morning in effort to wake me up a little. It did the job...or as much as I can be woken up on this kind of rainy humid gross morning.     Last night, or this morning I'm not sure which, there was a massive thunderstorm. I was too groggy to fully appreciate it, but I was happy to hear the thunder. I almost thought I was dreaming it.     Am currently grinning like a maniacal inmate after Nurse Ratchet has given me some sort of shock treatment. And yes, it has to do with Jeff. But I'll post more later. Time for some work."
0W5F653,female,25,"I am  not  a patient person. I really don't care that it's only 8 something in the morning on the left coast. I am super anxious to hear back from Jeff. I want to hear from him not only just because, but also because a slight worry has creeped into the back of my mind:    What if he really doesn't care about resuming communication?    What if he has totally written me out of his life, and doesn't feel the need to resuscitate our friendship.          Could I be any more overanalytical???"
0W5F653,female,25,"""We can all fly as high as we aspire. Unless you are a chicken.""     I have a magnet that says something like that, and when I am sad or even just bored, I think of that magnet, and it's primitive picture of a chicken with a thought bubble that says ""shit,"" I cannot help but grin.     I am now bored enough to think of the chicken.    Happily, though, the sun has broken through the clouds. Moms yesterday said that she heard somewhere that in the entire month of July, we have yet to have one full strictly sunshiney, blue-skyed day. That totally explains why people seem to be dragging along, we all need the sun to keep us going."
0W5F653,female,25,"Music for the Day: Duran Duran - Rio     You know, if I had never seen the movie  Barbarella , I wouldn't get to feel like a music snob, in knowing where  Duran Duran  got their name.  Matmos  also took their name from that excellently weird film.    Speaking of films. I am on a movie kick. Two nights, two movies. I think I am going to try to see a movie every night this week. Well, except Thursday and Friday. I saw  Dr. Strangelove  last night. Totally loved it. Though I wanted to see what happened in the cave while the Doomsday Machine was going off.  And I wanted to know more about Dr. Stangelove. Like, say, why is he such a nut? And what's with his hand? And why did that one guy order the nukes to be dropped? But yeah. I loved it. Such a good movie. I can't believe I'd never seen it before. And how timely it is, in a way. I liked the president in the movie much more than our real live president...    I saw a guy, had to be mid-40s, on metro this morning who had a comb sticking out of his back pocket. It was a plastic purply-blue comb. I found it strangely amusing.    It's hot this morning. Muggy. I am ready for it to changes seasons. I feel like the longest season in this town is summer, though.     Going to think about what to rent tonight. And to think about Jeff's email from last night. Sigh."
0W5F653,female,25,"Yay!! I'll get to see the Zutons after all!! That is, if I get a ticket to see The Thrills before it sells out. Which I am sure I will...      Only one hour and forty minutes to go before I am free for the weekend."
0W5F653,female,25,"fuck.      I keep running into the Cute Office Boy whilst totally unprepared for it. I've seen him three times today already, and never when I am ready to see him. It is getting to be rather farcical.         I don't know why I even pay attention, because he is probably 17 years old and killing time until he goes off to college (how long ago that was for me).      Though...he really doesn't  look  17. Maybe he's a new hire. That would be much preferred.     I've also realized that I say pretty much the same thing to everyone who calls. I even use the same tone of voice (the dreaded Phone Voice). It's higher and perkier than my normal speaking voice and it annoys even me. Yet I can't seem to stop doing it."
0W5F653,female,25,"Music of the day: 94.7 FM (classic rock - the only station that plays music in the morn.)           My tongue was this color when I crawled out of bed this morning.               Be wary of delicious yet potent slurpee-esque drinks. Especially when they are full of nothing but blue food coloring and sixteen types of booze. Perhaps not really sixteen, but it feels like sixteen...         I had much too much of a good time last night. I am glad I decided against going home to go to bed and went to see the Hives. The show was great. Well, apart from one of the opening bands.  Mediocrity, thy name is Sahara Hotnights.  They are the Swedish Donnas. And no, that's not a good thing. Anyway. I love the Hives. Always a Hives bridesmaid (somehow I always managed to miss their D.C. shows), I was finally a bride. They are great and they know they are great and they make the audience feel their greatness. I dug their matching Colonel Sanders ties, too. Nice. They all sport the black ensemble with white blazer and tie thing very well. From my perch upon the balcony, Hannah and I watched as Howlin' Pelle proceeded to prance, pout, schmooze, strut, shimmy, and kick. That boy really is like a Naughties version of Mick Jagger. Thankfully, though, none of the Hives look like Death Warmed Over (a.k.a. Keef Richards).         I suitably liquored myself up, the more to enjoy the frenetic energy of the show. The 9:30 Club makes this wonderful wonderful drink, simply entitled the Blue Thing (easy to remember; always a good quality of a drink). It is, as mentioned above, a Slurpee-like drink. It is also very much more alcoholic than a Slurpee could ever hope to be. We'll call it the Slurpee's evil twin. And I had three. In under 2 hours. It might not seem like many, but damned if my head doesn't still feel fuzzy. Also, my tongue (and a bit of my lips) turned a nice shade of blue. And still retain a bit of blueness.         Also last night I spent a good bit of time after the fabulous show having a chin-wag with lovely friend Laura. She and I don't see each other very much (bad thing) but always have a good time when we do see each other (good thing). We discussed our current crushes, and decided to try to formulate strategies to help each other attain our boys. I think that it'll be much easier for me to advise her, given that I think her boy has a crush on her. Mine, however...not so much. But that's another story entirely.         So I got in bed around 1:30, in a fuzzy haze (thanks to the show and four {I had a cup of Framboise Lambic a.k.a. the Blood of Christ, which the super nice bartender gave me on the house} drinks) and after hitting my arm squarely against a wall. Yeah, I walked into a wall. Yay me. Arm is still smarting.         Today is: Black Cat Wednesday. Maybe."

0W5F653,female,25,"Burning the candle at both ends: health hazard or fun times?         Kevin told me today that I was burning the candle at both ends. I guess I am. But I don't want to let go of my occasional bouts of leaving rational thought behind when it comes to going out, because when I do that I begin to feel old. Being able to go out on weeknights and drink a lot and stay out late and then get up and make it to work ontime has been a part of my life ever since I graduated college. It's been a part of my identity: for example people here at work think of me as a ""good time gal"" which could be used to describe me. I feel that if I give up going out during the week, that I'll have lost part of who I am.         Neurotic. I know."
0W5F653,female,25,"I am worried I am being bratty.         I am having marginal issues with the bed I bought for my new apartment. The girl I am buying the bed from is understandably busy, she is working two jobs all the while packing her life up in order to move to San Francisco. Great. So I think we have finally pinpointed a time on Friday when I could maybe have the bed picked up and brought to my new place. However...Jackie's old roomie still has stuff there. It seems she (old roommate) is ""particular"" about people touching her stuff. Granted, she technically has until Sunday to have everything out, but I don't really want to a) have the bed delivered but hanging out against the wall in the living room or something, for myself and moms to move into my room Saturday or Sunday, b) wait until Sunday for the movers to move it, or c) have the bed delivered next week. So I think I might have been a wee bit snippy in my response to my roomie...argh. I am just frustrated and beginning to get tense about the move. And so I am beginning to take this out on others.         Beware, others. You have been warned. The Wrath of Megan might soon be out in force ."

No, really.     How does someone get into the spokesperson field? And is there stiff competition? And are spokespeople PAs, or their own separate entity? And if one wanted to go about becoming a spokesperson, can you go to school for it??? It just seems like one of those ""huh?"" jobs, like that might be really cool but you're not quite sure how you got it. I think it would be a totally rad job. All you'd have to do is write statements for your client and then talk to the press and that's that.     Easy peasy."

Though I wasn't really me. I was some sort of omniscient being. There were loads of people in this dream, most of whom seemed to be designers on Trading Spaces. Don't ask. The only one I really remember is Laurie, and she was in a long floaty frothy confection of a dress and she was being chased around by one of her dearly departed relations. There were loads of ghosts in this one. I woke up with a start and I remember not wanting to open my eyes for fear of finding someone unexpected in my room. Most of the dream has faded, but it was extremely creepy.          Nightmares do not a happy camper make."

AND THEN.. i heard this voice.. and like.. i turned around and i saw one of the instructers!!! and i was like.. omg.. shiet.. but she was talking to andrea.. even though she was facing my way... and then i just walked away as quick as posible.. and we roasted mashmellows.. well.. either roasted or set them on fire.. but anyways.. i only had two coz i had a tummy ache.. then we went and brushed our teeth .. lol kristine forgot her toothbrush.. ahah she was gunna use her knife to brush her teeth.. but then decided not to.. lol..and lent andrea her cup.. THEn we decided to go to sleep.. in our nice sleeping bags.. that wasnt so warm coz i kept waking up in the middle of the night coz it was so damn cold... and i wanted to sleep.. but like andrea and kristine who was like.. not so far away.. was like talking.. lol .. they're so funny.. and cordell was listening.. and every so often she would shout soemthing to them.. or laugh.. so then.. i cant sleep.. but it soon died down.. lol they hav this accent that they did all night.. lol .. its like.. ""hellooww"" ""HEEllLoow"" and thta would go on for a little while.. and.. lol its just so funny.. then in the morning.. we had to pack our stuff.. take down the tent.. and eat breakfast.. lol i couldnt finishe the milk.. so on my way walking.. im like.. ""kristine trip me over"".. *trips me over*...*""accidently"" spills all the milk*... me:""omgosh! kristine look wat u've done!.."" kristine:"" oh im SO SORRY!.."".. lol.. it was funny.. and serina and sabra was just looking at us weirdly.. wen we set off to walk.. me and andrea were just tokkin abt japan.. coz it was distracting us from the pain.. wich was good.. wen we got the gate.. we had to once again.. go uphill.. but it wasnt as steep.. thats wen ollie stands and watches us and then goes onto some easy path...after we get to the top its preety easy.. me and angela was leading from then on.. coz its just a pathway.. and i picked up a stick along the way.. and named it alfred wegener.. wen we got to a point and met with mrs sheilds.. her and her group moved left while we moved right.. and ollie was like.. smiling.. and so was ms shields.. and it made us think we were going the wrong way!! but we kept on walking after checking our maps and deciding to believe angela.. we walked for like heaps long untill we saw these artificial rocks and had a break.. where mrs sheilds group caught up.. then we got onto the road.. and that was the long long long walk until we reached the point where we get pcked up.. thats the place where they drive us back to basecamp.. and we had to wash the pots and stuff.. then we got on the bus where angela and katie sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall all the way to 0 !!! omg.. then they went to -1,-2,-3.. and emilg came down to us and was like.."" ok.. we've heard enough.. we let u sing from 100 to 0 and we dont need no negatives ok??.."".. lol.. and i was getting sleepy.. we were like an hr late.. all the parents were standing round waiting.. lol mr.dunbar picked me and rachel up and we went to maccers to get icecream.. the chicks infront of us were looking at us weirdly.. mayb coz we were like in shorts and t-shirt and rachel had a hat on... and others were like in jumpoers and jeans and stuff.. lol oh wellz.. they were least of our worries.. then i got to go home.. and collapsed onto the floor.. =) never felt to glad to be home..   after all the pain and suffereing we went through.. i think we all had heaps of fun ^_^.. lol after this week of skool.. we would ahv spent a whole 12 days with each other.. lol..  i got tkd tomoroz.. and im in so much pain.. i havnt even done any of mie hw.. but i can always do it someother time i gues...  i think i've bloged enough.. no ones gonna wanna read all of it =) lol..  bye bye"

AX2K3G1,male,24,"The 'Godfather' has finally parted ways with us. In a remarkable career full of controversies and brilliance, Marlon Brando gave us a lot to cherish with his astonishing portrayals of characters. And for this reason, for the third day in consecution, I'm using photos in my blog entries. The reason is the same. I adore this guy! And he, as you might have guessed by now, is on my  urlLink WHILTHS list . Like Saddam, he lost some of his voluptuousness as the years ticked by, mainly due to his weight problem. Here's why.     urlLink      urlLink       Marlon in Godfather  Marlon in his later years    It might a stark coincidence to note that the first picture should come from a site called  urlLink Moustache Database . Most of my best men would be on that database I'm sure. If there is any other database that might reveal my favorites, it might be called 'Frown-lines on the forehead Database'. Marlon, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, and Sean Connery - they all have such sexy foreheads when they frown!  I've been reading up about  urlLink Marlon's career on New York Times  and there were a lot of things which I thought I should quote here and comment about.   In addition to physical beauty, Brando brought psychological torment, moral ambivalence, savage intensity and a smoldering, at times oddly ambiguous, sexuality.  Now, I don't think I should search further for reasons why I like him as much as I do. Maybe it's the gaydar thing!  ""Whenever we want something from somebody or when we want to hide something or pretend, we're acting. Most people do it all day long.""  I really believe in what Brando is saying here. In fact I think that is what I'm doing each and every living moment.  Jack Nicholson, who co-starred with Mr. Brando in ""The Missouri Breaks,"" (1976) and was a friend and neighbor for many years, termed him ""a genius who was the beginning and end of his own revolution.""  Mr. Nicholson said that Mr. Brando was the reason that he - and many other actors of his generation - entered the profession. ""I was in high school when I saw `The Wild One,' "" Mr. Nicholson said.""He changed my life forever.""  All throughout reading the article, I wish I was someone who knew Marlon in real life. But at this point, I wish I was Marlon himself. He lived next door to Jack Nicholson and they have been great friends! Come on, what I have I done to receive this tormenting? And I could have changed Jack's life forever if he had allowed me to! ;)  Docker hasn't yet replied to me about what he thought about chatting after what had happened between us in the past few days. I am hoping that he would adjust with my 'limitations'. I haven't heard from Mr. Lion again since he replied after a gap. Maybe he is busy taking care of daughter before her delivery. I should allow him some room here, I guess.  Things are starting look brighter in my hobby field. Yesterday, I took a couple of books from the library about HTML and PHP. I'm going through the HTML books as I type because I'm using my HTML to design this little post here itself. Why such a sudden impetus? Well, because I got another offer from a person who owns a big shot in the Medical PG field on the internet to host my website on his servers. I really thought I should upgrade my website before I think about hosting options. The owner of the  urlLink SilverDaddies.com  site was also generous to help me out with my nagging doubts. I am grateful for that.  I've been writing some mails to my sister. But she apparently doesn't get time to read through these. I know things are not 'bright' with her in laws. But I think my BIL and Sis should try and read through what I write and reply the situation demands it. I don't know if I should excuse her for being lazy. But do I have another option?"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Yesterday was my first 24 hour duty at the hospital. A good one actually. Not too busy. Got a nice sleep in the night as well. Got time in the morning to come home and clean up and be at the hospital in time for rounds.  Yesterday, when I was eating at a restaurant close to the hospital, I ran into the bystander of a patient. This patient is a 'hot' older man. The bystander was not as 'hot' but was very well behaved. I greeted him and asked him about some lab results. Nothing serious, just small talke kind of stuff. Today, while leaving the patient after checking him, the bystander said a 'Thank you sir.' I felt honored. I felt wanted. It was a great feeling.  I have got a Yamaha acoustic guitar, courtesy my friend. The strings are very old and need to be changed. Other than that it sounds great. I'm looking forward to changing the strings and playing it. Maybe I will try writing something tomorrow."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I’m totally enjoying my re-entry to professional life. But, that means that I’m getting very little time to stuff like blogging. I guess that this would mean that my blogs will get more concise and therefore, more readable. Fine.  I have started on a new song called ‘Living your dream’. I thought the lyrics sucked. Try the poem at the bottom of this post. I have the basic melody and the chord progression and I recorded a demo a couple of days back. It sounds okay. I hope I’ll do much more with this song than previously. Usually, I end up making a melody and recording a demo, stop there and start working on another song. That means that very little time gets invested on improving the song. Sort of lazy, isn’t it?  I had a disappointing time watching ‘Van Helsing’. Screenplay was drab, acting was average, animation poor and the movie was very, very predictable. I hope ‘Troy’ gets released here soon.  I read a couple of books by ‘Ben Elton’ in the last month or so. I think I’m getting very interested in fiction of the comedy/satire genre. I’m going to try P. G. Wodehouse again.  ‘Living Your Dream’  After what seemed like eternity I redeemed some dignity Head held high, beaming face I saved myself from more disgrace  If you want to know why  A few years back, I recall On a rainy night in fall I discovered a hidden beauty (which) Cleared out the dark and misty  I won't get paid for this But it's something I can't miss I want to run and scream Nothing like living your dream  It was a busy day I missed a movie today A routine With my best mate And more of this I can take  If you want to know Why  Because Now, I have realized A dream, from the day I cried And it gives me what I need Without which I would bleed  I won't get paid for this But it's something I can't miss I want to run and scream Nothing like living your dream"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I never realized that two days of my life could give me so much to write about. I don't have a clue as to where to start. Maybe I shouldn't really be writing so many things about my personal life in here. Wait; that was not me talking. That was my mexican friend Saul's thought after he saw my blog. Saul was sort of uncomfortable reading through my blog citing that personal diaries are meant to mean what they are called - personal. But this personal diary, I said in an explanation to justify myself, is different. It is a medium where I get to write what I want, the way I want and I get a lot of satisfaction in doing so and getting comments of a few like-minded readers about it. I can go berserk in here. I explode into my fantasy world where gayness is accepted like down-town New York. Yeah, I'm referring to you Faustus. I'm jealous of the way you live. But it is okay, and under control. But I would someday want to live a life like how you do.  The day before, I was invited by Chuck to a party sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The party was actually meant for the fresh-residents in the Orthopedics department. I was invited to fill in the numbers. The pharmaceutical company held a belief that such parties are useful for developing amazing levels friendship, solidarity and the spirit of team-work among the residents. Chuck, being the representative of the residents, found that inviting me was the only way he could continue deluding the pharmaceutical company representatives for more parties in the future.   Anyway, after the initial formalities-for those unaware, this includes introduction of new medications under the labels and a lot of bullshit about how the doctors are doing a world of good to everyone bye prescribing the company's own formulations and vice versa-got over, the feast began. Although the quality of food was appalling, alcohol was there to salvage some respect. I, being a honest preacher of non-alcoholism, didn't even want to take a sip. But Chuck and A. (another friend of mine) convinced me on the grounds of inevitability-Orthopedicians are the drunkards among doctors, the college to which I was going to do my residency set high standards in everything, including drinking-that I can't go without a drink at least. Eventually, I had a 'large' of brandy. What happened next is worth another paragraph.  This was the first time I was drinking. Maybe it was the empty stomach, maybe it was the fact that the proportion of adipose tissue in me was lesser, or maybe that my hepatic microsomal system of enzymes was naïve as compared to the others'-the drink had an almost immediate effect. I was starting to feel dysbasic, ptotic, ataxic and dyskinetic. I thought I was dysarthric as well, but was relieved to find that I wasn't after I got out of being 'under the influence'. But, I could think very clearly. And I was feeling stupid. I was not being under control of myself; the one thing that I always feel I need to. I was worried about this. I was feeling plain bad about this.   To not indulge in anything remotely close to being inappropriate, I started to fiddle with my mobile phone after going to a corner where there was no one. I tried calling Ray. But he was busy. I tried calling my sister. She wouldn't take up the phone. I resigned to typing in messages to Ray, once having to type the same message thrice because I had accidentally deleted the composed message by virtues of being dyskinetic. The effect wore off in little under an hour, and I was so happy to back in control again. I felt sick even momentarily losing the only power I seemed to hold forever. And I was thinking that I would never drink again. I didn't find any benefits to being drunk, of course it is from my point of view... at least until I got up the day after when, astonishingly, my prodrome of viral illness was gone! Wow, that justified me having a drink. I hope I won't have to search for more justifications in the future for both refusing a drink or getting drunk.  Back to my physical charms-wait a minute, I don't think I had too many the last time blogged. But things change, sometimes drastically. I happened to send a upper body nude photograph of myself (chest hair et al) to this very good friend of mine R. He was so excited about this that he replied in an e-mail with so many wonderfully strung sentences having words such as cute, sexy, wonderful, beautiful, lovely, handsome, adorable, that I finally felt that I'm at least okay looking in part nude. So, someone thinks that I'm hot. This sort of is like a revenge of sorts to May who says that I suck in looks. Coming from an older man, she still won't take it as a reason to believe the fact that I'm even remotely good-looking. But anyway, I'm happy about it. This comment, finally, gave Ray some sort ground trying to convince me that I don't need to feel so bad about my body, the way it is. He is okay with the way it is. Even Mr. Lion thinks that I'm cute the way I'm. But, for me, looks are very subjective. The subjectivity of the person himself, or herself for that matter, is the most important aspect in modulating decisions to amend looks. Therefore, I'm justified again.  Mr. Lion is back by the way; back from the hospital, and is very happy about the fact that he has a grandchild. The lack of opportunity for hands-on action had made him very horny when we had a couple of chat sessions. I thought that he was too flirty for an old man, but I loved each and every moment of it. I like ment who flirt. Especially dirty old men. Only when they flirt with me, that is. In our chat, we discussed a lot of stuff. I even asked him about his apparently pedophilic tendencies. He accepted the fact that he liked it but he never forces issues. I admire his honesty about this, but I'm not sure about the justification.   More importantly, of course for me and not the millions of poor little kids in the world who I admit I don't care too much about, the discussion drifted off to our next meeting, which happens to be today afternoon. Now, I want you to understand that the following couple of lines were actually meant to be in capitals, bold, 600% more in size and in alternating colors of pink and fluorescent green-Mr. Lion and I are meeting in the zoo today and he said he will try to get me near tiger cubs! Maybe even touch and play with one of them! Oh my me!!! This is the most exciting thing that someone has ever said to me. I really hope things work out well because if you don't already know by now, tigers are my epitomes of perfection. Tiger cubs add a share of cuteness, playfulness and amazing degree of stupidity-just like a kitten. So they are more attractive than a thousand penises, to me at least.  Yesterday was a wonderful day in my personal life. I spent almost the whole day with my beloved friends; Chuck and Ray. First we went to watch Spiderman 2. Nice movie, I have to say. I, increasingly realizing that I'm becoming an unstoppable critic in just about everything, found the animation sub-standard and the technicalities of the story line a little under-worked. The first half of the movie was better than the second half, where Peter Parker was given more prominence than Spiderman. After this, we watched the India Vs. Pakistan cricket match on TV. It was during this match that I found out about the surge of my criticizing instincts.   All through, I and Ray had the opportunity of being in the proximity of the amazingly cute older man-Chuck's Dad. I had imposed restrictions on myself on staring, flirting, having conversations beforehand. As it was about a month since I made the enforcement, I was feeling more at ease and actually was proud of how I carried myself there. Maybe I just overdid it by not commenting about  da man 's Chicken curry which was really tasting good. Today morning, when I finally realized this, I told Chuck and he smiled back at me as if to sympathize with effort that I was putting in.  I have a lot more to write about. But I'd have to postpone it to my next post because I need to run to the college hospital to sort out my admission procedure."
AX2K3G1,male,24,I'm not posting in detail because I'm very tired today. I and my friends have made the basic outline of the song and have recorded a trial version. I'm very happy about the way it went.
AX2K3G1,male,24,"This following is a passage that I typed in the Gay Bombay e-group. Thought it might be interesting to read.   I thought I would contribute to this ongoing discussion about theself-realisation of homosexuality. First of all, I must point out that I likeolder men. The reason why I have such a preference might become clearer if youknow about my experiences as a child.  I was brought up in a family where my father didn't spend any time with me. Henever used to talk to me about what I was interested in etc. Besides he was awayfrom home for prolonged periods for work. This was the reason why I alwaysenvied friends whose Dads were 'closer' to them.  When I was 8 years old, I used to go to play at my neighbor's place where myfriend's Dad used to chat with him about a lot of things. I felt attracted tohis Dad from a very early time as well. He must have caught me staring at him attimes because after some time, he gave me a lot of signs in a sexual way. Thoseincluded undressing and masturbating (once). Even though these things did arouseme, I was no way aware that I was being homosexual/gay. Honestly, I didn't evenknow what sex was then!  After that, I began watching out for older men. And things started falling intoplace. I was at another neighbor's house when an uncle over there was watchingtennis on the ""then Cable TV"". An uncle who invited me over didn't change thechannel when there were seens of nudity and sex. That was when I was about 10years old.  In my puberty days, I felt the physical changes and started understanding sex.When I started trying to read about sex, I never felt interested in women. Iwould always read about men. Then I understood that there was somethingdifferent with me than with the rest of my friends. The hots for older men keptraging on after I found a lot of books relating to sex in my uncle's library.  Then right through college, and my graduation I kept myself busy fantasizingabout men and eyeing hot older men. Now I'm 24 and it's been three years since Ihave 'come out of the closet'. Most of my close friends now know that I'm gayand I like older men. Some of them even try to understand me. I have not toldabout my likings to my parents although my sister konws about it and issupporting me silently."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I'm not getting enough time to type in these days. Very busy always spending time outdoors, with friends or at the hospital. Maybe I need to drop this idea of the blog until I get enough time.  I am exchanging mails with this guy I'm about to meet. He's not a natural gay. Is married with wife and children. But he looks hot and seems to be a good guy and I think I'll meet him in a couple of days' time."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"This post was meant to appear two days before. Thanks to my great ISP which can't figure out how to solve a local cable problem in under than 48 hours.   Yesterday was another special day. Ray celebrated his birthday with Mr. Lion in bed. It was the best possible birthday present that he could ever have I guess. Both enjoyed every moment of their time together. The day before, both were being apprehensive about how things would work out. And I, being the pimp, did my best to reassure them. I think it worked marvelously well.  To put things in perspective, Ray had sex with the man I’m almost in love with and I am still feeling great about it. It must be something to do with us being insane because this kind of thing works out only in porn movies or fantasies. But the truth is, we are very happy ‘sharing’ the treasure that we have found from this desert for gays. And as I quote Karen from ‘Will and Grace’; “It is like finding a needle in a gay-stack”, I’m feeling proud about our friendship.  To celebrate things, we two decided to try our luck at another crossword, from another newspaper, hoping that things would be easier. To give you an idea how committed I’m to improve myself in this, I bought an Oxford Advanced Learner’s dictionary before we headed off to the beach with the newspaper. As things unfolded, we realized that the miraculous transformation in our skills, which the dictionary seemed to guarantee, was not going to happen yesterday.  Ray’s vocabulary is simply amazing compared to the average ordinary educated Indian graduate, thanks to about 10 years of voracious reading since high school. Mind you, even with that, these crosswords are being very difficult. I suggested Ray to give a shot at writing; even in a blog like this. But he says he is not yet good enough and that the knack of writing is something he doesn’t have. I hope he changes his mind, and the sooner he does it, the better.  Yesterday, I thought I went overboard trying to explain how lucky I was feeling after finding men of such quality on Silverdaddies.com. I am forced to continue doing so, as I found out yesterday, that a man that I’m chatting with is ultra-cool. I’m referring to Docker, again from Silverdaddies.com who is an artist/professor by his own right. He has worked with an amazing artist/painter/writer called M. C. Escher during the latter’s lifetime. And now, he is the proud owner of a collection of the works of Mr. Escher which is second only to the one found in a Washington Museum!  As pointless it is, of me, to point out that I’m feeling onerous at this moment about this, M. C. Escher’s work is very interesting. You can check out some of the impossibilities in his featured paintings. I’m not even scratching on the surface of this great artist’s work, but I feel special having added a bit of knowledge into my own brain about art in general, and him in particular.  Yet another gentle-mature-man from the US was kind enough to let him read his article on a magazine that he writes in. Very entertaining read indeed, it turned out to be.  See, this is what I love about older men. They seem to be more wise, more creative, more intense, more knowledgeable, more powerful, more ‘everything else that you can think of’ than younger men and of course, any kind of women. My infatuation should be self-explanatory now.  I’m now in touch with about 10 different older men over the internet from the US, Canada, UK and Australia. Most of them have hit on me at SilverDaddies.com and seem to be very interested in me. I chat with them and enjoy flirting with them, even with the feeling in the back of my mind that I might be cheating on them. Is there any other way of going about this that the generous reader might suggest?  Out of these 10 odd persons, 4 have offered me unimaginable luxuries if I were to fly over and start living with them. How and why should they be so generous, I may never understand. But I’m feeling uneasy about these offers. Sometimes I feel like a part of the flesh-trade. There are times, when I remember a friend of mine friend saying that “An older man wanting to have a relationship with you might be a pedophile.” Even other times, I feel that I’m being a fool rejecting such great offers. I can assure you that rejecting them takes a great amount of will power.  I was chatting with an American Silverfox who enjoys international soccer. He likes watching the players and I enjoy watching the coaches. It suddenly occurred to me that just about everything I do in life these days is related to getting closer to an older man. Although this has been a blessing to me because such an urge made me improve myself as a person, it’s time I got a hold on it."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"It always feels nice to salvage a day which begins like a disaster. After missing jogging in the morning and going out with a friend, I thought I'd be down and out all day. Despite realizing that I was cheated by my DVD rental store by being handed over half of the full ""Ben Hur"", I enjoyed what I could see in the movie. I must admit that half the time I was admiring Robert Brown, the sailor chief, who adopts Ben Hur as his son. Acting was great and the script interesting.  Then, I started on a new song called ""Promises"". I'll give the lyrics at the bottom of this passage. In this song, I'm trying to venture out to increase the my musical spectrum by putting in some Harmonica (for the first time!). I'm already into the melody but am not getting great ideas for the verse as of now.  I'm fighting a couple of issues with my personal life at present. I must confess that I have found a great friend. Right know, he knows more about me more than anyone else at present. I have to make a couple of very important decisions in the next two days and I hope they will be wise.  ""Promises""Why does one promise so oftenOnly to keep some, the rest left brokenA word which is used without the knowledgeOf it's actual power, Oh what we pledgeIf making someone happy is your aimIt makes sense to decide, before you proclaimWhat to say and when to do without lettingAnyone get hurt by you forgettingYour promisesThe near missesYour promisesThe death kissesNever let them call you and remind youOf what you said and what was dueYour discretion would save youFrom all the shadows standing in queueI can understand why you make thoseMistakes from which, oh it was so closeGo on and get a grip of what you sayOr you might find yourself in the grey ofYour PromisesThe near missesYour PromisesThe death kisses"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I have a few problems in my life. If someone wanders on to this page and has a suggestion, I would be very glad to hear it.

I still have to break it to my family and a few other friends.I have to find a way move to my hostel in a far-away city.

AX2K3G1,male,24,"Some about turn this is! Three monstrous changes in my life. Firstly, Creed has been disbanded. I don't know how to react to this. Thinking from one angle I feel that it's for the better cuz I know that Tremonti and Philips can kick ass without the limitations set by Stapp. But then, I'll be missing his voice! The new band (minus Stapp that is) is called and their record is coming up in August. I'm looking forward to that.  The other two would certainly bring about changes in my personal lifestyle. One is the news that there is a gay minister in the Indian Cabinet! Come on, this has to be a dream come true! This might come into more relevance when I'm actually contemplating losing my virginity to a daddy I met on ""SilverDaddies.com"" who resides in my home town! I never thought I would find someone from my town. This guy is called ""oldlion"" and has not yet replied to my message. But it's been only hours since I found and sent him a hello. I hope this turns out to be a great experience.  These three events have forced me to work on another song."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"In the last few days, I've been referring to a list of Persons with whom I would like to have sex. Since I'm learning HTML from its very basics, I thought why not make a list in HTML coding? This, folks, is the final result.

AX2K3G1,male,24,"I’m disappointed at the fact that I’m unable to progress with my plans to convert my website into a database based site on PHP/MySQL. I’ve been looking at some tutorials and all suggest that you can’t be a novice to do it. Therefore, I’m reconsidering my plans. I think I’m going to get a CGI/Perl template which is already available on the internet. That way I don’t need to think about buying server space as Tripod can host the site without problems.  Because of this web-designing dilema, that I’ve been postponing my plans to put on braces and to see my Urologist. Once this website-work is shoved aside, I think I will get more time to even think about this. I’ve been getting too much involved in something that should always remain as a hobby; a hobby which should be under control as well.  Mr. Lion now is a proud grandfather! He must be so happy! He became one on Sunday. He is very busy tending to his fatherly/grand-fatherly duties these days; so busy that he has partly forgotten his fatherly duties to me and Ray. I’m just kidding. We two are really happy for him.  I’ve been very fortunate to get e-acquainted with the most handsome person that I have ever met online. He is of Mexican descent and works as a flight attendant. We have been interacting over e-mail for the past few days and seem to get along well. I have to admit that he’s so near my kinda physical-perfection that I’m drooling over him in my e-mails. I’ll ask him if I can post his picture on my weblog so that you can appreciate his cuteness.  This guy has complimented me enough on my looks to redeem my self-esteem. I’m feeling happy now!"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Finally, I've come across other blogs maintained by Indians which discuss about gay issues. Here are two which seem to be a little dormant at present. Let's hope things will liven up soon.    urlLink QueerIndia  by  urlLink Nitin Karani   urlLink Queer  by Praana Sakha And I stumbled upon a few articles about the Section 377 IPC in these blogs.   urlLink Sexuality and The Law  on  urlLink Frontline   urlLink India: Section 377: How natural is normal?  by Nivedita Menon  To Nitin and Praana - I hope you will give me some much needed 2 cents on my ramblings. ;-)  Here is another article on another Frontline with relevance to sexual minorities in India.    urlLink India : The Sex Workers. The Story   Of particular interest to me is a little part of the article that I'm quoting below. Is this the hospital that I'm about to work in?  Not surprisingly, Mumbai's AIDS rate has soared in recent years. Aronson visits one of Mumbai's largest public hospitals, one of the few in India that doesn't turn away AIDS patients. There she finds a man who is well into his sickness."

AX2K3G1,male,24,"Do you ever get this feeling of utter worthlesness while waiting at a hospital lobby for something to happen? Well, today it happened to me when I went to see this cousin who needed emergency Laparoscopic surgery. Okay, I'll explain why...  I was rudely awakened from my sleep by a call on the mobile asking me to turn up at a blood bank as a donor. I was late in getting to bed yesterday after posting at this blog etc. The donation didn't eat up too much time. I got time to get back home and get dressed for a housewarming at my friend's home. Felt really good catching up with him and his family. A wonderful house and a great lunch as well.  Lack of sleep, a hypersomnic lunch and the bleed must have all contributed to the fact that I felt rotten during the 4 hours I had to spend waiting at the hospital. Besides, I was being bored to death by a dull conversation with the aforementioned cousin's hubby. The only good thing about this - got to stare at a few hot older men!  I had to lie to get out of the hospital. I took a nap in my friend's room at the hostel. Came back home and watched the rest of the Godfather 2 movie. The nights are becoming more boring as they have taken a couple of my favorite shows off the prime time. ""Caroline in the City"" and ""Will and Grace"" have both been replaced by ""Mad TV"" which doesn't match up to their standards.  By the way, any one reading my posts?"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"The day of my dream date with this guy didn’t start off that well. I was unsure why he wasn’t chatting with me. But apparently, MSN had to resolve issues far beyond human comprehension to get us to chat with each other. But that was not the jolt which I received in the morning. Well, ‘jolt’ probably isn’t the word that I should be using because at that point the news that my sister is arriving the day after could have meant good or bad. Anyway, I thought this might be a bad experience because of the fact that I could never explain to her why I wasn’t talking to her as much as I used to. This was shocking because I had to get everything clean and spotless before she arrived. And I had a date on in the afternoon!  Before I get any further, I would like to give the characters in my life with some names. So here goes; Ray – my gay friend, Chuck – my straight friend, May – my straight girl friend, Mr. Lion – my current date. These are the important characters. I’ll introduce more as the story goes on.  So with the new of my Sis coming, I called Ray and asked him to help me. We would discuss about the date along with cleaning. So all was said and done and I was getting ready to go to meet Mr. Lion. I logged into MSN with the hope of at least hoping to chat with him once before meeting. And there he was! Apparently he had been hoping for the same from the morning. He had a visit from a cousin. We chat for sometime and start out to meet. I decide on a set of formals. The best set I have.  It’s a rainy afternoon. I reach there 5 minutes before schedule and wait for him at the parking lot. He doesn’t turn up in time. I start worrying. I even called Ray up and he suggested that Mr. Lion might have waited until the rain subsided. Finally, I pick his car up and greet in and get in. Boy, he looked good! Much better than what I had expected after seeing his photo. He’s younger looking than the photo suggested. Great forearms, arms, sprinkle of silver hair sprouting through his shirt top, no shoes just sandals. Dresses smart and talks nicely.  Wonderful start I guess. I was feeling a bit nervous. But we started talking and things started easing out. We went to good restaurant where we hoped to get some privacy. We start off with soup and he carries on talking. He’s not having any main course cuz he had lunch already. I order a Biriyani and listen to him.  The conversation is about his sexual encounters in the past and his professional life. I only get time to add stuff here and there. I’m awestruck by the things that he did, the things that he knew and the stuff that he had been through. Honestly I have never realized that sex life among men from India can be this colorful.  As he’s talking he starts to grab at my thighs. With waiters interrupting, this never goes on properly. Finally, I start reciprocating and I’m feeling happy about what I’m doing. We never reach the ZONE because of the lack of privacy. There was this one moment where he actually felt my nipple which was so weird. But then, I am not gifted with my body; be it nipples, muscles or anything else.  This was pretty romantic because of the setting for the first date. I thought I liked him then. After this, we rode on his car to the place where we met and from there he took a side lane. After reaching a relatively empty part of the road, he grabbed me and kissed me. Wow, what a feeling it was! I thought I reacted well and we shared two warm kisses with tongue. In between I groped at his thing which was responding. At the end of the second kiss, Mr. Lion caught someone looking at us. We then made our way out and then came back to the parking lot. We parted after I gave him my mobile number and he gave me his business card.  After this, I felt on top of the world. It was my first date and I thoroughly enjoyed the kisses. I finally felt like I’m entering my adult life proper. Wow, it took about 2 hours for me to explain the whole story to Ray who was very happy about this. We came to my place and started doing the chores. It really felt wonderful having someone like Ray beside me who understood all my feelings. I called Chuck up to say that I had enjoyed the date. I promised to tell him all the details on the next jogging session.  One thing that really amazes me is the number of good qualities that this guy has. He’s almost my dream guy. Intelligent, educated, handsome, caring! Could this be a dream?  I worked late into the night and then got up early in the morning to finish my chores. I did finish them up before my Sis landed. Me and my cousin went to picked her up from the bus station. BIL was looking hip in shorts and tees. After we took them home, I was really anxious to get started talking to my Sis. Rest in the next post…"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I seem to have a flurry of topics to write on. Expect a lot of posts in a short time.  A couple of days back, I was just messing around with a couple of web designing tutorials from the internet on a dull afternoon. Heavy Alternative Rock music was blaring out from my radio and to add to the bewildering array of noise, yours truly was singing along. Ray was around; he was reading a text book in the middle of this commotion. I asked him why he would be studying when he had a perfectly calm room at the hostel. He said 'Umm… I have to be distracted by something so that I could concentrate on my books.' And I thought I was an expert at dishing out oxymorons. I bow to the king!  This is one of the seemingly endless list of similarities between myself and Ray. There have been so many discovered in the past few months that I am beginning to suspect evil wizardry and black magic at work. Anyway, I too enjoy reading my books when some sort of sound is there in the background. Most of the times, it is music on the radio. I don't mind if it rock, classical or jazz or for that matter, any kind of music. Just that it shouldn't be a talk-show.  Some of the ceiling fans available in India make enough noise to shut out all kind of sounds from outside the room. This is the only reason I love and hate ceiling fans. I love 'em when I need to be distracted from a noise source - read 'my mother, relatives or any unwelcome guest'. I hate 'em when I'm watching TV because they cut out the crispness of the audio stream.  Speaking of irritating sounds, the reason why I hate watching TV at home when Mom and Dad are around is because they seem to specialize in making noises that are amazingly irritating. Wondering why? Get a load of this -- Every night, my folks watch a hopelessly shallow Tamil soap called ' urlLink Annamalai '. Everything about the soap is shallow; the story, acting, script and even the sound track. Since they both are busy watching this, no unwelcome noises are heard and it is a perfect environment for watching TV.  Right after that, it is the time for sitcoms which I love watching. I go downstairs and switch on the TV. Mom and Dad get out of the couch and do these;  Dad 	   Goes to his bedroom and turns on the radio moderately loud. A classical western concert is usually being played. The recording is poor and the radio is awful in sound reproduction.  	   Takes up his ' urlLink mridangam ' (which by the way is a percussion instrument used in Eastern Classical music) and plays along with this. Of course, I should be enjoying this as I like all kinds of music. But what can I do if what he plays seems out-of-sync and too damn repetitive.     Mom 	   Goes to the kitchen and washes the dishes or does something noisy. Astonishing that she fails to realize that it is bloody irritating.   Talks on the phone to one of my aunts over the phone. Very loud. Conversation topics range from ordinary gossip, putting down other aunts, discussions about why the world should be coming to an end and why fate has been so cruel to them.     Both 	   If they both have nothing to do, they talk about things like how bad the other relatives are, why the word should be coming to an end, why fate has been so cruel to my mother, why my Dad's body should be itching at 11 O' Clock in the night etc.     You must be thinking why I can't ignore these things. I don't know why. I used to be able to during my childhood. But right now, I just seem to unable to, however hard I try. That is why I can't quite hope to watch a movie at home on the telly unless my folks are away or are sleeping. This is one big reason why I dig movie-halls. This also explains why  I paid to watch "" urlLink Gangs of New York "" in a cinema yesterday when it was being shown thrice weekly in one of the movie channels."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"In yesterday's post I think I sounded irrational. Perhaps I was. But I don't think I am generally irrational while taking my decisions. Career still reigns supreme over all other priorities in my life. But I would love having a love-life of your dreams along with a nice and stable professional life. I'm getting a lot of response from a lot of nice persons in the mailing list that I subscribe to. I'm already having enough to think about for some time.  Another interesting thing happened yesterday. After I and Ray went to May's place to help her out, we had been suspecting that she might pick Ray's gay identity up. Well she did that yesterday. And once she asked the question ""I hope Ray isn't that gay friend of yours, is he?"", I couldn't resist and as a result Ray has came out of the closet twice now. She has agreed to keep it as a secret and Ray is okay with this.  I have been having this viral prodrome for four days now; sore throat, stuffy nose and slight fever. I'm not ruling out anything now; and that anything includes the worst possible scenario, but I'm sort of wondering whether it is actually as bad as it can be. It is even worse now that I need to figure out alibis to take those X-rays of my impacted canine from a dental clinic (where I used to go to) to another one run by my friend (where I plan to go to from now on). Wish me luck with this!"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Oh my, I can't believe this is happening. Finally, an older man from my very own city is interested in me! He has replied to my earlier message. We're planning to get to know more about each other before we meet. I'm ecstatic about this."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Today, I did something criminal. No, I didn't get arrested by the police while doing 'unnatural sexual practices' as explained in the article 377 IPC. I did something on the internet. I copied a layout design of a popular website on the internet which I stumbled across while searching for tutorials. Of course I'm not going to give you details because I'm sure most of you will forget about this when I get my website running. And I'm sure I'm due for some praise.   urlLink   But seriously, I'm feeling guilty about doing something that I profess against. But it's okay I guess because I'm learning by fiddling around with someone else's design. Such messing around really teaches a lot. It is like a guided 'hands-on-tutorial'. I'm making some solid progress on this last two days. Once I get my layout right, getting it up on the internet should be easy as I have most of the content ready already.  Time for older men. After a period of two weeks, which felt more like two years, I went to the movies with Ray and watched 'Hidalgo'. The movie as such is just okay. But it does give a lot of 'food for thought' for guys like us. Omar Sharif is very attractive in the movie.  Especially with the kind of facial hair he sports in his role as a Sheikh. He would end up in my WHILTHS list soon I guess. It gets even better if he sports a stubble like this.    urlLink"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Finally, after a long wait of over 700 days, I was at the my college hospital doing some work. Oh, I can't tell you how good it felt! I was a little edgy when I went there. I didn't know if I could fit in to the system to which I was so snugly engaged 2 years back. The first day, or night rather, went very well. I feel like a changed person now while interacting with persons, especially patients. But since I was not officially on duty, I had to keep a check on myself through out the whole time. I have this problem of putting myself under all kinds of rules and restrictions during some occasions where I was uninvited/shouldn't have been present. It's fine to have some kind of restriction always. But I overdo it most of the times. Thankfully, except for the wretched feeling it gives me, it has never back-fired!  It was a very different day/night yesterday. I went back to the 2 movies/day theme. Watched Gladiator on TV in the morning. Again, I fell in love with the magnificience of Rome and the empire. Lovely screenplay, great fight scenes and of course, gorgeous SilverDaddies! Wait a minute! Every movie I love has one or two of these cute older men. Is it because of them that I watch movies? I was able to generalize the question sometime later on in the day. After reading/sleeping till tevening, I switched on the tennis on the tube from the French Open. It was a total mishap of the Ladies singles championship match. I was still enjoying it very much? Why you may ask? What? Not again! Yes, there are a lot of moustached daddies in the spectators that, very curiously, attract the attention of the cameras. They keep on showing such guys between points dammit! Is this why I watch Tennis? Maybe it's not just me. Perhaps, everyone likes them!  After spending the day until about 4 AM at the hospital, I came home feeling fresh. I had decided not to sleep and watched ""Braveheart"" on DVD. I think the theme is naive but the cinematography deserves some applause. Having seen Gibson's ""Passion..."", I feel that he makes movies in a similar way.  One more thought that I would like to share with you today. I don't know how many of you interact with so many persons in your professional life. But, my profession is such that a lot of unsuspecting persons pass through my life, as patients, who, under different circumstances, would be ideal persons to have a crush on or start a relationship with. During my internship, I had a lot of feelings with patients. But I tried supressing them not only because I was still uncomfortable about my sexual identity, but also because of the fact that I believe in strict professionalism at work. In the last 2 years or so, I have come out and now am very confident about myself being gay. It's the first time after this that I have worked in a professional enviornment. I saw a couple of interesting men and I stared at them a couple of seconds longer than others. What should I do in such situations? Does anyone have any idea?  The lack of sleep, about a couple of dozen hot men (combined total from TV, movies and hospital) and the pleasure of finding my feet back in my work environment is making me very horny today."

AX2K3G1,male,24,"I'm not updating the blog regularly. But when I do, you'll finally end up understanding why I should find this story relevant."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I’m back on the blog after a week where my life turned on itself, for the better! So many thoughts in my mind I wish to put down. These are very important days which I’m talking about. Those you are unlikely to forget for the rest of your life. So where did I leave you? I’m meeting an olderman on a date for the first time in my life.  The scene shifts to Friday evening, when I finally fixed a time and place for meeting my man. He has his own car and we plan to meet at a common place and decide on further plans. I’m thrilled to the core. I even start feeling a little nervous. Come on, this is my first time meet on a date! So what do I do? I got to SilverDaddies.com and start asking around for tips on dating. And some tips I got. I met three gentlemen in there, all very kind and considerate persons willing to give me tips on how to be safe etc. One of them, a painter/artist, was a very interesting person. He actually reviewed the Promises demo after getting to know that I was writing songs. The kind of dissection that song received from him (called Jim) was remarkable. I felt wonderful hearing from an art critic, a person who knows his bearings when it comes to music. This guy plays about 5 instruments and has had a singing career.  The point I’m trying to make is the fact that it’s amazing the quality of persons this SilverDaddies.com has to offer. I have been using the internet for some five years now and I have to admit that this site now has generated for me, five or six persons who are awesome, not just from the sex point of view. Thanks to Mr. Dennis Andersen, the owner of the site. I pity my friends who are straight but interested in meeting interesting persons over the internet. They don’t have such a site I’m sure.  After this, my friend comes over from College and we both watch the movie “Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade”. What a movie! I really mean it. I loved the movie as much as I loved the Godfather series. The most moving part of the story for me was the bonding aspect between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Connery played his part charmingly well enough to enter my list of “Persons I would like to have sex with”. The screenplay was captivating and the amount of thought that went into writing it must be remarkable. I can go on blah blah blah for a long time. But the point is – what are the new age directors thinking when making movies these days? With all the technological advances, surely movies should be made better with such great screenplay. This friend of mine has suggested two movies which are actually out of the way from my kind of movies, which have been exceptional. The other one is “Hero” by Jet Li.  After that, I went to my friend’s place to check on his Dad who has had a surgery. This is a person who, I have had the worst days of my life. But now we have settled the issues somewhat. I would like to really ponder why I did this after he almost forced me to committing suicide one day. Might that be because of the fact that I secretly had a crush on him stretching a few years back? Or is it because of my friend, with whom I’ve had my most inspiring musical moments with this friend back in the days when we used to jam. Maybe, I expect some magic when we jam again in the future. Or is it because of the fact that he was my sister’s idea of an ideal person, the kind that I looked up to emulate when I ‘grew up’? Maybe it is because of my grudge with the persons who said I can’t possibly do anything in a relationship because I suck at it. Am I trying to show them that I can bring a relationship back from a point of absolute no hope to its full bloom? I think I’ll keep on pondering till death about this.  Okay, so back to this friend’s Dad. He, along with his wife, had almost destroyed the careers of both me and my friend 4 years back. Now, they are seeing new light apparently! They have finally realized that their son is not going to realize his full potential until he goes to a career featuring music production, a field for which he is most blessed with. It felt awfully strange to hear the words “My son can’t work in a field which is not interested in!” tumble out of their mouths with a kind of hesitation and with a feeling of dejection. Was I not saying the same thing when they accused me of destroying their son?  The point is: Finally I’ve won a victory in a battle that changed my life. Wow, I feel so much better!

AX2K3G1,male,24,"urlLink Epistemology : Epistemology(Noun)  Pronunciation: [ê-pis-tê-'mah-lê-jee or -ji]  Definition 1: (Philosophy) The study of the nature of knowledge: suppositions, conclusions, and all that happens in between—how we know things; the structure of knowledge itself.  Very interesting word. Something like a fact about fact. I thought I'll share the word with you. Another new word usage that I came across today is 'acme'. Someone told congratulated me on reaching my acme. Well, I'd rather think that I've never reached acme and am striving for it. Keeps the drive going. Some of you may have realized, my life's peaking right now. But I am hoping that this is not the highest that it can ever reach.  I'm trying to don my Power Personality mode these days. Appearing confident about everything that I speak about. That can sometimes be deceiving to unsuspecting persons. Today, at the marriage ceremony that I had to attend, I had a few persons sermon me after hopelessly misunderstanding me. Check this out. I was having some fun with my uncle who I always enjoy having lively, humorous conversations with. I said ""In four years time, I'll be one of the  most-wanted Orthopedicians in town. I should be very busy and hard to reach."". The man behind me, my father's cousin, pulled himself up from the slumber in a chair and said gravely to my ear ""Whatever you do, always do something to help out the poor. Never let yourself be a money-machine who doesn't care about people. This is my advice to you."" Escuse me! I was just kidding. I am one of the proponents of the doctrine that my father's cousin preached.  Chuck had called me when I was at the wedding. I said that I was disappointed that he didn't inform me where he went. He explained that he thought I would want to come if he had informed me. Since there was not enough space in the car, he thought I will feel disappointed. Excuse me! I'm 24! I can understand when someone says no to something. Especially if it's for such a valid reason. He said sorry finally. But I need to talk to him about what he thinks of me."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Yesterday's mystery has been partially solved. From what my friend suggests, the concept of man descending from the Dwarves is there in some mythologies. More specifically, the Nordic mythology (a.k.a. Norse mythology). For those who don't have a clue of what this is, it is the mythology originating from Germany. I have not yet found reference to this link. But that ain't the point. With the British Council library providing online access to the Encyclopaedia Brittannica and Oxford Reference to it's members, internet has become very useful to many like myself. Now I can look up anything that I don't understand at possibly the best knowledge bank available. Reading books, watching movies etc. has changed since this facility became available. For example, I learnt that the Harmonica comes in two types - Diatonic and Chromatic. The one which I started playing about a week is of the former type in C. This is so much fun!  I'm very excited about the fact that ""Promises"" is listener friendly. Most of my friends who have listened to it are happy about the song. This makes me wonder if I should devote most of the free time that I'm having currently to songwriting instead of having fun watching movies, hanging out etc. But then, artists should not be deprived of their sources of inspiration! Could somebody passover my 'issues list'? The insatiable craving for amusement today meant that I don't have any time to start on a new song.  Today's movie was ""Harry Potter - The Prisoner of Azkaban"" at the city's best theatre. It was my first experience with Rowling's work both in print or screen. I thought the story was a bit of a drag and the acting not up to standard. Screenplay could have been a lot better. But the best part of the movie was it's Animated parts. I really think that movies like ""Hellboy"", ""Day After Tomorrow"" and this Harry Potter movie have raised the standards of animation in Hollywood from the critically backed ""highs"" in ""Spiderman"". Honestly, I don't think the animationg in Spidrman was all that good. I'm referring to the jumps and landings in the film which look highly artificial. In this Harry Potter movie, the animation featuring ""the Buck Peak"" was simply breathtaking.  Coming off the topic of movies and back to my personal life which is taking a gently swing, I spent some quality time talking about topics from Profession to marriage with a couple of friends from college. This is something which I wouldn't even have imagined a couple of years back. Now I want to spend more time like this. Although I still suspect it has got something to do with the delectable variety of the Older Men on display at the locations where we choose to hang out, this is remarkable if you have been a friend of mine in the last five  years.  Another thing which I must note down is that I'm feeling very good about my right wrist these days. I played a whole badminton game with a friend of mine today without even feeling the slightest discomfort. If you are wondering why I should be mentioning this, I had sustained a sprain about a month and half back and couldn't even lift a glass of water using my right hand about 3 weeks back."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"First of all, I never meant it to be this bland, a happy friendship day to all of you those who come and spend their precious time reading my blog and commenting on it. You have made my life richer by doing so and I'm very grateful for that.  Now, having that load off my chest, I can write on some grave issues. Grave issues from my personal POV (Point of View for those who don't follow such wicked acronym's). The last few days, I have not been finding enough time to blog! Whoa whoa, stop it right there? What am I saying? Yes, it is true. It is a fact. I'm not getting enough time to blog, to read and reply to e-mails etc. The reason for that is that I am starting work on Monday, August 2nd.  It has been over 2 years since I have been to a hospital. Lots of stuff I had to do to get everything just right as I start work. I had to get my wardrobe back up and running, especially the formals section. I had to get my lab coat, theatre-dress (scrubs) cleaned. Tomorrow, I have to iron a truck load of stuff while watching the Asia Cup final between India and Sri Lanka. My scooter needed service. The list of chores could go on and on...  Besides, I have been spending a lot of time at the dentist's. Oh! I haven't told you yet, have I? I have finally got braces on. It is not as uncomfortable as some of my friends suggested mainly due to the fact that traction using rubber bands has not been applied on mine yet. And because they are  urlLink ceramic braces , they look great. For that, I have had to subject myself to a couple of tooth extractions. Both were relatively pleasant extractions. But the second one has given me a long, thin, crevice in my mouth which lodges food residues which accumulate, putrefy and impart a nice little toothache/headache.  This has been quite a problem for me over the last couple of days. So much so, that I have had to use analgesics (painkillers) for the purpose. Well the pain is sort of dull, vague, depressing type and handicaps me in almost everything. Besides, I have have horrid time eating because it is hard to chew with braces on. And once you have eaten, you actually feel like a rhinoceros in a stenchy pool of dirt because just about everything you have eaten seems to have stagnated in your mouth.  That is not all. It is better for me to not have tea/coffee or any colored/stainable beverage because they can stain these ceramic braces. You have got to admit, what is the point in having these expensive ceramic braces if they get dicolored?  Having read all this, you might be worndering if I'm feeling bad about putting on braces. It must be obvious, right? But it isn't. I'm feeling okay. One of my friends pointed out a few years back: 'Kris, you have a wonderful face. But you need to get your teeth sorted out to let the beauty through!' I guess, all this trouble is worth taking if I'm going to get a wonderful smile in under 2 years time. After all, I'm going to be on the hunt to seduce the hottest men on the planet. And for that I need to be physically endowed."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I don't know if anyone is keeping a track on gay blogs for the past 2 days, especially those from New York. The main event featured in these blogs is a broadway musical called  urlLink That's SO Gay: Tales of Extremely Gay Gayness . My godfather in blogging, FAUSTUS MD, performed a gay cabaret song which he himself had written. From the comments on his blog you can be pretty sure that he did a great job. Now, Faustus actually went on to describe, on his blog, a few facts about his life which, he thought, made him gayer than most other gay people. Having thought I had read enough about gayness for a day, I went through another blog called  urlLink Evelasting Blogstalker  by a man who calls himself  urlLink Charlie . Found out even more about extreme gayness.  Ergo, my self-doubting alter-ego took center stage. How gay am I? I don't dress like gays. I don't walk poodles or matisse around. In fact, my dog can be considered as a 'bisexual' kind of dog. She isn't either too masculine or feminine. I don't frequent the gyms nor am I a particularly well built person. Okay, I adore boxer trunks! But very few people know that I'm actually gay. But I'm sure I'm gayer than most other gay persons. It's just that I don't go around splashing it all over myself. Maybe it's because I'm in India. Maybe it's because of the way I'm. Whatever it is, I'm very comfortable with it.  I may not be the gayest person alive. But I'm one of the geekiest persons to hail from my neck of the woods, I'm sure. Yesterday, I managed to get invited to 3 G-mail accounts from a source I wouldn't like to divulge because I value their privacy. Now, most persons around me don't even know what G-mail is. If that was not geeky enough, I actually spent the whole day migrating to these accounts from my current Yahoo accounts. My initial review gives 8 out of 10 to G-mail. The problems with the interface and slackness with attachments etc. seem to be problems that can be sorted out in the alpha version.  On a different beat, I talked for a long time with Chuck. We sorted things out. He has promised not be this creepy again. He actually wanted to hear all about my encounters with Mr. Lion. And I, as you might have expected, confided in him like a little pre-teen girl. I can assure you he was feeling like throwing up the enjoyable Punjabi food that we were having at a restaurant when this happened. But he still listened to me. He put forward his opinions. And he, mind you, is absolutely straight. And that is why I think he's cool.  I don't know if I'm the latest casanova on a site that I'm registered in ( urlLink SilverDaddies.com ), but I'm getting a lot of proposals from older men from all over the world. One of them, of special mention, is a very well known person (who is known as Skip  ) in the sporting circles in Australia. He is a charming, funny, enthusiastic man who actually carried the Olympic torch when it went through Sydney. And he likes me very much. So much so, that he has actually invited me to come to Sydney for watching a summer test match at  urlLink  the SCG  with complete hosting and entertainment from his side.  I told Chuck about this. And you should have seen his jaw hit the table to create a minor dent that would go unnoticed with the restaurant owner. He asked me “What’s happening to the world these days? Don’t straight guys have any chance at all?” Coming to think of it, he might be right. Look at me. I live in a conservative society which is orthodox and where, being gay is ridiculed. But, I’m seeing someone, enjoying a sex life and finding great persons from all over the world. And Chuck, he’s not doing any of these at the moment. Straight persons, as someone said, must be out of their minds!  I'm rounding this post off on a sad note on behalf for those who follow English soccer. Yesterday's game was breath-taking. But Portugal did give England the kind of fight that would at least, bring in some respect to the English defeat yesterday. And for da Wayne, he, in my opinion, will be good enough to be a force for at least a decade. And we will see more of him, talk more about him and raise his iconic status even further."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Ha ha ha! I am laughing already at the title of my post for today. No prizes for guessing the movie which I watched today. I must say that I enjoyed the movie especially the funny parts. Needless to say, the hunky Dads on the movie really whetted my appetite. Apart from sex, the movie provided me with a lot of thinking about my life with my family. I am feeling very much like ""Tula"" from the movie. I dislike most of the things about my family and it's roots. I have a real problem with adjusting with my parents, cousing etc. I am spending most of my days wishing I was in a different family who enjoyed life in the ways that I like. In fact this feeling has been strong enough to influence my sexuality. The reason why I seek older men is because I would like my partner to be a guide/advisor/dad to me. Much like the regular ""Dad"" in my ideal family.  The movie ends with the thought that wherever one may go in life, your family is going to be there and you have to get on with that fact. Right now, I'm trying to escape forever from the clutches of this family. I'm trying to finish my studies in a city far from where I have been brought up in and then going on to settle there. I don't think I'm willing to let myself adjust to the family which I have disliked for a lifetime.  Besides this, I'm starting on the ""Lord of The Rings"" books which seem to be very interesting. I hope they entertain me much the same ways as Asmiov did with ""Foundation"" series. Another problem has come up these days. One of my friends is acting funny and is not willing to talk to me about it. I'm really wondering what to do next."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I went through the second half of the topsy-turvy ""Pulp Fiction"" to start off the day. Wow, what a movie! Great ending and it's very funny in a grave sense. But, as I have posted in another forum somewhere else on the internet, I thought the F-word and the graphic violence were accentuated to levels which ended up tainting the movie. As I began searching online for great movies to watch, I stumbled upon JRR Tolkien's epic; Lord of the Rings. A few days back my dear friend, who's is an avid reader, suggested that I should read the book before I watched the movies.  I was very anxious to get my hands on the book and had to hurry through my chores to get to the library. I got the paperback monster of the book of the ""trilogy"" (which actually it isn't. It's supposed to be six books and indices). I visited my friend wearing the short-shirt which he had bought me from Delhi. I love the shirt. But, there is a slight problem which is confusing. The two halves of the shirt are not of equal length. The right half of the shirt is half an inch longer than it's counterpart. Is this some kind of a new fashion statement?  Anyway, I went to the DVD rental shop and got myself ""Ben Hur"". I read up about the movie online and I hope to be as thrilled as the reviews suggest. But to my disappointment, the DVD is not original. Picture and Sound qualities are far from perfect.  In the night, I watched the wonderful movie ""The Hours"" on TV. I really enjoyed the movie and was really touched by the amount of sadness depicted by the different roles. What really stuck out was the amount of home homophilia in the movie. There are three kissing scenes involving women only. There are two same-sex couples in the movie. Wowowowow, what's this? I never thought I would so much of 'gaydom' on Prime Timve television in India.  Things are looking really up! Or is it too early to call?"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"My sister finally went back. I was glad and relieved when she did because now I didn’t need to talk to her. Furthermore, she was depriving me of precious time to type mails to Mr. Lion. Hell whatever, I finally decided on meeting Mr. Lion in a hotel room and have some fun. I don't want to go into graphic description of the whole event. But it was so much fun for me. Lots of kissing, caressing, fondling went on. I gave Mr. Lion the time of his life (I hope). It was the first time I did it but I felt at home doing it. In between, we talked about a lot of things including my Sis.  Having said that, I was a bit disappointed that I couldn’t respond properly to what Mr. Lion had to offer. I have been thinking about the reasons why. I have concluded that it was due to the fact that I never fantasized anyone doing such things to me. I dream of me doing such things to others! Maybe a physical factor (which might need a surgical consult) was also involved. Again, I’m not detaling.  In the end, I feel wonderful after going through my first sexual experience. It was certainly fun. I hope to have more fun in the coming months! Thank you Mr. Lion!!!"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I guess I should have seen it coming when he started saying  urlLink weird things about me . The actual ditching process was arrogantly wicked. I had e-mailed him if I found me so annoying as to stop chatting with me and had suggested that if that was the case, we should stop interacting altogether. He edited the text that I had typed deleting everything but this -  'we should stop interacting altogether' . I'm sad to lose a very knowledgeable friend. But I don't think that I have done anything wrong.  It is funny that he should ditch me on the day when I found that my nick name Kris has a hurtful meaning;   Kris : Malay or Indonesian dagger with a wavy-edged blade.    In the last three days, I've found about half a dozen interesting blogs to read. I have actually started gathering a list of them which is on display on the sidebar on the right above my 'Previous Posts'.  urlLink Jalal 's  urlLink Search for Love in Karachi , so curiously named like Faustus MD's inspiration blog, is probably the one which I most enjoyed reading. The others whose style I'm still getting used to are  urlLink Sarah  with her  urlLink Tales of Ordinary Madness  and Sin with his  urlLink Venial Sin: Culture Chameleon .  As my irrepressable hunger to write about myself rages on, I'm amassing plenty--and when I say plenty, I mean it--of text for my personal website. Sometimes it is boring and I wish I could stop. But it cetainly helps if you get comments about this blog from someone as important as Mr. Lion himself. He actually typed in   ""... is just fantastic. I do not want to boost your morale unreasonably, but i get a feeling that you are developing a fine talent. Your writing reminded me of Frank Kafka or Sharti Brata. Please keep it up. It gave a fine (though long) reading to me. All the same, I appreciate your style.""    As I come to terms with issues in my life regarding  lengths , I'm glad I've found one where I need to decrease, rather than increase that of  something . ;-)  Wow! But I have to admit that I didn't even know who these two authors were until I looked them up on the internet. But I'm sad that I couldn't find more about their work. With suspicion of being deceived by flattery lurking in the background, I felt elated. And to add to this, I've been commented upon by a few of my readers. I feel very good about this.   urlLink   One strange feeling that is seeping over me is a desire to become a pig. Not any darned pig, of course. I would give up all of the rest of my life; rest meaning the part I haven't been talking about, for becoming a piglet like the one in the picture. For those still not getting the point, I love Cats - specifically Tigers and a certain breeds of Lions! The only disgusting part of the photo is it's source;  urlLink NewsIsCrappy.com . It's a pity that these people find such cute stories attractive."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Life gets weirder. First of all, FAUSTUS MD, the man who inspired me (with the blog  urlLink The Search for Love in Manhattan ) to create this blog, replied to mail saying that he enjoyed my style of writing. Great! Mr. Lion gave me and Ray a wonderful tour of the zoo. It also featured close encounters with tigers which is what I have always fantasized about! Everything about Mr. Lion is infatuating! Ray finally agreed to my earlier descriptions about the man. Mr. Lion and Ray were meeting for the first time and now they are going to meet again in about three days’ time.  Now, you must be confused about the picture. I’m dating Mr. Lion. I along with Ray go see Mr. Lion. Mr. Lion is making plans with Ray. It’s not a complicated love triangle. I and Ray can’t figure out why we are doing this. But the truth of the matter is that it’s very hard to find any SilverFox in this part of the world, forget someone like Mr. Lion! And therefore, we are okay with Mr. Lion seeing both of us at the same time.  Back to cloud 1. I want to see Mr. Lion more often. Not for sex always. Just to share some time between us. I don’t know if Mr. Lion is game for it. I’ve sent him a mail asking him if he would be interested. I hope he says yes.  What would you do if your best friend did something like going to a hill station without telling you? What if the reason for him not informing might be that he is scared that you might want to go along with him to the tour? Chuck is doing this to me now. But I’m fine with it. I’m not that easy to convince against in such situations."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Yesterday was a wonderful day in my life. I should admit that I was feeling very happy after my first date ""in Bed"". Even though I was able to please Mr. Lion (to an extent I think I have), some sort of nervousness hidden in me prevented me from enjoying the reciprocation.  So, feeling wonderful I was; but also feeling rather anxious about not hearing from Mr. Lion. Finally, he responded in the afternoon saying that it was nice experience blah blah. I wanted to chat with him somehow. It didn’t materialize yesterday and not until now. In the back of my mind I was feeling undecided whether to go to Delhi or to join my college as volunteering intern. Plus, I haven’t decided on a date yet to ‘give’ Julie to its new master.  Multitude of reasons made me wish there was someone with me to do something to take my mind off. I set out to see Ray who was actually busy at the hospital relieving someone. I met him in the intensive care unit and learnt something that I have always wanted to learn. How to operate the Ventilator and other monitoring devices. Ray is very good at explaining. He’s patient and answers all your questions with disregard to the actual intelligence involved in putting together the question.  After that bit, I took Ray home to help me out with my website updates. Plans went awry as we found ourselves at the mercy of the games that the Kerala State Electricity Board likes to play. Mind you, it’s not even a week since they have taken off the Load-Shedding bit. The half an hour per day cuts have been generously replaced by outages in the morning which last about 2 hours. Anyway, what this meant that we had to go out and we ended up having a lot of fun.  To the beach we went first and spent a lot of time knowing more about each others’ past lives. It’s alarming that we should have so many similarities. We also tried solving crosswords but ended up feeling like miserable jerks when we couldn’t even find more than 4 answers out of 50. A stroll on the beach is always great for ‘silverfox-spotting’. Even though a drizzle made a decent try at stopping us from enjoying, we beat it to the new park in the cultural capital of the city. It’s an awesome place and things like this should be encouraged. Except for the loud and senseless speech about some kind of harmony between religions blaring over cheap speakers, the park too was a pleasant experience. To top things off, there was this awesome dinner at the “Punjabi Dhaba”. In a matter of a few months, this place is becoming “the” place to have food. I love the “Aloo ka Paratha” at the place.  Did I ever mention to *you*, the reader of my blog, that I’m feeling a bit like ‘living’ Will & Grace? If I haven’t yet, then I’m feeling like that. I have always wanted to lead a life in the way one of these sitcoms portray it. Look I’m gay. I’m seeing someone. I have a friend Ray who is gay. I have someone like Chuck and May who know practically everything about me. Great friends, gay friends and an active sex life; Wait a minute! Isn’t this Will & Grace without all the jokes?  Among the things that me and Ray have been talking about, one thing that I would like to write about is about the relationship with parents. Ray had the opinion that I’m just taking things too seriously at home. I am expecting too much from my parents while not giving what they want. I know that this is true to some extent. But then, I just wish for someone like Chuck’s parents who enjoy dining out, having fun and talk to each other more. Then again Chuck is not gay, he’s religious and does do things that his Mom and Dad want him to. Thinking about what might have been had I not been like what I am now is never going to work, is it?  Anyhow, I would still like to give you an example of what goes on in my house which always seems to irritate me. Today afternoon, I was feeling happy about having worked out properly for the first time after my sprain. I had gone down to have lunch keeping a happy face and feeling good. Mom and Dad are watching the Sun News channel. Mom served me the set. I thought I will watch some TV while I’m eating. I ask my father if I can watch TV for 10 minutes.  Dad said “You can watch TV alright. But if you don’t mind I would like to watch TV for another 10 minutes.” Mom said “Why do you ask? Have we ever prevented you from watching TV?” Both don’t look in the eye. Mom said what she did with the kind of unhappiness which depressed me. Now you might be thinking that this is normal. But when you understand that my father always says things like this without actually meaning it. He actually wanted to see TV for half an hour. If he wanted to say he would like to watch TV for half an hour, why not say that? Why should he be dishonest in this?  Dishonesty is one thing my father always sports. Especially when it comes to saying things like   “I know it’s there somewhere here, but can’t find it now.”  - The thing was never there.   “This thing is brand new. I bought it a couple of weeks back.”  - It was bought about 10 years back and it looks damn old.   “I have never seen the TV go as dark as it does. It was normal until today.”  - The TV has not been working properly for about 4 years now.  The levels of dishonesty creep up to dizzying levels when he speaks to a guest/friend. He tries to praise himself and everyone else to glory. I can’t stand that. Why can’t he be straight-forward and say the truth?  My Mom’s cooking is in such a way that some times the gravy and the pieces in the curries seem like separate. Now this is accentuated when the curry is hot. When she’s at home, she cooks late and at lunch everything is warm. This of course, does more harm to the curry than not because of the problem. I hate this and always ask her to cool everything down before serving. But she never seems to understand and always blames me for complaining too much. The same happened today.  So I’m left eating at the table munching my not-so-delectable lunch. I try to drown with my best effort. This is what goes on around me.  Dad’s picking on his nose. It is ugly to see how he does it. He sort of lunges back after each pick and the whole upper limb motion is very jerky. After each pick he carefully inspects what is between his fingers. If there is something appreciably large, it ends up on the floor by the couch.  Mom’s trying to act interested in what is going on in the TV. She makes strange faces. She has her hand inside her underskirt and she’s also picking somewhere. I can’t see properly where.  Seeing this, I hope to see something pleasant on TV. Surprise, surprise it’s Sun TV. They show ugly Tamilians with weird hairdos, weirder accents and even yuckier things to talk about. At times the guy on the tube talks so loud, I have to plug my ears. And even more surprising, my parents are enjoying it. After all, they aren’t watching TV! They are busy with picking at themselves.  It’s too much for me. I have to stop eating lunch and come up to type this. I feel so bad at not being able to adjust to these apparently trivial things at home. I hope someone finds out that this is not so easy to adjust."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Today, I got into our college library after about 3 years. It felt wonderful to be back inside the place where I used to spend a lot of hours in my undergrad days. But I had to go through a lot of shit to get in.  To get inside the library, you needed a college ID card. I was denied of one because I was doing Voluntary training. Without and ID you had to get an external membership after paying extra charges. That is not the actual catch. With external membership, you cannot use the library after 4 pm in the afternoon. Of course, I can't accept that. So I had to meet the Principal and a couple of professors in charge of the library. Hopefully, I can get the confusion sorted out by tomorrow.  Ray and Mr. Lion met again and had sex today. Ray was really ecstatic about this when I met him in the evening. I couldn't get Mr. Lion's reaction to this. I am sure he would have enjoyed this as much as Ray did. The coolest thing is that I am not even feeling bad about missing out. I guess, I can wait even longer for more action.  In the night, after a sudden surge of inspiration, I re-recorded 'Living Your Dream' again. This time, I did it with a capo on the 3rd fret. I was amazed to listen to the result. This really looks like a listenable song. I really wish I had written something better. Maybe I should re-write the song. I don't know if that is technically correct ie. compose a song and then re-write the lyrics.  Two days after, guys."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Nothing interesting happening in life these days. Last two days have not been interesting enough to generate enough thoughts to write a blog entry. Apart from constructive criticism about my new song, nothing interesting has happened. I'm reading Lord of the Rings, apart from sleeping all day."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I know that the in-thing these days is Photoblogging. But it's not due to that reason that I'm posting so many photos in my posts, as I'm going to today for example.  I have been bragging about my  urlLink WHILTHS list . Yes, so from the time of the Kuwaiti invasion in early 90s (I know some of you would positively stop breathing when I finish this sentence), Saddam Hussein has been in there. If you are not seeing the light in my argument, this is why.  urlLink    urlLink    If you still don't like him try these.  urlLink    urlLink    At least this should get yourself attracted!  urlLink    I know that I'm crazy about him. But, don't you see the reason? Come on, wasn't he cute? Didn't he hold a powerful position? Doesn't he look downright - I mean business - kinda guy? But as many older men, he hasn't gotten any better with age. Check these pics out to find why.  urlLink    urlLink    Maybe it's because he didn't have nourishment during the months of refuge in that pit. Maybe he is having some other affliction (I heard that he might have cancer). But anyhow, he's not as hot anymore.  Mr. Lion's computer finally is back up and running. You know the funny thing in his mails is the way he conceals the words like sex, fellatio with words like 'discussion' and 'active participation' etc. This reads crazy when you actually are reading mails. I guess this is to keep himself under cover, from his family, about his gay identity.   Mr. Docker is acting serious and weird these days. The other day, he was offended(although he has not admitted yet that he was) when I asked him to read my blog. He said that he would like to know more about me before reading the blog as he thought that it was intrusion of privacy otherwise. That is strange enough for me. He went on to say that I keep on changing topics in chat and that when he wants to continue on a particular topic, I am tenacious. Today morning, he asked me a set of short, direct questions. I answered them. He asked me if I would like to ask some about him. As I was chatting with a few others at the same time, I took some time in replying. I apologized and explained this. He winded up the chat saying 'Next time I send you a greeting, if you are already engaged in chatting with someone else, please tell me.  I prefer to chat one-on-one, without competition. Good night.' Is this strange or what? Maybe it's the age factor - he is 75!   I don't know if you have heard of them,  Red Rain , a gospel (I presume) band from the New Zealand which performed in  my town  yesterday. I and Ray had almost decided on going. But the gospel thing put us off. Even  urlLink their website  is in an *.org domain! We spent the evening doing a crossword instead. I am wondering if I have squandered an opportunity to see a rock band in action. It's so rare a phenomenon in this part of the world!"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Ever since I have been to my friend's wedding a couple of weeks back, I have been seriously thinking about marriage. The very thought that my so-very-radical friend could adjust and adapt to the situations that demanded him to do so, is looming large in my mind. In college, it was us two who were the odd ones out. We never believed in arranged marriage. Hell, I was a strong opponent of marriages of all kind during the days when I was still not at terms with my sexuality.  Now, I approach the concept of marriage with more confidence. Of course, what I mean by the term marriage is 'gay-marriage'. It seems like a wonderful prospect. To fall in love and marry, then share everything, have fun and of course, sex with a man of my dreams; seems so rosy. That is my dream. And it will remain a dream if I stay in India.  Gay marriage is still a long way from being accepted in India where being openly gay itself is very hard. That is why I'm considering migrating abroad. My newly-wed friend and I had a conversation about this before his marriage. He had the opinion that the US of A was not the best option for me, as I had presumed. He thought that Europe is the best place to go and lead an openly gay life and maybe even marry. Canada was another good choice in his opinion.   urlLink   Now, it must a great coincidence that I have a lot of e-acquaintances from Canada. I hope I could fall in love with one of them and marry them! ;) One of them is the handsome Raul, who I had mentioned in a post some time back. I also promised that I would share with you a snap of his. I'm keeping my promise. Tell me what you think about him.  Coming back to the topic of migration; one thing that hurts me is the fact that I could have thought about this before I took my all-important decision-about how to do my post-graduation. I could have so easily opted for doing that in US/Canada and could have been studying there right now. But at that time, I wasn't even sure about my sexuality. Forget marriage. And that is why I opted to do my PG in India.   This leaves me with just one good option. To finish my MS course in India and after that try for options abroad. I'll be 28 by then. If everything works out well, I could be starting to do my two year rotation in US/Canada by the time I'm 30. But then, if that is the only way, there isn't any choice for me. Getting a visa is tough in India. I might have to get married to a person living in the country that I wish to migrate, to even get a VISA. By the time I'm 30, I hope to be in a position to tell my family that I'm gay I would only marry a man.  Wow, things look really complicated as of now. I think I'll have to read up a lot about the procedures and make my mind up in about 5 years from now. But will I be able to find my love by then?"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"It did seem a little strange when I first started talking to my sister after she came home. Two years back, I was being the post-pubescent younger brother without any sense of direction in life and she used to be the mature person who had the life that she once hoped for. We shared everything between ourselves. I have been grateful to her for supporting the way she has did in letting me become what I’m now.  Now it’s almost the exact opposite. I am enjoying what my life the way I want with the kind of confidence that I rarely experience. She is going through one of her worst phases of her life after marrying. And she seems lost in her own castle of shattered dreams. She and I have been rarely talking for the past few months. I was feeling bad about not doing that.  The conversations seem to follow the same course. She explains how wonderful she’s feeling being back at home. Then goes on to say how bad her life is at her new home but how good BIL is. I try to explain to her that it’s over a year and a half and that they two have to decide on a proper strategy which would work to make her life better. She says “You don’t understand. This isn’t easy!”.  For three days the conversation went on in this pattern with me trying in vain to suggest that they are allowing someone to rule over them without any need for the same. Finally, I felt lost again and contacted my personal shrink, Mr. Lion.  Mr. Lion asked me to stop bothering my Sis and BIL with their troubles unless they demanded help. He said that me and my Sis are showing something called “Allelomimetic behaviour” which actually means group thinking behaviour. He said it’s fine just to give them support and in due course things will clear up. He also suggested the origin of my homosexual tendencies from one of my parents. He also thinks this might have rubbed on my sister. Honestly, I never thought about that!  This is extremely interesting. I’m in a situation where I think I have found some answers to the origins of my sexual orientation. Also, Mr. Lion has cleared up my dilema about my sister. I’m quitting from being allelomimetic with my Sis. Thank you, Mr. Lion!"

AX2K3G1,male,24,"Yesterday was a hopeless day for me thanks to a get-together with my classmates from school. I never liked my days in school. There was a remarkable consistency in the lowliness in every conceivable aspect my school life. Undereducated neurotic fools with mannerisms donned the role of teachers. I was known as the geek who topped exams regularly and because of this status, everyone acted funny with me. Being the youngest in my class, I was pushed around in the playground and was considered immature for naughty jokes and porn. It was a boys-only school which meant that everyone, except me, was fascinated by a particular page on the biology textbook dealing with the female reproductive system. To sum up, it was like hell with the difference that it was hopelessly less exciting.  I started from home thinking that I could pull it off the experiences of self-realization in my adult life. I was  SO  wrong. The initial exchange of pleasantries was the only enjoyable bit. From then on, things went from good to bad to worse to hopeless—read—discussion about what we’ve been upto TO delusion of grandeur because of being successful in life even after passing out of such a shabby school TO amazingly cheap jokes and deceitful heterosexist remarks TO the apparent lack of purpose in their lives apart from getting it on with a woman, of course.   urlLink   I was feeling rotten. I was lost. I was gay. In reality, I’m not rotten, nor am I lost and I  AM  very glad to be gay. But even the thought of coming out to these guys seems more of an impossibility than getting Bush to spell the word ‘possibility’.  Life doesn’t get any easier for me, at least in the next four days. I’m going on a trip to attend a friend’s wedding with a ‘friend’ of mine who pisses me off about 4 times in ten minutes every time we meet. Wish me luck, everyone. The only things that have cheered me up in the last two days – chatting with Mr. Lion who seems to get more attractive by the day and the discovery of a sketch of my perfect older man."

AX2K3G1,male,24,"My mother retired voluntarily from serving the Central Government for over 40 years yesterday. She was an employee of Department of Posts. There was an official sending off function at the office and a lot of her colleagues gave her a farewell accompanying her home. She, as I can understand very well, was very touchy about this. This was probably one of the moments in her humble career-one in which she had to sacrifice promotions for staying with her family. She used to be considered as a trust-worthy, reliable, efficient person at her office; almost the exact opposite to what she was in her family's eyes. Apart from this, I know how a work environment can liberate oneself from the limitations imposed by the family structure. I knew my mother enjoyed working immensely. But as she was tiring, she had to compromise on that to enjoy a quiet retired life.  Anyway, the point that I'm trying to make is that I knew how important this was to her. And that is why I did my level best to get everything ready for the guests. I spent almost all day doing that hoping to make her feel really good about it all. And it worked! And I'm happy; maybe even proud!  Apart from her colleagues, almost everyone from my father's side of the family came for the function. Some even got her gifts! You should have seen the thrilled look on her face when she opened up the package with the Mysore Silk Saree, an expensive one, which my sister and in-laws had sent! Everything was so bright and happy! One any other day, this kind of get-together could have been one of my nightmares-I would get stuck in these pointless arguments with my relatives about topics such as religion and marriage. But it wasn't in the end! It was actually fun! I enjoyed being the ""nu"" Me; somone who  is  mature enough, and matured enough in the eyes of others, to not be tampered with in his concepts about various issues. Would you believe that I actually enjoyed recording the new mallu hit ""Lajjavathiye"" with me on the guitar and my cousins on vocals?! This remarkable step in my musical career can be looked at as a deterioration in the quality of music that I play. Or maybe just expanding one's own horizons. I take the second.  I never want to get too serious about anything in life, at least for a prolonged period of time. That is why I'm giving you this piece of info about the origin of the ""Man with the Moustache"".

AX2K3G1,male,24,"I have been rambling about my physical appearance in the past few days. I am being very self-conscious about the fat content in my body and its distribution, about what kind of postures that I adopt during daily routines etc. As a matter of fact, I just repositioned myself in my un-ergonomically designed chair as soon as I typed in the word 'posture' in the last line. I'll probably do the same every time I read this post.  In the last 2 years, during my preps for the entrance exams, I gained a few pounds of abdominal fat. It is very obvious; at least to me. I have a couple of ugly love handles and I have started energetically on the sculpturing of a 'tummy', which for some unfortunate reasons, is a genetic trait having high chance of inheritance in my family. Of course, if I decide to employ almost all of the muscle fasiculi in the anterior abdominal wall, I can get away with these now.  Curiously enough, and to my dismay, my gene pool lacks those lovely alleles for a muscular physique. Up to about 2 years back, my mid-arm-circumference could easily pass as that of a kid of 10 years. I have put on some upper body muscle since then, but I'm still very thin. The disparity in the upper body mass and tummy-mass further ruins my image.  I do some exercises at home. I have a couple of dumb-bells and do some crunches. And of course, I jog as regularly as I can. But still this abdominal pad only seems to increase. Today morning, when I was waiting for Chuck to turn up for jogging, I accidentally ran my hands along my side and had the ugly sensation of palpating your own 'love handles', tense with lardaceous fat!  I badly want to go to a gym and get in shape. I want to reduce my waist line so that I can slip in my size 30 pants with ease. Right now, only some of these fit me properly. But the problem with a gym is the timing problem and the cost. The cost is actually not prohibitive. But, I'm not earning anything these days. So I have a mental block. Finding enough time should be hard when I start working (voluntarily, meaning without pay) at the hospital at the start of next month.  I don't know if I have a body image problem. Maybe I'm being just plain health conscious. Or maybe it is because I want to evergreen-attractive in the gay sense. When I say such stuff to my straight-friends, they seem to laugh me off. Of course, most of them are more out of shape that I am. That doesn't mean that I can compare with them and feel happy about myself.   Whatever it is, I need to find a solution soon. Maybe I should stop eating like a pig, which I often do. Or maybe I and Ray should pitch in and get a few more weights and make a personal gym. Ray seems to be the only other person in my life who want to keep him trim and in shape. It is funny to note that Ray is also the only gay/bi person of my age that I know in real life."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"It has become some sort of ritual nowadays; can't sleep without watching two movies. Watched ""Erin Brockovich"" on HBO in the night. Thought the dialoagues in the movie were fantastic. Even if it was a real-life story which should deserve a lot of sympathy, there are parts in the movie where you would wish someone could just give a whack to Julia because of the way she behaves. If that was the point that the movie intended to convey, it has done that tremendously well. Earlier, you could have seen me coming out a theater very disappointed about the movie that I had to endure - called ""Murder"". It's a movie in Hindi and it was remarkable how the director managed to turn the movie from being bad to bullshit in the closing stages.  The movie was supposed to be a sex thriller. But all it did was to help shed the inhibitions of my friend who shared with us his first sexual experience. Mind you, we are from a very conservative part of society in the place I live in. Therefore, don't get yourself excited too much. Actually, I'm brining up this because I wanted to throw light into a couple of idiosyncrasies. My friend told me that he wouldn't get excited if someone sucked on his nipples. He also shied away being at the giving end of a blowjob. Come on! How can this be possible? I am wondering if these are attractive to me because I'm queer. I hope (and I'm sure) that it's not!  By the way, I'm planning a trip to visit my sister. I might end up seeing her in a week from now. Another thing that I noticed today - I think I'm more comfortable being with my college friends than with those who I share common interests with eg. music. I'm really wondering why such a gigantic change is occuring to my personality."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Go Portugal, go! Go Scolari, go! Yes, he was looking really hot yesterday when the Portugese played sublime football the go past Holland to the Euro 2004 Final. It was funny that the TV anchor (John Dykes on Star Sports) should point out similarity between the looks of Luiz Felipe Scolari and Gene Hackmann. Being the crazy nut I'm, you'd expect the proof, which is below! Woof!  	 		 	 urlLink   		 		 	 urlLink   		 	 	 		 Luiz Felipe Scolari 		 Gene Hackman 	   I guess this occasion calls for Scolari to be added as the latest entry in my "" urlLink With Him, I'd Like To Have Sex "" List (WILTHS List). Gene was already in there long time back.  A few weeks earlier, I was talking about the rumor of a gay minister being in the Indian Cabinet. Since then, the thread of the discussion in the Yahoo! Group  urlLink Gay_Bombay  where this info was posted has revealed two other personalities; a couple of Chief Ministers, including one who's presently holding post and a former prime minister. None of the members have gone on to point out who these persons are. The closest I could get to guessing was that the former gay Chief Minister is the late Mr. Rajesh Pilot (I hope I'm not mistaken) and the former Prime Minister - Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.  Today, July 1st, is Doctor's day! I wish all my fellow colleagues on the occasion. And to just to pep things up, I'm posting a medical-related joke.   A lady walked into a pharmacy and spoke to the pharmacist. She asked, ""Do you have Viagra?"" ""Yes,"" he answered. She asked, ""Does it work?""""Yes,"" he answered. ""Can you get it over the counter?"" she asked.""I can if I take two,"" he answered."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I'm learning HTML like crazy these past few days and as you might have noticed, I've been using the knowledge I’m gaining in the last few posts on this blog. Since it is turning out to be a pleasant experience, I'm currently working on a personal website describing myself and my life; something which, I hope, will be a welcome addition to my internet presence and something which the readers can refer back to and reflect upon.  That is the reason why, apart from checking my mail and checking a few other  NEW  blogs, about which I’ll write in an upcoming post, I have been sitting on at desk going on and on and on, typing about myself. I enjoyed it for the first 5 odd pages in my text processor when words were flowing like a jungle river. But things were different after an interruption of the most irritating type.  My namesake in real life, who is also a class mate of mine,  had  been my close friend until I found my new set of friends. We used to share everything at one time. After all, he was the first person I came out to. He has had his share of problems in life, some of which led me to firmly believe that the problems I have in mine are outright silly. Therefore, I have always tried to give room for him in my life because I felt like I have to help him out. Always.  Lately I've been suspecting that he has been making use of this freedom. He often rings me up late in the night, sometimes without any conceivable reason, rudely awakening my parents from their sleep. He comes to my place just to use my computer at odd times despite having a computer at home and having access to other computers in the hospital. His excuse would be that his own computer 'is not working'. He even goes through the personal messages on my mobile phone which has put me in several uncomfortable situations. I have tried to suggest to him that it is starting to get annoying and he always seems to shrug off my suggestions mostly by laughing or joking about them.  Yesterday, something happened of that sort. I was busy typing when he called. I tried putting him off but I'm very bad at that and ended up agreeing a one hour deal with him on my computer. I thought I will watch the Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Andy Roddick. He came and I went down to watch TV. Well after the allotted one hour, I went up to ask him if he was close to winding up. He said ""Sorry, but there is still more work"" in a most fake kind of way that I felt like not looking at his face. To control myself, I had to take my guitar and play something to overcome my annoyance.  After a few minutes, I asked my friend. ""Boy, if I were you, I would be running out of here as soon as I passed my time-limit."" He said ""Kris, you are just too good to be true."" Although it didn’t, and doesn’t even now, make sense, I said ""These days, I am very conscious about myself being a pain-in-the-ass to others. I think I'm beginning to be neurotic."" He didn't reply. The sheer discomfort of the developing situation made me say that I will go out and get some dinner. I asked him that I would like him to finish his work before I returned.  Back after dinner, I was surprised to see that my friend had gone. I felt happy about how it ended; so happy that I thought I'll watch the Wimbledon match again. Not even ten minutes had passed before my friend came again. Now the excuse was that he couldn't open the file he had just made at his  home  computer!  Wait a minute! Was he lying about his computer? I felt horrible. Friends were lying to me and making use of me. But I played nice again. I actually watched some tennis with him trying consciously to avoid thinking about what had happened. I was so engrossed with concealing my feelings that I had to fumble through the stack of newspapers very clumsily, unlike the normal me,  to find out last Sunday's crossword so that I could cross-check it with the solution for it published this Sunday.  Thankfully, a call from my long lost friend who is getting married in under 2 weeks time saved me from further discomfort. I talked to him over the phone for over half an hour and by the time I had finished, my friend had finished saving his work again to his floppy diskette and gone.  I must comment about the quality of tennis at this point in my post. It was simply breathtaking. Ballistic serves and fore-hands from from Roddick and elegant, graceful, flowing, classic tennis from Federer. I was instantly wondering what I have been missing in the past few years when I couldn't find enough time to watch sport on TV. But then, there will be times like these where compromises need to be made.  Back to my day-By the time, my friend departed, it was already too late to start on my monologue about myself as the Euro 2004 final was starting soon. I watched the splendid match; many would disagree to this I'm sure. I could watch the match only till my cable company screwed the whole thing up late in the first half! How mad I was at that time! First, I thought of waiting. I even tried staring at the in an effort to coaxe it back to life! After about half and hour, I thought this was not going to work out and decided to hit the sack. Before I did that, I switched on BBC World Service on my radio.  The match was on! Whoa! Fans screaming and perceptibly-excited commentators screaming on top of their lungs describing advances made by either of the teams; It was riveting! It was simply very exhilarating just to listen to it. I was left wondering why the TV commentary should sound so insipid.   urlLink   I thought I would re-start typing on my monologue. But now, the words were not flowing. I was feeling bored typing what I was typing. It was not happening for me. But it was certainly happening for Greece. They went on to win 1 - 0! I bow to the splendid work ethic of the team and execution of the tactics deviced by the coach Otto Rehhagel! In fact so much so, that I'm getting attracted to him already.  The cable connection was restored just after the long whistle at the end of extra time of the second half. I went down to see the celebration of the Greeks and the presentation ceremony. It was wonderful. I felt a tinge of sadness when I saw the face of Figo, Rui Costa and Couto. They all were from the golden generation of Portugese football which promised so much for the passionate nation, but delivered nothing.   urlLink   I have to admit that the best moment of my day was in the pre-match show when an interview with Scolari was being shown. Oh, he's so cute! He is so expressive. I felt that I was just melting into the couch I was sitting on when he explained how he would react if Portugal go on and win the tournament by a gesture - he pointed out where the his lips are at that point with his two fingers and then dragged these fingers to points bilaterally symmetrical in front of his ears to show that he would be smiling that big! In the end he didn't end up smiling at all. That was disheartening too.  I never meant to let this post go to this length. But I am trying not to put any restrictions on what comes out of me. That is the way, I've been told, to write engaging stuff. I hope this is true and you find this interesting."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I guess most of you bloggers must be aware of the G-mail theory. 1 (whopping) GB of space with a little string attached: Context sensitive text ads. For all that I figured, I thought they might not be good. Life has a habit of proving me wrong these days, but only for the better. Check the top of my blog out. You see the banner ad saying "" urlLink Indiana Jones "" or "" urlLink Sean Connery ""? I'm very impressed. Apart from Mr. Lion, Mr. Connery is the only man I've been dreaming about.

I bring this point up as the first person to comment on my blog is a big time soccer fan. I too am a soccer fan. Coincidence? I too support England. Coincidence? I too root for  urlLink Rooney, Wayne ! Not a coincidence! Not in any bloody way. And the answer to that is because he's on top of the world at this moment.

I hope he keeps up the magic and get England their first major title since 1966.  Oh by the way, Mr. Lion is happy to see me more often. I'm relieved. I'm happy and am gay. I'm expecing an explanation from Chuck today."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"We live in the electronic age. It is true and the realization came a couple of days back.  The day before, when I was hanging out with Ray at my home, I received an instant message from May's mom on my MSN messenger. She informed me that May was not feeling well. She had come home early from the hospital and was feeling giddy. She had almost fallen down on arriving at home and needed to helped to a couch. She had a low back-ache and it was hurting badly. She could not even move.  I was very worried and I told May's Mom that I would come over and take a look. I showered, got dressed and took Ray along with me to May's home. She was lying on a couch. I was very glad that she was smiling on seeing me; glad because I knew it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. You can't imagine what ran through my mind when I thought of all the differential diagnoses of a low back-ache and giddiness in a young woman.  Thankfully, after I took her history and examined her, that too with my rusty clinical skills, it seemed like a simple back sprain. Besides, she was running a slight fever. If it wasn't a sprain, it should be a Viral Myalgic Syndrome. I consulted with the budding Orthopedician in Chuck as well. It was funny because this is the first time I'm seeking help from him in Orthopedics, the same field I was going to specialize in. I and Ray explained it to May's Mom who was very relieved after knowing that it wasn't serious. We bought her pain killers and asked her to take rest.  We chatted over tea and a delicious snack that May's mom had made for us. And then we departed.  I was glad that I could help my dear friends in need. I was even happier because my dear friends help me help other friends. The world seems so nice right now; like a fairy tale, with an electronic touch to it. How else can you explain why I should know about an emergency over an instant messenger, which was intended mainly for precocious pre-teens to have brainless chat sessions. The same instant messenger, by the way, is the medium blamed widely for promoting pedophilia over the internet in countries like the U. K. How ironic!"
Y841FJ8,female,24,I wish i could go damn the army damn them and were not even doing anything oh well who likes ninjas check out this site if you want to become one

next time you hear next time just read on it continues haha does this suck trying to read all of this and trying to make sense of it all i'm sure it does casue i'm kind of getting lost as it is but

like a scavenger hunt yeah thats it a scavenger hunt but the whole point is to try to make sense of these blogs i put and find the sites i put up  it's really not to difficult but at times it maybe but it's all in the eye of the beholder kind of but not really wow i can tell all ready this is kind of long but it's been awhile so i thought i'd leave you guys with some reading material how ever hard it maybe to read this damn thing my blog muhaha let me c well arkansas sucks i hate that place it's hell on earth if you ask me out side all the time while it's 95-110 out side with 90-100% humidity now that sucks and all you get to wear is long pants and long sleeve blouse on top of a brown shirt with a k-pot and 25 pounds of gear while running around with a m-16a2 gas somthing or another rifle ask nathan he may know the whole damn name really it's kind of long actually nathan may understand what i went though in arkansas or maybe not not sure really you'd have to ask him to find out me i'm just ot lazy to do that but makeing this blog as long as possible is kind of fun so that is why i'm going on like this oh i also got a whole bunch of MRE's in my trunk so if you want some just ask and find me and i'll give you one i got about 20 left still some are good some aren't so you get what i give you no questions asked that is all on that subject matter let me c is there a nother one that i can pop up with wait a minute there is no subject matter on this one well butwhat do you mean by everyone is human T is everyone really human that is a question you must ponder do we live in a a world with a possible extratrestrial or maybe even AI and just don't know about it it's possible if you as me remember the goverment like to hide things from ppl and even though they say there going to tell you you know that there not going to tell you if they don't want to it's as simple as that it maybe like men in blac or independence day or terminator something like that and we just don't know about it think about it you know i man be right on this one we live in a strange world filled with secrets hell one of us maybe one of these never know and we may never find out what powers do we possess and just don't know about we all maybe human but some more extrodnary then others and some better suited with someone then the next person so you really have to think before you do something but it's also good to learn from your mistakes but try to learn from them it's a dog eat dog world out there to head this in mind always look behind you never know what maybe learking in the shadows maybe be a dog or a cat or rat or a cat in a hat or it maybe your worst nightmare so watch what you are doing never know who u can trust and who you can't so be cautious but try to be normal at the same time i know i'm not hehe oh well tough try to live with that for now but really i mean really what is normal if everyone was the same then would everyone be normal probbly but then the world would be such a boring place we'd all be looking for something and no one would ever find it cause we all were so similar but thats where we have to digress from the norm and be our own person and live and do what one can do be free from things that surround them the chains that hold one down you'd be suprised if you really think about it all the things that hold you down there are alot of them just got to break some of them free and live and be yourself then and only then will you be free to pursue what you are really looking for what ever it maybe possible a mate or something that was lost or maybe yoru searching for something but just dont know what but just keep looking and maybe one day you may find it like in hook with those marbles he wasn't crazy he found his marbles though and he was happy it maybe something simple or not that is something you have to decide and only u really can but others are out there to helpyou along the way if one is alone then one cannot grow it is not you that shape yourself but everything around u that shapes you think about that would you be the same if you lived somewhere else met different ppl yes more then likely we all grow depending on our enviroment and our genetic makeup so try to explore what you can and should on that note i'll leave you so think this through as deep or not deep as it maybe never know what may grow but just heed this look and thee may find what one was looking for or to be yes indeed.

Y841FJ8,female,24,"something interesting i was reading....      Here are some mental facts for you.  There are more than 31,000 nuclear weapons still maintained by the eight known nuclear powers, a decrease of only 3,000 since 1998. Of that 31,000, 95% of these weapons are in the United States and Russia.  Russia has 1,000 metric tons of weapon-grade uranium and about 140 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium. United States has 750 metric tons of weapon-grade uranium and 85 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium.   It takes 25kg of uranium or 8kg of plutonium to make a rudimentary nuclear weapon.  So Russia has enough uranium to make another 40,000 and enough plutonium to make 17,500 more weapons. and America has enough Uranium to make 30,000 and enough plutonium to make 10,625 more weapons.  So adding them together, that's enough to make just shy of another 100,000 nuclear weapons.   Yet, when we own nuclear weapons they are called 'deterrents', when anyone else owns them they are called 'weapons of mass destruction'.  I am not trying to be political or even pass comment on the above figures, but I thought it was worth you knowing. And now you know !   oh yeah simon. come on post them ONE more time....."

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,Well I will be moving out this Wednesday night and into Nathan's bedroom (until his parents move out).  I have very little packed and am positive that I'll end up leaving things behind.  I'm super excited about my new job and have bought tons of stuff for the classroom.  I'm hoping that the trainings this week and next will be worthwhile!  And well that's about all I can think of.  My brain is currently on overload and wanting more sleep than I'll possibly be able to get! ROFL oh well... Night.
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Introverted 67%, Intuitive 67%, Feeling 22%, Judging 22% You are:  distinctively expressed introvert,  distinctively expressed intuitive personality,  slightly expressed feeling personality, slightly expressed judging personality  Portrait of the Counselor (iNFj)  The Counselor Idealists are abstract thought and speech, cooperative in reaching their goals, and directive and introverted in their interpersonal roles. Counselors focus on human potentials, think in terms of ethical values, and come easily to decisions. The small number of this type (little more than 2 percent) is regrettable, since Counselors have an unusually strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping their companions. Although Counsleors tend to be private, sensitive people, and are not generally visible leaders, they nevertheless work quite intensely with those close to them, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes with their families, friends, and colleagues. This type has great depth of personality; they are themselves complicated, and can understand and deal with complex issues and people.   Counselors can be hard to get to know. They have an unusually rich inner life, but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions except with those they trust. With their loved ones, certainly, Counselors are not reluctant to express their feelings, their face lighting up with the positive emotions, but darkening like a thunderhead with the negative. Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact. At the same time, friends who have known an Counselor for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that they are inconsistent; Counselors value their integrity a great deal, but they have intricately woven, mysterious personalities which sometimes puzzle even them.   Counselors have strong empathic abilities and can become aware of another's emotions or intentions -- good or evil -- even before that person is conscious of them. This ""mind-reading"" can take the form of feeling the hidden distress or illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for other types to comprehend. Even Counselors can seldom tell how they came to penetrate others' feelings so keenly. Furthermore, the Counselor is most likely of all the types to demonstrate an ability to understand psychic phenomena and to have visions of human events, past, present, or future. What is known as ESP may well be exceptional intuitive ability-in both its forms, projection and introjection. Such supernormal intuition is found frequently in the Counselor, and can extend to people, things, and often events, taking the form of visions, episodes of foreknowledge, premonitions, auditory and visual images of things to come, as well as uncanny communications with certain individuals at a distance.  Jane Goodall, Sidney Poitier, Emily Bronte, Carl Jung, Mary Baker Eddy, Mohandas Gandhi  and Eleanor Roosevelt are examples of the Counselor Idealist (INFJ).   Beneath the quiet exterior, INFJs hold deep convictions about the weightier matters of life. Those who are activists -- INFJs gravitate toward such a role -- are there for the cause, not for personal glory or political power.  INFJs are champions of the oppressed and downtrodden. They often are found in the wake of an emergency, rescuing those who are in acute distress. INFJs may fantasize about getting revenge on those who victimize the defenseless. The concept of 'poetic j ustice' is appealing to the INFJ.   ""There's something rotten in Denmark."" Accurately suspicious about others' motives, INFJs are not easily led. These are the people that you can rarely fool any of the time. Though affable and sympathetic to most, INFJs are selective about their friends . Such a friendship is a symbiotic bond that transcends mere words.   INFJs have a knack for fluency in language and facility in communication. In addition, nonverbal sensitivity enables the INFJ to know and be known by others intimately.   Writing, counseling, public service and even politics are areas where INFJs frequently find their niche.    Functional Analysis    Introverted iNtuition Introverted intuitives, INFJs enjoy a greater clarity of perception of inner, unconscious processes than all but their INTJ cousins. Just as SP types commune with the object and ""live in the here and now"" of the physical world, INFJs readily grasp the hidden psychological stimuli behind the more observable dynamics of behavior and affect. Their amazing ability to deduce the inner workings of the mind, will and emotions of others gives INFJs their reputation as prophets and seers. Unlike the confining, routinizing nature of introverted sensing, introverted intuition frees this type to act insightfully and spontaneously as unique solutions arise on an event by event basis.   Extraverted Feeling Extraverted feeling, the auxiliary deciding function, expresses a range of emotion and opinions of, for and about people. INFJs, like many other FJ types, find themselves caught between the desire to express their wealth of feelings and moral conclusions about the actions and attitudes of others, and the awareness of the consequences of unbridled candor. Some vent the attending emotions in private, to trusted allies. Such confidants are chosen with care, for INFJs are well aware of the treachery that can reside in the hearts of mortals. This particular combination of introverted intuition and extraverted feeling provides INFJs with the raw material from which perceptive counselors are shaped.   Introverted Thinking The INFJ's thinking is introverted, turned toward the subject. Perhaps it is when the INFJ's thinking function is operative that he is most aloof. A comrade might surmise that such detachment signals a disillusionment, that she has also been found lacking by the sardonic eye of this one who plumbs the depths of the human spirit. Experience suggests that such distancing is merely an indication that the seer is hard at work and focusing energy into this less efficient tertiary function.   Extraverted Sensing INFJs are twice blessed with clarity of vision, both internal and external. Just as they possess inner vision which is drawn to the forms of the unconscious, they also have external sensing perception which readily takes hold of worldly objects. Sensing, however, is the weakest of the INFJ's arsenal and the most vulnerable. INFJs, like their fellow intuitives, may be so absorbed in intuitive perceiving that they become oblivious to physical reality. The INFJ under stress may fall prey to various forms of immediate gratification. Awareness of extraverted sensing is probably the source of the ""SP wannabe"" side of INFJs. Many yearn to live spontaneously; it's not uncommon for INFJ actors to take on an SP (often ESTP) role. > Famous INFJs:  Nathan, prophet of Israel Aristophanes Chaucer Goethe Robert Burns, Scottish poet U.S. Presidents:   Martin Van Buren James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter  Nathaniel Hawthorne, author, poet Fanny Crosby, (blind) hymnist Mother Teresa of Calcutta Fred McMurray (My Three Sons, various movies) Shirley Temple Black, child actor, ambassador Martin Luther King, Jr., civil rights leader, martyr James Reston, newspaper reporter Shirley McClain, actor (Sweet Charity, ...)

Senator Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL) Richard Gere, actor (Pretty Woman, Sommersby) Billy Crystal, actor, comedian Carrie Fisher, actor (Star Wars)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Introverted iNtuiting Feeling Judging  by Marina Margaret Heiss  INFJs are distinguished by both their complexity of character and the unusual range and depth of their talents. Strongly humanitarian in outlook, INFJs tend to be idealists, and because of their J preference for closure and completion, they are generally ""doers"" as well as dreamers. This rare combination of vision and practicality often results in INFJs taking a disproportionate amount of responsibility in the various causes to which so many of them seem to be drawn.   INFJs are deeply concerned about their relations with individuals as well as the state of humanity at large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people -- a product of the Feeling function they most readily show to the world. On the contrary, INFJs are true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious ""soul mates."" While instinctively courting the personal and organizational demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals INFJs will suddenly withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates. This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent ""givers."" As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood -- particularly by those who have little experience with this rare type.   Due in part to the unique perspective produced by this alternation between detachment and involvement in the lives of the people around them, INFJs may well have the clearest insights of all the types into the motivations of others, for good and for evil. The most important contributing factor to this uncanny gift, however, are the empathic abilities often found in Fs, which seem to be especially heightened in the INFJ type (possibly by the dominance of the introverted N function).   This empathy can serve as a classic example of the two-edged nature of certain INFJ talents, as it can be strong enough to cause discomfort or pain in negative or stressful situations. More explicit inner conflicts are also not uncommon in INFJs; it is possible to speculate that the causes for some of these may lie in the specific combinations of preferences which define this complex type. For instance, there can sometimes be a ""tug-of-war"" between NF vision and idealism and the J practicality that urges compromise for the sake of achieving the highest priority goals. And the I and J combination, while perhaps enhancing self-awareness, may make it difficult for INFJs to articulate their deepest and most convoluted feelings.   Usually self-expression comes more easily to INFJs on paper, as they tend to have strong writing skills. Since in addition they often possess a strong personal charisma, INFJs are generally well-suited to the ""inspirational"" professions such as teaching (especially in higher education) and religious leadership. Psychology and counseling are other obvious choices, but overall, INFJs can be exceptionally difficult to pigeonhole by their career paths. Perhaps the best example of this occurs in the technical fields. Many INFJs perceive themselves at a disadvantage when dealing with the mystique and formality of ""hard logic"", and in academic terms this may cause a tendency to gravitate towards the liberal arts rather than the sciences. However, the significant minority of INFJs who do pursue studies and careers in the latter areas tend to be as successful as their T counterparts, as it is *iNtuition* -- the dominant function for the INFJ type -- which governs the ability to understand abstract theory and implement it creatively.   In their own way, INFJs are just as much ""systems builders"" as are INTJs; the difference lies in that most INFJ ""systems"" are founded on human beings and human values, rather than information and technology. Their systems may for these reasons be conceptually ""blurrier"" than analogous NT ones, harder to measure in strict numerical terms, and easier to take for granted -- yet it is these same underlying reasons which make the resulting contributions to society so vital and profound."

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Wow, thinking about it I have a ton of stuff I can write about.. so I shall begin..  I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating.. I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating...I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating...The abundance of redundance flooded her head...And she said ""If I'm leaving with a broken heart...You're leaving with a bleeding nose.""...Look out man 'cause here she comes yeah...No no no...I think she knows what happened at the part yeah...No no no...Did you really sleep with that chick man...Yes yes yes...Are you gonna tell her straight up man...No no no no...I said I wasn't cheating then I began repeating...The abundance of redundance flooded her head....And she said ""If I'm leaving with a broken heart You're leaving with a bleeding nose.""...This is the last time you'll see me...Check your mood ring 'cause I'll bet it's green...Check our cash flow and I'll bet it's low...Hey how was the party last night honey...No no no...Oh it wasn't bad I saw a fight honey...No no no...I bet that wasn't all you saw now was it...Yes yes yes...Stutter stutter I couldn't quite slip it...No no no no...Check your sex toys, check your playboys...Check all your things yeah...I bet theyre destroyed...Cause I'm a jackass - Jettingham - Cheating  I love this song! It had been in my head all day, so I figured I should post the lyrics.  Ahh.. such a good song... such a great warning... hehe.  I used that line once.. it's a great line.. he laughed, until I punched him.. hehe.. ;)  So today my mind got to thinking, why is it girls suck?!  I'm going to start wearing my ""Girls Suck"" T-shirt more often!  So as some of my closest friends know I am currently having drama with one of my girl friends.  There was a time when I considered her one of my best friends, but now I'm not sure she ever was.  This entire drama that is occuring has shown me how immature and attention seeking she is.  I have talked to someone that has shown me that with all her guy friends all she wants is the attention and that she doesn't really care about them.  He made me realize that she doesn't want me hooking up with this awesome guy that I am seeing because she would thus lose his full attention, and she wants nothing more than just his attention.  Ugh.. she is being so self destructive.. She's gonna have her life get fucked up like mine did in high school, but hell we all have to learn sometime right.  Hopefully she'll come out of this with a better understanding of herself and a whole bunch of apologies to the guys she is treating this way.  I don't know if our friendship is going to be salvaged, and right now I am not sure that I want it to be.  If she can not respect the fact that I am REALLY into this guy and if she can not back off, then I'm not sure I want her around me. I'm sorry but I don't like the guy I'm seeing being felt up by another girl because it is a GAME to her.. I would rather she be feeling him up because she wants to sleep with him and ME!  But hell I digress.  I just hope she watches herself and realizes what she is doing. k.. I have said my share on this and don't feel like ranting anymore.. planning to move on to better issues!"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"My parents have bought a home in Amherst, NY. Its more than 300 sq. ft. larger than our current house and is BRAND NEW. That's the biggest surprise to me. It isn't even done being built yet. Construction is scheduled to finish sometime in August, but my parents are still leaving in July and will stay in a hotel until its done. The concern they have about that is what to do with Vickie. I have a feeling she will be staying here, but my hope is that Sue (my Dad's co-worker and Vickie's former owner) will take her in.  The house is 2 stories plus a basement, with the top floor being a decent sized loft. The basement that is the full size of the house. There are two bedrooms with the loft acting as a third. There is also a kitchen with a dinette and a separate dining room, living room, two walk-in closets, and a two car garage. It comes with a real porch in the front of the house and their new association will pay for all gardening and water. There's also a country club nearby that my Mom has already had lunch in.  So progress continues in this tumultuous process. This means Patti and I are one step closer to living together. :) Oh yeah - my parents will have to buy a new stove, but Patti and I get to keep the microwave. Probably for a garage sale."
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"I'm so excited.. Tomorrow is my last day at Tulita and I am so excited.  To finally be completing a huge step in my life is great!  I can't wait for student teaching to start!  Yippeee Skipppeee   Happy day!  So yeah, life, other than in the love realm, is going well for the first time in my life.  It's been forever since things seem to work out.  So yeah for me.  As can be determined my love life has been going wonderfully well!"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,For those of you that still read this... Nathan and I have created a mutual blog to document our experiences while we live together.  Mainly as a way of keeping our friends up to date.  So here's the link for those of you that are interested.  Enjoy!
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,So I had an interview for Riverside Unified School District and an hour after they phoned and offered me a very nice job! Woo Hoo! I'm super duper excited and nervous all at the same time.  I'll be teaching 5th grade in a year round school so my school year starts on June 30th.  Not much of a summer for me but that's ok.  So can I just say *Bouncing* I GOT A JOB! Woo hoo.
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Let's see... Yesterday my group came over and they were gone by 11:30am. BAH! Can I just say that I hate having group work with people that don't contribute. Susan is the only one that ROCKS!!!  Anyway, so they left, I was bored and started to call people and share that information with them.  Then I looked outside.. ""Hey self it is a beautiful day, why don't you go outside and work on tanning your back."" So off came the shirt and down I lay.  I was probably only out there for about an hour. I started to read Belinda again, I am almost done, I like how the ending is progressing so far, it's not too happy.  Then came back into the house, plopped down onto the couch and kept reading.  Well at about 5pm my mind began to wander to thoughts of ""Table for two"" and the ""Spaghetti Factory""  I was getting hungry, hmmmm who could I call to eat with me in Riverside???  Hey how about Nathan. So I called my sweetie and asked if he would like to have dinner with me.  He said yes and I was off to pick him up.  Well I was surprised that he let me choose Table for Two considering the Market Broiler fiasco.  We had a wonderful meal, he actually liked it and is willing to go back.  hehe. We also had a very good conversation and I am thankful for his opening up to me.  Well after dinner it was time for us to be creative and think of something to do. LOL. We both suck at thinking of things to do, must make possible list of suggestions from friends for later uses. hehe. Well we decided to go mini-golfing... but went the wrong way on the freeway. So we turned around and headed back in the other direction (by the way Nathan was driving). As we were proceeding to mini-golf Nathan asked if I would like to go wander B&N, duh, everyone knows I love to spend countless hours there, so there we went.  I found my sections rather quickly and picked up a very interesting crime book, I must remember to see if Jon has it.  Nathan finally found me sitting there reading and he found a good book on the Zodiac killer.  Well after that it was my turn to decide what to do... Dancing was out (punk) so I thought let's go drink!  Off to the store to buy some yummy Cranberry Mike's.  So what to do now.. Back to Nathan's place (it's gonna suck when he's not there anymore, but anyway.)  Drank and enjoyed his, uh, company, hehe.  I was beginning to get sleepy and I still had to drive home for mothers day, so I didn't want to drink as much as I originally planned (seeing as it is a wonderful sedative).  I took a brief nap and then off I went.  I was home slightly before 3am and I crashed.  I had wonderful dreams of a hottie all night, ummmmmm.  So, I had a nice night and wasn't bored.  HEHE. I love spending time with Nathan, he's fun.    Now it is Sunday and Mommy Day. I gave my mom a card and will be making her a nice chicky din-din. Hehe. I have a bunch of stuff to do for school so I better get off the web and get to work, bah, I hate work. Bah. Anyway.  I'm still happily lovey...life is great and so is my man.. hehe. buh bye."
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"urlLink    Thank GOD some people are standing up to Bush and his  stupid  MORONIC No Child Left Behind Act.  That is the most ignorant form of legislation I have ever seen in my entire life!  I'm so glad to see that at least one state is telling Bush to stick it.  So this leads me to say that UNLESS YOU ARE AN EDUCATOR (not an administrator) YOU SHOULD NOT BE TELLING THE EDUCATORS WHAT TO  DO!!!  Educators should be left to decided what is best for their students and their schools!  Who knows, better than they do, what they and the school can accomplish!  Politicians and non-educators should not have any say in what happens!  They should impliment what the teachers believe is best.  And that's what I have to say about that! Humph!"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"When it rains it pours!!!  Thursday I headed out to Nathan's and had a nice relaxing evening. Friday I woke up early and headed to UCR with Nathan, he had work and class so I decided to use the time wisely!  I headed to the science library and set up shop on the third floor, I spent 4 hours working on my lesson plans and redoing the whole thing.  Nathan picked me up and we had cheep sandwiches at the shop I went to all the time back in my UCR days, then it was off to Nathan's to load up for camping.  We packed all the gear after a few delays we were finally on the road.... boy oh boy was it cold... so we chose a really cold weekend to head out to Joshua Tree.  We made it to the park and once inside, since it was so dark, we got lost.  Well finally at 10pm camp was set up and we were ready to retire for the evening.  We had wonderful cuddle time and I listened to the sounds of the rain as it pitter pattered on the roof of the tent.  I had tummy troubles most of the night and was up before the sun rose.. I actually watched the sun rise over the desert!  It was awesome, yes Nathan slept through it, punk!  Anyway, I was up for several hours before Nathan finally emerged.  We took a nice brisk hike, saw a skull in the rock, then headed back for some offroading... well that was  fiasco and Nathan has written two nice write ups on JA and his blog so I'll spare everyone the details.  Although, I'm very glad that the windshield didn't shatter in on us, that the radiator was fixable and that we made it home safely on Saturday night, yeah we had to leave early on Saturday due to the accident!  But the short trip was relaxing and fun and definitely well deserved.  I had a wonderful time hanging out with my man, if only I had more money and time to do so!  So Sunday we arose to price windshields, fix the radio fuses, pound out the dents in the hood and finish our homework.  I finally arrived home around 9:10 last night and my back was killing me.  I woke up at 2:22 this morning and lay in pain for an hour, tonight I stole the heating pad and boy does my back feel better!  I am going to see the doc tomorrow about all that has been ailing me over the past 4 days, does it ever end?!  Anyway, I had an eventful and enjoyable weekend with my man.  The next couple of weeks are going to be busy and stressful for both he and I, but I know we'll make it through it as long as we have each other!"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,Roadburn sucks.. my book is awesome..... life is so-so and good at the same time for many reasons.. anyway... time to get wasted.. rofl... muwa
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Better start living now!   Young.  Really young.  I'd say anywhere from 15-35. But you'll go out with a bang.  You'll get in a car accident or be shot.  You'll never have to see yourself get old.  Sad though.  Really sad. By the way, its common knowledge that more people with great goals and aspirations die young.

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"BAH.. FUCKING COMPUTER CRASHED AGAIN.. AND I was in the middle of chattin' with Nathan! Bah.. I need to get a better computer, that won't freakin' crash!!! Bah.. Well I am going to bed! BAH!"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Well no more Tulita! Yippee!  I am so excited that I will be moving on in my career!  With this change comes many other changes.  And thus after looking at this blog I have decided to change it.  I've noticed that I don't really write about my day to day life on it that much any more.  I've just run out of time.   So, I'm going to dedicate this blog to the following topics: 1)  Politics 2)  Favorites - Authors, Movies, Foods etc 3)  Anything I can think of 4)  Rants 5)  Praise  6)  Etc  So it will not be updated that frequently, but it will be updated.  Sorry for those that wish to read about my daily life, I just don't have time to write... so drop me a line and we'll chat instead. ;-)"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"I just read this in an email and thought it was interesting. I am also working on some comments on the topics of hate and love, which will come hopefully some time soon. But here is something to think about until then.  Madly in Love By: Tzvi Freeman ----------------  Question:  There is a woman whom I knew for a long time. I love her so much, but we're not together anymore. It's been more than a year since she broke off all contact with me. In two months she's getting married. What should I do? I am still convinced that she is the only one in the world for me.  Answer:  Your situation is obviously a very difficult one. It is also a dangerous one, because she is marrying another man and you certainly don't want to destroy her marriage. One thing I must explain to you about what we call ""love"": The One who  created us wishes us to marry and have children. This is His greatest gift to us, for this is how we become most like Himself -- creators of life. But He knows that if we were all sane, controlled people we would never do these things. So, when we get into a relationship with a member of the opposite sex, He arranges for us to go insane and lose all trace of common sense.  This insanity is a very good thing. But the problem is that it has been made to be part of our natures, so it is indiscriminate. Meaning that it can work against us, too. We see, over and over, how destructive this wonderful insanity can sometimes become. You are young. Like they say in America, there are plenty more fish in the sea. Especially wonderful Jewish girls. My advice: Save your beautiful insanity for another one. Let this woman marry and raise a family in peace. And you will merit to do the same.  - So think on it. Bawahahaha"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Well it's now time for the weekend update with none other than me, Patti.  Friday - Began the day with laundry and cleaning.  Spent next to no time sitting and relaxing, which was kinda good since I needed to be on the move.  Nathan came out earlier than originally planned, which was cool and after a nice hello we took off to Torrance to Islands.  I had a certificate from Carla and her note was to take my cutie out for a good meal... So I did just that.  After dinner we cruised around PV, through the fog, and had a nice chat.  I also took Nathan to one of my parks and we were disappointed to see that the swings were all wet with the dew :-(  So on to the movie theatre.  I had wanted to see The Italian Job anyway so I was glad that we saw it.  Nathan was kind enough to let me rest on him during the movie... he's so comfy!  Anyway, after the movie we came back to Downey and tried, to no avail to find a store to buy some drinks.  So back home to watch one of Nathan's movies and enjoy some time together.  Nathan fell asleep while I watched my Metallica DVD.  At about 5:30 I heard my mom get up so I went out and chatted with her.  Finally I came back into the room and melted around 6.  We awoke on Saturday morning to an empty house which was very nice.  Have I mentioned that I really enjoy waking up next to him. :-)  Anyway, we ventured out to the junk yard and had no luck finding any Jeeps or parts that could work on a Jeep.   So we ventured out to the performance center.  The selection on their floor sucked and they could have provided a larger showroom with all the space they have in the building.  So back to Downey we went.  We decided to go swimming and get a bit of sun.  My parents did a lot of cooking and I asked them where the army they were planning to feed was.  But the food was yummy, I only wish it wasn't so hot so I could eat more.   We then went to the dinky little movie rental place to find Braveheart, but that didn't work... So instead we rented another one of Nathans favorite movies.  I really enjoyed Traffic!  So many good movies that I now like.. hehe.  Well Nathan had to go :-(  So Becca and I decided to hang out.  We took off to get some Coldstone, yummy!  Then it was off to cruise the beach.  The weather was great and we took a nice long drive.  Had a ton of good girl time.  On the way home Johnny called and wanted to know if we were up for hanging out.  I said sure and we took off to his place.  Well Becca and Johnny hit it off like I knew they would, hehe and we hung out and talked for a while.  They couldn't decide what they wanted to do and I was too tired to decide, plus the one thing I wanted to do was in MoVal and well probably already asleep ;-)  So finally it hit Becca's curfew and we took off.  I came home and crashed out.  I had a good rest which has been really rare lately.  Then woke up this afternoon after a ton of IM's and calls ;-) from Becca.  I went out and helped my mom get the carshow stuff ready then loaded up my bike and headed to Torrance.  Becca and I loaded our bikes into her dad's truck and took off to the beach.  We took a nice ride along the strand and can I say that there were sooooooo many good looking hotties out there.. oh my gosh! and Becca goes speeding past this group of really hot guys... Damn... of course I slowed down to get a better look. She and I decided that we absolutely must spend more time at the beach. hehe.  Anyway, we stopped on our ride at Ruby's to have burgers and chat.  The restaurant next door had a live dj and was playing all sorts of dance music.  They played Nathan's Shiny Disco Balls song and I had to text message him about it.  Becca and I were cracking up.  It was a blast.  Remind me to not let Becca order anything that spills! LOL   Anyway, after lunch we headed back to the car then back to Becca's house.  We then went to Old Navy and did some shopping.  I bought some really cute stuff.. damn it, I'm supposed to be saving money and there I go spending it on clothes... ROFL  oh well.  Anyway, we headed back to her place and showered then got dressed and headed out.  We went to one of the parks and went to play.  There were lots of cute little kids running around on the playground.. they were really cute.  We played on the swings and then I got really nauseated and told Becca we should probably go eat.  We called Johnny, because Becca wanted to see him, and decided to meet up at vinces.  Well we got to Vinces at 9:05 and they were closed so we headed to the Olive Garden.  There the three of us ate and I ragged on Mike and we had a good time. I forced Johnny to sit by Becca (by not moving) and let the magic work between them.. hehehehehehe.   After dinner they wanted to go do something and I told Becca that I was too tired and wanted to go home (uh huh, sure)  So we went back to her place and I loaded up my bike and set off home... wonder what they are doing.. hehehehehe.. I'm such a great match maker.  ROFL. Anyways, so now I'm home and a bit lonely.. missing that special someone... damn I need to move to Riverside.   So as you can see I had an excellent weekend. I spent it with the people I care most about and did lots of fun stuff.  I shall be off to bed soon as I have to help my dad work on his car tomorrow and I need to apply for some jobs too.  If I ever get that edited version of my resume from someone ;-)  I'm outtie for now."
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"AUSTIN IS A LITTLE PUNK ASS BITCH!  I'm telling you this kid needs a good ass kickin'!  Anyway, he was off all day long, throwing things, destroying what was left of the room.  Helen and I took the rest of the class out to the playground, I don't think they were in the class for more than two hours the entire day! And it's a 6 hour day!  Well the theory that Carla and I have is that Beth and Allan are not giving the meds to him because of the threat of reduced services.  We think their logic is ""Make behaviors worse, get more services, worry less about taking care of our own son since someone else will do it for us!""  So yeah, I'm not too happy about it.. and even though I'm not supposed to say anything to Austin's nannies or parents I have been. I'm not going to be there next year and it's about time that I voiced my concerns.  So I've been polietly going off.  Nicole has been so nice and has apologized for what has been going on, she's nice.  Anyway, I'm tired and done ranting for now.   I cannot wait to see Will tomorrow, it's going to be so much fun. hehe"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Well I have determined that I hate several of my coworkers!  Actually I can't stand the ones that I work with in the classroom!  I had a blow up conversation this afternoon with one of the aides.   I can't believe the nerve of some people.  ugh.. But I've found some awesome people at work to chat with and that understand what I'm going through and for them I am thankful.  Great news is that I calculated my sick hours into days and I have 25 sick days at work!!!!  25 days, that's unbelievable... I guess that I haven't taken all my sick days over the past 2 years and they have added up! Yippeeeee!!!! So guess whose taking lots of time off! hehehe. That's so cool!  So yeah! Yippeeeee... Did I mention YIPPPEEE!  Oh I went rollerblading with Becca today, her skates sucked!  The wheels barely even moved and so she couldn't skate much.  It was kinda funny watching her.  It was kinda fun.. But I've gotta find a good and big place to skate at. .... ugh the dilema... oh well.  So anyway, I'm not in as much of a funk.. I've actually had some reallly heart to heart conversations with some people and well it's been helping.... I've come to understand alot more about myself and them.   I've had some closures... I'm glad I can understand the other perspective of things.  I must say that AIM is a good thing today."

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"So I'm in Target today buying supplies for my student teaching position that starts next week.  As I walk past the Valentine's cards I notice a mother and daughter.  They are apparently having a discussion about something.  And as I walk past them the daughter, who I would say is no more than 15, stomps her foot rather loudly and says, ""Why won't you let me buy it? I want to buy something for my sister because I love her!""  The mother proceeds in Spanglish to say, ""I love my son, your brother too but I'm not going to go out of my way to buy silly cards.""  I could not help but let out a little laugh.  Thank god for mothers who stand their ground, but I would never stomp my foot at my mother.  I could not believe what this girl was getting away with.  And as I continued to shop I found that everywhere I turned children were pushing their mothers around and getting what they wanted.  What has happened to the discipline factor?  Where has the morals and standards of our society gone to?  I know it is tough to be a parent, when you work in SE you tend to be a parent for 6 hours of the day, but come on people and show a little backbone.  No wonder our world is so messed up, kids push their parents around and have no boundries. Parent licensing people, it's all about parent licensing."
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Thanksgiving is upon us and so begins the holiday season.  It has been a very long time since I wrote about the things I am thankful for, so here goes... I am thankful for... - A loving, caring, wonderful boyfriend - Friends that are there for you, even when you haven't talked to them in months - Jeeps - The outdoors - Friends that move a way and make a special room for you in their home for when you come and visit - Animals - Autistic Children, especially Austin - Having food everyday - Having parents that try hard to be good parents - Animals, especially Lilly and Abby - Modern communicative technology - Sunshine - Rain - Teddy bears - Gummy bears and chocolate - Hot chocolate with candy canes - Clean clothes - Two working cars - My education - My mentor - The warmth of the holidays - An open mind - Great sex - Caramel apple cider - Lava lamps - Having good health, despite being sick  The list goes on and on, but these are just a few of the things that I am thankful for.  I hope everyone takes some time to think about what they are thankful for."

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Well Comicon is fast approaching.  I've been doing a lot of thinking and have checked my finances.  Well I've decided that I'm not going to go this year  :-(   I know, I know, I've gone every year for like what the past 5 or 6 years, geez I've lost count.  But there are a lot of deciding factors in this decision: 1.  It is pretty much the same thing every year.  Same booths, same people, same stuff. 2.  There is no one on the roster this year that I'm really excited to see. 3.  The cost is just too much, with all the trips and birthdays that have come up lately this is just an expense I can't really do... $30 to get in, anywhere between $30 - $40 for gas, Food which can range anywhere from $30-$100. 4.  In the past it was a weekend trip spent with a large group of friends and we'd crash at a friend's house, well that ain't happening this year and some of those friends that I know will be going this year I don't want to run into. 5.  If I am not working the car show I'd rather be doing something else that's more fun.  Comicon just doesn't sound like it's going to be fun. So, yeah, I was up pretty late thinking about all this last night.  I know it's so unlike me not to want to go to Comicon but my heart is not in it this year, maybe next year it will be different.  At least this way I'll save anywhere from $90 to $170, not  including what I would have spent on ""crap.""  So yeah, I'm happy about my decision.  I think I have made a very intelligent choice and not a rash one.  I've really thought this through, which is so unlike me. ROFL.... Anyway, now that this is out of the picture I need to find something to do all dang day on the 19th, that isn't going to cost much... that way I can still tell my parents that I'm going to Comicon and that the ticket is non-refundable and then I'll get out of hosting the carshow.  Hmmm... gotta figure out what to do... oh well... if anyone has ideas pop them this way.    I'm outtie for now... gotta do the job hunt thing.. lates."

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"As you'll come to see these pages will reflect not only the inner workings of my mind but also a recap of my daily hijinx. This past weekend was quite fun!  My recap is as follows: Friday, the end of a long work week!  Austin had been suffering from the flu all week and had went home early almost every day.  So, Friday I needed a chance to be around healthy people!  I visited my aunt Leigh, since she had recently came home from the hospital.  She had phnemonia and is doing better although it is killing her that she had to give up pot and cigarettes! I told her she should bake more.  LOL I swung by the McDonald's car show to pick up flyers.  They are having a cruise for two cruisers that were badly burned while working on their classic in their garage.  Ok people not to be mean, but this is why I say ""Work on your cars in a WELL ventelated area or better yet out doors!""  I do wish them both a speedy recovery and am glad that they are participating in the shows despite their pain.  After that Will and Mauro picked me up and took me to Hollywood.  We ate at this really yummy, small, quaint, italian restaurant on Sunset.  They had this excellent wine which we didn't get the name of, but ah it was good!  We then headed to Circus. Oh so many gorgeous men!  I had my fill of eye candy!  The club was fun, although very hot.  I had an excellent time with the boiz.  Will and I are very depressed that Nathan was unable to partake in the fun.  He said he had blah, blah, blah. Yeah like that is more important, sheesh. Will and I were crushed and hardly found the will to dance. Saturday, My parents were gone for the entire weekend so I was able to sleep in! Ahh it was soooo nice.  I spent the day relaxing then took off to Jacki and Jud's house.  They took me to Red Robin for my belated b-day dinner, very yummy southwest salad... I recommend it!  We went back to their place and watched the last of the Kings game - they won 2-1.  Yippeee, see I am their good luck charm (so who wants to buy me season tickets, LOL)  Around 10pm I took off because I was SUPPOSED to meet Joy at my place for a trip to Dungeon.  But Joy is a punk and is deathly sick with the flu.  So being bored and debating if I should go, I got online... A friend was on that should have been at work.. Conversation was ""Dungeon"" ""K, be there shortly"" LOL  We arrived at Dungeon at the stroke of midnight, the place was packed!  I danced my bootie off, ran into Bryan, danced my bootie off some more. By the time I left I must have weighed 10 pounds less! I had a blast and many of my fav songs were played so I definitely enjoyed my evening there.  Afterwards, I grubbed at Denny's, went home, and died.  I slept oh so well, it was great.  Sunday, Slept in a lil, my parents came home.  I spent the entire day in my pjs, hehe.  Worked on laundry, homework and chatted with friends.  Didn't do too much because my body really hurt, but in a good way. hehe So as you see my weekend was very fun!  I was bummed that I didn't get to hang out with Nathan or Joy, PUNKS! LOL And there you have the weekend wrap up."

I'm so excited, Friday Nathan and I are going to Laughlin for the weekend.  Since he's never been it should be a blast.  We have so many fun things planned.  My friend is letting me borrow his jetski for the weekend, so we'll get to have tons of fun on it and the house boat.  I'm really looking forward to it.  I'm also looking forward to the break from work.  I know I deserve it. hehe.  Woo hoo.  *bouncing with excitement*  Let's see what else can I talk about.. hmmm not much else has been going on.

Patti and I were looking for a name for the blog and wanted something that would reflect who we are but also be somthing ""home related"". After chatting about random phrases, expressions, and word play, I suggested something musical. Namely, something from the realm of Metallica! I sifted through titles and lyrics, but there was one obvious choice: Welcome Home (Sanitarium). For those of you playing along at home, you can find this musical masterpiece on track four of their third album release ""Master of Puppets"" ( Lyrics ). Patti and I are both certifiably nuts, but we're both Metallica-loving homeowners so the song works!"

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"I swear, as soon as I get some damn medical insurance *swears at ex* I'm going to go get a cat scan and all those other fun tests.  My headaches have been getting worse and much more frequent.  The sucky part is that I'm not exactly sure why.  Oh well, hopefully it will be nothing serious, and something that meds can cure.  (My head is currently pounding, if you hadn't figured that out yet.)  So things are going ok.  The cool job I thought I might get well I didn't get it.  They chose to not accept me because of my commute.  How horse shit is that!?  Really, but I've thought about it (thanks honey) and have decided that any company that would make a decision about hiring someone based on something that should be that persons decision is a crappy company and not one that I want to work for.  But the experience has led me to determine what exactly I want my life path to be, so that is good.  I'm still going to get my teaching credential, but I've decided that I want to make a difference in other peoples, especially kids, lives.  I've decided that I want to spend the rest of my life helping kids discover themselves and their inner beauties and intelligence.  There are a couple of people in my life that were wonderful role models and friends as I was growing up and I want to emulate their goodness by helping others.  So yeah, I have decided where I want to take my life.  Now I just need to find the right job.  And so the hunt continues.    I spent a great day with Nathan yesterday.  I kidnapped him when he got off of work and took him on a little job searching adventure.  He was a very good sport and he even bought me a yummy chocolate covered cherry blizzard!  He's so cool.  So when we got done with the yummyness he took me on a brief tour of his old high school.  I tripped out because their mascot was the vikings too!  Wow, crazy!  So he showed me around and I could understand what he meant when he talked about having pride in your school when no one else does.   So after the brief walking/vehicular tour we took off to find something to do.  Well since the used bookstore idea was a bust the last time I was with him, sorry babe, I suggested we go to the one that I knew about in Downtown.  So off we went.  I couldn't believe it when I went to the back corner of the store to go downstairs and the stairs were blocked!  Apparently they are not letting anyone in the basement anymore, which is a bummer because they had a lot of great books down there.  We browsed around the shop for a while and then i had the idea to go to the Mission Inn and chat.  So I took Nathan to my favorite spot there, yeah I know it's not the prettiest or most interesting, but I like it.  We chatted for a bit and then headed downstairs.  Nathan sat in one of the big armchairs and i joined him on his lap, hehe.  We had a nice little chat and I told him something I haven't told anyone before.  After the chats we decided to go get some yummy food from my favorite place.  So we head to the car.  When we get to the car I realized that somewhere during our little adventure I have lost my sunglasses, Nathan drops me off near the book store and I head to the door, but as I'm walking towards it I realize exactly where I left the glasses.  I run to the car and tell Nathan that I'll be back and I take off at a fast walk to my spot at the MI.  As I am walking up the stairs I notice that Nathan has been following me, he's so cute.  Anyway, my glasses are right where I left them.  Good thing about the MI everyone is so rich they don't need to steal sunglasses, ROFL.  So now that I have my shades we head back to the car and to my fav place.  We have a short wait, during which we sit out front and have a lively conversation about S&M, ROFL.  Dinner was great, the bus boy was hot ;-)  the waiter was ok ;-) ROFL J/K.  We were in the kid section, maybe it's a sign. (I should work with kids, not the other type of sign you silly willys)  Dinner was yummy, so much good food in one day!  Then it was off to pick up the Jeep and head to Nathan's.  His parents were watching Chicago, I definitely need to see that movie.  We headed upstairs to do our work and hang out.  I got to be in Nathan's arms again which was really nice, it's definitely one of my more prefered places to be in life. hehe.  It was getting late so I headed home and was back before 1am.  I definitely need to move to the IE soon!!!  So it was another nice time with my man.  I can't wait to go Rollerblading on Saturday with him. hehe."

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Yesterday was a pretty good day.  At 10 I went to DH and met Alison and Anthony to work on our Science Methods lesson plans.  We accomplished alot and only have a little left to add and some refining to do.  We spent 4 hours working on the plans and Anthony was nice enough to buy us lunch at the Cafeteria.  So at around 2:30pm I was finally headed home.  I had a very nice phone conversation with Nathan since he was stuck at home.  When I finally arrived home I began making calls to see who might be going to Howl at the Moon this Friday night.  So far I've gotten a few positive responses and sadly a couple people that I would love to have there will be out of town or working, so they won't be able to show.  I'm hoping that those who can go do, since it is a load of fun!  Anyway, so after making those calls and with Nathan finally off to his retreat, I made myself some dinner and vegged in front of the tv.  My mom arrived at around 6:30 and we began to make peanut butter balls for Thanksgivings trip to Nathan's.  I was done by 7:30 and was able to call Alison about the Dungeon.  Since we had talked about it earlier in the day she was interested in going and had a friend that wanted to go to.  So I got changed, picked them up at 9:30 and we headed to Dungeon.  We luckily got in for 5 bucks and as usual it was not so crowded in the beginning.  The ladies took a look around and Chris realized that she didn't really fit in, she looked like she walked right out of a BR bromag. hehe.  So we took in the first show which was an unattractive man being dom-d by a woman.  Alison headed out to the dance floor and I looked around for some people I know.  We headed back to the table to see what Chris was up to and she was watching a girl on the horse get whipped.  The dance floor became full so we decided to hang out there and I got about an hour and some worth of dancing in.  It was great to be dancing again... I have definitely missed dancing every weekend.  (Babe lets go dancing more, hint hint)  At around 1:30 the ladies finally had their fill and so we headed back to Alisons.  The ladies said they had a good time, but they would probably never come back. I told them it was awesome that they went, everyone should go at least once since it is such an interesting experience!  So I am glad they had fun and were able to keep an openmind.  I finally arrived home and dived into bed at about 2:10am.  Once my head hit the pillow I slept like a baby and had an awesome sleep, although I wish a certain someone were there next to me.  Anyway, I'm now up and ready to go visit Nathan once he gets home.  It's been a good weekend thus far and I can't wait to make it a better weekend by rushing into his arms.  Hope your weekend was awesome."
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"The lack of stress in my life is very nice. I only have one final to complete so far, yippee. But no homework is making me mad. I was so bored!

Oh well I guess time will tell what will happen.  Anyway, Now it is time to find a job and a home in Riverside, yippee. I am off to bed soon. Buh bye"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"First off I want to say that everything went pretty good today with my therapist.  I might have to get psychological testing.  She wants me to see a psychiatrist to talk first.  I don't want anything on record though because the insurance companies might raise my rates if there's shit on record (evil bastards) so I'll have to pay out of pocket.  I think I'll do it.  I guess thyroid problems can cause depression so there's one thing to pay attention to.  Also, I have to start tracking it to see if it is connected to my period and if it's in cycles.  Overall though I'm feeling much better about things.  Oh, one other thing I noticed is that I tend to have an emotionless expression when I talk to people.  I guess that's what makes me hard to read.  And after my sessions my face actually hurts from holding it that way.  So I'm going to try to be more expressive.  ok, I think that's all I have to say about that.  My newest enemy is starbucks.  As everyone is well aware I am heavily addicted to caffine.  I drink like 3 cups of coffee a day.  I decided to try to cut back.  On sat I didn't have any coffee for most of the day.  By about 3 or so (can't remember exactly) I got the worst headache so I got a latte and it was all better.  Today I tried to go sans cafe and again about 3 I had the worst headache, but this time I said ""I know coffee will get rid of it but I'm going to be good"".  Also I was out with that girl Lynn (who's really cool by the way).  It was when I was on the bart back from the east bay back to the city when the withdrawl got almost unbearable.  I could think, my head hurt more than you can imagine and I was getting sick.  I was seriously fearing that I was gonna puke on the bart.  I got to my stop and was in so much pain it was disorienting.  When I found a starbucks it was like a beacon from heaven.  I got my latte and before long started to feel better.  I felt so ashamed though.  If this were any other addictive substance people would say to push through and not give in, but I did.  I have immense respect to anyone that has overcome anything.  It hurts really bad (and mine is only caffine).  I think that starbucks is evil to pushing it's drug onto innocent people like me.  I will overcome this addiction...slowly.  and then I will never consume caffine again.  (please remind me of this next semester).  It took like 2 hours before I was fully functional again.  My plan is to cut it down to 1 cup a day, then switch to caffinated tea, then go to decaf tea.  I hope it works.  Ok, my official first day of my heart conscience diet.  I didn't do too good.

RV8CJXP,female,24,"So, here goes......   These last few days have been very significant.  I've touched on some stuff, but I guess it's time to actually get my thoughts together so I can figure it out.  So, I guess I'll just go through it.  Friday I was extreamly tired (didn't sleep more than a couple hours the night before).  I knew I was gonna be going out with Sugar and her new (ok, it's not her girlfriend, just a girl she's seeing.  I don't know the term for that.  Let's call her G).  Well, Sugar graduated a little bit ago and I wasn't able to go so I sent her flowers.  The thing is, I really wanted to send her a cake but had a hard time finding a place that would deliver it.  So, since I was gonna be seeing her the next day I stopped by this nice store and picked up a little (maybe 4-5 inch in diameter) cake.  This was also right after I got my cholesterol results back so I figured we both had stuff to celebrate.  As soon as I finished paying, I called her cause I wanted to confirm Sat.  I would have felt like a dumb ass with a cake and then her canceling.  She was all excited when I called, so I decided to go straight to her house from there.  It was in the middle of traffic so it took like 2 hours and I even stopped for sparkling cider and ice cream.  I thought I was being stupid, but I was just so excited to see her.  I really missed her alot.  So, we hung out.  I already wrote about that night and Sat morning where I was getting all upset.    Well, sat went pretty well.  It turns out all three of us felt like the third wheel so that was pretty weird.  I can understand G and I feeling like one cause each of us has a very personal relationship with Sugar, but I was surprised that Sugar felt like one too.  I think what it was is that both G and I were trying really hard to get along with the other, probably to prove that we didn't have a problem with the situation and because we knew that we were each very important to Sugar.  So, it resulted in us talking ALOT.  I noticed that Sugar stopped talking but couldn't figure what to make of it.  She's told me before that she doesn't like talking alot and that she was excited that I could talk to G about politics.  When the music got turned up I realized that it was bad, and tried to talk to her, but she didn't hear me.  My bad.  It was an interesting day though.  I kept reminding myself of my place.  G was the one dating her, so I shouldn't touch Sugar in front of her cause I don't want to offend their relationship.  I found it somewhat amusing that whenever something was just a little off with Sugar we both immediatly tried to fix it.  When I noticed G doing it too though I reminded myself of my place and backed off.  It was just a weird day.  When we got back to Sugar's I was too tired to drive home (remember I only slept a couple hours for the last 3 days).  I crashed in her spare room.  I know I should have left, but I was just way too tired.  The next morning I was in a half sleep when I heard someone downstairs.  I went down hoping to get a couple min with Sugar to talk.  Nope, so I went back to sleep.  When she got up she talked to me for a couple min then we went downstairs.  This was the hardest part cause I really wanted to spend time with Sugar but I knew I should leave them alone.  That is one thing Sue made sure to teach me, always know your place.  I stayed for a little while but knew I shouldn't be there.  When G changed into a jersey, I knew I had to go.  On the drive home I cried.  I cried alot.  Then I put on Linkin Park (for those of you who don't know, that's my angry CD.  I only listen to it when I'm really upset).  Luckly Gouch called me that morning.  When I called him back, he was just so happy to hear from me.  I asked him to see me cause I really needed someone.  In a couple hours, Red and Gouch we at my place.  I am just so glad that they are there for me.  It's something so familiar and comfortable that I really need.    Just like old times, the three of us hung out and just acted stupid.  I missed it so much.  We walked around, talked about stupid shit, tried to defile a blair witch looking rock formation, learned that the antonym of Convince is Province, and were almost attacked by an evil squirle.  I miss them so much.  I think they are some of the very few people who I can just be ridiculously stupid around.  I also talked to them about Sugar.  They just listened and helped me figure out what to do.  And there wasn't even one skank ho comment.  I appriciate it so much.  I couldn't figure out why I was acting so weird.  I got Red convinced that it's cause I feel like I'm loosing a good friend.  Gouch, however, doesn't buy it.  He thinks I really care for her as more.  To be quite honest, I just don't know.  I love her very very deeply as a friend.  Whether or not I am in love with her is yet to be determined.  After much contemplating I have come to the conclusion though that it really doesn't matter.  I'm not gonna fuck up things for her by making things complicated.  I few weeks before she started dating G I tried to talk to her about it a little.  I just didn't know how to bring it up so she thought I just didn't want to talk about it.  I was talking about the difference between ""having sex"" and ""making love"".  She says it's really a specturm.  She's right, so I dropped it.  Anyway, I called her that night (Sun) and we talked for just a couple mins.  G keeps asking why we're not dating.  I don't really have an answer.  The one I finally settled on is that I'm so screwed up that I fuck up my relationships.  I don't want Sugar to be a victum of that.  I've gotten yelled at by several people for saying that.  They say that I am being down on myself.  But it's true that you break up with most everyone you ever date (all but maybe one).  Those aren't good odds.  I guess it's that I don't want to be the one to break her heart and upset her.  I'd rather be the one who holds her if someone else does it.  Our relationship really is great.  There's not a whole lot to be gained by dating, but there is a whole lot to be lost.  I couldn't talk to Sugar for long cause she had to go.  After hanging up, I called Sage (this is the friend who tried to hook me up with the whinie chick).  This was a disaster.  She has screwed up girlfriend issues all the time and I listen to her almost every day while she talks.  So, I thought she would be a good person to listen.  She just got very loud though and kept comparing our two situations in weird ways.  It's more like she would talk about her own shit and then add in a line to make it apply to me as well.  But they were mostly a ""she won't know what she has till she looses it"".  I told her tat it's not that though.  It's that I don't know what I want.  Or she would talk alot about being a doormat and that you are only worth as much as you think you are.  Ok, good thoughts, but I don't think they apply.  She really was yelling.  By the time we got off the phone I had the biggest headache.  The one line she did tell me that I think is significant it this.  She said that it's all about risk.  You could stay friends and risk loosing parts of her when she dates people, or you can go for her and risk loosing her all together.  I choose the first.  Also, I just don't know where I stand, so it would be extreamly mean of me to try to approach her asking her to give up a good thing for a maybe, I don't know how I feel.  I want her to be happy.  That's the number one thing.  I'm just worried that I screwed up.  I think that I'm turning into a whinie little bitch.  I'm really hoping that I don't loose her over my being so screwie.  But I guess I won't know till next time I talk to her.  I just need to not be to clingy.  I talked to her Sun, it's not Tue and it seems like forever since last we talked.  That's probably cause I'm nervous about how things stand.  I'll be better after it's all worked out.  Overall though I feel secure in my decision to stop being a stupid ass.   Ok, here we go again.  I already wrote about yesterday and being sick and I was gonna go to Bunny's for a Bill & Ted's double feature.  Well, it was really fun.  I felt bad cause their house always makes awesome Vegan food and I couldn't eat any cause I was sick.  But it was fun though.  The weird thing is, Bunny and I started cuddling during the movie.  Yes, I'm fucking up...again.  We've been close friends for a while.  Once we both admitted that when we first met we were each like , huh.  But we came to a decision together that there would be none of that cause we're good friends.  Also, we both tend to get all girlie when it comes to intimatcy.  That's probably why I'm having issues with the Sugar situation.  Maybe my head is just getting confused.  I'm just nervous now.  We're going out for dinner and to a bathhouse for women tomorrow.  I really need to be careful.  If I fuck up relationships with TWO of my good friends in the same week, I'm gonna be PISSED!!  What's wrong with me??  Maybe with Bunny it's cause we were both just having a bad week.  I talked to her about Sugar and she told me about her problems.  Maybe it was nothing and I'm over reacting.  I just need to be careful with what I'm doing.  I know Bunny and she'll get very emotional very quickly.     urlLink     Trying to figure shit out  urlLink      So, there's my weekend.  It's been alot of thinking lately.  I've been expecting a letter from CC, but nothing has come.  I feel slightly bad about my last e-mail being so direct and harsh, but I then realized that it wasn't as bad as the one's she sent me.  Also, I think it was the last post when I was talking about my little episode.  I was thinking about it today.  CC and I were still together at the time.  I remember how I tried calling her when I was driving and slightly hysterical.  She told me about her shit then said she couldn't talk cause her roomate and her were going shopping.  She never called me back to see if I was ok.  So, you know what....FUCK HER!!  I don't need that shit.  Yes, I love her but a realationship is reciprocal.  Do I really want to be friends with someone who won't talk to me for 10 min when I need them the most, who won't even bat an eye when I'm crying?  I'm in the process of surrounding myself with people who truely care for me.  I can't constantly take care of everyone else when they won't do the same for me.   But just to end on a happy note.  Elaine told my mom about our talk yesterday too.  She was also super excited that we got along without fighting.  Hopefully it'll stick.   One last thing, I'll talk more about it later.  I realized that I can't do it all right now, so I WON'T be applying to grad schools this year.  I'm gonna take a year off.   I have been typing for an hour so I think this post is long enough.   Love you!!  (and thank you for everything)"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Ok, the verdict is in. I'm going to send a care package. I figure a game boy, some moisture gloves and lotion (she used to make fun of me for my skin softening system), cookies, ect... I was talking to my roomates about her and all about our relationship. It reminded me how messed up everything got. I'm really glad that it's settled now. But, then I went to get a picture to show them. I couldn't find the specific one I was looking for right away. You know how you get all panicked and think ""where are you baby"" (don't think I'm crazy, you know you do it too). Then you realize that you're getting all stupid. I'm missing her. I don't get it. But, I'm so worried about her and I do want to talk to her. It's not like I'm not over her. I really am.  Aren't I?  It's weird, you just get rebounded once in a while. Now I have her pic on my dresser. I need to put it away and stop acting stupid. I think I'll feel better once I send her a little note. Tomorrow it'll be all better.  On an entertaining note. I was also talking to my roomate (and her friend) about a date I had a couple weeks ago that didn't go too well (it's a good story, but you're not gonna get it tonight). Just then my other roomate walked in the room and told me about this butch who wrote her off of friendster. Same one. I think it's funny. I told her to write back saying ""Liz told me all about you"". Or, invite her over for dinner. It'll be entertaining. I love entertainment. Honestly though, I feel bad about that date. I really didn't present myself very well at all. Oh, Oh, it looks like you might be getting the story afterall (this will be the greatly abriviated version). Maybe not. I just wrote like a whole page and even that made me sound like a bitch and that's in my own words. To put it in short. At the end we went to a club and I ended up feeling REALLY uncomfortable. I mean REALLY uncomfortable. I don't normally drink a whole lot. I got pretty wasted and acted stupid. No I didn't do anything horribly bad. I was just a stumbling lush. The next morning I felt really bad. I was all depressed. I called Lei to appoligize, but she won't talk to me (but apparently she'll talk to my roomate). I know that on the car ride home I was talking alot. You know when you're talking out of your ass. You know that what you're saying isn't good, you can tell by her face, but you just keep talking. Ya, it was like that. I'm not sure what I said, but she won't talk to me, so I guess it wasn't good. The next day I also realized why I was so uncomfortable. I realized that I was in trophy position. This I really will explain later (not tonight). Overall, why I feel so bad is because we did get along. I feel like her judging me by how I acted that night is a total misrepresentation of who I am. But, that's what dates are for...to judge."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Ok, before I get replies yelling at me about my reply I'll say that this has NOT been sent yet.  I will be sending it today though, so give me some input.  Sugar says that I need to grow balls (yuckie visual..ewww) and be straightforward with CC.  How's this??  Let me know ASAP if you have any comments I should hear before sending.   CC,    I really do want to be friends with you, but from what you wrote it's apparent that you still have feelings for me.  I fear that if we try to be just friends you may be thinking that we have a chance of a relationship again.  I want to make it very clear that we will not be getting back together again.  I don't want to put you through any excess stress or pain.  I will leave it up to you to decide whether you can deal with a purely platonic relationship.    -Liz-       Thanks yall!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"This weekend I went to Denver for Sue's art exhibit. It was a really good weekend. Ellaine only got angry for about half of each day, which is really good. It was really nice to be able to chill with Sue for a while. I haven't seen her since March. The piece that was displayed was called ""Severe Sadness"" (self portrait). She took it when she was like 17. It's always been a key piece in her portfolio, so it was cool to finally see it displayed in a real live art exhibit. I'm not gonna go into details of the trip cause it would take forever.   I think the key thing lately has heen remembering old shit. All the problems with my aunt and cousins are making me remember my childhood. I've been talking about it with my mom a little. It almost like watching how things were when I was young. But, there's nothing you can do about it. I've been thinking about Sue's photgraphy and my relationship with her alot. And most of all, I've been thinking about my grandfather. I miss him. I love him so much. I'm not angry that they took him off the resperator. That's not it. I'm angry about everything surrounding it. His death was used as a power card within the family. There was so much shit surrounding it I can't even explain. At the funeral, when I looked at my father I saw evil. You know when it's almost like you see an aura. His was just bad. I know he's sick. I do know that. That is why I don't hate him. I know that it's not him when he does bad things. I know he can't help himself. It just hurts. I wish that I could talk to him. I wish that there was just one thing that I could express to him that he would understand. I try to be logical, but it doesn't work. He doesn't think logically. There's nothing I can do about that (believe me, I've tried). Just like my cousins, I just have to step back and watch him deteriorate. I wish there was something I could do. I would do anything for him. I know that I'm not doing engineering like he said. So I guess that's not everything, but I know that he'd be unhappy with whatever I chose. I know that it's ok, but I'm really not happy with the events surrounding my grandfather's death. I know that I have to let go. I don't know what to feel though. I'm angry and I don't want to be. I want to forgive and forget. I know that he doesn't want me to be mad. I'm going to try really hard. I've just been thinking about him alot lately. I've been crying alot too. I want to hold his hand so bad that I can feeling in in mine sometimes.   I have my cardiologist apt on Monday. I need to bring all my medical records with me so I've sent out all my requests. I've got them all but my school ones for just this past year (bastards want $15 to copy them. no one else asked for money). It's trippy cause I got all the ones from college. I flipped thru them. All the records from my past shit is there. The morning after pill and the full STD screenings. It just reminded me of bad shit. I want to pull that out cause it is a heart doctor after all, but I don't know wheter that pill effects anything. I know that I got pretty damn sick for a few days cause of it. I remember when it was perscribed, as though I didn't feel like shit enough, the phamicist through the perscription at me (it's a small, christian centered town). I guess you can't just forget. Maybe I should just pull the pages out and shred them. I can control the records for all future doctors, and the originals will get destroyed when the statute runs out. Is it that easy to erase history? Maybe if you get rid of all evidance, it will be like nothing ever happened.   On a random note. Back when I was living in Pacifica, I used to take the bus every day. There was this one girl who would be on it too sometimes. She is the exact ideal of what I'm attracted to. I wanted to talk to her so bad, but never got any further than a smile. I have a tendancy of liking people who I won't talk to for fear of them kicking my ass. You know, hard ass girls. That's something I have to work on. Well, I moved and stopped taking that bus. I saw her on muni a couple times but chickened out of talking to her. Well, last night I stayed at my mom's cause the flight got in last night. This morning when walking to my car for work, she was walking my mom's neighbor's dogs. I guess she's house sitting for her. I wanted to talk to her, but I had no excuse to go over there. Isn't that a bit much of a coincidence? Ok, next time I see her, I will talk to her. Red, you should know who this is, I used to tell you about the mean looking girl on the bus who I thought was hot.   Lastly, I got to sit in on yet another argument between my parents. It was disguised as a ""meeting"" so I couldn't leave. I don't want to get into it. Nice start to the day though.   Oh, and my friend who is trying to hook me up with her friend called me on my way home. The two of them came over and hung out for a while. It was RIGHT after I got home from work though. I didn't even have my shoes off. So, I'm not sure how well I did. I think my feet smell. I worked a 10 hour day today. She's cool though. We'll see how it goes.   She took a little too long to use the bathroom in my room.  I'm pretty sure she was going though my cupboards.  I can't hold that against her though, cause I would do the same.  Also, my roomate is pregnant. She's had one abortion before. This would be the 2nd. She's going to the Dr. tomorrow to confirm. And the one who got her pregnant is this guy (with herpes) who she sleeps with but definially does not want to date. She doesn't really like him much.   Ok, I have to work tomorrow. And I need to call this one chick to have dinner. I don't overly want to, but I have her book and need to return it. I'll call her tomorrow and see if she wants to meet for dinner after I get off work.   Last dilema. I'm really hungry but need to go to sleep. Get a quick snack, or go to bed hungry?"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"So much to think about, so much to do.  I would write more but don't know how to word it.  How many times have I written entries and then deleated them before posting?  Oh, I found a white hair today."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I have alot of emotional shit going on right now that I need to write about.  I'll do that a little bit later.  I need to leave in a couple mins and don't want to get all upset or flustered.  So, here's today for ya.   I've been feeling more and more sick these last few days.  It's been upset stomachs and cramps (NO, it's not that time of the month, but the cramps are worse than any menstal one's I've had).  I figured it was stressed and eating crappy food.  This morning though it all came to a head.  Last night my head hurt so bad I had to take 2 extra strength bayer just to lay down to go to sleep.  (Yesterday is what I have to fill you in on)  This morning I woke up crazy sick and in alot of pain.  I had work early so I was up at 5.  I didn't feel good so I just had a banana and went to work.  I could not keep my eyes open for driving.  I was totally convinced I was going to get pulled over for drunk driving cause I could not stay in my own lane for the life of me.  Well, I got to work.  Still having crazy pains.  I made it about 7-10 min then went to my car and took a nap.  I didn't wake up till I got cold and tried to grab a blanket and realized I was in my car.  Well, I went back into work (it's now 7:30, I started at 7).  I made it another 10 min then finally gave up and asked to leave.  I feel bad cause last night there was an ""incident"" and one of our rooms got THRASHED.  But, I figure the manager can deal with it.  So, I went to my mom's hours and slept for like 4 hours.  Woke up still sick but not as bad.  My mom asked what was wrong.  I told her I thought I got food poisoning.  But, I don't think that's it cause I've been getting slowly worse for the last couple days.  Anyway, went to my doctor (will talk about it in a min).  Then met Elaine for late lunch/early dinner.  (this was the first meal I ate since yeaterday at maybe 5).  After eating I felt sick again....FUCK.  So, I'm still not too hot, but I think that if I just don't eat anything I'll be ok.  I'm going over to Bunny's in a few min to watch a Bill & Ted's double feature.  I really want to stay home but I haven't seen her in a while and really want to.  I'm just so confused why I'm so sick.  Last time it was this bad was last summer when I was living with my dad.  I actually remember the day.  It's was the day of my freak out.  I was feeling really sick but Anne was in town and I REALLY wanted to see her.  So, we made plans for lunch dispite being sick.  I tried really hard to act fine and only had a couple spoonfulls of soup.  Then a couple min later she's pulling over to the side of the road and I'm kneeing on the pavement thowing up.  It was near a park.  There was a homeless man there giving me sympathetic looks.  I remember I was throwing up and crying at the same time.  Anne took me home.  I then got all pissed off, threw some stuff in a bag and started driving.  About 4 hours later I ended up in a Gilroy parking lot muttering.  My mom came and got me and took me back to my dad's house.   I don't understand why what is happening now should effect me like this.  Maybe it really is all the crappy food I've been eating lately.  Ok, here's some REALLY good news, actually a couple things.  First off, I actually got along with Elaine today.  We rarely get along.  I think it cause I'm trying really hard to not help her but to just be there.  It's hard cause there's so much shit I want to help her through.  But, I realize that I can't.  So, I've been trying to be more passive.  And today it really paid off.  No fights and she didn't snap at me once.  Please let this be a permanent change!! Second, my doctor apt.  It was a 3 hour exam....literally.  I had an EKG (all ok), then the Dr read my entire health history page by page.  This was a little nerve wracking.  Especially when he stopped on the ""Morning after pill"" page and read it like 5 times.  I also had to talk to him about some of my other shit.  I got a little misty but nothing noticable.  He said that the amount I dropped my cholesterol is comprable to what would happen with drugs.  So, he says that he sees no reason to put me on drugs.  I only have 3 risk factors; I'm overweight, family history, and high cholesterol.  I think that that's alot, be he says it's not too bad.  Oh, I had to weigh in and I guess I lost another 10 pounds.  My top weight is 205-210 last I weighed myself I was maybe 185.  Today I'm 174, very weird.  I'm not sure how that happened.  But, he says that I am still over weight so I have to loose more.  He wants to see how low I can get my cholesterol with just weight loss.  I'm seeing him again in November.  But, NO DRUGS!!!!!  YEAHEEEE!!!!  The most I'll have to go on is this stuff that's related to oat bran that you drink.  It's supposed to taste like sand.  Yuck!  But it looks like I'm ok.  So, I'm off to Bunny's.  If I'm back early enough (which is a bad sign cause it means I probably felt sick) then I'll fill you in on this weekend.  If not, tomorrow."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I feel much better.  I little boracha, but good.  Ali called.  I'm so excited.  People say that I sound like my roomate on the phone, so I just pretended to be her and took a message for myself.  Oh, I crack myself up.  Advice please on how to fix it.   Now....damn it!! Love you guys!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Today I filed...for 8 hours.  I got 1 whole drawer of 1 filing cabinet almost organized.  My back is killing me.  Today I was pretty depressed.  I had to foce myself to eat breakfast.  I just had some cottage cheese.  Then come lunch all I want is sweets.  I had a Mc Donalds hot fudge sundae and a cookie.  Now I want more sweets.  I had a good dinner though.  I got creative.  I wanted cous cous with tofu but didn't have anything to cook the tofu in.  I pan fried it in seaseme oil then added tahini, soy sauce (yes, I'm using it...I'm surprised too), garlic, and wheat germ.  Surprisingly it turned out really good.  Go me!!  Oh, today I was very proud of my mom.  I think I said before that Curves is owed by some Pro-Life religious organization.  My mom joined one of the Curves knock offs.  I'm very happy about that, but not only that, she had a doctor apt this morning.  Her doctor goes to curves.  My mom told her about the Pro-Life connections and convinced her to switch gyms.  Go mom!!  She is doing her part to oppose the religious right!! *fist in air*  I also talked to her a little today about wanted to come out to Elaine.  My mom is getting much more accepting.  She's always been accepting, but the negative undertones are less.  She is actually ok with me telling Elaine.  When I first came out she treatened me that I wasn't to tell her.  I also saw my dad for a couple min.  He wasn't too bad.  Said some things that I think are disrespectful to my mom, but nothing too extreame.  But like I said, for some reason I'm sad today.  I think that it's about my cat.  Whenever something happens to one of our animals I always get bitter towards my father and just overall pissed off.  See, my dad hated the pets.  He was the one who got them for us but then after a couple years started hating them.  He actually bullied my mom into putting our dog to sleep.  She was getting older but we wouldn't have done it if it weren't for his threats.  When it happened, I was the only one of the three of us who knew what happened.  My two sisters thought she died in her sleep.  I was sworn to secrecy.  I've always had a back and forth relationship with religion.  At that time though I thought that I was an evil murderer and going to hell.  But I couldn't talk to anyone about it so I just did my self hating shit.  I try to tell myself that she was in pain, but she really shouldn't have died then.  Also, with my cats.  My dad has tried to poison them.  They refused to eat the food though.  He also tried to catch them a few times.  Not sure where he was planning on taking them.  I don't want to know.  But, they got away.  So, I know it's irrational but the fact that my cat is dead makes me mad at him because this is what he wanted.  And I don't want him to find out cause I don't want him to rub it in my face or even worse pretend to care then smile.  Even a year after my mom left him, every time he talked to me he would mention how horrible his life was because my mom forced him to live with the cats.  He suffered every minute of every day.  I know I get crazy about things some times.  Also at work we were dealing with a woman named ""Cathy"" to set up a contract.  I hate that name with a passion.  Every time I hear it I get angry and bitter.  It was the name of my father's ""secretary"".  She really helped to fuck up our family.  I truely hate her.  She's one of those people who (when she was around) my sister and I would spend hours just thinking of evil things to do to her.  Red laughs cause I actually call her ""Cathy I hate her""  It's like it's her full name cause it always comes together.  Ok, other news ????   I got a pin that says ""Evil Wench""  and it's pink!!  My therapist is back tomorrow.  I'm gonna go 2x this week cause I'll probably need it.  I'm trying to stay home a bit this week.  Wed is my roomate's thingie.  I'm trying to be there for her.  It's hard though cause I have so much of my own shit.  I'm really trying though.  I'm off work tomorrw and have nothing to do.  I was thinking about going to work anyway to keep my mind busy, but I think I'll take the day for myself.  Sugar invited me to hang out with her then but I think it's a better idea to have some me chill time.  I'll probably end up cleaning my room."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I guess you can probably tell that I'm not doing too hot right now.  I'm so tired even though I've been sleeping unbelievable amounts.  My head hurts and I've been having to force myself to eat for the last 2 days.  In short, I'm depressed.  I've been doing nothing all day, but I start work tomorrow so I guess that'll force me to do something."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Whenever I spend lots of time away from my family I miss them so much.  But then, when I do see them I remember why I limit my time.  I love them so much, but it's hard.  I'll be down here till Sat night.  I guess we'll see how it goes.  As for other news.  My car had issues...again.  This time it took $300 to fix.  Not cool.  I'm pretty short on money right now.  Especially with the Old Navy issue and now my car.  Oh, Old Navy called again the other day to get a survey.  I wish I was here to take the call so I could tell them to fuck off.  Last thing that's bugging me.  Ok, it's not the last thing that's pissing me off, just the last thing I'll mention right now.  I can't find the jewelry I want to wear on Sat.  I want to wear my Tiffany's necklace and the bracelet that Anne gave me for graduation.  I think I took them up to SF but I don't know where I put them.  When I was packing up my stuff for this weekend I couldn't find them and thought they'd be down here.  Nope.  I have backup jewelry but it's just not my first choice.  Plus I really need to find that stuff.  I know I put it in a safe place.  Why can I never remember where my ""safe places"" are?  Anyway, I'm gonna go chill for a bit.  The get together is in a few hours.  I'm not gonna dress up.  I think it'll be ok if I'm casual."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Well, just got home.  I was planning on having a ""me"" day, but decided that I didn't want to think.  I almost started crying on the way to therapy.  Not sure why.  I'm driving, look left and see a homeless man pushing a shopping cart up the hill, get all misty.  At therapy it was mostly a recap of my month.  We spent some time on my mom this time though.  I don't talk very often about problems between my mother and I.  Well, afterwards I was fragile and knew if I was by myself I would think too much.  I went to Sugar's place.  We hung out for the day.  It was really nice.  We talked alot and got alot of stuff in the open (I will discuss tomorrow when I'm not so tired).  I'm really glad we hung out today.  The drive home sucked.  Keep in mind she lives about an hour and 8 freeways away.  Well first a bag flies into my window and won't go away for a while, then I hear a pop on the driver's side of my car (I hope it was just a hubcap, but forgot to check when I got home), then almost got in an accident (going 90) with a cab (had to slam on my brakes and swerve, luckly no one was in the next lane just then), then I'm shook up and don't pay attention and come too close for comfort between a semi and an SUV, then get stuck behind a swerving car doing 50, and then get stuck behind a car doing 40.  I'm just glad I'm home.  I want to sleep.  I have lots to fill you in on, but not tonight.  Love You!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Well, I talked to Sugar last night.  I gave her the link to this journal cause we're close and there's nothing I can think of that I wouldn't be ok with her knowing about me.  She read it and called.  I wanted to tell her what I was thinking so bad but didn't know how.  I knew she'd read it.  Even though I wanted to, I just couldn't explain how I was feeling or what it all ment.  We just left it alone.  I think that's how I want it for now.  She said that we are friends and nothing is going to change that.  She's not concerned about what I was worried about.  She was concerned about my being sick.  I just get sick when I'm stressed.  It's been that was since at least high school, maybe earlier.  But, yesterday I was not only sick, but I also got dizzy.  Sugar made me promise to see a doctor.  I'd been planning on it for a while but haven't gone as of yet.  I will though.  I promised.  As for Bunny, it's all ok.  We were just friends.  I talked to her about Sugar a bit and brought up that talk we had a while ago about not wanting to start anything (in a casual way though).  So, we're good.  No problems.  We're putting my cat to sleep tomorrow.  This is the cat I've had since i was maybe 5 or 6.  I love her very much.  She's really sick, so we need to put her down.  I'm gonna spend the weekend at my mom's house.  I still need to pack my stuff (and bring my dirty laundry).  Vegas is planned for October 1-3.  That's my b-day weekend, so I think it'll be cool.  Everyone is welcome to join.  The hotel is on me (well, actually those time share people).  My roomate (not the pregnant one, thank god) got attacked today near our apartment while jogging.  Had to call the cops and everything.  Now I'm even more paranoid about my place.  I'm here alone right now.  I'm really tired and not feeling too good.  I think I'm gonna go to bed now.  Just a quick look for credit card imprinters.  Anyone know where I can get a cheap one?"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I'm feeling really good tonight.  I'm still nervous about how CC is going to respond to my e-mail.  I'm worried that it's giong to upset her.  But, I feel like a weight has been lifted.  I finally got to say something that had been stressing me for a while now.  Yes, I wrote the words, you know which ones.  I'm a little scared that she's going to think that it's possible to get back together.  I don't want her to get her hopes up, but I do want her to know how I feel.  Last night I went to the east bay to hang out with my friend and her friend (3 of us).  It was exactly what I needed.  We hung out watched movies, played video games (which surprisingly I won at), and talked till 5:00 am.  I got up at 9:00 am and again just hung out, watched movies, played games, and went swimming.  I got only 4 hours of sleep.  But feel surprisingly rested.  I think that it's because that's the first I've let myself just completly veg out for about 21 hours.  Her house reminded me of Nicki's.  I'll explain.  Third year of college I was not doing too hot.  I was very lonely and didn't feel like I belonged anywhere.  Nicki's house was the only place that felt like sort of home.  I would go over there on Thursdays to watch Must See TV, eat junk food, and play games.  It was just so welcoming and comfortable.  That's how I feel about my friend's place in the East Bay.  This was the first I've been there and it just felt so welcoming and comfortable.  I haven't had a sleepover in a long long time.  I'm so glad I missed the party for it, it really was worth it.  They're cool too.  I'm not in the mood to think of creative names right now so they shall remain nameless untill next time.  I just thought it was funny.  While I was in the bathroom (those of you who know me know that I spend a great deal of time there) they discussed amonst themselves then when I got out asked me if I knew that I was hot.  I'm not sure how to answer that.  I really don't consider myself hot and know for a fact of several people not interested in me cause I was not ""hot enough"".  I told them this but they didn't believe me.  It was however a huge ego boost.  Between this, the wedding, and the breast comment.  I think I should probably be working on my self esteam issues.  Maybe I'm cutter than I though.  I usually think of myself as  (never mind, these are negavive thoughts and need to be stricken from my mind).    Yes I am one sexy bitch!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I finally know 100% that there is not only stealing going on but the manager is doctoring to books to hide it.  His punk ass is getting fired.  Yes it's bad to encourage the ""laying off"" of someone but he's an asshole.  Just to give you a little sample, a little girl came in yesterday saying that she was putting together little packs of shampoo, soap, ect.. to pass out at homeless shelters and wanted to know if we could donate maybe 4-5 of each.  The manager gets a discusted look on his face.  I not only gave her shampoo, but also sewing kits, toothpaste, shaving gel, ect...  What the fuck?  It's for a homeless shelter and the girl was only maybe 8.  He's gonna be gone the end of this month.  Hopefully things will get better after that.  On the up side, my dad was (somewhat) nice to me today.  He calls me every day to have lunch eith him.  Kinda weird.  Things will get better very soon, I can feel it."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Well, we'll see if this works.  I'm at work so I can't get into the  posting site.  I'm supposed to be able to post thru e-mail....we'll see.   I saw my dad a little bit ago.  I thought that we reached this new  level in our relationship where we'd be able to get along.  But then I was  reminded that that isn't possible.  We got in a little bit of an  agrument.  He then picked up a pair of scissors.  My eyes got big and all I  could think was ""damn Liz, you fucked up again"".  He just put them away  but it reminded me how scared I get.  Oh well, that's my dad."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Ok, I'm in a MUCH better mood today!!  I finished my take home final.  I found my teacher as I was frantically running towards the office before the door slammed shut.  He held it for me then I told him never mind cause I was looking for him.  I gave him my final and he told me I should hold on to it cause it's not due till Tues.  But, NO THANK YOU!!  I have another class to worry about, I will not be looking at it again.  So, this means that I only have one more final to worry about.  And, I'm super psyched cause Anne's gift came in.  It wasn't supposed to be in till after the wedding and I was super dissappointed but i just got a call from the store today that it's in.  I'm extreamly tempted to dive down and get it today, but I'll wait till Sun.  Tomorrow I'm going rock climbing in the moring and a physics party at night and probably an art show in the middle somewhere.  It'll be a good weekend.  Oh, I talked to Tyler last night  I don't think I've mentioned her yet.  I think we're gonna go out soon.  She says Sun, but I'm gonna see, I think Wed would be better.  I have my final Wed morning, so I'll be ready to chill Wed night.  Then, Thurs I'm going down to my mom's house for a long weekend.  Thurs is a pedicure with my sister, friday is wedding festivities, and sat is the wedding.  I'm so excited!!  I honestly don't think i'd be more excited if it were my own wedding. Do you notice that my posting really are incohesive ramblings.  I will try to start being better, but no promises."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I'm up at the butt crack of dawn cause I have to be at work early.  Woo hoo!!  Quick update:  Everything is pretty good.  I almost got in ANOTHER car accident yesterday.  With a brand new shiny Civic.  On the freeway everyone slammed on their brakes (Was I tailgating?).  It was one of those things that you don't know if you actually hit their car or not.  I think I stopped a couple inches shy.  Anyways.  I got all shook up and decided to take side streets for some time.  Yes, between SF and South Bay.  It's interesting at one red light I looked around and was like ""Shit, this is where my Uncle lives, like 3 blocks away"".  Our families stopped talking about 10 years ago.  I saw my one cousin just once when we went to the same college, and didn't see anyone else till my grandfather's funeral.  That's why it's so important I go to that wedding next month.  We weren't invited to the weddings of the other two cousins, so it will be VERY bad if we don't go now.  Ok, what else....  At work, our pay per view in the room got pulled so now we're gonna have movies they can rent at the desk.  I'm gonna go to Hollywood or Blockbuster to get some Previously Viewed regular movies, but I need porn!!  Porn seems to go better...go figure.  So I need to get me some used porn.  If anyone knows of anywhere, let me know.  Must be clean. Ok, off to work I go.  (at least I get out early since I'm going in early).  After work I need to go grocery shopping and do laundry.  I'm spending the day with Sugar tomorrow!!"

RV8CJXP,female,24,"The crazy lady across the hall is moving to the East Coast.  She gave us a TV and told me to meet a nice boy in Denver (ok, but what would I do with him?)."
RV8CJXP,female,24,I've just spent the last hour searching the US Army sites trying to find out where she is.  I know I won't find anything.  Damn it Liz...write your paper!!
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Hey!!  I had a SHITTY day today.  I know I still need to deal with the CC thing....later.  I went to the store and got $1.99 wine.  Two bottles later, I'm pretty good.  I'm gonna go watch my movie and go to bed.  Hopefully my therapist can sort it all out tomorrow.  I love her!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I know I shouldn't care, but I want to hear from her.  Be good Liz, be good."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"So, my official job at work is not ""clean up chick"".  Everything is disorganized and fucked up.  I'm suppossed to fix it.  Yesterday I spent 9 hours cleaning off the office computer.  I thought I found all the Britney Porn but today I found two more folders filled with it.  Ok, that better be all of it.  I hope there weren't any significant computer files that I deleated.  I don't think microsoft makes the XXX Hard Core program, do they?  Today I started on the file cabinets.  There are like 10 file cabinets filled with paperwork, none is filed.  It took 8 hours to get one drawer almost sorted.  This is going to seriously blow.  And I haven't been able to study for the GRE.  I really need to get going.  I work tomorrow night, so I'll have some time in the morning.  I also have to clean though.  I've been a total slacker with the cleaning in the apartment.  I know that I'm on the verge of a ""talk"" from my roomates, so I figure I'll clean the kitchen tomorrow and vacuum.  That should buy me some time.  I'll aim for the GRE at the end of the month.  My math rocks, english sucks....totally!!  I also have to request all my medical records cause that heart doctor want 5 years of everything.  That means SLO, HI, SF, snd SJ.  Oh, and my car insurance is due.  I think I can get cheaper from Costco so gotta look into that too (before the 26th).  I still haven't written back CC yet.  Mostly cause I just don't want to deal with it.  I feel a little guilty not writing back quickly though cause it takes her hours to wait for a computer and then she checks and nothing.  I was thinking of writting her tonight but I'm a bit tired and we all know what a mess I made last time I wrote her when I was tired.  But, I did write someone else.  I wrote actually a couple people from my old company in HI.  My ex-boss is gonna give me a letter of recomendation.  Yeahee!!!  I'm hoping that a reference from a real world company will help with grad school applications.  I really want Stanford or Berkley, but unless I get some study time....   Other random stuff.  I haven't been very good about watching my diet, but I'm not craving or liking the ""bad"" stuff any more.  Well, except the sweets.  But I'm on the rag (yes red, TMI) so I'm allowed.  And coffee addiction is concored.  Today I hade maybe a 1/4 cup of coffee (I forgot about it).  I needed a cup of tea later but that's really good  :)   I'm not sure how I feel about those sideways happy faces.  They seem odd.   Other thing.  I think that I'm gonna send a letter of support to live 105 for playing Howard Stern.  I don't like Howard.  I find him vulger and offensive, but banning him is an attack on freedom of speech.  I appriciate 105's efforts to protect our rights and fight censorship of public radio.  I don't like the show, so I switch the station when it comes on, is that really that hard of a thing to do.  Why does everything have to be f*c*i*g censored?  Also, from the 2 sentences I heard when flipping past it this morning, I realized that that show does support women's roles outside of those tradionally mandated by society.  Kudos to Howard!!   Yes, I have an hour commute each way to/from work...I think about random shit.   This weekend I'm taking my two little cousins to Marine World.  I am VERY excited.  Elaine and I took them to Great America last year.  The older one and I went on all the roller coasters till I was about sick and Elaine took the youner one cause she doesn't like roller coasters and he wasn't tall enough.  This year we're going to Marine World so that while I take the boys on the roller coasters (the younger one should be tall enough) she can see the animal shows with her friend who's comming with us.  I'm super excited Elaine's friend is comming.  I want her to meet some people who are nice and who she can spend some time with.  This should be a good opportunity.  I'm a bit nervous about the coasters.  My stomach isn't as strong as it used to be.  I need little breaks between rides.  But, that's what lines are for.   I've been feeling bad about one thing though.  My friend, Sugar, is graduating this Friday.  I really want to go, but Sat I have to drive like 3 hours with my cousins (I drive VERY differently when they're in the car) and spend the day on coasters.  So, I need sleep.  If I go to the east bay Fri I know that I'll end up crashing there, and I know that I'll get a max of 4 hours sleep.  So, in short I can't go.  I'm disappointed.  I promised her that I'll take her to dinner to celebrate.  I really love Sugar.  I haven't known her for too long but I just seemed to click with her right away.  I think that she's alot like me.  I may just be on crack but I feel like I really know her.  and I feel like she knows me too.  When we first met, the first thing we found in common is that we both have a tendancy to be attacked by wild animals.  And you thought I was the only one.  Ok, contemplation.....  It's 9.  I'm tired (didn't sleep last night, even after taking sleeping pills).  But I'm working night tomorrow so if I wake up early I may get tired early and won't get home till after 10.  Bed.....wake......bed....wake....bed.....wake.....bed  I think I'm gonna go to bed."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"My other boss from HI wrote back too.  He said he'll give me a recomendation letter too, but later (what exactly does that mean?).  But, he sent me pics of my baby.

RV8CJXP,female,24,"I figured I'd just give a little update of my day.  Yesterday I ended up screwing around so I didn't finish my paper till after midnight, then had to get up at 6:30 to put on the final touches.  I ended up feeling all sick.  Not sure if it was the lack of sleep, lack of food, stress, the beer, or the smoking.  Maybe a combo.  Oh ya, I'm smoking again.  Well, not really.  I'm not buying them, just bumming them.  I know, I'm going to be good.  I'm spending so much energy trying to get my Cholesterol down, so smoking is just so couter-productive.  I'm totally tired today.  It took 3 shots of expresso, 1 coffee, 1 ice tea, and half a caffinated chocolate bar to make it through the day.  But, classes are over!!  Oh, I had a presentatoin today.  It was quite possibly one of the worst I've given.  I answered nearly all the questions with ""i don't know"".  And, Anne is moving to Seattle in maybe a month.  I learned one thing about myself.  When I get sleep deprived, snack jingles get stuck in my head.  One time it was ""I love the fishes cause they're so delicious"" this time it's ""i want candy (do do do do)"".  Yes, that one phrase circling in my head for weeks.  What else.  Oh, a fucking collection agency is calling.  I guess I didn't pay my Old Navy card off.  I'm pissed cause I never got a statement and haven't shopped there in so long I have no clue what I owe.  I went to the website and it won't let me access my account cause they already sold it to the collection people.  Mother Fuckers!!  They're being complete assholes.  I've called them back 2x but no answer.  And finally, I'll give you one guess for who I had a dream about last night.  Damn, I need to get a grip.  I'm so glad I have my therapist tomorrow.  I think I'm getting too dependent on her though.  She'll be out of town for like 2 months.  I don't know.  I think you can tell I'm agitated.  So, lets end on a happy note.  Mass. just legalized gay marriage and Sweeden is going to allow tran in the olympics.  And, I just talked to my roomate, she's in a bad mood too so we're gonna get a bottle of wine and a movie.  I should be feeling better tonight."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"*************READ ME************** This posting is kinda depressing I think.  Well, I think a few of them are.  But, anyways, please don’t think differently of me after this.  I’m still the same.  And don’t talk to anyone about it.  Thanks.    ANNE – Please don’t read me…PLEASE *********************************  Red, what you said in that comment really got me thinking.  I want to thank you.  I know that I wear my problems on my sleeve.  I think that I’m so used to defining myself by my problems that I don’t know how to be without them. I allow them to consume me.  But, I’m going to try really really hard to pull my shit together.  I know that I’ve been this way for forever but I do feel like I’ve been worse since moving back to Cali.  I’m still getting everything sorted out from last summer when I had that breakdown.  Well, I don’t know if it’s “technically” a nervous breakdown.  I ended up in a parking lot in Gilroy listening to Sympathetic Character [http://www.alanis-morissette.com/lyrics/sfij.html#SYMPATHETIC%20CHARACTER] on repeat muttering to myself.  I didn’t have time to deal with that before my grandfather died.  And, yes I am still having issues with that.  In fact I haven’t even been able to touch my Hindi books since the day he died.  They are still in the back seat of my car.  I won’t touch them.  Now my stressor is CC in Afghanistan.  As I’m writing this, I’m realizing that everyone has their own problems and I am not overly special.  But, I agree that I let them consume me.  Tomorrow I’ll be talking to my therapist about it.  Believe it or not, she really is helping and I am getting better.  I’m nervous about tomorrow though cause I promised to talk to her about something I don’t really want to talk about.  Though I know it will help.  Anyone who knows me knows that suicide has always been a factor.  So, that’s what I want to talk about.  Partly to get my thoughts straight for tomorrow and partly to just talk about it.  Most of my friends already know most of this, but here it is anyway.  I’ve been depressed my whole life.  I can remember back to kindergarten having issues.  All though grade school I was depressed.  I wasn’t suicidal cause I didn’t know what it was.  But I was into self-injury.  I would beat myself over the head, scratch up my arms, ect…  By Jr. High I was pretty disturbed.  I hated the human race.  I had no problem with people being hurt, I laughed.  And yes, I hurt myself A LOT, on a daily basis.  I hated life and everything having to do with it.  I was very suicidal.  In my spare time I would compose suicide notes.  That is what would comfort me before falling asleep.  But I also didn’t sleep much.  Once I went over two weeks with no sleep.  I would just lay in bed all night trying to figure out how I could kill myself without screwing things up worse for my mom and sisters.  Come high school I wasn’t quite as actively suicidal I just didn’t care one way or another.  Still thought up suicide notes, but not every second of the day anymore.  I didn’t hurt myself quite as often either.  But I did like it when I got hurt.  Actually I still like it when I get hurt.  Ever wonder why I show off my scars.  I love scars, I love bruises.  I don’t know why, it’s morbid, but I like getting hurt.  I was seriously pissed about my foot getting burned though cause that one wasn’t my doing.  Anyways, back to high school.  I was getting better.  I still hated people though.  It was my plan to get sterilized on my 18th b-day cause I didn’t want any chance of ever contributing to the persistence of the human race.  I think that pretty much explains my mind set.  Ok, college.  I’m not going to go through all the shit that happened there.  I’m not even going to sum it up.  I went pretty crazy for a while.  I had several what my therapist refers to as “passive suicide attempts”.  I guess that’s when you don’t actually do anything yourself, but you find situations where you can get seriously hurt/die and you put yourself in them.  I did that a lot.  Were not going to get into any of this either.  The huge turn around happened when I was living in Hawaii the first time (2000).  I went to the beach with the Moron.  You guys know who I’m talking about.  There were two small islands off the coast which he was going to swim to.  He was on the swim team.  He said that I wouldn’t be able to do it.  I just learned how to swim maybe a month before, so he was right.  However, I’m the kind of person who will always do whatever someone says I can’t do.  So, I started swimming.  Moron ended up getting ahead of me.  I lost him.  By the time I did I was exactly between the two lands.  I was starting to swallow water and getting tired.  No one around.  At first I panicked.  Then I thought “This is the exact situation you have always hoped for.  It will look like an accident.  Actually, it really is.  You can’t make it.  Just relax, put your head under water and take a deep breath.  Even if your reflexes are to cough it up and struggle, it won’t work cause you can’t stand.”  I thought I had a pretty good chance of dying anyway, might as well just wait for it.  I thought about it and floated there feeling great peace just staring at the water.  But, as I was telling myself this I automatically started swimming as hard as I could to shore.  I swam so hard I swam till my belly hit the sand.  After I was mad at myself for passing up such a perfect opportunity but realized that if that is what I did automatically, apparently I really didn’t want to die.  That was the last time I considered myself suicidal.  I’ve had problems and it has crossed my mind but I just remind myself that I had the opportunity and didn’t take it, so I must not really want it.  Up until today, I know that I don’t want to die.  I don’t have thoughts.  Ok, sometimes I have thoughts, but now it’s more inclinations.  I don’t want to die in my head, but I always have the urge to, I don’t know, drive off the cliff when going over the grade, drive into the column when going under a bridge, ect.  Lately my thing is slitting my wrists.  These thoughts intrigue me because I’ve always been more of a pill girl.  But recently that’s all I can think about.  It’s the last thing I think about before falling asleep.  I think about it when driving, on the computer, pretty much all the time.  I don’t want to die.  That’s not it.  I honestly don’t know what it is.  I even think about how I would do it.  If you cut cross ways you won’t die because the blood can close the clot in time.  You have to cut up the vein to actually kill yourself.  That way the blood can’t clot.  I try to figure out what my mind is telling my by these thoughts.  I sometimes think if it’s like a healing thing.  You know how in the old days they would use leaches to suck the blood of sick people because they thought sickness was carried in the blood.  By draining it you should get better.  Maybe that’s it I want to get rid of my pain and think that if I bleed it will go away.  I know it won’t.  It’ll just make things worse.  I’m trying do hard to pull my shit together.  After red’s comment I decided that I’m going to try super hard to not be so obsessed with hurting myself.  But, even after resolving to that and trying to keep my mind occupied I still thought about it 10-15 times during my drive home today (it took 45 min).  The only way I could get myself to not think about it was to think of CC, then I cried.  I swear to you guys that I really don’t want to die.  I really don’t.  I’m going to try really hard not to think about it so much.  I think it’ll get better after tomorrow.  Usually only after I talk to someone candidly about what’s bothering do I release it.  So I’m thinking that after I talk to my therapist about it I’ll feel much better about things.  On the flip side, I think I’m gonna write CC a letter telling her the whole truth about how I feel.  Maybe then I’ll be able to release that too.  And maybe it’ll be good for her as well.  I’ll talk to my therapist about this too.  Lastly, don’t be getting all upset or worried about me.  As I stated very clearly above, this is nothing new what-so-ever.  I’m not suddenly more fucked up cause I wrote this.  I’m actually much better no that I could talk a little.  I love you all!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Today was crazy at work.  The morning was slow and there was only one clerk working.  I was back up.  He asked to leave early since it was slow, so I told him I'd cover him.  After that, the shit hit the fan.  There was alot of random stuff I won't go into cause you know how much I talk and I want to keep this entry under 1000 pages.  One interesting one was this one guy whose been staying for a couple days now.  Every day he comes down and pays cash for one night so is checkout date is always the next day.  Yesterday he wouldn't come down to pay and he wouldn't answer the phone or the door (they were pounding on it) but his curtains were open and he was just lying on the bed, naked.  We had to send someone into the room to make sure he wasn't dead.  Well, I guess today he ran out of cash.  He says he'll bring it by at 6 tonight.  So, if he hasn't paid by the time I get into work tomorrow, I have to call the cops.  Yes, it seems excessive but that's what they told me to do.  I gues I'm not gonna tackle a naked man myself and get all his shit out.  Another thing I feel bad about is a woman who's staying there cause her boyfriend beat her up.  There's been a few troubles with her room and she's breaking down every time I talk to her.  I gave her a free night tonight.  I told her that I understand completely.  In other news, I think I'm going out with that friend of a friend on Sun.  I'm slightly weary cause we've been talking alot.  I'm worried that she might be the type to rush into something.  I want to chill a bit.  She seems cool though.  We get along and have alot in common (we both suck at geography).  And, no I have not spoken to scary public transportation chick.  Sat I'm going to Exploritorium with Sugar and this woman she's seeing.  I'm super excited cause I like to play (as you all know.   oh, she's gonna bring a camera, yeahee!!).  And I want to meet the woman.  Sugar and I have gotten really close.  It's so hard to explain.  Red, I think you would use the term ""psudo girlfriend"".  I talk to her like every day.  I didn't talk to her for 2 days this week and flipped out wondering if something happened.  I care about her a whole lot.  I'm really excited that maybe she found someone cool who will treat her right.  I will admit, that the selfish bitch part of me is a little tiny bit jealous.  But, I care about her too much for that to influence my thoughts in any way.  So far I really like the woman, fingers crossed!!  oh, I got a ""FUCK BUSH"" bumber sticker.....on a purple background.  Go me!!  Very cool.  But as we learned in driving improvement school the first time (the total is 3 times for those of you who lost count) cops really will find reasons to pull you over if you piss them off (they've admitted to it).  And displaying contoversial stuff can piss them off.  So, no displaying of profanities on the car  :(    I guess it'll go in my room.  c'est la vie  (yes, I am pretty sure the spelling is wrong, blow me)  That's it for today.  I get my blood test back tomorrow.   Please let it be good!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"It seems like everyone is having a hard time right now.  There's so much that I feel I need to focus on and it's getting hard.  I love my friends so much and always want to be there for them.  My mom tells me that I can't take on their problems and/or responsibilities.  But, I can't help it.  I can't stand to see them hurt or having problems.  If I can do anything to help, I will.  The only problem comes when everyone is having issues at the same time.  Two of my really good friends are going through some hard times.  I'm trying so hard to be there for them.  Sometimes I don't know if I'm doing a very good job.  I've known them for so long and I still don't know what to do.  Does that mean I'm a bad friend?  That I wasn't paying close enough attention?  When they're upset I still don't even know if they need to be alone or if they want someone there with them.  And when I'm there, do I even help?  I have so many of my own issues that I'm scared of unintensionally burdening them further with my stuff. That is the key word...burden.  Why do I always feel like I'm burdening people.  I think that's why so many people have such a wrong idea about who I am or how I feel about things.  I'm so convinced that I'm a burden on everyone that I don't allow anyone to know me.  It'll be ok, lets change topics"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I haven't written in a couple days and do have alot to fill youin on.  Here's the just of it.  No cheese, no sweets, keeping coffe down, blah, blah, blah.  Whatever, my ""diet"" is fine.  My dad is a dick.  Yes, he made me cry (at work)...again.  Yes, he fucked me over...again.  Yes, he was mean to me...again.  Whatever, fuck him.  Ok not really.  I came to the conclusion a while ago that with my dad I have 2 options.  I can continue to allow myself to be beat down by my dad, or I can loose my dad.  No matter how much it hurts, I'm not ready for option 2 quite yet. Ok, is that enough of a summary.  CC wrote me today.  I haven't been able to stop crying since.  I don't know what to do.  Please help me.  I want so badly to start writing her again and have communication, but I don't think that's a very good idea.  I don't know what to say to her.  I need to talk to someone but I can't think of anyone.  Anne is super busy righ now with moving, I don't want to bother her.  Plus, this is the last weekend she and her husband have before leaving.  Red, Big A, and Gouch are down south at a graduation.  And I can't talk to my family.  I could call Bunny (my rock climbing buddy), we've been talking alot about ex's and she understands how I feel.  But, I'm tired of being known as the depressing one with problems.  I don't want people to think that that's who I am.  If I always talk to them about my issues, that's who I'll become. I think that I'll just do some alone time today and try to figure out what to write.  I started something, but it sucks.  Maybe I'll just let it suck.  Just be honest and write what comes to mind.  I want to write her ASAP.  I know she probably won't check her e-mail for a while, but I want it there when she does.  Here's what she wrote me: ************* Hey,  I just wanted to let you know that I recieved your package. Thank you. I received it about a week and half ago. I had set myself a time limit in which I had to reply. To be truly honest I didn't know if I was going to reply. I really don't know what to say. Other than the fact that I was very surprised actually I was dumdfounded. The package nearly brought me to tears. So many questions have been running through my mind since then. The main question is Why Now?. I may never know that answer but I just had to ask. Is it because I am over here? Would have contacted me If I was still in Hawaii?  I guess it really doesn't matter but I you could answer those questions I would appreciate it. I don't in anyway what to throw a guilt trip on you. I can only guess what you've been going through. I truly do wish that things are working out for you. For me though things are okay. No new relationsonships, just me I think I've grown a little bit since you left.Well I don't knoe if I'll hear from you again so I will just say this.  Thank you very much for being apart of my life. I will always remember you.   Please if you can respond to this e-mail                                                                                                       CC (smily face)  p.s.    You will be recieving a letter and  a check in about three weeks .  I will be sending it to the address that was on the card .  *************** She sounds good, huh?  I'm really glad.  Do you think she hates me?  I don't want her money.  I really do love her.  I know we won't work as a couple, but I care for her so much it hurts."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"The purpose of creating this blog was for me to have a place to write about my thoughts and feelings.  Thus far I haven’t touched on anything that I intended to talk about.  I’ve been nervous because several of my friends read this.  I am happy that they do because I think that it will give them a better understanding of who I am, but I’m nervous at the same time.  The truth is that I no one really knows me.  It’s not their fault.  I, like my father, am a great actor.  I portray what I want.  I often slip and people will get snippets of my thoughts, but nothing cohesive enough for them to form a picture of who I am.  I often even try to hide this image from myself.  I am hoping that I can begin writing my thoughts here.  This is my place to talk about how I feel.  I don’t want anyone to read this and feel bad for me, or try to fix things, or minimize things.  And also, no matter how much I talk about something, what is written here is never the whole story.  In fact, I have not told the whole story about any event that has ever transpired in my life (except to my therapist).  I often twist and contrive things into a form that works.  No, I don’t lie or manipulate the truth in order to gain something in my interest.  On the contrary I change things in order to protect people from what may hurt them.  I love my friends dearly, but I don’t confide in them.  I don’t confide in anyone.  This is what has happened.  I never talked to people about problems I had.  In fact, I would often change a negative event into a positive one.  No, I wasn’t raped…we messed around.  No, he didn’t hurt me….he’s just playful.  I hide everything so meticulously that no one ever knew what was happening in my mind or otherwise.  None of my friends have ever seen me truly upset.  I temper my emotions before I allow them around my friends.  I think that I’m trying to protect them.  When I care for someone very deeply, I want to protect them from everything.  It’s the motherly thing.  A lot of times I slip and my bitterness or depression comes out, but they have never seen the brunt of it.  None of my friends have ever seen me go into a panic attack, they have never seen me go into a catatonic state.  The Gouch may have once, I’m not sure.  But, all this “protection” has resulted in no one knowing how to comfort me when I’m upset.  There is only one person who can make me feel better when I’m sad.  But even she hasn’t seen me when I’m truly upset.  I’m so scared to write about things because I don’t want some people knowing some things.  But, I do honestly think that it would be good for our relationship for my friends to understand me better.  I don’t want my emotions to be brushed off as “Oh, Liz…you’re just being you”.  This blog is not a competition or a “who has a worse life”.  This is about me.  Only me.  How I think and feel.  I think the biggest problem I have with talking to people when I’m upset about something is one of two things always happens.  Either you get someone who offers tons of advise on how to fix it, or you get someone who trivializes your problems and explains how they have it worse.  It is so hard to find someone who will just listen.  I just want to be mad/sad/ect…  I don’t want it fixed.  I just need to feel this way sometimes.  I don’t know if this posting makes much sense.  I ment it as an introduction so that I could now post some other things that I’ve been wanting to talk about.  But, I’m still nervous.  I love you all.  Please keep in mind that this is my diary.  It’s excess information about who I am.  Don’t form judgments about me.  And don’t criticize me or tell me to change.  I know that right now you’re thinking that I’m full of shit and a bitch for trivialize your understanding of me.  I do not mean to do that.  I feel like this posting did not do what it was intended to.  But, I’m not thinking too clear right now, so I’m going to leave it at this and do damage control later. I love you!!"

RV8CJXP,female,24,"I have a bunch of stuff I need to talk about, but have to wake up at 4:45 am.  Fucking bitch walked off the job today and I have to cover her shift for a little while.  I'll discuss later.  Love ya!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Ok, I'm supposed to pick up my medical records at school this morning.  The place opened at 8:30 so I got there at the 8:29 and went straight to the chick's office.  Wait....wait.  Her office is open with the lights on but no one there.  I'm getting a little annoyed cause I'm supposed to be at work at 9.  I knew I was gonna be late but not by too much.  I also didn't get nearly enough sleep last night so I'm tired.  Well, I hear the loud speaker call the chick into the conference room for a meeting.  Great!!  Well, I thought I'd get breakfast on campus cause I skipped this morning cause I was rushed.  I get breakfast (tofu, hummas, and sundried tomato on a bagel...yum) then go back to her office at maybe 9.  Her office door is closed....FUCK!!  That means she did come back before the meeting.  Well, I wait some more (glad I paid till 9:30 on my parking permit).  After about 10-15 min some guy working in the office next door asks what I'm waiting for (yes, I'm sitting in front of a closed office door).  He looks it up and the meeting isn't supposed to end till 9:30 and they run late.  Damn it.  No I have to kill like a half hour.  My parking permit has no expired.  I debating whether to hike back to my car to pay some more or risk a ticket.  If I get a ticket, I'll be pissed.  And I'm on campus in my work clothes and my hair all up in a bun.  I look like a dumb ass.  The guy told me to come back at 9:45 at the earliest.  I guess I will go back to my car and pay the extra money.   FUCK!!!   And I'm gonna be about 2 hours late to work.  Well, the one good thing.  Next semester, I'm paid for full time and I decided to only go part time, so I turned in my refund request.  Yeahee, productive!!  Ok, I gotta get to my car before the parking people do.  Hopefully when I get back the chick will be out of the meeting and I can get my records.  Today WILL be a good day, DAMN IT!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I have to leave for the rehersal dinner in about an hour so I decided to waste some time.  I just finished a cup of instant coffee so my mouth has a bad after taste.  I'm starting at a cup of Parsley tea, but scared to take a sip.  Don't ask why I'm drinking Parsely tea.  Maybe I should strain it.  All the leaves are just floating around.  I'm gonna go strain it.  I guess this post is shorter than expected."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I checked my e-mail a couple mins ago and just got a forward from someone in my department saying to watch the news tonight because they will be reading the names all everyone who has died in Iraq. I am completly against the war and could go off about all that, but I don't want to right now. Right now, my heart is in my throat and I have tears in my eyes. My ex-girlfriend and I broke up last July. It was my choice and I it was definitally for the best. It was a little bit of a hard break up (not as bad as others I've had, but not easy). I haven't spoken to her since maybe August and have tried to move on.  I met her when I was living in Hawaii. She, like most lesbians in Hawaii, is in the military. I generally don't date military, but made an exception for her. We had a rocky relationship (though she will deny this) which ended me me begging her to date other people. Last time I talked to her she told me that she was supposed to go to Afgahnastan in Feb. I don't know if she ever went or what is going on. But based on the fact that they're trying to re-institute the draft, I think just about everyone is over there. I would e-mail her, but I don't want to make contact again. I'll write more about her later, but not right now. Even though I thought that I was over her, when I got that e-mail, my heart skipped a beat. I went down the list of names getting more pannicked as I got closer to the C's. She wasn't there (thank god). But, now I'm just anxious and upset. I want so badly to know where she is and if she's ok, but I don't know how to figure it out.  It's funny, relationships can be long passed and you can think you're over someone, but then someting happens, and all that emotion comes flooding back. All you want to know is are they ok, and are they happy."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I am just finishing up a 16 hour day.  I am oh so tired.  I woke up before 5:30 to get to work early (and stop at the store on the way there to pick up flowers and cookies for a meeting being held at work.  Get to work and set up the room for the meeting.  Barely made it.  Brought in the drinks after they arrived.  Pretty good timing though.  Then my dad stopped by and was an ass as always.  I feel bad cause I know he doesn't mean to be one.  It's not his fault that his very presence upsets me to the point I can't function for the rest of the day.  Well, maybe it's kinda his fault, but he doesn't understand.  But, I'm really not wanting to get into it.  The internet guy for the company got moved to my location.  He likes to spend his days annoying me by comming up to me every 5 min and talking to me about what he's working on, or asking me to pull a file.    Anyway I was psyched when I got to go on a Costco/Smart & Final/Bank run.  I get lost on the way to S & F then my car breaks...yes, again.  I was stranded in San Jose most of the day.  I just got home.  My brakes are ""fixed"", but apparently, something called a buffing is gonna break soon so I'm gonna have to get that repaired too.  The mechanic let me go under the car to look though, Yeahee!!  I actaually have some interesting stuff to say, but I'm tired.  I think I need to sleep.  I'm starting to contemplate whether this would be a good time to start saving for a car.  Mine is having problems way too often.  I need sleep."

RV8CJXP,female,24,"I'm actually doing really really well today.  Night before last I talked to Red for about an hour on the phone.  It really ment alot to me and made me feel much better.  I've known her for 6 years and I love her so much.  It seems like lately things have been really strained between us and I was seriously scared that I was loosing her as a friend.  Our talk though made me feel like she really does apriciate the fact that I'm going through something right now and I know how much she cares for me.  That ment more to me than I can explain.  Since then I've been feeling much much better.  Maybe the reason why I wear my problems on my sleve is because I'm searching for that connection.  I don't know.  I'm not trying to say that I'm magically better.  Yes, I'm still having bad thoughts, but not as often.  And night before last (the night we talked) I actually winced when I thought about cutting myself.  That's a big improvement.  Oh, and I switched the CD in my car.  I've been listening to the same CD on repeat for over a year now (since I was living in Hawaii).  I usually just switched it when someone was with me.  So, today I listened to India Arie (spelling?).  So that's a positive change too.  I'm also doing better in ways that I won't discuss right now.  Overall I'm good.  I've been thinking about psychiatrists and don't think I'll go to him right now.  Either I'm really getting better, or I'm on an upswing.  If I'm on an upswing then I have some time to get strong before the next bad spell.  Overall today was chill.  Didn't fuck up too much at work.  Started studying for the GRE.  I tried to read Bitch (it's a total feminist magazine) but my coworkers kept stealing it cause the ads are funny.  The one I'm going to post on my wall is ""Put your pussy where your politics are.  Support feminist sex toy stores.""  Very cool.  Oh, FYI apparently Curves gym is heavily linked to several Christian organizations and their proceeds partly go to Pro-Life organizations.

Not too bad today.  No cheese, only 1 cup coffee, kinda alot of sugar (especially with the juice), not enough water (why am I not drinking water??)  Ok, that's good.  Night!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"About six years ago I formed a mantra:   Reality is Irrelevant. It's only one's perception of reality that matters.    If you see something to be a certain way, does it matter how it really was? If you remember something with skewed details, will it ever make a difference? Is who we are based on how we perceive things to be, or is it on how they really are? So many times we rework events in our own minds so be able to deal with and accept them. If you tell yourself something often enough, does it becomes truth? So many times, I have fucked with my own memories and thoughts twisting them into my own personal ""reality"". But no matter how many times I tell myself something, there is something in the back of my mind saying it isn't right. Now I have grown, and I no longer live by my mantra (though I often recite it). I finally accept things for how they really are.   I no longer have anything to hide. This is me..."

RV8CJXP,female,24,"To put it mildly I'm extreamly upset.  Remember how I wrote that back in Jr. High I used to hurt myself but I don't do that anymore?  Well, when I get like this, all bets are off.  It's not like I lied cause I forgot how I'm like when I'm upset.  In the shower, I cried...alot.  Had a couple minor panic attacks (hyperventalating).  Then I get weird, like a trance.  I don't know why, but my hand go to my throat and squeeze, I start scratching myself and just feel violent.  You know how you take the cap of the conditioner and hit it on your hand, I did that so hard I have a semi-circle cut on my hand.  Well, not really a cut, it only is the first layer of skin I think.  When I got out of the shower, my vision is blurry.  I'm not sure if it's from crying or pushing on my eyes.  My shoulders hurt from scratches and I'm drained.  I don't think I want to talk any more.  I need dinner.  I just wanted to write a bit before I forgot cause I know that I need to start checking myself.  I just wish there was someone here to hold me.  But I know it's not gonna happen.  And I probably would just end up feeling worse anyway.  I'm fucked up like that."

RV8CJXP,female,24,"I was ridiculously pissed off yesterday and today. I was planning on writing about it, but I have resolved my feelings...I think. I don't want to go into it cause I'm all ok now and don't want to get thinking before bed. It had to do with Sugar. But, we talked for like an hour and I think I got everything off my chest, so there's nothing else I need to say right now. And I only had one glass of wine, so no lectures. I'm sorry I get like that. I'm having trouble lately figuring out how to deal with my feelings. I usually just bottle them up or stuff them down and not deal with them. Now I'm trying to face them. It just gets hard cause I don't always know what to do.  Sometimes I feel like I'm screwing up, but honestly this is the healthiest I've been both mentally and physically in a long time.  Ya, I'm thinking about more stuff.  But, isn't it better to think about and deal with things than to not?  My therapist says that I'm seeing the world in a different way.  I'm seeing things I never saw before.  I think she's right. I miss you guys."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I had a shitty ass day today.  Didn't sleep last night cause I was thinking.  I was pissed off all day today.  I even had a drink at lunch (Is it bad when you hit the tequila before noon?).  And why is it whenever you're tired, your cell phone dies?  I don't get it. It was also my roomate's thing today so I stopped on the way home and picked up 2 kinds of cookies, pound cake, brownies, ice cream, flowers, and of course some wine.  Yes, I need to fill you in on what's going on, but first I need a drink.  Please don't think any less of me.  I'll try to write about it tonight.  Love ya!!"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Damn, last night I could barely sleep (woke up every half hour) and it's not even me who's getting married.  I'm so excited for her.  I got out of bed a half hour early and feel totally rested just ancy.  It's wierd, I've been dragging all week.  I have to leave for my hair apt in like 5-10 min but didn't know what to do to kill that time.  I think this helped."
XF2OJF7,female,39,"I Love  urlLink Blogger!   Cool.  I've been meaning to mention how much I love the  urlLink updates  that Blogger added back in September, but haven't done it until now. I have saved 'Tuesday Quotes' into the future a month or so, now that we can post to future dates.  So tonight, after not posting for a week, two Tuesday Quotes post automatically when I post tonight's blathering. I just love technology."

XF2OJF7,female,39,"Sketch  Check out this  urlLink Artist . Something simple made into something beautiful. Very Zen.   Creative Challenge:  Go get a cheap drawing toy and keep it on your coffee table or somewhere you might find yourself with extra time. The bathroom?? :P  The car? If you're thrifty (read: cheap) like me and use dial-up, put one by your computer for all that waiting time. Or a small one in your purse or backpack.  Having the tool available will help you use some of that spare (wasted) time exercising your creativity."

XF2OJF7,female,39,"Body in a Jar Update  Well, I started with food coloring, which didn't do much, but honestly, I didn't expect it to.  So I bought Rit dye and now the 'body' is in the jar with the dye. It appears that the plastic is starting to change color. I know it works on some kinds of plastic, I had seen plastic beads being dyed with fabric dye, and a friend experimented with that for me. But I know some kinds of plastic will change color and other kids won't. On the doll so far (only 10 minutes or so) it looks like the head is changing color, and the arms, but not sure about the body and legs, that's a different plastic. Well if her head turns out, I can live with the rest of it. Probably cover the body and maybe cover the legs, too, so it should work out.  Gotta get a good idea about the outfit."
XF2OJF7,female,39,"Oh, and for those of you keeping track, the winners were announced over at  urlLink Designs On The White House  last week.  I was happy to be one of eight semi-finalists, and ecstatic to be one of four finalists in my category, and I'm pleased to say that my favorite entry (not my own) was the winner. Seriously, it's not one of those 'it was an honor to just be nominated' spoken through clenched teeth. I really did not expect to get as far as I did, and am very happy that I overcame my procrastination tendencies and entered the contest. The folks at DOTWH said us finalists could sell our designs in our own Cafe Press store, and they'd link to us. They haven't put up the link yet, but here's my store, if you want to check it out:  urlLink  Technicolor Junk to Buy"
XF2OJF7,female,39,"The art of the quilt  For one of the sites I'm working on for someone, I've been doing some serching for  urlLink Sunbonnet Sue  patterns, and I found a couple cool things. One quilter has used  urlLink Sue  to help raise awareness for domestic abuse. And a group of quilters, who realized they were sick of  urlLink Sue , made quilts of her in, um, let's say, not so flattering situations."
XF2OJF7,female,39,"Thursday Bit O' Beauty  OK, I know this is kinda a cop-out, but today's bit o' beauty is my new template. Still just one of the basic Blogger templates, since I haven't learned CSS myself yet, but kinda funky. Hit refresh, or click the title to change the colors. Very Technicolor, if you ask me."
XF2OJF7,female,39,"Links galore  If I haven't said it before, one thing I am very proud of as a newbie blogger, is that I have used all free things. I certainly know you sometimes get what you pay for, but I'm happy with the different free blogging tools I've been using.  urlLink Blogger  and  urlLink BlogSpot  for the blogs. Not upgraded, so I do have ads, but I'm willing to suffer the ads to have a cheap blog.  urlLink Haloscan  for commenting here, and  urlLink Enetation  on the other. I definately love Haloscan, Enetation is nice, but doesn't seem to always stay up. They have an upgrade which promices to not go down, but I think they should stay up more, then I'd consider upgrading.  urlLink BlogRolling  is the absolute coolest!! I did upgrade that, not to specifically get the extra features, but because I just loved it so much. And now, I do love the extra features (more BlogRolls). Other things I've found and used for free:   urlLink W3 Schools  has taught me so much HTML and stuff, oh, and  urlLink Web Monkey  is great, and has a kid section, too. (Hmm, I need to add a link to them). That's a lot of links! (Hey Perry, here's all the links you need to make a completely FREE blog. Now you have even less excuses to make your own!) My point is, I like finding the free things. The newest free thing I've found is the  urlLink Zonk Board  (see previous entry). And I just have to say, I'm so impressed I had to upgrade my account right away."

XF2OJF7,female,39,"This  urlLink hat  project sounded very fitting for me, as the weekend goal is to get the work area table ready for the sewing machine.

XF2OJF7,female,39,"Here's the latest obsession: I decided I NEED a digital camera. Yes, I have known for a while that I have to get one sometime, but I was thinking of a really great one that would put me into debt, with all the bells and whistles. But what I've figured out now, is that I can buy an inexpensive one now (and I know I'll get what I pay for), and I'll still save for a better one. So I'm looking at spending up to around $60. Here's my research so far:  urlLink This one  is cute, I love Yahoo! stuff. Though  urlLink this one  looks more like an actual camera. I really liked the specs on  urlLink this one  until I saw the picture. Kodak is always a name you can trust, I do like  urlLink this one.  My two favorites after all these and many more that didn't even make it this far in the running, are  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one , one more camera-like, the other more pocket-pencil like."
XF2OJF7,female,39,"So today's pay day, and I'm feeling like my budget is closer to 'in line' than 'out of control' now, so I treated the kids to Popeyes for supper, then ran off to Hobby Lobby to pick up those on sale patterns. I was very diciplined at HL, and only spent $10. OK, it was $10.11, but close enough. I bought two hat patterns, which was what I went for, browsed the fabric, and of course, bought a few beads.  I'm looking for earring inspiration, but didn't find any. I only bought the beads that I really loved, and they are started on a project already. But the funniest thing tonight was part of the adventure. I had to get to HL in a round about way because of different road construction projects, and I'm going up a road I don't normally travel, so seeing new things. I drive past a house that has a 'sold' sign, a class C-type camper for sale, and a portable basketball hoop, also for sale. (is 'portable' the right word?) Anyway, I've looked into getting one of these for my boys, I know the price can range from $75 or so up to at least $150, and as I drive by, I see the sign says  FOR SALE $25 . Cool, I'm thinking. I can afford that! I can't take it home right now in this car, but I could ask my friend to pick it up in his painting van, he'd do that. I don't have the cash on me, but I could offer a check, or offer to go to an ATM to get the cash.  So yup, I turned the car around and pulled up in their driveway. Something told me to double check the sign before ringing their bell. I go to check, and the notebook page that was the 'for sale' sign was kinda wrapped around the pole, and it actually read  FOR SALE $125 . Whoops. I got right back in my car and headed out. There were two adorible little girls at the glass screen door as I started to pull away. They had heard the car and come to see what was up. I waved, and they seemed dissapointed that I wasn't coming to the door. Oh, well."

XF2OJF7,female,39,"Disgusting and Disturbing  OK, I'll admit, I was warned not to watch The Swan. But I flipped past and it was like a train wreck that I couldn't turn away from. Completely horrifying. I won't even start on how they're glorifying 'perfection' and cookie-cuttering these women. And I won't comment on how the doctors are nothing special to look at themselves (meaning they haven't had all sorts of surgeries done on  themselves  but they're willing to do all sorts of unnecessary surgeries on these people. And I won't finish by saying how pathetic it is that everyone made such a big deal about how beautiful these women are NOW, completely diminishing the beauty they already had to begin with. I won't even start. I will go off on a different tangent, though.  I can not get into MaryKate and Ashley being grown-up hotties. I just can't see it. Yes, they've grown up just beautifully, but every time I look at them, I still see that little curly-headed baby, all smiley, as the 'uncle' and 'best friend' try changing diapers for the first time, and one says to 'dad' my favorite punch-line-turned-personal-catch-phrase-that-year (say it with me!): ""Your baby's a  pig ."""
XF2OJF7,female,39,"Yay  Sometimes the solution is so simple, it makes you mad you didn't figure it out sooner. You know, like 'if it were a snake-it would've bit ya'. Well, that's what happened with my image issue. The simple solution was there all along, I just didn't find it. Didn't see the tree right in my face, for looking into the forest, cut off the nose to spite the face, missed the circus trying to fix the merry-go-round.  OK, that's going a bit too far  Anyway, please notice all the wonderful graphics loaded here, and be prepared for more!"

N6J7KCU,male,25,"When the news of Reagan's passing came, I was reminded of his re-election bid in 1984 when my parents took me and my brother to see him speak at a rally at our town hall in (mostly Republican) Fairfield, Connecticut. I was nine or ten, and boy, was I excited.   My brother and I waved our flags and cheered ""Four more Years!"" We jeered the Mondale supporters and liked the Republicans with the ""Fritz Busters"" signs (Mondale's face fashioned into the Ghostbusters logo). We made our parents rush us down the street afterward so we could wave to his limo as it passed.   Why this outpouring of GOP enthusiasm from two tykes such as ourselves, raised on PBS and whole wheat bread? Well, he was the PRESIDENT!! What did we care if he was funding the slaughter of villagers in Guatemala? Nuclear proliferation? What's that? Iran-Contra huh? He liked Jellybeans and we wished our grandpa was more like him. We didn't care what our parents thought about him -- we didn't even know! (I have since learned that my father voted for him both times, something I like to give him shit about when he spews venom over George W. and sends checks to Kerry.)  What is my point? Oh, I don't know. I guess just this: if you see cute little kids on TV in the next few months' campaign coverage, cheering for Shrub, don't judge them too harshly or take them too seriously. They may turn out to be card-carrying, bleeding heart, pinko liberals like me. As for the kids cheering for Kerry -- well, let's hope they turn out that way too."

People used to say things to me like, ""I love you, but you're an asshole,"" or just, ""you're (such) an asshole.""  I was fine with this.  Maybe I just liked the attention; maybe I was simply immature.  But in my own mind, it was a question of rebellion, of struggling to set myself apart in a subculture that claimed to be about individuality but was really as viciously uniform as a fraternity during pledge week.  I was so proud of myself.  I was a self-appointed inquisitor to the punk scene, and quite obnoxious.  In retrospect, anyone who did like me probably managed to do so despite my self-conscious efforts rather than because of them.  (Something that is maybe true of all good friends in all situations.)     I've lost the fire, thank God, but I'm still willing to say things I don't mean if I think they're funny or otherwise worth saying.  Perhaps this is a bad habit.

I guess the heart of the issue is the right to privacy, particularly on matters that can, unfortunately, be held against an individual in very real ways.

N6J7KCU,male,25,"I cut and paste this quotation from Matt Bivens' ""The Daily Outrage"" Blog which appended to thenation.com's home page.  ______________  It's hard to improve upon the opening to this dry, tiny Reuters report :  Two rehearsals for his prime-time speech were not enough to keep US President George W. Bush from mangling the name of the Abu Ghraib prison that brought shame to the US mission in Iraq.   During the half-hour televised address, Bush mispronounced Abu Ghraib each of the three times he mentioned it ... English speakers usually pronounce [it] as ""abu-grabe"". But the Republican president ... stumbled on the first try, calling it ""abugah-rayp"". The second version came out ""abu-garon"", the third attempt sounded like ""abu-garah"".   White House aides, who described the speech as an important address on the future of Iraq, said Bush practiced twice on Monday before boarding his helicopter for his trip to the speaking venue ...   If you want to see it for yourself, go to the White House web page for the President's speech, and click on the video option. Start listening 20 minutes into the speech -- just at the two-thirds mark -- and all the various mangled iterations of Abu Ghraib come in quick succession.   Reuters gets it basically right. But they don't quite communicate the look of angst that grips the President's face at his first effort, which actually comes out:   ""Abugah ...   [Pause; President bobs head in internal struggle to shake free third syllable; a truly anxious moment when one feels a stab of sympathy for the man, and wonders if he'll be able to pull it off;]   ... rayp.""   [Heavy sigh of relief. He did it! Hooray! George W. ""low expectations"" Bush surprises and pleases us once again. And to think he only had to practice twice beforehand!]"

This is my favorite sort of player, sort of a lovable loser, lovable because he helps your team win but is, you know, kind of a loser.

He looked like a cross between Brad Pitt and that guy from  urlLink Nickelback .  The man, quite friendly, submitted to her pleas and returned with her to her friends.      To this point, I assumed that he was an exciting and perhaps long lost acquaintance.  The scene was interesting from a simple and dramatic viewpoint.

A bum, also recognizing the star, lurked patiently outside the cafe to ask for change.  And this guy, what a guy, obliged instantly.  Another detail that remains, for whatever reason, is the crumpled McDonalds back in his hand.  It seemed so mundane for a guy in leather pants, let alone a celebrity.  What's most notable about this celebrity encounter is that I was able to observe it with no recognition at all of the celebrity himself.  I had no reason to be excited by seeing him in person, so my attention was focused more on the women as much as him.  I've spotted and/or met a few celebrities in my life, and they've always disappointed me in person; physically, personally, sometimes both.  But this guy, in some paradoxical way, might as well have been Elvis back from the dead.  I felt compelled to ask for his autograph too, but decided that the possibility of him  figuring my ignorance would dash the whole point."

N6J7KCU,male,25,"Beauty Considered    urlLink The NYTimes misses the point on reality television and plastic beauty .  The problem isn't that we're all going to look the same, or that beauty will become boring, but that the relationship between the product and the consumer has become so tricky as to be much more than simply disingenuous.  What we think we want isn't what we actually want, and what we're getting isn't so much either as it is universal in whatever it actually is (outrageous, if you ask  urlLink Chicha , but I think it can be other things as well; the point is not how it hits us, but that it hit a majority of us the same way.)    A good example of this is market-researched endings to movies.  Does anyone really like those endings in which, despite the combined inertia of character, plot, plausibility and logic, everything works out?  I'm not sure; probably someone does.  Grandmas go to the movies too.  But the more more important point may be that fewer people staunchly object to these endings; we know that good art ultimately makes us happy, but that doesn't mean it  is  happy.  (Perhaps the real problem is a widespread confusion of satisfaction and happiness.  I might even confuse the two as I write this.)        Just as in the past we all became armchair psychologists, now we have all become armchair Ad-men.  We think we are savvy to market forces and cynically aware of how we are manipulated.  But we still buy the same shit, and just as much of it.  Our cynicism has been acknowledged and appropriated.

What would be worse:  a satirical send-up of a current pop song about one's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning?  Or an earnest ballad about one's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning written by  Weird Al Yankovic  ?  If I was him, I'd really be wishing I wasn't him right now, you know what I mean?  No one would take him seriously, or if we did, it would be uncomfortable in the same way that it was uncomfortable when, suddenly, John Ritter was a comedy god simply because he was 1) dead and 2)  we all know his name.    Not to speak ill of the dead, of course.  But sometimes we talk about them like conspicuous eavesdroppers.  And that doesn't seem to be what anyone would want."

N6J7KCU,male,25,"Finally, reliable internet access.  I should be back for good now.  Big things are afoot in the world of impeccable jones. Between Barrack Obama and a sweaty John Kerry, between Nomar's sudden revelation as one of baseball's biggest bums, a new home in a new town, and a visit to Boston, Philly and New Jersey, there has been plenty to write about but no internet to write it on. Sorry about that.  Scott and I have been discussing this nomar thing in an analog format, though, and there are some important points to be made.  Count me among the supporters of this trade.  Scott seems to insist that I be upset about it,  but considering Nomar's actions, the players available and all other factors, I think the Sox did the best thing for the team.   Cabrera and Mientkiewicz are solid players who aren't going to fake injuries, make ridiculous salary demands, or infect the clubhouse with their sulking.  No, they won't hit as many home runs as Nomar will, but we have enough of those guys in this line up.  The vastly improved defense will save us runs, and I'm personally tired of rooting for a team that either socks eight home runs and wins, or doesn't and loses.   Historically speaking, the trade is a move in the right direction, toward building a solid team full of solid players and away from the team's tendency to focus on and cater to it's minority of superstars.  This is a move toward a team like the 2001 Diamondbacks, the 2002 Angels, the Yankees of the 1990s.  Because the superstar lineup only works if you're willing to pay for it, and the Red Sox never quite have been.   If I have any complaints, they're minor:  1)  For my own reasons, I wish they hadn't traded Nomar to Chicago.  This effectively settles the cubs/white sox question.  I can't, in good faith, root for Nomar's new pinstripes.  Then again, the White Sox are in direct competition with the Red Sox for the wild card, so I can't exactly root for them either.   I know it isn't a satisfaction conclusion to the ongoing quandary, but I think I hate both teams, at least for now.  2)  Why didn't Theo accept the Lowe for Clement portion of the deal?  I don't see how this would have been anything but a straight upgrade.  The best justification I can think of is that Lowe will improve with the defense and the apparent vote of confidence.  I'll be the first to call Theo a genius if Lowe pitches us to the World Series, and then promptly holds Nomar to three straight double play grounders.  The long and the short of it is that I still trust Theo enough that when he does something I don't agree with, I allow for the strong possibility that he knows something I don't.  I guess we'll see."

Unbelievably, Pokey Reese (.192) is off to better offensive start than A-Rod (.189, 0 for 4 last night, and, in a symbolically appropriate play, caught stealing). Okay, the offensive numbers are pretty comparable in this small sample, but at least Pokey gets to play shortstop.  And  how  .  Nevermind that Pokey's numbers are only mildly disappointing, whereas A-Rod's are decidedly not good enough.  All I can say is:  Suck it.

Even better is when you find the programs targeting you without having to watch commericials.  That's right,I am a PBS viewer: middlebrow, well-educated, and generally content with half-assed intellectual pursuits.  (Sure, we'll go to grad school for one discipline or another, but in most things, we are content with enough knowledge to get through a cocktail party of our peers.)   We privately delight in noting historical inaccuracies, grammatical mistakes and the many other intellectual failings of those around us.  We  urlLink hyphenate our last names , we eat biscotti, and  urlLink we give our kids stupid names .  Make no mistake:  I don't really want to be in this demographic and I do my best to rebel by doing drugs, listening to loud music, and making fun of my peers.  But damnit, if my viewing habits are any indicator, I'm doomed.  Because  urlLink Colonial House  is the best show on television.   The show is, of course, reality television, but at least it's what reality television should be rather than what it usually is.  It's easy to forget that such programming needn't appeal to our basest interests or outrage us to be entertaining.  I'm not going to pretend that Colonial House is more educational than it is.  This is the adult equivalent of  urlLink Where in the World is Carmen San Diego ; mildly informative, but, more to the point, able to capture that part of our imaginations that makes us want to learn even if it isn't teaching us very much.  But to be honest, after watching, I didn't revisit my college history books: I went to bed.  The real stroke of genius, I think, is the inclusion of 1) true to life religious-freaky baptists and 2)indentured servants.  No one is in ""character"" per se, but the show does a fantastic job of manipulating the circumstances to highlight certain behaviors and interactions.

It read ""Please remember to take off your shoes."" I noticed the hallway littered with pumps, sneakers, go-go boots, even some nice expensive shoes crafted in a similar manner as mine. I knocked on the door and stepped in. ""please take off your shoes,"" my host asked me, reiterating the post-it. ""we don't want to disturb our downstairs neighbors."" i looked at all the shoes in the hallway, and was going to respond ""well why have 50 people in your apartment getting drunk if you are concerned about your neighbors,"" but this host didn't know me very well, i knew the birthday girl, his roommate, and i wanted to be a good guest and respect his wishes. so, the shoes came off. after all, i reasoned,  urlLink how often do you really look at a man's shoes.   i heard about the ""uninviteds"" from the host, toward the end of the party. he had just spoken to three drunk men from ""the neighborhood,"" who tried to crash the party, easing their way into the foyer of the apartment, sniffing their noses high, like booze hounddogs. the host had nicely told them in his friendliest, most patronizing voice, ""sorry guys, the party's winding down."" then he abruptly closed the door on them. he told me this, and a girl with whom he was attending the university with said, ""well handled."" i may not be getting a master's degree, but i know this party host had neglected another principle from the bastion of knowledge we call society yet again. i rushed as fast as i could out of the apartment.   of course it was too late. our host ""handled"" the situation of three drunk strangers on his doorstep so ""well"" that they had made off with over 30 pairs of shoes, including my nice expensive pair. i spun off the bannister, hopping stairs, gaining velocity as i descended. perhaps because of my speed and momentum, i was in a state where saw everything laid out before me, including the next hour in the future. everything that was to happen i already knew to be. i knew i would burst out of the apartment building into the night, that there would shoes awaiting me, that most of the shoes would be abandoned, probably in an asinine place (surely, the middle of the street). i knew the bandits weren't bandits, they were  urlLink pranksters . and i knew as such the pranksters would return. it was only a matter of waiting. wearing only my left shoe that i found in the street, i waited, poking my head around in trash cans and hedges, hunting for my absconded shoe.   i had a lot of time to think about the party host, since i was alone down on the street with my right foot freezing due to the damp pavement, and he was upstairs ""hosting,"" a skill which already netted him 5 missing shoes (the rest were recovered by myself and my friends  urlLink Darrell and Gideon , both of whom were fiercely ready to rumble with this party host). but i saw all of this already. i knew we just had to wait. i thought about asking the party host to pay for my shoes, since justice left the responsibilty for their abduction on his shoulders as well as mine. i thought how, if i was the party host, i would offer. but this party host as i mentioned did not live in a world where shoes are stolen, or worn in the house, or make less noise than the 80s dance jams blaring out the stereo. i decided it's useless to argue with  urlLink someone  so entrenched in a world where you do not see what will be, your prayers are not answered, and you speak only to avoid the guile of others. we grew up differently, i said to myself, and i cannot blame anyone.    the pranksters did return, and we gave chase, but i had one shoe, and we knew they didn't have the shoes on them. they made off.   if this blog be the place for frustration, for rants, know that i currently wear one shoe and have a sore jaw from grinding my teeth so much. my shoe was found the following morning sleeping beneath a nearby car. of course, i've got to go there to pick it up."

All of the major projects I've had are now complete and I only have to deal with my daily 18-25 different things.  Plus the musician at Washington on the Blue line decided to play ""How Deep is Your Love"" today and had me smiling and singing on my way to work.  I went to bed last night at 8 (I didn't see the end of The Apprentice so if anyone did please fill me in), and we have Monday off cuz of President's Day.  GO PRESIDENTS!!!  I'm going to a party tonight at the  urlLink Darkroom  where an eclectic mix of downtempo, afrobeat, latin, electro, nu jazz, and house will be playing (yeah I got that from the website, but at least that's more clear than ""world music"" which I was going to say originally.)

YB0WDIM,female,23,"does anyone else have trouble sleeping or is it just me?  i used to sleep like the dead when i came home, but this time its just not happening. i lay awake and think.  i resorted to reading till i pass out, but sometimes that doesnt work when the book youre reading turns out to be hella good (if u havent read Angela's Ashes go do it now - great book). and a few nights i soooo just wanted to take some tylenol pm, but does my mom keep anything good like that in our house? nah all we had was regular tylenol.  im so tired lately but i cant sleep. it sux. my brain is going miles a minute while i lie there in complete stillness.  then i shove the pillow into my head and cover my face with the blanket in hopes that pretending im in a cacoon will somehow force me to drown out the thoughts in my head and just sleep.  u might think this works....it doesnt.    i think im gonna start running again.  i kno thatll help me sleep.  but try to convince your paranoid mother that running at night isnt a weird cult thing like the phat pants u wear sometimes that shes so sure someone else influenced u to wear.  cuz u cant do anything on your own mind u. no no. your the good kid.  the smart kid.  the pure kid.  not like those other kidz.  your smoking, yeah that was the cause of an ex-boyfriend.  the drug use a few years ago?  yeah that was cuz of the people you were hanging out with: bad crowd; wore the big pants and did the drugs, influenced your baby into becoming like them, frightened you are for her.  and now that shes legally able to drink, shes an alcoholic if she goes out one night a week on a regular basis - ONE night - and man, its not even that regular...ok well that just caused some stress to reveal itself. interesting. perhaps the reason i cant sleep is cuz im sleeping right above all of this stress - literally.  hmmm more things to chew on.  perhaps while i go running.  tho the great thing abt running is sometimes u dont have to think - your mind clears and all you feel is the solid pavement beneath your feet and the rhythmic sound of your breathing.  you fall into a motion that your body knows so well that your mind lets it take over.  you feel the wind on your neck and your muscles stretch and burn. the pain becomes numbing as you continue on, propelled by something you cant quite understand and dont want to, because if you do youll stop and then itll be over.  ok yeah, now i really wanna go running.  too bad im stuck in this 10x6 cubicle in the middle of nowhere, oh wait - this place is called work right?"

She did not come. She is not in her office. I am getting the feeling that she either does not have a 7am mtg, or she's just being mean. I want to go home. I haven't yet.   The scarier part was that I wasn't here alone tonight. We are pitching a new client this afternoon and there were about 20 of us who worked into the night, and about 15 of us who stayed here. This would explain the shower at work. ""Why would a company have a shower? Oh. Right.""   Man, I don't get paid enough for this...."

YB0WDIM,female,23,"I told my manager today that I'm leaving on the 25th (yes, it's a Thursday - I want a lil 3-day-vaca before I start my new job at  urlLink Performics ) and ironically I got an email today that says my job will be replaced by a computer program by the end of October.  So I guess it's best, tho I fell a bit bad that I won't be here till then cuz they will have to have someone else come in and they will only get to be here till then - unless they decide to give my replacement more responsibility, which I doubt.  They were too cheap to hire someone to do this work so I highly doubt they will make more work for whoever comes after me.  Anyway, kudos to me on the new job - KUDOS.  mmmm kudos....  So now I have only 9 days left here which is so weird cuz I've only worked at  urlLink CDW  since the 2nd.  Should you put a job that you've worked at for a little less than a month on your resume?

Plus, a one load machine costs $1.50, which isn't bad mind you, but the amazing 5-load machine costs $4 - that's a savings of $2, which is more than another load!!

YB0WDIM,female,23,"Where did summer go??  There's only 7 more weeks till I leave (to go to Boston, San Francisco, or to move in with Debs).  When the hell did that happen? Usually I start the summer off loving it, cuz there's no homework and I'm not running around all day trying to get everything done and get to meetings etc.  Then after working for about a month I start to miss school, I miss my friends, generally I start to feel a little school-sick.  Then comes the trudging through the next few weeks feeling incredibly tired and bored cuz home sucks and no one lives here anymore, all of my friends live at least 20 mins away, and I have no money cuz I've been paying off all of the credit card debt that I incurred over the school year.  Then comes Aug and you start to get everything ready for school and you count the days till you get to stop working and have time to hang out with your friends who now live 5 mins tops away from you.  This is the normal cycle.  This year the cycle has been disrupted and I seemed to have missed the weeks of trudging.  Granted, home has not been all merry this year but it doesn't seem so dead-ended.  I've had my share of freak outs too (as many of you can attest to) and the indecision is still there, but at least I have options now.  Options are good.  Summer is flying by and I feel as if I cannot slow it down.  It's a little scary, but at the same time I feel tons better about my situation than I have in a long time."

YB0WDIM,female,23,"I had an   awesome   weekend, much like  urlLink Rupal's  - and considering we were hanging out a lot this weekend it makes sense! =)  Friday was girl night with Ira which turned out diff than expected, but was still fun.  Saturday was full of  Rupalness  - I really will miss you  tons  roomie!!  The apt just won't be the same.  Then on Sunday I fought the worst hang over I've had in a long-ass time and did errands (got to return a movie late without a fee and had my groceries carried to my car by two good-looking black boys - I swear to god that race has a thing for indian chicks) , saw Fahrenheit 911 w/ Juliet who lives *right* by an  Edwardos  (score!) and ran over to my mom's place to visit with my brother.  Sad news in his life - his gf broke up with him last week.  Way not cool of her.  He loves her  so  much.  But at the same time I understand her position completely and am actually in a semi-related situation, but I think it took her a real long time to work up the nerve to do it.  As much as I'm sad that he's crushed, I'm a lil proud of her cuz I know how hard it was to do that in her case.   Conflicted feelings much??   You could def say that.  Lots o things conflicted lately - such is life tho, eh?    C'est la vie!       The working out thing is coming along nicely.  Figured out a good  routine : 30 mins elliptical machine warm-up, then weights (alternating upper and lower body), then abs (holy god they have this machine that almost makes me cry), and then 2+ miles of  running .  I'm trying to get that up to 3 by the end of the month, but I'm not sure if that'll happen just yet.  It takes almost 2 hours to do all that so I really don't want to be at the gym any longer than that.  I also started a blog abt my progress, and don't even think abt it - I'm not giving that URL to anyone.  It's mostly just so I can see what I've done etc.  I also decided that I'm not gonna keep track of stuff (meaning my weight) cuz it'll just end up getting out of hand.  I figure I'll reevaluate at the end of August and see what's happened.  The working out part is   way   easier than the eating healthy and low-cal, low-fat, low-taste part.  I'm trying right now, but I know that it won't last - I've already cheated a bunch of times.   Damn chocolate and it's hold on me!   Apparently ppl can already tell a difference from the working out - ppl meaning my mom (tho I bet Ruth could too cuz she always had an amazing knack for telling me when I gained and lost weight without me knowing it myself.) Then again that's my mom, she's also the one who will periodically stare at me and tell me that I look pretty today - I don't usually, but today I do - so whatever.  Her opinion sways with the tree leaves, but I'll be honest, it's really nice running again.  I've missed it more than I thought.  I dunno if I'll ever have the body I did in high school, but we'll see.  It'd be a nice goal to have, but it's too early for that yet."
YB0WDIM,female,23,"Today is the day before my last day at work....or so I thought.  They offered me a position to stay yesterday.  I really wasn't expecting this.  And when my boss made the offer, she apologized for the events that transposed on last Friday (If you don't know what happened, just ask) and told me not to pay attention to Cheryl.  I don't want to work here.  The work is boring and the people suck - exception: Scott.  I have an interview today for an administrative position in the marketing dept of CDW. Ooh someone pinch me I think I'm dreaming.  (sarcasm)  I didn't think I went to school for four years and got a degree to be a frickin secretary.  Christ.  But it'll be better than here if I get it, and I'll be around younger people (this is a huge plus - the average age of workers at Fujisawa is 35-40) but basically, I don't want that job either.  Yeah I know, I'm being picky.  Yeah, I know I can't really afford to be picky.  The CDW job (which btw really REALLY sucks cuz I was thinking of applying for a position in their sales dept that I'm qualified for, but now I'm interviewing for a administrative assistant position?! sorry, not so happy about that) was supposed to be a 5 min phone interview and then a real interview if they liked me, but they loved my resume that they got YESTERDAY and wanted to meet me asap.  Well duh, I'm a little over-qualified for the position dontcha think?  Anyway, money is money as of late, and I will not be keeping that job (if I get it) for the year I'm taking off from school.  The only thing that really sucks is that I wanted to work downtown and CDW is in Vernon Hills which is far from downtown (as well as my home).  I hate jobs.  And I found out last night that Paul is leaving to go back and live in Champaign.  WTF?!  1. Waaay jealous cuz I'd love to do that.  2.  How can you leave us here all alone?? (us namely Ruth and I, but still) and 3.  You just got here and you're already leaving.  *sniff sniff*  yeah, you should feel guilty.  The only semi-promising thing that I am excited about is this meeting that I have with a friend of a former boss who is gonna help me hit up jobs in pharmaceutical advertising agencies.  Granted, I don't want to do that either, but agency work is agency work and I'm basically groomed for pharm adv.  I would DEF, HANDS DOWN, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT rather be doing that downtown than working here or at CDW.  But for now, that's all I've got.  At least I'll have money coming in no matter what - that's the good thing about all of this I guess.  I can't wait for my mini-vacation to Purdue.  I miss you kids!!  I went to BandN last night to get some books to read when I'm there and spent over 80 bux - I love bookstores.  They have so many things that I want to read, they're just so dang expensive.  *sigh*  Now I must get to work.  Hopefully this will all end sooner than I expect."

I wonder when I'll finally outgrow this.  Cuz it has to be a phase.  I can't possibly be doing this when im 40, and yet there are ppl who I've worked with who have been near retirement and like that.  Damn.  (**realization that i wont grow out of it, that ill have to make the decision not to do it any longer**).  Well right now I'm not ready to be that mature.  Fuck it.  I want to piss someone off and I can so I will.  Fuck being the bigger person.  Screw the jerk-off.  And yet, I just stopped myself from doing something out of pure spite.

Thoughtful, sweet, and made me feel crummy cuz I lied about why I was leaving so early.  =(  They got me a Barnes and Noble girft card for 40 bux so I could buy a book on SF before I go to school and a book to read on the ""vacation"" that I'm taking with my family.  See? sweet.  dammit."
YB0WDIM,female,23,"I have been running nonstop at this job.  Granted that hasn't been the easiest thing to do, esp with my dang ear not working and hurting on a consistent basis, but I've done it.  Now I can finally take a lil breather and step back from it all.  This job rocks.  No, I mean it really, really rocks.  The place is amazing, I want all of you kidz to come down and visit me at work - the space is incredible.  There are TVs in the walls that play Simpsons every day and when there's a game on they play that - it's ubercool.  And my office is a HUGE plus - I never know how much I would like an office.  I mean, I know I hated cubes, but the alternative wasn't within my reach - ever - so I didn't even dream.  I want to give everyone an office.  But not mine.  I like mine. =)  I've made it through my first week at a top 5 worldwide agency and all I have to say is wow.  It's overwhelming and there is a ton, a TON, of work that I will be in charge of, but I'm really excited about it.  And the best part is that all that stuff I learned in school about advertising applies to my job and actually HELPS me do it better.  Insane huh?  My clients are Summer's Eve and Hillshire Farm.  I actually like working on SE more right now (probly cuz more is going on with them) but I've wowed my bosses a few times with my industry knowledge (yeah, I rock) - my director actually called my memory of an 5 yr old commercial ""amazing"".  Yeah, I rock.    The funny thing is that even though I left school I still have homework.  My director gave me a book on the industry that he wants me to read and to come to him with any questions I have on it and I have to read an agency orientation and brand review on SE before Monday so I can sit in on the conference call and actually have something relevant to contribute.  Working at a big agency is simultaneously thrilling and scary.  I still can't believe I got this job.  I feel like they are going to surprise me one day and tell me that my time here is over.  It's really an amazing opportunity and I feel like I'm being introduced into this little club of the agency world or something.  And even weirder is that they all think I'm smart - they've actually said that to my face.  It's really weird when something that you think you'd be really great at is finally put in front of you by people who think the same thing and are waiting for you to show your greatness.  My director keeps telling me that he knows I'll accomplish great things here - I'm 22!!!  It's great that he thinks that, but there is def a pressure factor that I'm not sure he realizes he's putting on me.  And I think I just set the record of using the word ""great"" in a paragraph.  Well, I have to get some more work done before I can leave tonight.  Hopefully I will see some of the Purdue folks later on tonite.    *big breath*    My life is just beginning."

I need to think up some skills on how to deal with people here - it's getting to be problematic, in the sense that I'm losing my sanity and that's a problem.   I just spent almost the entire day working on a statistical analysis for my manager and when I came to her to ask how detailed she wanted the graphs done, she looked at me and said: ""what else should you be working on?""  I just stared.  I had spent this whole morning trying to get the data ready for her to present at the 3pm new business meeting.  I had *thought* that was more impt than anything else I had going on, but apparently I was wrong.  She lectured me on how I had let my supervisor leave without reminding her that she had to give me an example of this POV that I'm supposed to do by the end of the week, and that I really need to be more ""on the ball"".  wtf.  No offense lady, but you ASKED me to help you get this done before the meeting and I had checked with my supervisor to see if it would be okay for me to help you instead of working on my other crap, and now it was all for nothing cuz you just basically yelled at me for not doing my other stuff.  I don't understand this.  It's so dang frustrating!!    I do not like the corporate world."

Then, Shawn went to Hardee's for food while I feed Nick and now we are all watching a movie...kind of. I am finishing on the computer, Shawn put a movie in but is in Nick's room talking to Nick. Nick had fallen asleep as soon as we left Pam & Daryl's house last night around 7:30-8 and slept until I gave him 4 ozs at 11 then got up for good at 3:30. I tried to get him to go back to bed but handed him off to Super Dad who stayed up with Nick and attempted everything in the book to get Nick back to bed.  This lasted 2 hours !~While I slept! So those two needed a nap more than I did. Most Sundays we all are running around trying to get this and that done all day, but today, we are staying in! Nick slept on his left side last night yet again.-But he napped on his right. I think that's ok because if he spends all his time on his left, we are going to have a left side problem then. Shawn and Nick did great yesterday! (While I was at work) Those two bond instantly and for the entire Saturday. Next Saturday the three of us are going to Charlie & Amanda's house."

We have our own room and within thirty minutes of our arrival, I had our room looking like ""our room."" I even have pictures up of Shawn, Nick & I and of just Nick, too.  Today Miranda(my cousin), Nick and I ran errands and went shopping. I had so much fun! Of course, Nick and I got outfits for summer which  I  desperately needed! We had a very busy day-time flew by. For dinner, Grandma Lu showed me how to make Biscuits and Sausage gravy. It is soooooooo good! This weekend I am going to make Shawn some.  I really missed Shawn today. A few times each day, an overwhelming feeling comes over me and I think there is no way I can do this-raise Nick Sunday evenings thru Thursday-without Shawn's support. I miss him so much. He is an amazing man and I am lucky to have him in my life. This time apart has really made me appreciate our relationship so in that way, distance was a good thing, but I'm ready for him to be done with his internship and home! Thank ""Gosh""( G'ma Jan, that's for you;) ) we have the weekends!  Falling asleep is hard without Shawn. At least I have Nick!  Nick is getting to be so smiley lately-I LOVE IT! This morning he was laying in his pack-and-play in the sun happy as can be. No matter what I said, he would kick out his legs and smile and laugh. It was awesome! He is so beautiful.

Nick played on my lap for an hour without fussing! He smiled, danced, and even sang! Nick Sings! He really likes looking at dogs and babies that look similar to him. It was sooooo much fun. Next Tuesday Keely and Nick and I are going back to hear Beatles music. This early afternoon Keely and I took Nick down to the lakewalk and there was a huge boat coming in. So, Keely and I walked fast and found a spot along the crowed pier. The boat blew its loud horn and I said something to Keely about I hope that doesn't hurt Nick's ears. The spot we found was not so conveniently located under the bridge so when the bridge answered the boat by whistling back, Nick cried. It was one of those scared out of his mind cries. The type that break my heart. But, it didn't last long...10 seconds maybe. I took him out of his stroller and held him as the boat went by.    Nick's weight update...19.5 pounds."

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"My boy is a scucher! He can scuch his way around while doing tummy*time. He still dosen't like tummy*time, but it is helping him and he is doing much better compared to 1 month ago. We've had a busy week. Today it's raining and the candles are lit and the house has cooled off and Nick is napping! When he wakes up, we have more errands to run. Nick has done a good job sleeping the last 2 or 3 nights. He has been going to sleep at 8:30-9:00 and up at 2:30 and again around 5:30 or 6:30. After that feeding, he goes back to sleep  again  until 7:30-8:00. Last night I could not sleep, so I just watched Nick sleep. He is so precious! I think he is the most beautiful baby in the whole wide world!!! I love his chubby, chubby hands! Nick  loves  to stand! His face lights up and he gets this huge grin that takes up almost his entire face!~his eyes crinkle, too! I love days like today. The only thing missing to make this day perfect is Shawn. But...he'll be home in 8.5 hours!"

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Today Nick sat upright in his crib all by himself!-I placed his hands onto the bars of his crib and he kept himself up long enough to take a picture! He did so many situps today-Poor Boy.  I am reading an amazing book called, The Five People You Meet In Heaven. I can hardly put it down, but I don't want to finish it yet because it is soooo good. I put Nick in our Baby Bjorn front carrier and walked around our apartment to get in some reading time this afternoon.  Nick's room is almost complete!!! We decided to put carpet in his room closer to fall because we don't need it yet. We will need carpet in our living room soon so Nick has more opportunities for tummy*time.-Even though he hates tummy*time with a passion. Shawn & I decided to go with a ""Finding Nemo"" fish theme. It looks great and Nick stared at all the pictures in his swing today for 45 minutes! I think he likes it, too.  Grandma Lu bought ""Christian"" Nick his first pair of carhart pants today! I can't wait to see Nick in them =) He is going to look adorable.  Only eight days until Shawn begins his internship in the cities. Nick & I are in search of some sort of play group."
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"My poor boy is still allergic   to   cow based formula. I was at my mom's yesterday & forgot Nick's soy formula, the only thing at my mom's was his old cow based formula. So, I gave him 4 oz's of that and it didn't turn out well. When we got home, he was very clingy and cried/fussed until he finally went to sleep. This last week, Nick has not been sleeping well at night. He has been getting up 3 or more times during the night and more crabby than usual once he gets up. Nick has been doing very well at tummy time! He also will turn towards you while you are talking and really look at you. He also has fits of laughter. Today I had him propped in bed and he started laughing so hard, and so did I! My favorite sound in the whole wide world is Nick's laughter.  I love him more and more everyday! Nick also  loves  to stand. And he is doing great at sitting. I am so proud of him. Shawn's coming home today!!! I can hardly wait. Only 2 more hours!!! It has been a  long  4 days without him ."
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"I loved being at work. It was so weird at first because my fingers knew what to do on the keyboard faster than my head knew what to do! I brought tons of pictures of Nick and showed everyone. There were a lot of babies there and I kept trying to guess how old they were according to Nick's size and  every  time I was wrong. Nick is  really really  big for his age. All the babies that were his size were at least 11-12 months old! I missed both Shawn & Nick like crazy, but it was good to be around people and to do work that I knew I could not screw up. Whenever I am taking care of Nick, I hardley ever know for sure what he wants or if I am doing things right. I am looking forward to him telling me & Shawn what is wrong or right or what he wants. I called G'ma Lu and before I dialed, I told Nick who we were calling. When the message beeped, I told Nick to talk to G'ma Lu...And he did! He cooed and talked for 40 seconds or so. Smart Boy! Last night Shawn, Nick & I went up to the Kallevigs for dinner on the grill. It was fun. We watched, Under the Tuscan Sun. I liked that movie. I want to go to Tuscany! Shawn and Nick hung out the whole evening, too. What a  super dad ! Today Shawn & Dave (future brother-in-law) are going shotting. I have no idea what Nick and I are going to do yet. Something fun!"

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Nick discovered his reflection in the mirror at G'ma Lu's house! He would flirt with the ""handsome baby"" in the mirror. It was so cute. G'ma Lu was laughing like crazy and having so much fun with Nick. I took KeKe to the Hacienda Del Sol-My favorite place to eat-while my mom and Billy went to his parents to visit. Keke ordered hot chocolate and beans! ;) Yep...Beans! That's it! Awesome combination Keely! We had a blast! This afternoon was beautiful. Nick and I walked down to the lakewalk and over to 21st and back up home. It felt good to work up a sweat!"

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Today during ""side-time"" Nick pulled a toy to his mouth. We also played a game...I put my face close to his and he would use his fist/hand to bring my face closer to his over and over again and he would smile. I also witnessed his 1st tear.-but it wasn't a sad tear, just an eye leak type of a tear. Nick also had tummy*time today and he did good for a little while and I just gave him pretend spanks when he cried and he would stop crying. He did tummy*time for a least 10 minutes. Nick absolutely hates tummy*time. I also worked on keeping his head to the left. He even took a short nap with his head to the left! I can't believe how much Nick is changing  every  day. I almost expect him to sit up and say, ""Hi Mom. Let's go for a walk!"" When he was taking a nap this evening, I looked down at him and his entire face is changing. I can easily visualize what he'll look like as a little boy. He is so beautiful. The hair on his head is starting to move downward more so he no longer has a mullet. ;) He is precious. Right now he is learning about shapes from his ""Baby Einstein"" video. Today has flown by! Shawn might be home earlier than expected tomorrow!!!!!!!!! I hope so!!!!!! I can't wait to see him!!!!!!!!!!!!! ***Nick's Latest NickNames*** ""Nickerdoddle"" ""My Minastroodle""  ""Nickernack"" of course...""Soybean"""
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"urlLink    Nick first CuP~aDvEnTuRe! Nick drank water from his very own brand new cup this evening and he gulped it right down. I thought it might be time to introduce his cup when he grabbed MY water glass and drank from it without spilling....Yes, You read me right...without spilling!!! He is awesome. Very Very early this morning I dropped Nick off at G'pa/ma Kal's house for the entire day while both Shawn and I worked. Nick had a great time, especially napping with G'pa Daryl on the floor. At 4:00ish Nick and I headed up to the Taylor/Johnsons....NOW the Johnson's for G'ma Lu's (Wu's) wedding to Billy. It rained but Nick liked it at first. He decided to talk right at the begining of the ceremony, so we had to move even farther back. I did get to see the very very end when Billy and G'ma Lu were pronounced Husband and Wife and they high fived instead of kissing. It was a great wedding! There was a lot of people there including a baby 3 wks older than Nick named, Alexandra. My mom looked absolutely beautiful in her hawaiian print shirt and shorts! She glowed! It's still raining and late last night I fixed my blog only to discover now it's broken AGAIN! Friday on the way back from the cities, Shawn got into a car accident...a bad car accident. He was being a careful driver staying 3 car lengths ahead of the other cars due to the stop and go traffic...all of a sudden the car ahead of Shawn slammed on their brakes. Because Shawn was 3 car lengths back, he was able to stop his truck before hitting the car ahead of him, BUT the car behind Shawn wasen't looking and slammed into Shawn sending him flying into the air and into a ditch. Shawn banged his head, but managed after filing a police report to drive all the way home. Dizzy. Tired. Sore. My Poor POOR husband. He is doing ok today. Right now he is actully sleeping. I can't imagine life without Shawn. There would be no life...it is inconsivible. He is the best husband & father. There is No One else like him. I am lucky.   urlLink"
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Yesterday, Shawn & I took Nick up to my mom's for Nick's 1st fire. He wore his brand new Carhart overalls. Nick looked sooooo hansom. My mom captured the cutest picture of Nick laughing. Austin (Nick's future uncle) tickled Nick's cheek and it made him smile so huge and even ""talk!!!"" Nick mostly slept during his 1st fire so he seemed to enjoy it. Shawn installed our carpet in the living room yesterday and it looks and feels like HOME! The carpet brightens up the place and draws you into the livingroom. Shawn did an amazing job =) Right now he & Nick are rocking on our rocking chair. Nick's eyes are rolling into the back of his head. They look precious together. I can't believe how much I am going to miss Shawn. He has been Super*Dad to Nick lately and the best husband. I LOVE having him home."

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"I have started teaching Nick sign language. He is learning milk (formula), full, more, & sleep. I read in a magazine that by 6 or 7 months, he will be able to sign back to me! I can't wait because it is so frustrating not knowing what he wants, like if he's hungry or too full...AHhhhhh!  Shawn & Nick are embarking on a shopping adventure right now. They are on their way to McDonalds for salads, and then to Target. This is Shawn's first time taking Nick out all by himself. GOOD LUCK SHAWN! Today, Nick & I visited Grandma Lu at the Police Station for a minute & Nick got lots of kisses!  -Grandma Lu works as an investigator for the Duluth Police Department.-"

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"I feel like I have been on a diet f o r e v e r! I am determined to lose this ""baby weight"" before school starts in August. I don't have too much to lose, but it is taking a long time. Nick and I have been walking like crazy! I do really well on my diet when Shawn is not here, but as soon as he gets home, something happens and I cheat. All will power is lost. Since this weekend we are going to Brooke's baby shower in the cities, I think I will be able to keep my will power up!  Nick and I had a pretty mundane Tuesday. Except for some fun for about 3 hours at G'ma Lu's house. Nick flirted so much with his grandma.  Miranda is babysitting Nick on Thursday so I can get a hair trim and highlts/low lts. YEA!!! I'm sure I'll be a nervous wreak with someone other than his grandparents watching him! I'm one of  those  mothers! Keely watched Nick a few weeks after he was born while my mom & I took a sauna less than 15 feet away and I gave her so many instructions!  Did you know that Leah can be spelled, Liya, and it's still pronounced the same as Leah...Keely told me that. I love ""Liya""-it seems exotic! I am excited for tomorrow...Target shopping!  Nick did not have a good night last night due to tummy problems from watermelon that  someone  slipped him...;) But he's all better now.  I am exhausted."

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Today was the most perfect Sunday! Shawn & I ate out for breakfast. Nick even ""ate"" out with us-he sucked on honeydew melon, cantaloupe and a dab of strawberry juice. After that we three went to Barnes and Noble then Pam & Daryl's house for some map help for Shawn in the cities. From there we dragged our tired, hot exhausted selves to the lakewalk. It has been the most beautiful day of the year so far!  Shawn's gone back to the cities =( But Nick and I went up to Grandma Lu's and picked up Keely for the night! At Grandma Lu's, Nick got ""five thousand"" kisses and I got a slice of incredible apple walnut pie that Billy's brother, Mark, made. Nick feel asleep in my arms on the deck and when we all went into the house, I noticed he had blood on the back of his head!!!!! A HUGE DROP!!!!He must have got a mosquito bite. He never even cried...My Brave Boy! ;)  It has been such a great weekend with Shawn home! I can't wait until Friday night!!! Only 5 more nights and 4 1/2 more days!!!"
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Nick tried rice cereal fo rthe 1st time last night. He has always been an incredibly greedy eater and both Shawn & I could not get the cereal down fast enough as the bottle goes down. So, Nick cried and fussed with each attempt. The good part is, whatever we got in,  stayed in ! He just wanted his bottle more. But, I am going to try it again through out today and tonight.  Dinner turned out great! I even did the cleaning up!"
