QWLJY8F,female,26,"Was lamenting slightly last night. Wanted to go to the circus but worried that I might be supporting the unethical treatments of animals. Was glad to find out from  urlLink Channel News Asia  that  “There will not be any wild animal acts this time following Singapore's ban on wild animal acts. Instead, the Moscow Circus has substituted its tigers in the magic act with dogs that play football.   Pups playing ball? A strong Russian man pulling a 10-tonne lorry with his teeth?  Rrrr…   I’d like to see  that   one!  If you are interested, here are the deets: Until August 13, 7.30pm Woodlands Square (beside Woodlands MRT station) $19-$55 from SISTIC."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"These are places that we did NOT go to last night. We planned, we executed ideas, but for one reason or the other, none happened.   Our evening began with Jelts and I at a Stella Artois event at Fort Canning green. For the Win a Date with a Celebrity contest. I think I gave Jelte his first journalistic interview experience while I stepped back to sidekick role of holding tape recorder. I wrote down some questions that i think were siginificant and then I got him to shoot them to the date winners and Melody Chen and Sivert Ong. The whole event was pretty lame, and the two 'stars' were lacklustre but hey, I am just a tape recorder holder ;o)  So, it was good. We had a couple of beers there, and later wines and champagne at Sandr'as. She invited us to celebrate her first pay check from Clinique.    Sandra 1st pay toast   urlLink      Tits out   urlLink      Tittie boy (Hooker)   urlLink     Didn't know what else to do in small tiny Singapore so Hooker and his mate James, the Ss and J&L decided to go to JB. Cabbed home to grab passports and toothbrush. But Hooker rang to say his passport was in his office.   So scrapped JB, wanted to go Velvet now (yes, right, in my JB clothes!!). Then I remember, Spencer is spinning tonight, Marx too. At HPL House. Jeng jeng, I so clever.   It was another Kinemat party. It's a 'private' event, like Alter Ego. Saw Haikel and Ash there. Belle - or Ayu - is looking good now that is pregnant again. She got this pink flowy top thing and fisherman's pants, scarf on her head, boogieing.   Aaargh! We also saw the MTV Golliwog who flashed his black cock into my face at Big John's house on his birthday! Shazam and Jelte got really excited and walked over to him by the wall, taunting him with such pleasantries as ‘we hear you have shown something to our girlfriend at big john’s house…’ (baby help I forgot exact dialogue). Anyway he walked away and I didn’t see him anymore. Though he is prolly in the toilet showing his ebony schlong to some cornered bird somewhere else…   More wirdness. Koreen (Adrienne) suddenly professed her love for my friendship, Cheryl Fox is quite tiny in person (she gave a me a cigarette - I am still not buying. I had like four cigarettes all Friday). And the girl from Sex in Lion City (see previous blog of similar title), Joanna Fullerton or 'my real name is Ciara' flirted with Shazam at the bar - she is EXACTLY like her Samantha Jones persona of that play! Touchy feely like she knows him. How dare she touch my friend's partner like that. Out of this world. I squeezed in between to grab my vodka redbull which Sandra took from me later anyway.   It was very small and dark and smoky smoky smoky! My tummy ached, I needed to poo (cigarette laxative effect?) I had a shit at Orchard Parade hotel next door in the gents while Jelte waited for me by the sink.   Back at Repercussion's black hole, Lyes waved to me at the lift landing. Looked like he is standing in a bright place. We walked over, and saw the inside oh Hard Rock's upper floor. It was cold and smoke-free (coz has no one there). I sat Jelts down (smoke got in his eyes so he needed to stay for a bit) and went to get the rest.   That was when I saw Ciara (Joanna?) flirt with Shazam, delaying my cocktail from reaching me. Anyway the posse joined in and Shazam and Hooker went to the unattended bar to re-enact a scene out of Cocktail, it appeared to me. I told them there is a camera there watching, above the curtain. So Hooker smuggled a bottle of Jim Beam into my Paul Frank bag. Yes, my friends.  They had enough and wanted to go back to Shazam’s. Jelts had to go home. Which was good coz they went to Lola and the next day when we are going to the circus, they were all unapproachable, hungover and unapproachable."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Returned to the office today after two days away. ‘Returned’ is hardly the right word for it. I was practically working still, but only from home. Haven’t been free till now, 3.30pm. I haven’t been 100% since Saturday. Now I’ve got this dull throbbing where I believe my cervix is. Damn PMS.   I am happier with the new intro for my weddings story. But I guess that’s taken too much toll on what’s left of my brains. I got no more ideas of what to write. I’ve turned into Jelte – copying and pasting mass jokes for my post this morning : )  Oh, met Loobz for lunch today. Funny, I forgot about lunch with my colleagues and I planned to meet him downstairs from my office. It just so happened my colleagues and him came down about the same time so we all had lunch together."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"We over-estimated our mortal selves when we believed that Jelte and Sandra could be at work at the normal time after going to bed at 5am Thursday morning. At 8:30, a short discussion in the hallway resulted in them taking half days. So we traipsed back to bed. Then at 11:30, only Jelte was going to work while Sandra decided to stay at home after all. I went back home to pack.   In two hours' time, Shazam was on the plane with Hooker and his friend, Simon, to Bangers. In about eight, Jelte and I got into the plane for the first time together, also going to Bangers. Sandra would join us the following day.  We arrived at 00:15hrs Friday morning. The cabby took us to the 'wrong' Evergreen Place so we had to take another cab. Already we were late as the bars now close at two. By the time we met Shazam at our hotel, he was already 180 degrees (again) (Hooker and his friend Simon had booked themselves elsewhere).   The guy who checked us in was illiterate and incompetent. I wanted to check that he got my booking right: one room tonight, two rooms tomorrow. But he kept dodging my queries, he kept confusing things about. He was playing games with my feelings.   I was very patient because you should never make a Thai an enemy (trust me, my first boyfriend is Thai and we are still not on good terms, according to him) but usually-mild-mannered Shazam threw his passport at him.   I hid my horror, I was sure that the guard standing near us would shoot us with his AK47 and together, they would cut up our bodies into little pieces and sell them on the streets as barbecued chicken. I quickly explained to Mr Stupid that our friend here is very tired and very drunk. That's why we need our correct rooms quickly so we can chain him up inside, away from civilisation.   After about 20 minutes, we managed to drop our stuff in our room - which was fantastic, btw. It was quite big and clean. Everything worked and there was a microwave oven, toaster, fridge, cutleries, glasses.  Our initial plan to hit the clubs were exchanged with a more manageable in-room drinks courtesy of the nearby 7-11. I offered Stupid some drinks which he politely refused. But at least now we all know that we are all friends, not foes.  Went back up to our suite and now that we are settled down, we flicked on the TV. We were surfing the channels when at one point, we saw Stupid at the front desk. It was a camera surveilling the entrance so guests would see who was coming through! No wonder he rejected our Heineys. And if they shot us, one of the guests in his room was bound to have seen it all happen.   So we didn't got out the first night in Bangkok. We finally went to bed at about 4am."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"I am - nope, make that, WE are - very unhappy with work. Not what I do - I love my job - but with someone in particular for making my life, and those around her, hell with a capital A!  Yes I know there is no A in Hell but it sounded nice.  At that time.  Anywyay I don't want to waste my time and yours bitching and moaning about this moaning bitch because I am going to put my big foot down and take the boss out for beers tomorrow so that we can solve the world's problems together.  For now, I will be doing more of *her* work so that we can all live in peace and harmony. Tonight, my babylove Jelts and me are going to watch I, Robot with Shazam, Sandra and Shazam's baby sister whose visiting from Sri Lanka.  Oh I donno if it's my period that is coming or whether it's because I stuffed myself with good food silly in Thailand but I have been chunky foor the past two days.   Time to do my workout with my baby tonight! Just us and Mr Pinky!  Aaaargh! I hate her  PS. Just received a pink pair of boy-leg panties with glittery heart in front. Sweet."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"We watched a shitty film just now. It is called The House of Flying Daggers and it's such a total piece of crap, I wish they allowed 'free list'ing so I could have very well used my free Golden Village tickets to buy the tickets for my friends and I instead of wasting good $34 (of Hooker's).  Even better, I should have bought a pirated VCD (ooooh! scandalous!), flick it on at home, and fall asleep on the sofa.  That'd have been much more enjoyable.  Zhang Ziyi is a nice piece of work but oh, the plot just kills me!  She belongs to a righteous tribe called the House of Flying Daggers who is against the wayward ways of the goverment. They tried putting a plot there - even a plot within a plot - by making her a blind girl who works in the whore house and who possesses exceptional gift in dancing.  A 'govt. official' got word that the daughter of the old leader of this govt-opposing is in this whore house so he went there to cause trouble so that she might get arrested by his people.  Anyways to cut a long boring sappy romantically-overloaded story short, she falls in love with her captor, and he, with her, and they try  to run away from all the bad people and she was hit by a - flying! - dagger of course where her heart is and then it snowed suddenly and then she died and then the two rivals in love fought and then the old lover almost killed the new lover and then she suddenly got up again from under the snow this time and tried to save her new lover from being killed by her old lover!  How annoying.  I am going to sleep now"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Have you ever gone through days (or a lifetime) being inexplicably stupid?   I feel like the perennial dumb blonde today (I had to check whether ‘perennial’ means what I want it to mean) (it does).   I feel like I don’t write well enuogh, I don’t sub (edit) well enough (I missed out a couple of fucking stupid typos) and once I had to striggle to come out with the answer of what 51 minus 4 is!  Look I even spelled ‘struggle’ ‘ striggle’.  Don’t laugh at me about being dumb – the joke’s only funny if it ain’t true.   What?   Aaaargh!!  I can’t write, can’t count, can’t organise my freaking birthday party.  I QUIT FROM BEING LIANA!!!!"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"So Sex in the Lion City (as it's correctly called) and the four-course dinner at Ristorante Teatro was um, so-so. I was invited to review the show. My colleague Shalu and her hubby Sean joined us.   The food. The breads came with delicous tangy salsa dip. We kept asking for fourths. The first starter, porcini mushroom soup served in a large plate was creamy & delicious, with shroomy bits floating about but was served at warm-ish temperature. The room was cold - we borrowed the staff jackets - so we had to scoop the soup up quickly before it turns to porcini ice cream.   The second starter was black pasta with seafood. That was rather pleasant for me as just before dinner, Eda was talking about black pasta which I have never eaten. Apparently it's made with squid ink. Mine was served with prawn, scallop and squid rings in familiar looking bread dip salsa-looking sauce.   I picked beef for my main as I had fish for lunch. My salmon lunch was served with rice and mayonnaise - harrowing! They should not serve rice with mayo. My medium beef was cooked right but it's a little too salty outside and the flavour contrast strakly with the rest of the beef. It was served on a bed of flattened spinach, fried tatoes and onions. Not bad but I didn't finish it. Shalu's a vegan and her main was vegetarian pasta in a sauce that looked and tasted like the salsa bread dip, like our black pasta seafood sauce. Maybe since we liked it so much, they put it in all our foods.  The ending was tiramisu which we suspect was made with fake cheese or a combination of mascarpone ad egg white or soemthing. It lends that plastic taste on your tongue rather than melt into your tastebuds. The espresso base was rather strong. I didn't order after dinner coffees.  We also had two bottle of wine. So the end bill was actually $400+ for uhm, mediocre food and service (staff was very helpful and polite but they do things like reach across your face, nitpick.. nitpick.. nitpick). Mine and Jelte's dinners were free but we had to pay for beverages. So, $80 for four-course italian dinner with theatre and wines on a Friday night... not bad.   Wait. I am suppsoed to review the show not the food! Ha ha... well, read it in  urlLink Expat magazine  August issue ;o)  After Teatro, we went to ATTICA. Very nice place at Clarke Quay. Met the usual party crowd from as long as the old Liquidroom time. Saw Boydie and crew there too. And Chicken Bob who was with Fox. NAturally my polite hellos at that last table was rather snappy.  We spent only the $50 note that Jelte had as our unofficial budget for last night.   Now, I must go. Going to pick up Shazam and Sandra to go to Sentosa for makan and cycling. Hooker is at work - HOOKER ARE YOU READING THIS - you'd better meet us for Dutch VS Czech later."
QWLJY8F,female,26,"It had been quite a ride, this turning-26 business. I give up giving a blow-by-blow account so here is the sum-up.   Last Weds, after Blue Cow after-work drinks, we went to Thumper at Goodwood Park Hotel. It was the grand launch with pretty serious booze going on. Sweet. Yvonne organised a bottle of champagne for me and I must have had 17 birthday songs that night, and 17 more after-midnight. People were coming to me from all directions to wish me well.   Shazam was indeed suitably impressed with my Levi’s jeans stunt. He came round with Sandra about ten minutes after we arrived. Came to me with large bags and then pointed his finger accusingly, saying ‘where did you get that from?’. It was funny that he later said ‘wow, I can’t believe you pulled that joke. I feel so loved’. Ha, ha. I don’t know that you are supposed to feel that people care about you when they pulled a stunt on you.   With me were of course the posse made up of the Double Ss, Hooker, Big John, Boydie and Jelts. Office people like Jason, Hiroko, Eda, Shalini and Maria. Mann turned up with his wife, Maria. People like Anwar (Today paper), Merlitz and Ciaran etc were also there. Beside our table was Rick Tan’s, a gay actor, and his gay and/ or actor friends. You can imagine the racket coming from our direction.   Went to Ink after that. Even Jason who doesn’t drink nor party and who was working the next day came along. Actually everyone had to work the next day and they all lasted the whole night with me (who had taken off). Vernetta (Lopez) stumbled in at one point and we discovered that we share the same birthday.   So of course the birthday cocktails came around. Let’s just say it wasn’t me who did a Merlion all over the table top, completely filling up two or three once-empty glasses with her own projectile… she was entirely good-humored though. Besides everyone else was also sideways; there was not one person who did not empathise with her.   We were dejected when the lights at Ink finally came back on, signalling the end of our debauchery. It was after-3, and we were having so much fun. I was happy that it ended on a high note. Shazam and Sandra invited Jelte and I to stay over so we did. We stayed up till 5am at his, having our last cans of Sapporos and we just talked.  It was a seriously successful birthday celebrations. I guess it was because I didn’t expect anything much apart from a night of drinks with people who are close to me. The best part is I know that all my friends had fun! Even my sweetheart, by some miracle, did not get sick even once. Can’t wait to go to Bangkok for the weekend tomorrow…"
QWLJY8F,female,26,"Going to bed at 7-something a.m. just makes you want to stay in bed forever.   So at 5.30pm, I woke up. Couldn't remain under the duvet like that - I've got spas to edit.   While Jelts spruced up the battleground of the previous debauchery, I drank milk and chain-smoked in front of the PC, working. At 8, we left for Shazam's. Met up the crew plus Sandra's sister, Celine, for the first time.   Dinner at Kiruya Dining was really good. I mean the food had always been so but where we sat, at this warehouse-looking smoking-enabled area, felt like we were somewhere else, not a shopping mall restaurant.   The plan was to boogie at INK after dinner but Jelts was feeling a little fragile. I didn't mind either way so I volunteered to take him home. As if I would have it any other way.  He's mine!  I get to take him back with me!  Finished Back to the Future 2 and I fell promptly asleep at  the beginning of number 3..."

How do you make a soap smell like sex?  I didn't chance it.  I skipped it and went on to pink lemonade.  I enjoyed the ""Joy"" candle as well.  I never knew what joy smelled like.  Unfortunately, they were out of the ""Teen Spirit"" candle.  I would have liked to have smelled that one.  Today I woke up early.  I did things around the house.  I had lunch with David.  I went to CompUSA to return the fire wire card that I did not actually need.  I came home and cleaned the bathrooms, vacuumed, swept, did laundry, etc.  I sat down to read on the couch with my favorite pillow, and old comforter and Buddy, the wonder cat.  It was nice.  I had candles lit and one of the many Buddha Bar CD's on.  Jeff went antiquing today and met Jay Baker, Jim & Tammy's son.  He has body piercings and tatoos and has a ministry in Little Five Points.  Jeff has always been very interested in him and I bought him Jay's book to take on his missionary trip to Honduras.  Jeff may go check out his ministry.  We went and had barbecue near the airport.  It was very tasty.  Jeff's best friend, also Jeff,  is in London, Ontario with his dad.  Mr. H is in the hospital trying to gain his strength back to renew chemotherapy.   Keep him in your prayers.   I had a dream once where an angel came to me and said that worry was like growing thick vines and weeds around us and prevents God's angels bringing our good to us.  He said that faith affirmation clear the way to God's light.  I hope that's true.  I remember that every time I start to worry."

BYPG6W9,male,36,"I LOVE ""COUPLING""!   Well, I love the BBC series. The British series is so funny. I don't understand why the American series is unfunny. On my way home from work, I used my Borders gift certificate that my sister, Vicki, sent me for my birthday and bought Series 2 of ""Coupling."" I watched the episode where Steve thought Susan's parents meant masturbation when they said whistling, but they really meant just whistling. It ranks up there with ""Lesbian Spank Inferno.""   Work went well today. Robert and I worked on our realtor packet. We are working on making connections with realtors to refer us business. It can be very slow in the beginning. Robert and I work so differently. He is like a house fly randomly flying from task to task. I tend to finish a task and move on to the next task depending on the urgency. I think I could accomplish much more quickly on my own, but Robert is much better with the sales pitch and talking to people. Then again, I don't want to be dependent upon him. I watched a sales training tape yesterday and have been applying the principles. We complement each other well.   Carol Lynn, my boss, is the only woman who has ever made me use the ""F"" word. She truly is fabulous! She is such a pleasure to work with and so inpsiring. She mentioned that she thought Robert and I should send out a weekly newsletter via e-mail and suggested an audio/visual e-mail that someone sent her. Perhaps my degree in Multimedia and Web design will now pay off. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!   I will now use the ""~"" because it tragically receives so little attention. Sigh....   I also went to the volunteer meeting for ""Out On Film"". It was sort of subdued. The head guy, Paul, spoke for a few minutes and then we signed up for a few shifts. I was hoping to meet some other people that are serious about film making that I could connect with and interest in turning one of my short scripts into a video or film. Perhaps it will happen in the future. The link to the Web site is  urlLink http://www.outonfilm.com/ . On the plus side, I saw the Robbie Williams video for ""Feel"" and ""Dancing Queen"" from Kylie's ""Impossible Princess"" tour.   Tonight, Jeff and I watched the very first episode of ""Coupling"" together. He laughed a lot and very hard. He likes Jane too. It made me happy. :)"
BYPG6W9,male,36,"ACT 1   I completed ACT I of the screenplay.  It's actually coming along nicely, but it's tiring to write more than ten or more pages in one sitting.  However, I think I write pretty quickly compared to most people I have talked to.    Tomorrow I'll try to do 15 pages with a break in the middle.  I'll do the same on Sunday.  That means I would be halfway through the screenplay by Sunday evening.  The characters are developing well.  It's always interesting to see what comes out of their mouths.  They aren't exactly following my written treatment faithfully, but the new directions seem to make more sense.  I'm going to trust them.    I've looked back and read over a couple of pages, but I try not to do this.  Instinctively, I begin judging what I wrote and the point is to finish the script, take a day off to decompress and then read the whole script and make revisions.  My concern is that some of the beautiful passages of dialouge I have written may need to be trimmed somewhat.  A screenplay is about action and some scenes may be too long.  I guess that's why we do rewrites.  I'm really enjoying myself and it's been a long time since I have felt this way about anything I was doing.  It feels good.  They are playing  Your Woman  by Whitetown on 88.5. I love that song.  It's too bad the whole album wasn't as good as that one song."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"GAY PILL   I wrote a story a few years ago about a lesbian couple and a gay couple who are friends.  One day, one of the lesbians states that the pharmaceutical company that she works for has come up with a pill that can chemically rewire you into being straight.  Because she is a valued employee, she can have four of these pills in  a test trial.  She asks the others if they would like a pill.  The older of the male couple wants children and agrees to take one of the pills.  ""What happens to me?"" Asks the other guy.  The elder of the lesbians takes one of the pills too.  She doesn't want to be discriminated against anymore.  A few months later, the older lesbian visits the younger lesbian.  She wants to make amends.  Changing her sexual orientation did not keep her from being discrimanted against.  They found other things about her to set her apart.  The younger lesbian kiss her goodbye and sends her on her way  The older man seeks out the younger man.  He is married to a woman now and his wife is pregnant.  He can't get the younger guy out of his mind.  He is very sexually attracted to his wife, but he still thinks like a gay man.  The younger guy explains that a pill may allow you to have sex with a woman now, but being gay, your personalitym they are all learned and developed.  A pill is not going to resolve that.  It can take your identity away.  The older man cries and crumbles as the younger man walks away."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"SUNDAY AM   I once made a cool mix tape of slow, soothing songs, which contained a lot of overdubs and synths.  I started out the tape, or perhaps I ended, with a cool song by Book Of Love entitled  Sunday AM .  It was written by Lauren and Ted about their memories of hanging out at the Sound Factory with Junior Vasquez until four in the morning.  The vocals are pretty sparse, but it's very ethereal.  Whenever I heard the track, it would always cause me to pause and literally go to another place.  I used to be very good at that.  I used to go places through out my day.  In the fourth grade, a teacher led excursion to the lunchroom was often being led by Imperial Stormtroopers to interrogation with Darth Vader.  ""The fools,"" I thought to myself.  ""Don't they know I can resist the mind probe.""  It helped me cope.  When did I lose that ability?  When did I grow up?  I'm beginning to feel that I tap into that again with my writing.  I used to sing along to records in the mirror as a kid.  It's a shame that I never manifested my lip sync talents into female impersonation, but I never felt so inclined.  I have an averstion to ripping duct tape off from between my legs, along with my genitalia.  I think we could all use a little more fantasy and mindless excursion in our lives."
BYPG6W9,male,36,"Another rainy day. Yuk! Good news is that Mom is doing well after her surgery. I’m hoping that they eventually give her solid foods or she might get cranky. I know I would. This morning as I’m trying to get Chris out of bed to go to work, he tells me that I’m being mean to him. However, he didn’t mention how nice I was to him the prior 3 times the alarm went off. I even scratched his back on the 3rd attempt to get him up. I’m a little hurt.  I was reading a story in the Offbeat News section of CNN.com about new protests against Naked Sushi night at a restaurant called Banzai in Seattle. A model wears nothing but a thong and a couple of strategically placed flower petals. Plastic wrap is then placed over her torso and then the sushi is placed on the plastic. This little event takes place once a month at the restaurant. I’m totally sure how I feel about this issue. The protestors argue that this degrades women and will promote violence against women. On the flip side, the restaurant and patrons alike claim that this is a work of art.  Seems that some children in Brooklyn found a US Army issued missile launcher in a trash can in their neighborhood. An adult took it away from them and dropped it off at a police station. Luckily, the thing was inoperable, but could you imagine?!?  Of course, were would we be without the shock of the day: millionaire Robert Durst was found not guilty of murdering 71-year-old Morris Black of Galveston, TX. He actually admitted to killing him, hacking his body up into pieces and then throwing them into Galveston Bay. He then fled from Texas and returned to move the head since he thought it could be used to identify the victim. After doing that, he winds up in Pennsylvania with $500 in his pocket but steals a $5 sandwich. Caught, extradited to Texas and the rest is history. The catch is that the jury was asked to find him guilty or not guilty of murder – and no lesser charge. The defense claims that Durst killed Black in self-defense. The jury agreed. They couldn’t really take into account the actions of Durst after Black was killed only that he died as a result of an accident and it was not intentional. Talk about shock and surprise! Even Durst couldn’t believe it! How often does someone kill someone else, admit to killing them & dismembering the body and get away with it? I mean, I can see how he got off on technicality and to be quite honest, I almost think it was brilliant of his lawyers to take that gamble, but it was just that – a big gamble that ended up paying off.  Oh! And I learned a new term: BIN (booger in nose)"

QID6QM3,female,14,"In the world of tech, I have reluctantly accepted my role as the person who comes into the conversation long after it's begun (though not after it's completely over and the others have already moved on to another topic), just as I've accepted my role as the mother who sits in the balcony at the 9:30 Club rather than down below with the cool, young people.  Of course, it's a matter of perspective.  In the context of my very traditional profession (law), where people are a little slow to embrace new technology (I still know lawyers who use dictaphones and expect their secretaries to take dictation), I can pose as someone who's right there on the blinding edge of innovation.  For instance, I can still impress many of my colleagues with my Treo 600, my usb jump drive the size of a lipstick, and my lime green iPod mini, all of which I'll write about here as if they weren't yesterday's news.  If we're going to talk about tech to non-geeks, there's a benefit to having someone on board who can test gadgets in a real-life setting, and report on whether they're truly idiot-proof.  When a techie shows me a cool gadget and dismisses my concerns about how to use it with a casual, ""It's easy,"" I take that with a huge grain of salt.  While I may not be the Amelia Bedelia of consumer technology (there's someone else we have in mind for that role), I'm probably fairly typical among female, non-tech professionals.

If I'm not dropping off kids, I'm picking them up, or making them pack-ups, or washing their clothes.     I treated my car to a rinse through the wash, she's sounding almost as poorly as me so I'm being uncharacteristically nice, before having a quick nap in the car wiating for the kids to stop snogging. Net result - I left work at 5.30 but never actually saw the inside of my lounge until after 10.30. Great for weight-loss! I always try to see the positive.     I can't even look forward to the weekend particularly - having booked us all on a day-trip to London. We have to catch the coach at 7am, which means a 6 o'clock start (!!) and won't get back home til 11ish. I hope St Swithin's on a career break!     On the plus side I've done 4 swears today, bought the girls on reception a big box of posh chocolate biccies in the hope that they'll keep passing them my way - it all helps toward the Send Jack To Spain For The Entire Month Of August campaign! And I've had some more emails and texts from Cute Suit - all unsolicited (no pun etc) - and my new office is now vacant and just waiting to be decorated and recarpeted for me.     There's a bit of a power struggle going on between my long-standing secretary and my new assistant as to who gets the seat closest to the Lord's right hand - or my side door as the case may be - I may have to interevene and decree that Jacquie gets it - from a practical point of view it would be convenient to have Lisa within hollering distance - but then Jacquie knows when my face says Do Not Disturb - Important Cute Suit on Line 1!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"My uber-efforts at work are paying off - down to my last large pile of files to work on - but it has more to do with the fact that the strain has finally taken it's toll on my secretary, who is currently nursing a nasty rash, enlarged glands, and a puffy face - I've told her to stay at home as long as it takes - I already have a propensity to all those traits and don't need any added assistance from my assistant.  It made me feel much better about skiving off at 6.30 to pick Jack up for the pre-season training pre-training meeting at the rugby club. I was dreading it, if truth be told - new coaches, likely to be much the same as the previous bunch, taken one too many punches in the scrum, unable to wear the trousers at home, and not clever enough to know what to do with a little bit of power -parents, some of them very vociferous and inarticulate, others just subversively grumbling between themselves, a couple just anxious to get as much cheap ale down their necks as possible, and me just sitting smilimg, staying schtum (apart from the odd bitchy comment which I knew few would understand, only the ones who are on my wavelength) and taking it all in.  I wasn't that disappointed - the Chief Coach could at least string a sentence together, but it was quite self-indulgent - I took notice of the bit about being fined 50p for being late - that'll put an end to my all-night chat sessions next weekend - Jack took absolutely no notice whatsoever of the bit about turning up in clean boots, suspect that'll be down to me still - and yes - the parents were already finding things to moan about. Their points might be valid - certainly in the case of the self-appointed fundraiser - don't know what it is about her but she rubs me up the wrong way - not that I'd want her to know,I can imagine she takes no prisoners in a fight - but give it a chance I say - season doesn't start 'til September (and if I keep losing weight at this rate, I'll be in a 12, and the only mum on the touchline in a mini skirt and crop-top, ditch those baggy jumpers, Cherrypie!) and the boys need to get fit, together and focussed on an enjoyable, competitive season of tough rugger. The boys are looking great - some of them a bit spotty, but they are growing so much - can't believe they were only 9 when I first met most of them - seems like last week - and now shaving!!!  I'll miss the first training session on sunday morning - party saturday - don't expect to have stopped partying by that time - but I am looking forward to meeting up with the parents again - they are mostly lovely people, sport-politics aside, and we do have a laugh on a day when I would otherwise be mouldering in bed.  Oh! and the other interesting thing that happened today? That cute solicitor - he dropped me an email on what I think was a very lame pretext of wanting to copy one of my drafts - we plagiarise all the time in our game, so he needn't have asked - and what's more, I'd only cribbed from his contract, but with the odd Cherrypie device, but it did earn me an offer of alcohol - just hope it comes with dinner!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Managed to leave work relatively early tonight - I call 18.15hr early these days - and I met my lovely pal, Sarah for a quick drink, catch up(need to keep up to speed with all the old office politics - not much doing since I left by all accounts) - and then to the salon for a demonstration of The Most Recent Cosmetic Technology!  My mobile went off just as we were walking to the venue - normally I wouldn't have answered it but it was one of my cuter, younger, more handsome clients who was calling me after 7 from home - had to be a date! Apparently not, I forgot to add he's also a friend - who sees me very much in the same role - he needed legal advice! Should have turned the bloody thing off the minute I left work!!Anyway we walked into this normally buzzing salon to find Hull's re-enactment of the Michael Jackson's Thriller video! God! These women were hideous to look at - and after I'd turned my phone off they were even worse to listen to! At least 2 of them had to have wigs on first inspection, closer scrutiny (it wasn't that interesting) would make you question whether someone would go to the trouble of adding obvious grey roots to a bouffant extravagant affair! Either she has a very long-term prognosis and needs wigs for every week of the month or she sees her hairdresser more often than her husband sees her - if you know what I mean!! Shudder!  Sarah and I deftly swerved out of being the model/guineau pig for the evening - that went to Evelyn - a very Game Bird about 70 who had skin to die for (well she almost had). It was interminable but we dutifully boked appointments for the next week and left with almost the entire contents of the Sample box in our handbags - let's see if it works!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I've done very well this week - only 1 really late night at work!  I haven't exactly been shirking my duties, at least I've been trying to devote some long-overdue time to some of my charitable activities - oh! and having a facial! Wow! Did I need it!?!  I was buffed and rubbed by Anna - delightful, wee thing with mad Bjorkish bunches - I decided against the hi-tech lifting doobrey! My looks may be fading but I'm not ready for that yet! I opted for the deep cleanse instead. It was heaven! I nearly jumped off the table when she started the shoulder massage! But after a minute or so, it was bliss - I particularly enjoyed the ear-rubbing thing she did - it only lasted a few seconds but my ears haven't been touched by human hands (I still controversially use cotton buds) for almost 5 years - you just don't realise what you are missing sometimes!  I've decided that I deserve a bit more pampering - that's rather a radical turn-of-thoughts for one who hasn't really felt worthy of self-attention, let alone that of others, for some considerable time - so I've booked another for next month - and I have absolutely no guilty feelings whatsoever, which again is refreshing.  The calming effect of the massage had beneficial side-effects in addition to that of my complexion - I went to work in a much better mood than I'd left it the night before! Snapping at my secretary over 25p really isn't how I like to run my ship! Well! Honestly! She could see I was up to my neck in it, trying to get everything ready for my 30-odd (some more odd than others) families that I had moving today, and all she could do was hover for 5 minutes to talk to me about a minor (25p) discrepancy on a Completion Statement! Can no-one else ever see the Bigger Picture? I was more concerned that my 3.8million pounds worth of property would move.  Eva has played a minor, potentially disastrous role in my week. I foolishly sent her 2 photos of diametrically opposed men who I've chatting to - both very charming in their own way - to see what she thought.I wrongly assumed, given that she works for a large corporate venture, that she would be reasonably computer literate and that my emails would remain private - and in a way they did - save that her replt that she ""preferred the lanky one!"" was sent not to me - but to the hunky rugby player! Fortunately, he has a fine sense of humour and a well-developed competitive streak - so she may have done me a favour in the long run - least I now have a potential new salsa partner - our lessons start in 3 weeks. Wonder how many pounds I'll lose by then?"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I'm really pleased I did as I was told for once and stayed away from the office all weekend. The piles of files were still here when I walked in this morning but they didn't look half so threatening and imposing as they had at the end of a very tiring week. I've whipped through them today, well that was once I'd seen 9 sets of clients, responded to about 50 emails and answered a constantly ringing phone. I had only managed to dictate 3.8 minutes-worth of work by 4.30pm, then I had to rapidly sign my post before getting my last clients of the day in to sign their contracts. They were a really young couple buying their first house - they were so excited - wonder whether I'll be acting for them in 2 or 3 years time when they are moving onto their next house, perhaps one with a bigger garden and nursery for the children? or going their seperate ways as more often seems to happen.  The rest from work has definitely done me good, but it nearly got me into deeper water than I had intended. After the experience with Hann the Mann last week I had firmly decided not to even think about meeting anyone else until I was feeling more confident, slimmer and had my roots done. Easy for most people, easy for me too I thought! But since when did I do anything easy! I forgot to factor in the effects of marinading myself in a few bottles of wine over the weekend, culminating in me suggesting to a witty young man from Derbyshire that we go on a mini-cruise to Holland for our first date! It seemed like such a great idea at the time! I've never been on the Hull ferry even though I see it everday on my way to work and he seemed such a nice young man.  Fortunately, he appears to be quite a sensible, mature gentleman, despite being a mere 30 years old (Gosh! Eva would be so proud), and recognized that perhaps I had allowed the wine to cloud my judgement so he didn't go straight to the P&O website and book a 2 for 1 as I had insisted he do! I think  perhaps it would be wiser to meet for a drink and chat first, before co-ordinating our holiday plans, just not sure when given the state of my diary over the next few weeks and my inability ot leave the office much before 8pm (it's 19.47 now technically I've finished work, not doing any more tonight - just taking advantage of the peace and quiet and lack of friendly msn interruptions!) At least this time he's seen what I look like, a further side-effect of the alcohol-consumption being my lack of inhibition in using my webcam (I stayed clothed, Eva! Even wine can't stop me being hopelessly shy about my body), and he's still wanting to talk to me which is a positive sign.  I'll have to go and see the Cheese Nazi tomorrow and let her scales decide the verdict - loss of 4lb or more I'll agree a date, anything less than that and he'll have to wait! (If you are reading this I have never lost more than 3 lbs in a week so far, so don't warm the car up!)"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"What is going on here? I made a fab posting last night but it doesn't appear to have saved at all. Oh well - I can't remember what it said so it can't have been that great.  I had a day off today. Quick smell these salts!! I know - it came as a surprise to me too - but I thrive on spontaneity in small doses and as I was in very real danger of over-sleeping, I decided to spend some quality time=money with my son. We went shopping!  5 hours and a dozen or so bags later and we headed home with my 6 months supply of scented candles, new nail polish, a silver poncho - just in case I had to resort to the silver dancing shoes to go with my lilac corset dress for the wedding - and 2 purportedly expensive coats for Jack that we had snapped up for £75!  I wasn't content with that - I just had to call into all the shops that I knew would still be open when we got back home - and what do you know?! I got the perfect silk mules for my outfit - for just £6!!!! Ecstatic or what! and I even picked up a shawl in just the right shade of lilac so now I will be able to attend the wedding comfy in the knowledge that my hideously unattractive gnat bites are covered.  I didn't stop there - I bought a telly too - just 15 minutes before the store shut - Craig, the incredibly cool manager, who clearly had far more important things to do and was way too important to bother with eye-contact - casually slipped my card through the thingy - and dismissively told me it was rejected - then patronisingly suggested that I might have given him an old one - Tosser!  I, for once, calmly accepted it was a mistake - I really didn't like the way he called me ""Miss"" - not something I ever have a problem with -but from a 24 year old bum-fluffed shop assistant who then proceeded to call me ""Love"" - ffs - I sped round to the Morrisons cash point - checked my balance - phew! still healthy - and happily parted with £150 in return for my new 21"" Nicam TV - teletext and everything - haven't had that before - I even bought a new hairdryer.  I would potentially have bought a Tumble Dryer and Fridge Freezer if Craig hadn't been a Wanker of The First Order. Mum has offered me her old F/F - bless her. What will I do to while away my nights if I don't have to chip ice off the inside door anymore? And I figure my new cleaner might be able to hang my clothes out so the T/D isn't a priority.  Lorraine left a message on the answerphone - looks like we might be going to see Madonna after all - just need to check out how expensive these flight tickets are going to be - and I am really starting to worry about the groaning sounds emitting from under my bonnet every time I turn the steering wheel - I can't turn the steroe any louder until my sinusitis has thoroughly cleared up."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"La la la! La la la! La la la! la la la! la la! England!! Wow! What a performance!  I watched it via my Yahoo! Sport online commentary and then listened to it in the car on the way home. I didn't dare watch it live, having turned on the match in the 98th minute on Sunday and given it the kiss of death! And my reticence was rewarded - perhaps tomorrow is a day to braoch the company car issue, given the good mood my Lovely New Boss will be in!  I've had invites to 2 posh parties today as well - one after the other - result! Just got the details for Jack's County Athletics meeting too - if he does well at this, he goes through to the All England Schools' Tournament - he's more interested in going to the Designer Outlet on the way home to buy some new rugby boots and deprive me of more cash - but I've agreed, what price future fame! Move over Jackie Stallone - Cheryl's entered the zone!  I can't get this horny feeling out of my head either - not eased by the fact that my favourite rugby player is back from holiday and emailing me again - and my Mister Sunday is being very attentive - Come on England!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I thought yesterday was bad! It was! But not a patch on today.  I broke myself imposed curfew of midnight on a school night and stayed chatting on the internet til a stupid hour this morning, having opened a bottle of wine, washed down with a glass of Port!  So, of course I was late dragging my sorry ass out of bed which put everything behind for the rest of the day. I've just spent the entire day chasing my own tail! Completions all went well - thankfully only sales so not too demanding - but all my exchanges have just collapsed in a heap! The most unlikely people have pulled out nothing more than a whim! Leaving one of my oldest friends and his wife in a right old mess! I'll go and see them at the weekend and take them a bottle of wine - little consolation for having potentially lost their dream home, but a sympathy token nonetheless.  I've just taken the traitorous hire car back and picked up my own - she looks so nice after a valet - but that's left me over £120 light of pocket after having had a couple of measly bulbs fixed to get her through her MOT.  Now I'm back in the office - it's bliss not to hear the phone ringing - and about to start on this morning's post mountain. By the time I'm done, I'll be ready for a shower and another bottle of wine - but then it is the weekend! Think I have another date on Sunday! This one is really handsome and just the right age - 37 - Geordie too so likely to sound nice. Best have an early night tomorrow - face pack, foot scrub, the works, maybe I could just get a body double! Yawn!!!   Right - to work!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"This could be a very long 2 weeks. When I said Victor was quiet, I hadn't bargained for just how uncommunicative he is - all he does is lay on his bed reading comics. Jack is really making an effort and trying to get him involved with things, suggesting games to play, films to watch, music to listen to, but Victor is having none of it.   Byron came over this morning - he's back from Spain for a few weeks - and has come to stay for the night - he and Jack optimistically set up the tent at the bottom of the garden and carried armfuls of blankets, duvets, pillows etc down there - Victor just lay on his bed - didn't show the slightest bit of interest. They've all walked over to the next village this afternoon to meet up with some of the others and attend the Summer Fayre. Victor has gone too, I hope he's not dreadfully unhappy or homesick.  I've had an even lazier day than normal. The housework is all done, all I had to do was push the Dyson around and put in the odd load of washing. I was so bored I found myself cleaning the cooker! I even took the heavily-baked-on rings off and scrubbed them til they were gleaming. I've toyed with the idea of cleaning the windows or doing the ironing, but I need to leave myself something exciting to do tomorrow after rugby-training.  I think I might go and bake some Nigella Snickerdoodles and Granny Boyd Biscuits now - the girls will be dead impressed with Jack's mum then - beautiful, clever, immaculate house and wholesome ability to bake and not worry about her enviable figure!! I need to get out the house - I'm becoming delusional! Quick! Tesco! Help me!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Debbie Harry is a Goddess! Ok - so she was backlit and had fans blowing her platinum retro hair, but there is no denying that she has It! and she can sing and move, one of the sexiest things I've witnessed - last year's Rugby World Cup aside.  In fact, I had the toppest of top nights - not only was the entertainment phenomenal, I had good company, good food and a new leather skirt which I picked up for pennies just when I thought I was going to have to go to the concert in my old jeans. Can a day get any better? I even came home to sexy text messages from an even sexier handsome tall guy. I had to have an early night - the excitement was too much - I was in bed by 2.30 am - alone and smiling.  This weekend has to have been one of the best I've had in years - Jack took part in his first ever athletics meeting yesterday - it was also my first encounter with athletics - could have done it at school if I'd bothered to ever take part in PE and drag myself out of the music practice rooms - but I didn't and I wouldn't have changed it for the world. But I'm so proud of Jack - he was the smallest of the competitors in his shotput event (and that's at 5'8""), representing his District - he came 3rd - and now represents the County at York next weekend - I am so proud!    I can't think this week will be half as eventful as the last has been, already Mr Monday has postponed - so I'm now preparing myself for the work schedule of a Junior Doctor - on the pay of a junior nurse ( by comparison) but I'm happy, a bit freckly from sitting in the sun ( I had to decamp to Rachel's garden 'cos my step father was too evident with his greenhouse to enjoy a proper sunbathe at home) and feeeeeeelllllllllin' pretty God Damn funky! Bring on Week Commencing Mon 14 June!"
0M69NG5,male,25,"so now that i have a moment, let me tell you about this past weekend.  as i said before, it was wonderful. Su and i spent all of the time up there together, holding each other, cuddling, and, after our first kiss friday night, kissing. and let me tell you, that first kiss was worth the wait. it was great. the cabin was great and we even got a few inches of snow fall saturday night, waking up to this:    urlLink      that's her gti. we talked a ton, worked out a lot of the specifics as to what we are as relationships go. seems that we are moving a lot faster than she has ever done before with a guy and that she gets anxious about commitment and labels and how friends and people in public view her in new relationships. she confessed that it takes her a long time to be comfortable in public with a new guy and to finally start using the 'boyfriend'/'girlfriend' labels but that she is a one guy type of gal which made me feel better about us not having a label yet. for perspective, she told me that of the guys she's dated, she didn't kiss them for the first time until almost a year or more had passed and with me things are falling into place a lot quicker than she's use to. she did say that once she does feel comfortable and the initial anxiety goes away that she's a very affectionate person in public and lavishes her beau with tons of attention. it just takes her time to get to that point. but when we're alone, she's more free to do what her heart wants without her brain getting in the way. i told her that its ok with me and that while i might possibly would want it another way, i'm can be more than content to do it her way because she means that much to me. she's was very happy that i was so understanding and went out of her way to show me. this weekend was blissful, waking up next to her both mornings was a wonderful feeling. falling asleep next to her at night, so comfortable. she told me she felt the same way. i really really like where this whole thing is going and can't wait for the next step. she's been on my mind all morning, i'm looking forward to the next time i get to see her. its not nearly soon enough."
0M69NG5,male,25,blah blah blah friday.  blah blah blah nothing to do. blah.
0M69NG5,male,25,well that was an easy day! 9:30-ish to 2:30-ish. might have stayed longer had i not gotten bored. going to go see  once upon a time in mexico  tonight with Sa. i'm thinking it'll be good. saw  matchstick men  while in pa. i really liked it. cage plays his character very well.  saw this for the first time last night:  urlLink happy tree friends . fucking hilarious! so much so that i bought the double dvd set. i am looking forward to their arrival. i suggest you check them out.
0M69NG5,male,25,"poker was a good time. i didn't win anything, but i sure as hell drank my $50 buy in's worth! in fact, i had to be picked up by Em who shaparoned me for the rest of the night.  sunday i installed a ton of parts onto the car, its getting close to being finished. the exhaust went on today. looks, sounds, and performs awesome! fixing a few fluid leaks tomorrow and awaiting a few more parts to arrive and the car will be done, engine wise.  my office is moving this upcoming week, i got to see it for the first time on tuesday. i finally have a window! on the second floor no less. i can see the mountain that surrounf the valley from it. i'm so excited!  i'm going to be extremely busy this week with work, the move, preparing for my thanksgiving trip up to the folks, and car stuff, but i'll try to drop in and give an update."
0M69NG5,male,25,"i'm going out to dinner with Am tonight. i don't know if i talked about this before and i'm too lazy to look, but her digital camera broke at a party awhile back and she was quite upset, mostly because she didn't have the money to replace it. i told her i would see what i could do to fix it. well i couldn't do a damn thing so i boxed it up and sent it off to olympus for repair. well, it arrived back today so i called Am up at work and told her that she should let me take her out to lunch. she wasn't able to make it out for lunch today so we decided on dinner. i hope she'll be pleasently pleased when she sees that her camera is back and working."
0M69NG5,male,25,"stupid me. i forgot to delete my archives from my blogspot host. i got a ton of hits on them last night. ugh. well, they are gone now. time for work."
0M69NG5,male,25,"car is fixed, but i'm still broke and life is still lonely. i miss my best friend."
0M69NG5,male,25,"day 2 with the fam is coming to an end. man am i beat and i haven't really done anything.  i did see lord of the rings - two towers today with dad.  good flick, hard to stay put for 3 hours but i will probably see it again while its in the theater.  my sinuses are acting up, head is very stuffy."
0M69NG5,male,25,"so i found out that my friend who i am interested in thinks i am trying too hard and that she might be getting a bit agitated. not exactly what i was looking to hear, especially after i had already ordered a valentine's day delivery to her work a few weeks ago. thankfully i was able to change it from something that shouts 'i fucking like you, damn it' to something a lit more mellow. i'm sure getting a dozen roses delivered to her work in front of all her co-workers would have put her in an uncomfortable position and probably made her mad at me. damn women. why are all the good ones taken, not interested, or living in other states?  other than all that, i had pretty good weekend. i helped a friend move into a new house, did that cruise through northern az with my vw friends, and i went to a party.  today, i am suppose to get my car back.  i'm very tired today."
0M69NG5,male,25,"well i made it. snowing here, i love it. fam is in good spirts. pillows on the bed suck, gonna get that fixed tonight. my car is a dirty bitch."

Had quite a sumptuous meal @ Thai 'Xpress... to summarise, it was a total relief!~!~!! ^_^ From all the assumingly ""hard work"" tt we haf put in over the semester.

So excited 'coz seldom take photo wif they all. Tink I muz haf been ""cravin'"" for a photo-takin' session for a long time alr. Keke!   Had sum beer, mainly Kilkenny & Hoegarten... Gosh!! They taste GREAT! Fantabulous I muz say!!!  Muz haf been losin' touch wif overseas brewery for a long time!! It's alwayz Tiger or Calsberg... Now finalli sumthin' different!! The live-band was excellent as well!! Tink it's the kinda of feelin' &  the company tt blended in so well to the atmosphere tt made mi so at ease. It wasn't the moz enjoyable party I haf (In fact, it's not even considered a party), but it was definitely one of the moz enjoyable! Mabbe they dun feel the same way, but at least I do...

No choice, Vonny wanted to leave earlier... n Ken was gg to join his friendz @ ChiJimes. Could realli see tt Ken couldn't bear to part wif us... He's gg to Taiwan on 20th.... followin' tt, he would be returnin' to the States. So sad. T.T He has been such a worthy pal... whether it's project or social life. Pple say unlike poles attract; I tink otherwise. 'Coz the 2 of us haf a common interest in drinkin'!!! H33!! n moz of the time, tt was our common topic too!! Partyin', clubbin', drinkin'!! Hopefulli, we'll haf a chance to meet up for more booze b4 he leaves... Keke!  Btw, comment by Vonny: I'm beri 自恋. I rebutted in sayin' tt's nth wrong wif lovin' oneself more than others. Erhmmm.... I guess she's rite. I realli love myself more than anyone else in this ""compassionate"" world. Mabbe 'coz I  dun wanna see myself hurt? Or perhaps, I juz wanna be in my best in order to please the world. Probably, both.

Then one Indian female sercurity personnel ""kindly reminded"" us to wait elsewhere 'coz the car was obstructin' the ""heavy traffic"" which consisted of onli (Look... it's ONLI!!!) the NUS shuttle buses which arrived @ 6min interval. Well, not much of a choice, we had to drive to the basement carpark then back again. However, Ken K was still takin' his own sweet time (probably... keke), so we were ""advised"" by the Indian again. Gosh, We muz haf repeated the cycle 2-3 times b4 Ken K finalli showed up.  Sumhow, if onli we could stop these Indians by pressin' the red button... BwahahahaX! I'm such a racist!! Keke!!

GGCUFSP,male,24,"A tYPiCaL DaY @ RoaDsHoW      I know I know, it has been centuries since I last blogged - and it's for an extremely logical reason. I've been busy wif my work. Makes sense?     Juz to illustrate my typical day @ roadshows. In case anyone of u is not interested, u can close the window and log on to other porno websites as u deem fit. I'm gg to carry on anyhow. Hee!    Well, u can say tt my target market is generally young, single workin' women as well as skolin' gers. Of coz I'm referrin' to those poly and undergrads instead of penniless xiao mei mei lah!!     Not tt I'm horny or anytin', but it seems tt this is the way thingz go in our line. We will usually approach prospect of the opposite gender so tt it will be easily to kick the conversation off. Sounds ridiculous? Ok. Imagine u are a man. Would u prefer a lady to approach u or otherwise? The answer is obvious.     Anyway, back to the pt. Upon contact of a possible prey, I would dash out b4 anyone else to stop the prospect. All thanx to my athletic genes. lolX!     WiNg: “Miss, can help mi do a survey? One minute onli lah… please??!?”     Prospect: “Sorry, I'm in a hurry.”     WiNg: “U in a hurry to go where? I go wif u lah! Dun walk so fast leh. I onli need one minute.”     Prospect: “Dun want lah. No time.”     WiNg: “I know u haf no time. But I onli need one minute mah. By the way, wat's ur age har?”     Prospect: “20 lah!”     WiNg: “Bingo!! That's the age I'm lookin' for loh. Help mi lah. The rest of the pple here all auntie. Onli u are eligible for the survey. Okok??”     Then I would pester the person till she couldn't resist the temptation of tokin' to mi. And I know she's already fallen into my trap. Hee!! I would take down her particulars and @ the same time start to build rapport wif her.     WiNg: “Still studyin' ah? Where?”     Prospect: “NUS loh. Arts fac.”     WiNg: “Oh!! Last time I oso from NUS. But it's BizAd. But I always go Arts fac canteen eat one. The food is good and the gers there oso beri sweet lookin' one wor.”   Upon hearin' this, the prospect would haf been flattered till cloud nine. Of coz, this differs from person to person. I juz haf to play by ear to respond to different pple. Once the rapport has been established, I would get to my main motive.     WiNg: ""Aiyah.! See lah. We get along so well tt I forget my purpose here. ""     This is of coz not true.     Subsequently I would begin to survey the prospect. More often than not, I would inject humor into the conversation. Not tt hard though, juz haf to follow my instinct. Keke!     Anyway, end of the day, once a solid foundation has been established, u are almost there. Apparently a good knowledge of the products is essential, however wat really matters most is ur soft skills. This is wat I'm tryin' to develop.     Yah… faced numerous rejections already, but I won't let them dampen my spirit. Easy for mi to say, but seriously, my morale is quite low now. Coz I closed many, but some of them cancel the policies b4 they could even take effect. Tink I still haf to pull up my socks now. SiGhZ.     Hmm… depressin' stuff aside. Now let's tok about sum lame excuses pple give for refusin' to do the surveys.     Prospect: “Dun want lah. No time.”     And she continued to stroll. Didn't sum bitch juz mention tt she's got no time? Duh!!     Prospect: “No need lah.”     I mean for a fact tt I know tt she did not need. But I need!!! Otherwise the role would haf been reversed. Bimbo!!     Prospect: “I'm meetin' my frenz. Late already. Sorry.”     WiNg: “Wat time?”     Then she would frantically tink of a suitable time juz to get off the hook. Some would even look at their hands even though they did not wear any watches. So comical! HahaX.     A few of them are even more extreme. Upon detectin' surveyors in the vicinity, they would make a detour to I-haf-no-idea-where. I haf even witnessed one of them went crashin' into a pillar!! bWahahaX!! Serves them right!!     As a responsible citizen of Singapore, Sumtimes I might warn them, “Miss dun walk so fast hor, later fall down not nice. I'm not gg to ask u anyway.”     Keke!! This would almost certainly slow their pace down,humiliate and make them embarrassed of wat they've done.     I'm sure moz of u out there muz be guilty of any one of these acts rite? Dun pretend pretend hor. If u really dun wanna do the survey, no one will force u to do!! Simply smile and say “I'm sorry, no thanx.” Izzit too hard to ask of u?? U guyz ought to do sum soul-searchin'. Keke!!     On the other spectrum, kind souls still exist. These are the pple who really make ur day and even if they walk away wifout takin' up any policy, I would still appreciate their attention.     The bottom-line is, while many pple are skeptical of financial plannin' products (in fact, most would pass it off as insurance. No big deal.), there is a profound knowledge embedded. Financial plannin' is no longer  used exclusively for protection purposes (aka insurance) onli. It can be used as an investment vehicle as well as aid u in ur savin'. Everyone needs financial plannin' and it's always better to start young. All of us know; few practise.     I remember when I was abt to graduate, I told myself (& sum other pple whom I can't seem to recall who... stm striles again.. Hee!) tt I'm gg to do a financial review once I found a job. I've already had an agent in mind and she is none other than Meiqing!!    As fate dictates, I became her colleague. Not @ all coincidental cosiderin' the fact tt I went to her (now oso mine) agency 2 yrs back. I guess whatever tt is destined would become reality. There's no escape. It's juz a matter of time. Soundz scary man.     Does it appear as if I'm tryin' to offer my svc here?? Dun try to speculate any longer lah. I AM!! But dun come to mi 'coz u wanna support mi. I dun need monetary support. Approach mi if u feel tt u need to do sum plannin' for ur future (which means all u pple out there) and u trust tt I will handle it professionally & diligently.     In the meantime, thanx to all who haf showed mi moral support when u were informed tt I've decided to pursue this career. I won't name who. U know who u r. Thanx lotZ!!!  MuackZ !!!"

BUCZX21,female,25,"""Sa inyo ang___; akin ang Tundo!""          One does not easily forget the uniqueness of tondo, a singularity of features that begins to reveal itself with the early morning mass at the Santo Nino Church where parishioners would later be seen joining the eager buyers of  kakanin  and  salabat sold  by peddlers at the church patio, and of course, mornings are not complete without the  magtataho  who occupies his permanent post at the steps of Plaza Hernandez wearing his unmistakable  gora , his shouts of  taho! taho!  are welcomed by children attending the adjacent Catholic school or by early morning  parokyanos  who await the opening of shops at nearby Divisoria where I have spent countless shopping sprees with my grandmother who, by the way, used to tell me stories to keep me from going out in the afternoon and head towards Plaza Moriones to watch the  ati-atihan  groups beat their drums, wave their arms in unison and parade around the plaza--a spectacle which children of my age would never want to miss as we marched along with them, danced in tribal fashion and screamed to our hearts' content--to brandish their pride the way residents of Tondo are wont to do: shame is a stranger to them, to us, as we stride along pot-holed streets where  tambays  who offer gin to passersby is a usual sight; those who dwell in makeshift houses take pride in a community where a sense of belonging is wealth enough--strongly felt especially when somebody, perhaps a tired resident  jeepney  driver, passes by one of these houses and smells the irresistible aroma of  daing na bangus  being fried for dinner, he smiles at the thought that he is coming home where meager living is never an absolute cause for despair; he takes pride in his children who would grow witnessing the multi-faceted life of Tondo, however poor such life can be, the stories of its people, including those mouthed by generation after generation of resident  tsismosas , will never be placed merely in the far-end recesses of the mind.       ***       That was a  one sentence  description of Tondo, a writing assignment from a Sociology of Literature class in college. Our prof, now National Artist for Lit F. Sionil Jose, wanted us to write about our hometowns--a one sentence description of it, on a whole sheet of paper. So what makes a sentence? The period. As in this: .       One of  urlLink Ayen's  entries reminded me of my classes with Sir Frankie. We were at first enamored by the thought that a categoricaly popular Filipino writer would be our professor. Of course,  all  our professors were writers. Sir Frankie was different though: we didn't like his works, much less read them.       But of course, the beer guzzling, hobnobbing, and a December tour of the Ilocos province with him and the whole class in a cramped coaster changed a few things. It didn't matter anymore if we thought  Viajero  was meant to travel on its own and never come back. Knowing the man was somehow enough."

BUCZX21,female,25,"from the mouth of my babe   he said what i need is diligence. my laziness,according to him, is detrimental to any literary visions i have of myself. i just have to write, write,write, he said. if that's the way i want to live my life, i might as well die writing. and to do so, i must get on with it.  come to think of it, this has always been my problem. i have always been a butterfly when it comes to projects. i work hard,set my heart on things, get my heart broken and move on. as with my life, my relationships,my dreams and fears, i flutter, fly, thrive on whatever's good (even the bad) and move on. and so, i look for more.   i envy  urlLink naya . first, because i really like and admire her poetry. her metaphors range from the most common to the amazingly profound. her language mesmerizes me,too. i know for certain that when i read a poem of hers without her by-line, i would recognize that voice, resonating on the page,reaching my mind. and second, just like her, i wish i were teaching again.   i am writing this with a sigh.   and of course, there's  urlLink ian  whose works i would always read for sheer pleasure and to simply marvel at his craft. his fiction is comforting no matter what his subject is. there is,in his words, a quiet spectacle that unfolds before my eyes but it is always something calm and fluid that i allow myself to flow along his plots, his characters, his images. i specially love ian's stories on afternoons when my own despair to create swallows me whole like a dragon's open mouth...  then there's  urlLink pam . this girl simply amazes me.   and  urlLink dinah ? this woman has the most beautiful words and an equally beautiful mind.  there are other things to do and enjoy aside from writing. i love, i am loved, i laugh at myself, cry,weep, eat anything, hug people---there  are  a million other beautiful things i could make myself do.   but writing eludes me. and i was born to chase anything that runs away from me. chase it, grip its neck, shake it and when everything's done and still nothing else happens, i let it go.  i know when to admit defeat."

Mickey Mouse Celebrates 75th Birthday VOA News 18 Nov 2003, 21:50 UTC      Mickey Mouse turns 75-years-old Tuesday, and is still a beloved international celebrity, though he speaks in a squeaky voice, has basketball-sized ears and started life as a rat.  Mickey Mouse began his film life on November 18, 1928, appearing in Steamboat Willie, the first animated cartoon to synchronize music and sound effects.   Originally dubbed Mortimer Mouse by creator Walt Disney, the plucky rodent became an overnight sensation, starring in more than 100 films.   His popularity soared in the 1950s with the televised Mickey Mouse Club and the opening of Disneyland, in Anaheim, California.   Walt Disney called Mickey Mouse ""the little mouse that started it all,"" crediting him with helping to launch Disney's multibillion dollar entertainment complex.   Mickey Mouse's long-time companion, Minnie Mouse, could not be reached for comment.    ------------------------------   mickey, mickey, mickey   i have a sizeable collection of mickey mouse stuff: shirts, watches,pens and pencils, slippers, pillow cases... what can i say, i love the rodent. and we're both Scorpio."

Me : armspowlkks izh kowpolkmorstern * im hungry and I don’t wanna talk *  Sam : sips her yogurt shake and rolls her eyes  Nina was craving for intelligent talk but Sam and I were too hungry to feed her with pieces of our minds.  I had to sweet-talk to my bladder all the way from QC to Intramuros. When we finally got to Starbucks, all the gallons of pee I was holding off had somehow given me vicious abdominal cramps. I would have gladly traded that pain for a root canal on a good tooth.  Dr. Sam made me pop two paracetamols and with the flick of Nina’s wand, I was enjoying my tall cup of hot cocoa.   Nina’s mauve cellophane-wrapped box of questions:   Nina : Are you ready to go?  Sam : as in die?  Tintin : (not realizing it was supposed to be a philosophical query) uh, can I finish my chocolate first please?  Sam laughs and wipes tears off the corner of her chinks.   Nina : noooooooo.

Those two might kill me with a nail clipper (as per my idea of a revengeful murder) so let me just say last evening was great: conversations that made heads turn to our table, two mosquito bites on my left arm, a missed episode of SATC, and two goodnight kisses. ok, ok.

VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I just got through reading my friend  urlLink ANDY""S  blog and it inspired me to come and do the same. My friend has hit upon a nerve in my conscience. You must read. Andy that's some deep shit my brotha. Not many people have felt inclined to share the secret drive time story. To some people this is a sacred and lonesome ritual. I have this very same train of activity. I go about driving my run-down 93  urlLink  Oldsmobile Achivea  to the depths of the gas gauge. When I'm driving my car around this fair city, I find myself at peace. A rare occasion because usually I am ridden with compulsive worrying in my tender age of 21. This is the only time I feel like me. It may sound weird to some, but to those who have been enraptured by the beauties of  usually occupied roads, but at this hour empty ,desolate, barren streets, the road is a safe haven for the broken hearted , the lonely, and yes the righteous. The fuselage of your automobile becomes everything to you. Your mother ,father , lover, and your mistress. All you have in the world is the two cd's you brought on your journey into the unknown. The street lights leave lasting impressions on your eyes, the stray dog you slow down to avoid, the way your usually shitty car stereo sounds in the empty night air. All of these senses and emotions make for one ride you could not explain in a million years. Its better than any roller coaster you have ever been on. Time has  lost all meaning in this ride into oblivion, a mere two, three hours have gone past you and you feel as if you just left home. The place where nothing makes since. The place you cringe to return to, you want to stay out , you want to stay were things make sense. Green means go and red means stop...................simple. The night air moving past your face with suave and grace. You think to your self if gas and money were had meaning at all, I would drive forever never to return. But as the saying goes...""all good things must come to an end"", either the movie ended, the song is over , or your out of gas there is always a time to return home. Not just from your drive to know where, but in everything, love, books, driving, walking ................life. There's always time to go home."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Listening to some  urlLink AM/FM  and I'm feeling good. Last night I popped some crazy allergy pills and I started to trip out and I thought I was on my way out of this life, but all I needed was some long deserved R&R. Today was my first day off since I started working and I wish I was at work right now, I've been bitten by the money bug and I need/want more, is wanting as much money as possible wrong? I personally don't think it is, money is the root of all evil but it's also the root of all things heavenly. As of right now I'm feeling heavenly, I have a pocket full 'o' cash, the crew has made plans to partake in Mexican festivities and the weather is chilly and the sky is gray. My room smells of death due to the ritual waterbed explosion and my wall to wall lime green shag rug is soaked to the core with moldy, dank water. According to the  urlLink Violence  Bubba has made a triumphant return to the world of blogging and if I must say so myself I'm glad to have the guy back, hopefully we'll get more from him before he returns in to his self-inflicted exile. Just the other night I was going over my life as if it were a small movie of the sort and I decided that my life wasn't that bad, rockin even. I have good freinds, money , family that only mildly pisses me off and I'm alive so what could be better than that? Well of course it's missing a few important objects but that will come in time right? As the masses say everyone gets their one chance at everything, and hopefully I haven't missed mine."

It was the empirial march, you know the song thats always playing in ""Star Wars"" when Darth Vadar is amidst the solar system. Well it turns out that a marching band decided to go on a crusade and bring music to the unfortunate people of my block. I look out my window and right in the middle of the street a miniture parade is going on. Chaulk full of everything that consists of what might be considered a good parade. Cheerleaders, band players, flag tossers, and the all to famous mascot suit, which in this case was a screaming eagle. I swear to god this was the slowest moving parade in all of history, they were in front of my house for three songs, we all know that the emperial march isn't a short peice of work. Finally they went by but the beauty of marching bands is that you can still hear them 10 miles away, I really don't know why I didn't hear them comming but I sure did hear them leaving and comming to every block after that. So as you might have guessed I didn't go back to sleep, I'm currently running on about 25-30 minutes of sleep. So right now I hate everything and everyone.   Theres just 5 words to say as you go down down down .................................... YOUR GONNA BURN IN HELL!                                                                                                                                                          Twisted Sister"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"What can I say about last night, not only did I witness the greatest show ever but I was also having a damn dandy day. I was feeling extra cheer and feeling that life was good, the show just put a period at the end of the night and a damn good ending it was.  urlLink Trail Of Dead  showed everyone how to do it and why. The night was just chaulk full of great bands, Orson Wells, Siva, Universal Recovered, and you will know us by the trail of dead. Orson Wells just happened to rock my socks but the band thought different, the pressure of playing for such special show got to their minds and the freaked but all in all they were rockin'. Siva and Universal ripped it up as per usual and I was in indie heaven, a night full of black rimmed glasses was no match for my mood. As for Trail of Dead I really don't think I have to elaborate but I must! Myself and the entire crowd knew what was in store for us and we still got more, so much more. It seemed as the show went on the Trail just started rockin' harder and faster every song, more shaking and more hunched over guitar playing. My ears were seconds away from bleeding with furious passion and the room was bending at the raw power emitting from the amps. Aside from the tall guy standing in front and in back of me with his damn digital camer, letting the damn strap "" grace"" my hair and me freaking out everytime because it felt like a bug or some critter lounging on my domepeice. If blowing the shirts of our backs with their crunchy rock wasn't enough, the band decided it was a good idea to destroy about 75 guitars and a window toboot. The drum kit took a beating as well, watching the guitar tech run outside to throw the snare back in the window was worth my 6 bucks alone. After all the mayhem stopped the stage was left in a musical graveyard state, and the crowd snapped out of the music induced trance and parted ways with the Trail and will tell tall tales of that night for years. I myself left the scene with pockets full of Trail 'o' Dead merch and I was a happy boy. After the show I took that long journey home and partook in some leaf with Nick, partook in some late night comedy that we were generating on our own. For the record my left ear still isn't 100% and I'm starting to freakout, but if I do go deaf it would have been worth it."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Damn it seems as if the boys over at  urlLink the violence  have been busy, I didn't expect to hear from them in awhile seeing how school has started, and they are in a great town living it up. Well it's good to see them keeping to the posting policy, maybe I'll take que and resume the position I once denied (what movie is that from?). Well these past few weeks have been a little strange and alot of good things have been happening; my pops finally got his job back and he's getting paid a hefty amount more than before so that means, oh wait he never gave me money anyway. My cousin has finally decided to stop being a thug and she has decided to join the army, that wouldn't have been my choice for a career but I'm glad she has decided to do something with her life. For awhile I was getting a little worried about her she's had some rough times and she's seen alot for only being 22 years old. At work alot of things are going on, people are going to get fired, hired and fired again. People at work are some serious bad influences, in the last month or so I've been living the life way to much and it's starting to take it's toll. I talked to the playa Andy a few days ago and I must say it was good to hear from him since his departure, on another weird note David and Jon just up and left one day and the last I heard they are living it up in Georgia, hotlanta if you will. I think today I'll follow Andy's lead and end this post with a little Alk Trio Tribute................ I never had a drink that I didn't like, one taste of you and I puked all night. Christ thats harsh!"
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"The freeway going 65 mph, my fuel indicator going on 'E', my Marlboro Ultra Light going on filter, and  urlLink Sparta  making love to my ears. That was the scene I was in earlier this afternoon as I was returning from a pointless day at the office and in a bout 2 hours thats where I'll be returning to for a little thing we call a split. Today has and is going to be a weird one, I was harrased and then charmed by a young urban fellow selling pixie sticks on the off ramp, I was accused of stealing food from young childrens mouths, and to top it all off I just received some more good tidings from the El Paso Police Department. Hopefully this damn day will get a little more interesting, last night was odd as well, a whole day aimlesly wandering this fair city in search of happyness and relife of the endless torment known as boredome. I watched a little movie called ""13 Ghosts"" last night and I must say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my short and uneventful life. last night ended with a few glasses of Amberbock and a few drags of leaf, a few Z's, a few waffles, and a few dollars."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"Tonight I missed a great show due to my employment status. That status lies within the realms of being unemployed and relying on my folks to spot me a bill or ten. Well this show just happened to take place the day before an eagerly awaited payday, my parents that is. The 12.50 I needed was nowhere to be found, so  urlLink MCD  were one fan short of a spectacular farewell tour. I bet  urlLink Andy's  employed ass went and just my luck he's gonna tell me that they played the best show of they're short but inspiring career. So I was forced to spend an evening of drawn out stories that really go nowhere and if I cared enough to actually listen to them they would probably still wouldn't go anywhere. Well that's another story all together, all in all the night was a total waste but it could have been a total waste at home which tonight wasn't on the agenda.  Peace."
VMR4HQ1,male,24,"I had this crazy dream lastnight, and in this certain dream everyone that was in it had huge heads, imitating that crazy 'Ludacris' video. I started to freak-out a little in the dream but then I realized it ws really funny and I became envious of their copulant, cranial capacity and I started to wish them all harm. So in short I had another freaky ass dream in which I started getting slow evil revenge on all that attended. This mega pouch of 'Capri Sun' is tearing my taste buds apart with it's neverending quantity of life giving solitude and it's rambunctious attitiute of drink me fast and hard wait till I'm empty to taste. Did anyone see the damn Raiders lose there shit in goddam New England of all places, what the shit is that? I think they should make a rule that teams only play each other if they have the same climate,  what the hell gives having a team from sunny ol' Oakland play a team from blizzard ass New England. Maybe I'm just bitching because I've been a fan of the Raiders for 16 yeras of my life and I can't remember the last time they were that close to "" The Bowl"".  Coach, do you remeber me? It's me George Costanza, JFK high...........  Can't Stand YA!"
01L3YY2,female,27,"There is nothing I hate more than hearing people chewing their food! It rates up there with dragging your nails on a chalkboard in my opinion.  For awhile now, two other ladies & I would go out to lunch once a week. Recently, one of my male co-workers has joined us. He likes to chew with his mouth open & none to quiet I may add.  Yesterday I was going absolutely batty as he was standing in my office, chewing an apple, a noisy piece of food to begin with, mouth open, making more noise than a fret train!  I was seriously having convulsions."
01L3YY2,female,27,"My little brother   just got back from   urlLink camp   & he informs me that he & another cabin member have thought up the idea of a Lazy Camp. And when I say thought up, I mean, they thought of everything. I'd suggest something, & he'd say, yep already covered. Obviously the premise of the camp is to be as lazy as possible. Here were some of his ideas:   No talking: before you get to camp, you think of everything you might possibly say, record it, that way you don't have to talk the entire time you are there.  Transportation: Every body gets around with their very own wheelchair, lounge style!  Bathroom: Your lounge wheelchair fits over any toilet, & that's all I'm going to say.  Eating: Feeding tube of course!  Pretty much the only thing you'll do while at the camp is play computer/video games."

01L3YY2,female,27,"Today, Charlie had a little bit of surgery to remove some problem skin tags & a small mass (probably a tumor) that was found in his mouth.  All went well. Pops was a nervous wreck all day, which is understandable. Thankfully everything went well.  I went to pick Charlie up & he was definitely still woozy. He didn't even acknowledge me! HUMPH! I admit it was a little comical when he tried to get in the back of my car & then climb the steps to the house.  He gave Pops the same greeting he gave me, so I don't feel as bad now. He then proceeded to walk around the house in circles like a drunk man (dog?).  Now we have to wait to get the results on whether or not the lump & skin tags are cancerous.  Anyway, that's the Chucky update!"
01L3YY2,female,27,Today is 04.04.04!
01L3YY2,female,27,"Lucky, I'm convinced, knows English. He knows what's going on.  A couple of weeks after we found out that he had cancer, & was given 1 to 2 months to live, he became very sick, & we thought we were going to have to put him down for the night.  Pops, wanting to be with his friend, slept downstairs, so Lucky wouldn't have to climb the stairs.  I think Lucky knew something bad was going to happen in the near future, & summoned all the power from Helms Deep, & told himself to get better, which he did.  Lately, due to the deterioating effects the medicine has had on his intestines, Lucky's had some diarrhea.  And unfortunately, he's not been able to make it outside a couple of times.  Plus, he's been getting really stubborn.  Won't come downstairs in the morning to go out.  Won't go out at night.  Two nights ago, it's pouring down rain, & lucky won't go outside.  I bribe him with General Tso's chicken & get him in the kitchen.  He goes outside, I give him another piece & then heads right back for the door.  So, thinking he just didn't want to get wet, I grabbed my umbrella (okay I didn't want to get wet either) heated up some more Tso's, put it on a plate and set in at the bottom of the steps.  Boy was that dog being stubborn that night! He went down, took the chicken & then hauled ass back up the stairs (as  quickly as a 150 lbs. rottweiller can with a bum leg) & back inside.  So Pops stayed downstairs, just in case Lucky had to go in the middle of the night.  He finally did at 4 AM.  Pops has a short discussion with CJ about possibly putting Lucky down.  He reasons that if he's having bathroom problems & won't be cooperative, what more can we do?  Well let me tell y'all.  This dog heard the word, put down, & he cleaned his act up!  Last night, went outside with no problems, probably looking at Pops like, what's the fuss, it's not like I've never gone to the bathroom outside before!!  Humans!! Went upstairs with no problems, came downstairs this morning, with everyone else, & went outside.  I'm telling you, he knew!"

So we listened to her (as she was rather hysterical at this stage and was complaining about how we didn't listen) and turned left, doing a rather large circuit of the neighbourhood.     We were completely confused by her explanation and decided to ask a police officer...    ""Get back to Toronto?

DRT3HYS,female,16,"I was reading a Dave Barry column on the Miami Herald website and I noticed in the sidebar that there was a link called ""Gay South Florida."" I clicked on it out of curiousity, and on the page that loaded, I found a Gay Q&A with a guy named Steve, who is a homosexual. It broke my heart when I read this one:   Q. Steve, what can we do to get these bible abusers to get real and acknoledge that they are trying to steal civil rights from a minority, as the Nazi's did repeatedly in the early 30's ? They refuse to see their own bigotry, THEY make blind assumptions and present them as FACTS. I never asked to be gay. I tried to be ""normal"" for these people, it caused YET another failed marriage in America, and MORE children raised in a ""broken home"" when I could no longer live a lie !  -Dolphins fan 4 life, Memphis, TN   A. Dolphins fan, the best thing people can do is to tell their own stories, just as you've done. I'm sure other gay people will relate and nongay people will have something to think about. Thanks.    Christians  are the ones making blind assumptions? Well who is calling who a Nazi, here?   Dear Dolphins fan 4 life,  Okay, first of all: I'm sorry that the experiences you have had with Christians were so awful that you now associate all of us with Nazis and call us ""bible abusers."" But, well, we're not like Nazis, really. It hurts that you're making such a blind assumption of us, Dolphins fan. If we were like Nazis... well, things would be a lot worse for you, is all I can say. In case you didn't know, Hitler killed Christians. He wanted to create a new world religion and replace Jesus Christ as the central figure of worship with himself. He is not our best friend. So if you don't mind, don't call us Nazis.   Second of all, I would just like you to know that the Christian ""agenda"" is not to ""steal civil rights from a minority."" That's blind assumption number two for ya, buddy. What would be the point in stealing civil rights from someone? It's not like they're something we can hoard all to ourselves, or anything. ""Ahaha, these are MY civil rights! Precioussss!"" No. That is not what Christians want. At least, that isn't what REAL Christians want. Sometimes, as Christians, we can come off a little strong with our fire and brimstone talk, but ultimately... well, real Christians want to spread the truth of God's Word to the world. We're not supposed to point fingers and act like we're better than everyone else, because we're not. But, well, like it or not, God's Word says that homosexuality is a SIN. Yes, that's right. SIN. It's a hard word to hear, I know. But guess what, EVERYBODY DOES IT! MYSELF INCLUDED! SIN IS A HARD THING TO DEAL WITH! The ONLY difference between us is that I recognize my need for a Savior. I know I sin. I know I can't do anything worth doing apart from Christ. And I know and believe that Jesus is the only way for me to escape the consequences of sin.  (Collective gasp) WHAT? There are CONSEQUENCES for SIN? But... I thought I could just do whatever the heck I wanted and get away with it! Isn't that what America is all about?  IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT IT SURE IS LOOKING THAT WAY LATELY.   But you know what the absolute greatest part is? Yeah, there are consequences for sinning. To put it bluntly, people who sin go to hell. Which means that all of us are condemned to hell. (Oh yes! I  went  there! Final destination for sinners = HELL!) But you don't have to go to hell.  What? But you just said...  Yeah. Remember Jesus? You know, the guy who came to Earth roughly 2000 years ago...? Well, he did this thing for us. He died. On the cross. He was crucified, which is actually a pretty painful way to die. I don't know for sure, but I would even venture that it is probably THE most painful way to die. But see, he didn't die because he did something wrong. In fact, he never did ANYTHING wrong in his entire life. He never sinned, not once. Which is pretty amazing, if you think about it. The reason he was able to not sin his entire life was because he was actually God in the flesh, which is even more incredible. God!  Walking around!  On   Earth!   TALKING to people! Come on, doesn't that mean something to you? It sure means something to me. You know why? Because he came to Earth to die for ME. He did it because he for some insane reason LOVES me and wants me to be with him in heaven for eternity. So when he rose again three days after he was put into the grave, he had conquered death and from then on, all you had to do was believe in him as your Savior and follow him. That's it. Believing in Jesus = salvation from sin and its consequences. It's REALLY not that hard to understand.   Dolphins fan, in fear of sounding incredibly hateful, let me just say this. Gays and lesbians should NOT be whining about being persecuted. You're getting an amazing amount of press because of all your various antics, and all the blame for your supposed ""unhappiness"" is landing on us Christians. After all, we're the ones upholding the founding fathers' Constitution. We're the ones who want to keep America's last bit of purity before we lose it completely. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not bitter about the whole persecution thing. It's promised in the Bible that because the world hated Jesus, they will hate his followers. So really, I don't care if you do it. But because this is America, and we have freedom of speech and religion, I'm able to defend what I believe, which is what I'm doing.   I'm a Christian. Am I afraid of change, like everyone always accuses us of being? YES! I an desperately afraid that this nation is going to forget their Creator. I'm so scared that America is going to be a highway for others in the world to be led astray, and I'm scared that even more people are going to end up separated from God for eternity. It is MIND BOGGLING that SO many people actually believe the lie that they were ""born that way."" Satan is having his way with this country. Homosexuality isn't the only thing that's wrong with us. There is a plethora of other things that should worry any thinking person. Why wouldn't I be afraid? But thankfully, he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world. And he's our only prayer right now. He's always been our only prayer, and personally, I wouldn't have it any other way.  Sincerely, Sarah  Dear Steve,  Thank you for posting that comment. It did give me something to think about.  Love, Sarah"
DRT3HYS,female,16,"I was talking to my friend Becca online today. We had this really interesting conversation about friends and the friends we've lost recently. She was telling me about this mutual friend that she had a lot of problems with Freshmen and Sophomore year. Then recently, this friend came back and practically begged for Becca to take her back.   Becca said no. This girl had put her through too much and she was tired of being let down. I didn't know what to say. I just thought about how we used to be this great group of friends. Then freshmen year, everything went wrong. People went to drugs and alcohol. We kinda turned our backs on each other, and now there's barely even three of us left that are still trying to hang on to what was there before.  Then I was talking to my friend Matt. It was his birthday on Tuesday and he was making fun of me cause I forked the wrong house.  But he still got the card cause he knew the people we did it to, and he thought it was great. And then he all of a sudden said he had to go. This girl, Gracie had called and they were all going to see a movie.   They being the people at my old youthgroup. I didn't really like my old youthgroup but I wanted to curl up and cry. My friends at school are all divided. My friends from the old church never talk to me anymore. And it kinda hurt.  Because I just realized. That I can't go back. I can't be the person I was and be the person I am today. It doesn't work. It won't ever be the same again. It might be better. But it won't be the same.  And I can't go back."

DRT3HYS,female,16,yes for pink austin! take that!
DRT3HYS,female,16,"Well, that was the best title I could think of for this post. Because there really isn't anything that can be said to announce what I want to share. Partially, because I have no idea what I am going to share with y'all today. Okay, that's not true. I know what I'm goind to say, I just don't know how. I guess...   I have a friend, who for the sake of privacy, I am going to call her Annie. Annie's a sweet girl just a little lost and craving love and attention. I know, newsflash, isn't the entire world. But Annie has had a particularly bad time with things. She has a good home and a great family who loves her, but she's incredibly unhappy, or at least she was when she started drugs. She's doing better now, and she only cuts on the rare occasion. (yay)   But as a Christian, I recognize that as not being enough, especially since the only one who is keeping her from drugs and cutting is her boyfriend. We all know how stupid and unpredictable boys are. So I just told her one night online (at close to 12 mind you) that I wish she had something a little more constant. Of course the question came, what could be more constant. And of course, my answer was Jesus.   Oh great, now there's a can of worms that I just opened. But she actually didn't flip out on me like I expected. On the contrary, she just said thanks, she knows I want her to have 'good things' but she's okay right now. So then I said something along the lines of 'I don't know about good things, I just don't really want you to go to Hell.' and then she asked why that would happen, because she's a pretty good person; sure she hurts herself, but she doesn't hurt others a whole lot. At least, she tries not to.   But it was so insane. I mean, I got to totally share Christ with her. I gave her the '4-1-1' on Christianity, salvation, Jesus, God, sin. You know? And hello?! It was all over IM.  IM!!  Who honestly shares Christ over the internet at midnight?! It was almost 1 when I finished and stold her I was going to bed.   It was just so amazing because the week before Derek and Kari talked about being Jesus here, and not just on mission trips. They said that we need to bring the mission field back to our school and share Christ with everyone. And it's hard, they know. I mean, they're only seniors. But I just kinda scoffed when Kari said something about, not waiting for the opportunity but creating it. I figure, God creates the opportunity, not me, I'll just take it and run with it when He gives me something.   Oh, He gave it to me alright. I never thought I would share Christ with Annie. I always thought she would tell me no, she didn't want to hear it. And then I told her how much Jesus loves her just 2 nights ago. I may have made that comment about having Jesus as a constant in life, but even that wasn't me. That was God. I got offline and just couldn't stop thinking about it. I've seen God work in crazy ways before, but never like this.   The whole thing was God. I could do nothing to start something like that, I could do nothing to open up Annie's heart and make her willing to listen. That was God. My words were God. I saved the conversation and reread it yesterday. Holy Cow*, I could never say those kind of things on my own, not unless I planned them ahead of time!   So I guess all I have to say is, yea Annie may not have become a Christian. But for some reason, God used me ( me of all people) to show Him to her with some text in a little window on Monday morning. I think it's really cool when you can see God work like that. It's not very often, but it happens once in a while. So guys? just keep trying. Because you don't have to do anything, God will give you the time and the words to say. He did for me. And trust me, it will come up in places you never thought possible. Like IM at midnight.   luv y'all bunches and bunches! Dios le bendiga.      *sarah, yes it is a special Cow."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"Well. I thought I would kind of do a big generic email/blog thing to let everyone know how Costa Rica is. Since, after all, you don't all reply to emails (coughaustincough) and I forgot some email addresses (coughconnorcough) I thought this could be the best way to keep in touch right now, since this time tomorrow I may not have internet connection at Ernesto y Adri's.  Costa Rica has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Okay, now that we have the setting down. lol anyway, right now I'm staying with Suzie and Michele. They have got to be some of the biggest sweethearts God ever made. Honestly. Anyway, I think the 2 biggest things that have happened so far are these.  On Wednesday (I think) I gave my testimony to an evangelism group from the youth group that Michele is working with. See, Natalie and I had to sit in on the meeting (I understood like half of what was going on). And they were learning how to write testimonies and give them. So Michele had already helped me write mine out and asked me to give it. So I did. It was really cool except I was sooo nervous that I couldn't get the word mia out. First it came out mio and then miaeee and then they all laughed when I finally got it to mia. lol and then later I couldn't say involucrada, becuase that word and I just have issues. So this one guy who said nothing the rest of the night, I was like 'involcr... no involucrud' and he goes 'involucrada' and i was like 'si!' and then kept going. lol it was funny. And then they all clapped and cheered afterwards. I'm still working on whether they were happy for me (cause they said 'amen' when I said I want to be 'una misionera por que yo quiero compartir el amor de Jesucristo con otras personas) or if they cheered cause they were happy I was done. lol  Then I was talking with Suzie about the 'illegals' which are Nicaraguans. I never knew that Nicaragua was having such a  hard time, but apparently they are. So I asked if there was an I-Team down there, and Suzie said no. But this other girl Maribela wants to go down there and start one but she needs someone to go with her, you know? And I was thinking about it a lot lately (which means in the past 3 days) that maybe this is what I want to do. THey don't need me here, they're already well established. But they need people for Nicaragua. And even though I couldn't go for another six years cause of school, I could spend summers helping Maribela prepare to go down there. I could come to Costa Rica for a year of school and work with her to plan it. You know? But then, I'm not sure if this is just me thinking of all of this, or if it's God showing me what His will is for my future. So I've been praying about it. I almost want to do the whole Gideon and sheepskin thing, but I don't want to be like testing God, I just want to know for sure so I don't screw up some vast eternal plan.  Anyway, those are the big things that have happened. Email me. You all have the address.  Working on my spanish, sara  ps, bring something for the rain."
DRT3HYS,female,16,"I talked to one of my friends from Costa Rica last night. His name is Minor. It was pretty sweet. He speaks perfect English, so I don't ever have to worry about language barriers. But conversation is still kinda slow because he has to think about what I mean sometimes, and I have to stop using idioms. But it was really good. Turns out that he writes songs (and plays guitar, but I already knew that). He even wrote one in English which he sent to me. I liked it. And he's writing a book. Which I can only imagine is going to be long and interesting, that is, if I could understand Spanish well enough to read it.  But it was so cool talking to him. I haven't had any news from anyone in Costa Rica. It was so exciting!"

P2XDNH3,male,43,"Master:  To say that my pretty slavegirl likes to worship my cock, would be something of an understatement.  For me, having my submissive at my feet reinforces everything I am: dominant, sadist, Daddy (yes, we have a 'Daddy's little girl' dynamic as well) etc.  It doesn't actually matter whether my cock is in her mouth.  Having her leaning against me, arms around my waist, head resting in my groin, while my hands are in her hair, is emotionally very powerful for both of us.  This is one of my favourite positions to collar her in.  The other has me sitting on the edge of the bed, while she kneels in front of me - the advantage of this is that I am already sitting if my knees go weak when she sucks me - she is very good at it.  Katy is misremembering one thing - I have not said I can barely feel it when she kisses and licks my shaft.  I have explained that most of the nerve endings are in the head , and also the foreskin, and that stimulation anywhere else is not as effective.  That doesn't mean I don't like it!  It is possible I like receiving oral sex more than most men.  (I also love returning the favour, even though one DimDomWannabe once told me it wasn't very dominant of me to enjoy eating pussy - but that is another post for another day)  My last two partners both had TMJ severely - Katie has it mildly.  One of them also had an aversion to bodily fluids, and even preferred the taste of latex to the taste of my cock.  (It wasn't a hygiene issue - Katie will tell you how fastidious about keeping myself clean)  I was mildly offended by this, although I tried to hide it.  It is difficult for me to describe how powerful are the emotions caused by having a slavegirl who actually  wants  to worship my cock; who actually enjoys it and loves to swallow.  (Although she also likes it when I come over her breasts and/or face)  I have very intense orgasms during oral sex.  I am quite sure this is as much due to the emotions as it is the physical pleasure of having slavegirl who gives the best head I have ever experienced.  Master, how does it feel when I lick around the circumference of your cock near the base? When the ends of my hair brush against your skin? When my wet lips trail kisses from the base of your cock towards the head?  I believe I have answered those questions."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"katy failed to stress one thing in her report on the Laundry and Dominance incident.  I usually only suffer from jetlag when traveling from West to East -- presumably because of the 'lost' time.  This trip, I have suffered badly from it, despite travelling from East to West.  The day in question, I actually had a two-hour sleep around lunchtime.  Sleeping during the day is practically unheard of for me.  I probably shoudn't even have tackled the laundry that day, but I was running short of shirts.  Anyway, I am usually  much  better at the hanging of things, as katy also failed to mention.  As to her question at the end of her post, the answer is ""Neither.""  Logically, katy understands that I don't ""twitch"" at the concept of handing over control to someone with better skills than I have.  Emotionally, she might not quite believe it yet.  The alternative, of course, is that she was bloody annoyed, forgot I was feeling unwell, and used the formal approach to hide her annoyance."

P2XDNH3,male,43,"Went to sleep for the night around 7, without taking pills.  Had night sweats and very vivid dreams.  No pain todya, but weak and a little dizzy.  Minor fog."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"3:30 pm... migraine coming on. Aching in neck and shoulders. Stretching relieves pain only during stretch. Nausea that feels like a lump in the stomach.  ate for lunch:  salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and italian dressing pasta alfredo same as yesterday  4:15 left work early, drank coke 4:45 took 2 magnesium pills with a hershey bar with almonds 5:20 home, going to bed on sofa with blinds closed and earplugs in to block the sound of children at the pool. Nausea worse. pain a little less, esp in shoulders 5:30 put TENS unit on golf balls on shoulders. Normally I use these at a 6-8 mA setting. More than that, and it causes muscle contractions which the manual says isn't supposed to happen on the 'pain relief' cycle. I got it up to 13mA before discomfort caused me to stop. The muscle contractions never happens.  After about 15 minutes, I decided to move the electrodes further up the neck. I placed them on either side of the spine just below the hairline. I got it up to 9 or 10 before the muscle contractions started. Then the weirdest thing. Every few minutes, I had to lower the setting because the TENS sensation became more pronounced and the muscles started contracting. Each time i lowered it, I could barely feel it at first, and then the area became more sensitive until the muscles started contracting. I got it as low as four by the end of the cycle (another 15 minutes) and I've never felt anything on 4 before. It was taking the pain with it.  After the TENS cycle ended, a few minutes passed, and I felt the sick pain of the migraine again. I started another cycle. I had to go back up to 6 at the start, but lowered it down to 4 after a few minutes, and fell asleep with it running.   The muscles obviously started out less sensitive to the TENS. Was this because of the migraine? Then they became more sensitive. Was this because the TENS was killing the migraine? Or was the magnesium killing the migraine? Or was the magnesium making the muscles more sensitive? Too early to say.  10pm: woke up, groggy and a little sensation fog. (Colors dull, thoughts slow, sense of touch dull.) Can't say it's very unwelcome. Drinking a glass of water now.  12am:  used TENS again.  pain getting worse.  took two more mgnesium pills.  Took bedtime pills.  middle of the night:  night sweats  8:30 am:  wake up call.  Seem to be okay, but not great.  Took a salt bath  9:30am:  sitting at computer and drinking a glass of water  10:30am:  no active pain, but definitely not normal.  ate 2 slices of toast with margarine and apple butter.  Went to bed with TENS unit on.  Slept until after 3.  3:15pm:  woke feeling very foggy and thirsty.  No active pain.  4ish:  took two more magnesium.  Ate rice with sugar and milk.  sometime i ate tomato soup, but the computer crashed and ate the post then i got mad at the computer and took half a xanax  at 7 pm.  then i ate ice cream.  then i fell alseep with out taking my evening pills or brushing my teeth or anything.  woke up with call at 8. took a bath. was okay until i couldn't find the pattern, and then i freaked out and now i feel like killing everything."
P2XDNH3,male,43,"Beauty:    The Pearl Necklace   I wanted a hairbrush with a flat back.  I wanted Master to put me over his knee, pull up my skirt, and spank me with it.  Master had other ideas for the hairbrush.  We went to the drugstore and picked one out together:     When we got home, he put me over his knee, pulled up my skirt, and spanked me.  It doesn't make sense, but when my ""Beauty"" personality is front, I feel pain as pain.  I still love the submission and humiliation of a spanking--especially over the knee--but it hurts.  (My Max personality, on the other hand, is a genuine masochist and takes pleasure in the pain itself.)  This hairbrush is very thuddy and painful.  I very often cry out in pain when it is used, particularly when the strokes fall hard and fast.  After the spanking, Master ordered me to strip.  Then he ordered me to crawl to the toy chest in the  bedroom and return with a condom.  Since we are monogamous and have another method of birth control, we only keep condoms on hand for a few specialized types of play.  Like when Master ordered me to put a condom on the handle of the hairbrush and fuck myself with it.  While I fucked myself with the hairbrush, he masturbated himself near my face.  I hoped he would come in my mouth.  I can't remember if I begged for that, or if I was beyond words by that point.  It was very  humiliating to fuck myself with the hairbrush that had just spanked me, so that the visual effect could be a turn-on for Master.  It was exhilarating to know that my whorish behavior gave him such pleasure.  It was the first time Master had ever come on my tits.  When we looked at the pictures later, we realized that I was wearing a double pearl necklace."

I laid down for a while, then felt better after a bowel movement.  I felt a little better then, and didn't have to sleep, but the ""better"" didn't last long.  When I took a nap later, my legs were twitching.     I did some sewing in the evening."

Okay, we're hardwired, full-time kinky people, but I think more than an hour or two of being chained somewhere would be too extreme for us.  The less interesting truth is that I have a full-time job and you can imagine how our time at home is being used.  You know, like unpacking Master's bags and finding room for all our books and rearranging the furniture.  What, that isn't quite what you imagined?  ;-)"

UMBMHKV,male,39,"""Hi folks, it was all a big  urlLink publicity stunt  for my new movie!""  Michael Moore knew over a year ago that Disney would not distribute his film, yet this week he pretended to be outraged at their censorship. As it turns out, he may not have even had a deal for distribution in the first place, the deal with Miramax may have just been for financing. It's was a cheap stunt and it damages what little credibility he has. This is exactly how he handles making his films too, slanting information, not telling the full story so it appears like something it's not. This guy is no more credible than Rush Limbaugh. The two seem separated at birth, one raised by liberals, the other by a pack of wolves.  In an indignant letter to his supporters, Moore said he had learnt only on Monday that Disney had put the kibosh on distributing the film, which has been financed by the semi-independent Disney subsidiary Miramax.  But in the CNN interview he said: ""Almost a year ago, after we'd started making the film, the chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, told my agent he was upset Miramax had made the film and he will not distribute it.""    Semi-independent Disney subsidiary? You are either independent or you are not. A company owned by Disney Corp. isn't semi-anything, it's a corporate beast. Silly me for forgetting what a bloated, lying, liberal windbag Michael Moore is.  Moore told CNN that Disney had ""signed a contract to distribute this [film]"" but got cold feet. But Disney executives insists there was never any contract.  And a source close to Miramax said that the only deal there was for financing, not for distribution .  So he's   still   not telling the truth! He never even had a distribution deal in the first place!

It's starting to look like calling someone a ""neo-conservative"" is the equivalent to calling them a  urlLink ""foreign policy simpleton"" , naive about dangerous world realities. It's about time.   Shortly after September 11, Sir Michael Howard, the British military historian, issued what sounded then like an apocalyptic warning: that in the context of the ""war of civilizations"" between radical Islam and the West a US occupation of Iraq would be tantamount to a nuclear exchange between the superpowers during the Cold War. It sounds like realism now. The fallout from the photographs will poison Muslim minds against the US, and possibly against democracy, throughout this century. Before the war, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak cautioned that a US invasion of Iraq would create ""a hundred Bin Ladens."" That is likely to prove a conservative estimate.  As for US credibility beyond the Middle East, a friend writes: ""I'm guessing that another result of this adventure is that much of the world will now see us as a paper tiger (which has both good and bad aspects). After seeing how incapable we are, with our 135,000-man army, of dealing even with a weak, backward little country like Iraq, is any heavily armed tyrant quaking in his boots? All we can do is blow up things. Don't our hinted warnings to China (China!) about Taiwan sound hollow now? If China decides to take Taiwan, we will ... what? Send Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle over there with a company of Marines?""  Paradoxically, the very scale of the debacle in Iraq may yield one long-term good: the repudiation of neo-conservative ""democratic imperialism."" The Americans killed in Iraq will not have died in vain if their sacrifice keeps other Americans from dying in neo-con wars to ""remediate"" Syria, Iran, or North Korea. After Iraq, ""neo-conservative"" may achieve the resonance of ""isolationist"" after World War II—a term of opprobrium for a discredited approach to foreign policy, shorthand for dangerous innocence about world realities. Like the isolationists, the neo-cons are history's fools. The strategy they championed was the wrongest possible strategy for the wrongest possible moment in the wrongest possible region of the world."
UMBMHKV,male,39,"EJ Dionne, in  urlLink  The Post  , reminds us of a great quote from Sen. Orrin Hatch, which was directed at Bush in a presidential debate in December '99:  ""You've been a great governor,"" Hatch declared of his rival for the Republican presidential nomination. ""My only problem with you, governor, is that you've only had four and going into your fifth year of governorship. . . . Frankly, I really believe that you need more experience before you become president of the United States. That's why I'm thinking of you as a vice presidential candidate.""  So let us not forget this as the ""Republican Guard"" gear up to take shots at VP candidate, John Edwards, by claiming he lacks experience. Jesus, the Governor of Texas, which Bush was for a little over 4 years, is about as close to a ceremonial position as you can get, as far as governorships go in this country. Of course, the more cynical, granola-eating, freak-flag flying, flag burning, civil rights loving, peacenik lefties out there probably feel his position as president has been largely ceremonial as well, with policy decisions actually dictated by ""Tricky"" Dick Cheney and his ""Fun Bunch"" of neocon minions. I don't often agree with cynics but..."

UMBMHKV,male,39,"...and I mean from the top down over this ever-widening scandal of Iraqi prisoner abuse and now  urlLink  murder  ! Who are we, as a supposedly moral and kind people, that we can allow this to happen?  A US soldier kills a prisoner, a human being, with a  rock  and all that happens is they are demoted and kicked out of the service? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Our entire military, as well as our entire country, should be ashamed and embarrassed that this travesty has taken place and was not only effectively ignored but the seriousness of the crime soft-pedalled by officers in charge of overseeing Iraqi and Afghani detainees.     An official said a soldier was convicted in the U.S. military justice system of killing a prisoner by hitting him with a rock, and was reduced in rank to private and thrown out of the service but did not serve any jail time.   What kind of message does this send not only to the Iraqi people but the rest of the world when it comes to our valuation of an Iraqi life compared to an American life? Demoted? Kicked out of the service? Sent home? With ""tough justice"" like that it's no wonder even more prisoners aren't killed by US servicemen! Kill a helpless human being, go home a free man?  When four mercenaries, or ""independent contractors"" (take your pick), were murdered and paraded around Fallujah, we invaded the city and killed scores of Iraqis, many innocent civilians. Yet when the US military's own internal investigation uncovers that at least 2 Iraqi prisoners have died while in custody, there are no serious repercussions for those who are responsible. A demotion and being kicked out of the Army? That's considered reasonable punishment for a crime of that hideous nature? The military officers involved in imposing that ridiculously light sentence should be court-martialed themselves, demoted and sent home. Instead, they've been  urlLink reprimanded  and their military careers apparently over.  This kind of excessive, brutal and barbaric behaviour by some of our troops and intelligence officials makes me sick to my stomach. It's unfortunate that a relatively small group of sadists and idiots can undermine the noble cause the rest of the military is pursuing in Iraq under very difficult and dangerous conditions. Furthermore, these actions only make it more difficult for their fellow soldiers to do their jobs, as it inflames Iraqis, understandably so, and creates a even more widespread hatred for the occupying troops."

A98XKGK,female,24,"Reminicing the awful past...   Today is a time for reminicing for me.  My boyfriend is in Alominos today for a hearing.  He had a vehicular accident a few months ago.  He was with his two cousins that time.  He was driving a pick-up truck from Bicol to Manila when they were side-swiped by a bus going on the same direction.  He was hospitalized because of a fractured bone on his leg and some stitchings were need near his head and ear.  He survived but his two cousins didn't.  I'm pretty close to those two cousins of his, especially the other one, Dennis.  He makes me laugh and genuinely cares about my well being.  He's a good singer and guitar player. And he always has a smile on his face even when you know that he has a problem or just sad about something.  I really miss him very much.  It was really a shock to me when they told me that he's dead.  Flashes of images and memories went through my mind screaming at me.  I wouldn't see him anymore.  I would never hear his voice when he laughs or sing with his guitar strumming along the way.  I wouldn't be cheering for him anymore when basketball season starts again.  I wouldn't hear his jokes.  I wouldn't see his smile.  He would only be a memory to me from now on.  A fond memory that will not be erased from my mind, ever.  A memory that will be etched in my heart for all eternity.  It was harder for my boyfriend...when he was in the hospital we've talked about it and he seems to be blaming himself on the accident.  Everyone from his family and friends tries to tell him that it wasn't his fault but I don't think he believes them and me.  Frankly speaking, it must be really hard for him.  He was the only survivor after all.  I couldn't imagine what he could be thinking all these months of blaming himself and playing the what if questions.  The most painful part for me is that he wouldn't let me in his little world.  He keeps it to himself and tries not to pester people about it.  That's where I know that he's wrong.  You can't move on if you cling to the past and blaming yourself for the accident will make it harder if not impossible.  There are some days that I feel so helpless.  I guess this is one of those awful days.  For me, it's really painful to just stand in the sidelines while the love of your life is struggling with his inner demons.  But what can I do?  I can't force him to tell me...it would make him resent me more if I do that.  I have to wait until he opens up to me. And for me, that's the hardest thing to do.  Just stand in the background waiting for the right moment to enter on cue.  For now, I'm just here waiting to be called."

They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.    Race:   Dwarves  are short and stout, and easily recognizable by their well-cared-for beards. They are hard workers, and adept at stonework and engineering. They tend to live apart from other races; generally in deep, underground excavated systems, and as such tend to be distant from other races.    Primary Class:   Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.    Secondary Class:   Bards  are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.    Deity:   Mielikki  is the Neutral Good goddess of the forest and autumn. She is also known as the Lady of the Forest, and is the Patron of Rangers. Her followers are devoted to nature, and believe in the positive and outreaching elements of it. They use light armor, and a variety of weapons suitable for hunting, which they are quite skilled at.

The reason why our country isn't progressing is because of the people who is running the show.  It's really upsetting to think that people are motivated by money and not the good deeds that they would do to the nation.  What do we have to do to get this country back to being one of the richest country in the world?  We were one of those rich countries.  We still have a chance.  We have rich natural resources.  We should be able to get everything together but we need to get a leader who doesn't care about money but to really serve the country.  I hope that the elections in 2004 would give good results."
A98XKGK,female,24,"A birthday party to remember   Yesterday was a rather memorable day for me.  Not just because it was my birthday but there are somethings that had happened that day related to my special occasion.  One:  I saw my aunt freak out in the  office.  It was a sight to behold.  She was babbling and having tantrums yesterday because some of my bosses didn't get to the office in time.  Dr. Galang our head had to calm her down and kept convincing her that our lunch out will push through.  Two: My parents called my up and I got a chance to talk to them fully before my phone died.  They greeted me on my birthday and I was really very happy.  Three:  I got to use the internet in the office the whole day.  My boss isn't here and still isn't here to use the computer.  It's really great!  Four:  We had a 3hour lunch break.  We ate at around 12nn and practically got back to the office at around 3:30pm.  It's really great.  I ended up nearly not doing much work.  Just faxed some documents and finished typing some documents as well.  But today, I have so much work but it's alright...I still have internet. :D  Five:  We have DSL!!! It was just installed at home late afternoon!  Now the internet at home is pretty fast and I can download things half the time I usually download them. :D  My brothers realy love it very much that now I know that I will have a hard time getting into the internet since they would be using it more often than me and my sister.  Six:  Well, this was this morning but I'm still happy because the Official Kimi Raikkonen Forum members greeted me on my birthday!  It was really a shock since I thought no one will remember from the people there. :D  Anyway, as I've said on my previous blog, it really gets me warm inside to know that I have friends who care so much. :D  Seven:  My bestest best friend in the whole wide world sent me an email greeting me a Happy Birthday and he also sent me and e-card as well.  It was really touching and to get a card from someone whom I haven't seen in the longest time and I still consider the best of the best friends I have was really heart warming.  Kuya Carl and I come way back to the time I was still in diapers.  And to here from him all the way from Boston, I'm really happy.  The biggest news he said to me that he was finally graduating Law at Harvard.  Graduating Law at Harvard is really an achievement and I congratulate him for that. :D  I really had a great time yesterday, even if the MRT was full and I had so many things to carry when I was going home.

JP2BY0F,male,27,"It's NOT carpal tunnel  . . .  Well at least in my very uninformed non-medical opinion. However I have a very sharp pain residing in my hand and sometimes both hands. From the base of my thumb to the first knuckle. I can't figure it out really. Sooo I'm leaving it to the professionals and letting my doctor look at it this afternoon!

JP2BY0F,male,27,"Wow, this is truly a sick addiction. But hey it's the flavor of the month and at least for now it tastes really good! Anyway, the world is truly small. As I was surfing some other blogs today I went to a link on  urlLink Coqui 's site ( urlLink jason ) read it for a bit and as I was checking out his links I see a name that is the same as that of a buddy from college. Surely this isn?t the same I thought but I don?t know many John Barbers and sure enough there he was in all his urlLink  Barberman  blogging greatness. Anyway it was cool to see small world.  If I continue this I?m absolutely going to have to get some pictures on this thing, but that requires money and before I go throwing around cash (yeah I know $5 a month or whatever isn?t a lot) I have to be sure I?m going to stick with it at least on a semi-consistent basis.   Tonight is an exciting night as my  urlLink Razorbacks  are playing on National TV. Living in Seattle it?s kind of hard to catch a team from Ark on the TV.  So in about 15 min they?ll be playing the Gamecocks.  They?ve had a very up and down season. But here is hoping they win out and make a decent Bowl.  For those of you not from Ark. The University of Arkansas is THE TEAM in Arkansas. If you live anywhere in the State you?re REQUIRED to root for the Hogs. Since we don?t have any professional teams, the college kids get all the love. It?s good times.    In fact Coqui, who is in my office bemoaning the Hawgs Illustrated (yep it?s an actual magazine) that she has to sort through and make sure I get each week, is a prime example of those that ?don?t get it?. It?s like New York and the Yankees, Chicago and the Cubs, Dallas and the Cowboys, or yeah ok sorry don?t have any non sports illustrations; if you live there though you have to follow the team. So I?m headed home to watch the Razorbacks.   Oh yeah the Basketball team is actually better then the football team. Ok well not this year, but give them a couple and the back to back top 5 recruiting classes they have coming in will be in full effect! Stan Heath will be coach of the year in '05 just put it down."

JP2BY0F,male,27,"Funny stuff. . .     Stacy - Silverton, OR  Comments: Before a softball game, one team member prayed, ''please let the other team win...and let us win, too.'' Both teams win? Like a tie, perhaps? Except nobody wants to tie...somebody's gotta win. It was hard to not laugh out loud when I heard this prayer.   THO's Response: Stacy, it's good that you didn't laugh out loud; you did what is right. A big part of being a Christian is knowing when to laugh and when to laugh behind someone's back. The good thing is even though the latter takes patience and willpower, those times are usually way funnier so you can have an even bigger laugh at someone else's expense an expense that they don't even know exists. The 'cost' of laughing out loud in front of them is often paid by you, and sometimes comes in the form of the pastor stopping his sermon, claiming he's doing the best he can, crying, and later kicking you off the worship band, which was made up of a bunch of no-talent clowns and had a horrible keytarist, anyway!

UNATEZM,female,24,"The following came across my email this afternoon:     Dear Friends and Supporters of BookWoman,      We are writing to ask your help. The still sluggish economy, our rising rent, and the difficulties of the construction project on Lamar Blvd. are all colliding to make this our most challenging summer ever. BookWoman is having a severe cash crisis! We are asking that you come shop at BookWoman right away and tell all your friends! If 160 people each spend $25 here in the next two weeks we would be able to pay our August rent on time. Why not start your holiday shopping now!      Or if you are able to give a small donation of $10, $25, or $50, it would be most gratefully and lovingly received. Although BookWoman is not traditional non-profit, we exist to serve all the women of Austin and all our diverse communities- both in the selection of the products that we carry and the in-store programming that we support and provide.We are actively looking for more economic digs...any leads will be welcome. It is really hard to believe, but we are nearing our 30th anniversary. It's a huge and humbling milestone. Hopefully we will be able to continue our work.    In Sisterhood: with love and gratitude for so many years of your support,     Susan, Kristen, Marla & Jennifer     BookWoman     918 W.12 St.     Austin, Texas 78703      www.ebookwoman.com        First thing is first--if you have  any  spare money lying around and an inclination to help keep a really wonderful store in business, go on down there, if you are local, or go to  urlLink www.ebookwoman.com  and buy something, if you aren't.   Secondly, this is the third or fourth feminist book store in trouble I've heard about lately. There are no words for how much this pisses me off. It is ESSENTIAL that we keep these businesses going. Given the social and political climate around us, protecting our safe havens is more than a good idea, it's a necessity. These stores were some of the first places in the past few decades for women to gather, to be safe, to talk and laugh and cry and be together. They carry books, magazines, music that other stores won't touch, full of information that we need to have access to, as well as entertainment that makes our lives richer. This is a service to the feminist community, and it is one that doesn't pay for itself. If we don't get off our collective asses and support these stores, they won't be here much longer."

UNATEZM,female,24,"I don't know if I have mentioned this before, but my full support is behind  urlLink Dennis Kucinich  for the Democratic presidential nomination. Make no mistakes--I'm not delusioned enough to believe he'll actually  get  the nomination, but he is the only candidate I support at this time, and I am planning to vote for him in the primary. I'm not a registered Democrat, but they tell me that even us  urlLink Commies  can vote in the primaries out here, so I'll be at my polling place next week.  I support Kucinich for fairly simple reasons: we're in nearly 100% agreement on political positions. See, maybe I have it all wrong, but I thought that was the basis I was supposed to vote on--candidates whose positions I agree with and wish to see forwarded. Am I wrong about that? Because that doesn't seem to be how other people are thinking about things. Mostly, what I see around me are people trying to figure out how to beat  urlLink Bush . And don't get me wrong, I'm 100% for that. However, I don't know if I'm for that to the extent of actually being able to pull a lever in favor of  urlLink John Kerry . Besides the facts that I don't  like  John Kerry and I don't  trust  John Kerry, there is the little matter of John Kerry and I disagreeing on some essential shit. Does he take a stong stance against capital punishment? No. Does he come out for same-sex marriage rights? No. Does he support single-payer health care? No. So why the hell would I support him? Better than Bush? Sure. But am I supposed to be voting for the less of two evils? Has it really come to that? Is that the best we can do? Is voting a matter of choosing the best option on the ballot, or is it a matter of choosing the option you think might have a chance of beating the worst option?  I've only voted in one presidential election so far, and I voted for a third-party candidate. And no, it wasn't  urlLink the one  all good Dems love to hate. It was whomever the Socialist candidate was, and no, I don't even remember who it was. I didn't like my choices, so I opted out and voted with my chosen party. I don't do that too often--I vote Democrat more often than I don't--but I don't see how much sitting back and accepting the same breed of candidate from the Dems as the Republicans offer is making a damn thing better. Sure, these old rich white guys are a little more ""Liberal."" They probably won't fuck things up as badly. But do I think they'll institute actual change? Real progress? Frankly, no, I don't. And I don't see how we are going to get to a place of real progress if all the supposed progressives in this country do is play defense. Yes, four more years of Bush would be a fucking nightmare. Yes, I want him out of there. But in the long run, is selling out my principles for another four or eight years of half-assed Democratic rule really going to help anything? Would it be better to let Bush get elected again, let things get four years worth of worse, and then see if people are willing to suggest and fight for real change from real candidates?   Part of the problem, I think, is the entire institution of the presidency. I'm not sure we should keep it at all. Maybe our whole government needs to be reworked into something a bit more representative and a bit less easy to buy or be born into. But where could we possibly start with that? And especially where could we start with it in a time where the best we as progressives can think to do is to try to keep our heads above water?  Don't get me wrong--come Election Day, I'll be rooting for whomever the Democratic least-of-the-evils candidate is. But I don't know if I am going to be able to vote for him."

I'm sick to death of exercise. I just want to eat what I want and do what I want. I'm discouraged.  And it's been working--I'm more than halfway to my goal.

JA99SLN,male,27,"Felt like seeing a movie for some laughs last week, so four of us went out and saw  urlLink  Anchorman   together.   It was pretty funny - good compared to most of the other big screen former-S.N.L.-castmember trash that's come out before. Will Ferrell does his usual thing here, so if you don't like his brand of humor, this probably won't do anything to change your mind about that. Fortunately, Ferrell happens to have my number. So I got several good laughs out of it. But it's been a little over a week since seeing it and, other than the newsteam turf war and the scene on the bridge to Coronado Island, I've already relegated all other memories of this movie to the basement of my brain. Hence, I am unable to give you a proper synopsis of the movie.  If anybody was expecting this to be worth the price of admission, you're kidding yourself and you know it. I knew this going into  Anchorman , but just decided to play one of my ""what the hell"" cards at the ticket window. With that sort of attitude, you won't feel like the movie was a waste. But if you're a tightwad, I'd recommend you save yourself fifteen dollars by waiting until it comes out on DVD and renting it one night when you're in the mood for some dumb humor."

There's no way I'd plunk down $8 for a song I already have, a remix of another song I already have and maybe one new song.  It's insulting to the fans.  I still have quite a few single from when The Verve (if they'd only get back together!) was making music and they are quality singles, with great b-sides.  You just dont see that much anymore.  Maybe that has something to do with Napster and Kazaa, because the last time I bought a single might have been before I discovered Napster.  Or maybe bands just stopped making quality singles because they knew fans would just download the stuff for free since it's only like 1 or 2 new songs?"

British thieves are so fond of swiping the pricey MP3 players that police this week asked iPod (search) users to consider switching to boring black or gray headphones, the Daily Telegraph reports.  Turns out the standard white ""ear buds,"" which identify an iPod user immediately, are mugger magnets.  ""People need to use common sense,"" said a West Midlands police spokesman. ""Using different color headphones might be useful to pretend you were listening to something cheaper, such as a portable stereo.""  Crime rates in Britain have soared in recent years, with muggers known to snatch cell phones and other electronic gadgets right out of users' hands.     ""A man asked if I was wearing an iPod,"" said Birmingham student Roland Baskerville, ""and as soon as I told him 'Yes,' he pulled a knife out and started waving it at me, saying 'Well, hand it over then.' I gave it to him and he ran off.""    An Apple spokesman contended that iPod users would ""rather be robbed"" than suffer the indignity of appearing to use different personal music players.  ""It's up to the consumer if they want to use black or gray headphones instead,"" he said. ""Some users really like the coolness of being seen wearing an iPod.""  Gary Parkinson, a magazine editor, told the newspaper the theft appeal comes with the territory.  ""You are an obvious target,"" he explained. ""The other problem is that the iPod is so shiny and lovely you want to get it out and show people. This attracts criminals like magpies."""

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"I'm melting over here.  They are interviewing one of the hottest men I've ever seen for the IT position over here.  He's like 6'4"", dark blonde hair with deep blue eyes...scrumdiddliumtious.  I'd like to climb him like a jungle gym.  I shook his hand and I swear my knees drooped.  He winked at me and gave me one of those killer smiles where you can almost see the sparkle in his teeth.  Mmm. I think I'll have him for lunch."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"i had my faith in human nature restored last night and my faith in myself shattered!  i went to target last night to pick up a few things for this weekend, including some tp that my roommate doesn't seem to understand is a necessity.  i checked out and for the first time in years actually wrote a check for my goods.  i walked out to the 'ruck and put my new stuff in the back of the hatch, as i did so i saw a man running towards me... i jumped back preparing to utilize my kickboxing skillz and give him a switch kick to the head...when I noticed he had his hand extended towards me which was holding a little black wallet.  MY little black wallet!!  i don't know where or how i had lost it but somewhere in between writing that check and getting to my 'ruck it had left my purse.  no money missing, all credit cards in place thankfully.  thank you sir whoever you are!"

AF3SAZJ,female,27,"""CAKE FIGHT"" someone screams amongst the chaos as I get a handful of cake smashed into the side of my head.  My reaction?  A handful of cake thrust at the 12 year old who trashed my hair with frosting and bits of chocolate cake.  ""Thwap"" was the noise it made as it crashed against her neck and stuck to her and started to slide down.  The other one stuck her hands in the cake and squished the frosting between her fingers, where that cake landed I don't' know.  But my next endeavor was smearing my frosting covered hand all over her face and neck, making sure I rubbed it in real nice.  It started as a playful joke.  I was helping Stacy's mom with one of the grad cakes and as I turned to set it down on the table it started to slide of the platter.   I made a quick recovering but in the process my 4 fingers ended up stuck in the side of the cake.  My other hand had grabbed the other side as the cake smashed into a cabinet. But I saved the cake with minimal (or a little above minimal) damage.  I was squatting down laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.  Luckily everyone was laughing with me instead of getting angry!  In a playful gesture I took my frosting covered fingers and swiped them all over Dale's face.  Ha ha ha right?  Apparently when you've got a bunch of 11 through 14 year olds in a room, it's not a good idea to smear frosting on someone's face because before I could say boo the kids had their hands in that cake and declared a cake war with me being the target.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life.  Cake on my legs, my shorts, my shirt, my neck, my face, my hair...but it was Yu-u-u-mmy.   12 DAYS!"
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Another one bites the dust here at the great factory o' crap.   But I want to write about my pleasant weekend and thank all those who were involved =)  Friday:  Comedy Cafe on the agenda.  Little did I know I was being set up on a sort of blind date.  I found that out around 2:30 in the afternoon.  My roomie was setting me up with her new guy's best friend.  My review, he's tall, he's cute, he's got a good solid career, he's into motorcycles and motor cross, he's attentive, he's generous and an all around nice guy.  We had a fun night with everyone at ""The Corner Bar and then off to the Comedy Cafe where we lost most of our crowd.  Only about 6 of us made it back to the Corner Bar where more drinks were had and more darts were played.    Saturday:  After waking up in a strange apartment in a strange bed I slowly remembered the four of us crashing at dude's downtown apartment.  Don't worry mom, I was a good girl.  After hitching a ride in his convertible Miata this fella asked me to lunch.  We decided to tag along with the roomie and her two little cousin's to Kopp's after I freshened up a bit.  At Kopp's we were asked  to join them bowling.  We went.  Roomie's brother, we'll call him Alchi, hit on me relentlessly and finally gave up when I beat him arm wrestling (ok I cheated).   After bowling, dude went home and so did we.  I then accompanied the roomie, her new guy, the two kids and invited CPA along to the Brewer's game.  I must say it was an awesome game and I got me a Scott Pacendick bobblehead.  Good day good day.  Cancelled my evening plans with Teaser and Ghetto Girl to stay home and watch ""Jumanji"" with the chitlins.    Sunday:  CAKE WAR! Can't wait to get the pictures back!  Then I highlighted Kit Kat's hair.  Apparently the jury is still out on the results though.  Hmmm, I wish it was Saturday again.  Hmmmm, 12 DAYS!!   Hmm, I wish I wasn't at work.  Hmmm, I'm easily distracted as usual.    Ciao bella."
AF3SAZJ,female,27,"Sleepy, Excited, Crazy Magnet face today.  Went out AGAIN last night.  And am going out AGAIN tonight.  Haven't done the during the week thing in a while, and after this week I probably won't do it for a long time AGAIN!  Watched my boyz play softball last night and headed out to celebrate their loss.  I had some strange conversation with Big C last night.  Rehashing things that happened 4? 5? years ago after which he told me about S's reaction to seeing M a short time ago...must say I wasn't expecting to hear any of that at all!  I was smiling that S still has that passion...um or something like that for lack of a better word.  When ghosts from your past make an appearance in such strange ways it makes you think about everything you do.  What will what I do today effect events in my future?  I sat up last night and thought about the last 5 or so years of my life and realized just how much I fuct things up...with so many people...I think I'm relationship retarded."
D0SIWII,female,16,What we love to do we find time to do.  --John L. Spalding  i think maybe that will be my motto next year. or i will try to make it so.
D0SIWII,female,16,"okay, so today i was writing emily a note in euro during our movie and michele looks over and...when she was knew i was aware that she had noticed the ""emily-"" at the top, she unexpectedly said: ""its futile"" and i dont think i said anything...just a thoughtful, determined silence...but i looked at her to acknowledge her comment ""does she ever write back?"" ""no"" ""you know, ill bet somewhere up in heaven theres this big pile of all the good things amanda does for emily"" and there might have been a bit more to that conversation but i dont remember it.  i hardly said anything. i almost told her i didnt care if it was futile and that i only truly fail if i give up, but i didnt. silence is good too, sometimes.  it was kind of depressing though...cause here i was...all decided that i wouldnt be too sad that i couldnt see emily tonight, because i was gonna call her and talk to her on the phone for a while...and that would be good in its own way. after all, its not the action of us going somewhere to do something that i care about, its talking to her. and phones help with that. too bad she never gets online anymore. and so i was writing this note to her and being all....not mopey.... and being constructive and thinking positive and trying to do all i can to fix everything and....and...all that. but then out of nowhere micheles like ""you know, its not going to help"" and what?!? nononono. dont tell me that. i mean, her opinion doesnt motivate me to give up or anything, but... it kind of made me sad. though she did say the bit about God keeping track of all the things i do to try and be a good friend to emily, so maybe that balances out the negativity of the first comment... if shes going to praise my efforts that would mean she thinks its good that i keep trying at it, right? i dunno, man, i dunno...   You think God smiles on my efforts at being a good friend...however fruitless?   i dunno...just...an interesting interaction....  and i wish they werent so negative on emily... be a little understanding--im trying to be. she has her own life. she has a right to be concerned with her life...gotta deal with your life before other peoples'. stuff like that. i dunno. she doesnt mean to hurt me....and its not her that ever does...its lack of her. you know? i dunno. i dont understand what she does sometimes, and i dont always like it, but i respect her waaaaaaaaaaay too much to be mad at  her  for this unpleasantness. shes still a good kid. if she wasnt, i woudlnt care so much about seeing her. and she deserves her sleep. and her boyfriend. and maybe not her homework, but she deserves to take what accelerated honors ap crazy hard classes she wants and be as busy as she can stand if it makes her happy. so lets not hate emily because amanda misses her and never gets to see her. hate her schedule and her desire to be busy, but dont hate her.  not that anyone does...but... i dunno.   and i dont know ho much sense this makes anymore cause im really tired and im going to bed.  since she was sleeping when i called tonight, i think im gonna call tomorrow just to talk and propose the journal idea. heres hoping it is well received."

D0SIWII,female,16,"Hey, now they got these crazy fonts and  colors and stuff check that out. amazenering.         Anyway, i thought i should post. as i have some free time waiting for eSTEVE to get out of the shower and then tell me whats going on tonight.        So Tuesday i got myself out of fencing, but into trouble, so that wasnt so great. but i did get to watch i love the 90s. so...score? i dunno. i didnt do much on tuesday. i almost got together with emily (pasch) but not cause after she did her stuff she didnt feel like going out again or something. but i did get to talk to her and hear her talk back to me after having not done that for almost 2 weeks. which was nice. i got a new game boy game cause i recently decided im going to start actually using my game boy some more cause soem of the games i have are genuinely entertaining and i did pay good money for them at some point.         Wednesday... ah yes, Emily drove me to the library. MY library. and i returned my pirate book and we looked at the kids books and adult books and neither of us got anything and i discovered theyre selling a bag full of 12 romance novels for only $1.00! how cool is that? i told liz. shes excited. i hope one of us buys them before theyre gone. hehe. aaaaaand... hmm... emily drove me to the cool park by the mall. Deerpath park? or something? but they have this awesome playground called ""Kids Castle"" and it had monkey bars and so much cool stuff. and a tire swing! and emily and i...especially emily... and fun on the tire swing and got dizzy and sick. so then we played on the regular swings. and we laughed at the little kids. and then the big kids came and talked to us and we made a friend...oh, what was her name? christine? crystal? something like that... aaand... the one kid didnt believe we were 16 so we showed him our drivers licenses but he said he was older than us anyway. (and where was his license? exactly.) aaaaaaaaaand...then we went to the mall to get smoothies which werent really all that great but its okay cause we were both thirsty after the hot park and the hot car ride to the mall. and theeeeeeen... we went to kb toys to look at the little kids toys and we laughed at the new hard games and talked about toys we had when we were little and it was fun. and then we got candy from the candy store. and then i showed emily that american eagle moved a long time ago and then we argued about whether aeropostale moved or not and what happened to that corner? and then i went home and slept and then i went to fencing which was not fun but not horrible cause we fixed weapons for a while. and then on the way home i stopped at caribou and got a mint cooler or something and i saw jenna so i stopped and talked to jenna and her friend liz for a little bit. which was cool. and then i went home and slept some more.   and then THURSDAY... i didnt do much either... i figured out what was going on with great america and was happy that everybody wasnt going without me and emily still might be able to take us later. i went to the dentist. that was boring. i came home and slept. then i went to fencing and it sucked and i didnt like it. then i came home and read all quiet on the western front and watched i love the 90s from wednesday and thursday.   Friday... i got up and showered and went downstairs and found my mom looking at old pictures of me when i was little so i looked too for a little bit... and then i called emily to see if she was sleeping over or not... and then i went to deerpark and got my hair cut... and then i came home and slept. and then i called emily again. and then she said she was going to sleep over. and i was very happy. and then i cleaned my room and watched mrs. doubtfire till she came over and then we talked for a little while and listened to her los lonely boys cd cause its like the only cd shes ever bought. and then i showed her my pictures and then we played outburst and i learned julie would never play games with emily when they were little cause julie was always reading. stupid julie. and i learned... that emily doesnt really like martha. but not really. and that kara's a bad musician. (not kara kara, other kara) and...that Emily doesnt like evan enough to say theyre good friends with evan... poor evan...and that she hates julie. but not really. but i already knew that. then we listened to some more music and talked some more and i learned a bunch more stuff. and eventually we slept. and bob magically appeared next to me during the night. sounds boring, but i enjoyed it mucho.   and today we got up at 9:30 and talked some more and she went home at 11 and i let her borrow Shakespeare in Love cause apparently they have a DVD player now and i cant stand watching movies with her cause i then i cant talk to her...so the only movies i ever want her to watch are the really good ones... but those are the ones i really cant talk through or shell miss it and i want her to see it. so i didnt want to watch sakespeare in love cause i would lose 2 hours of talking aaaaaand it would probably make her sleepy. i tried to get her to watch it in tucson but she fell asleep. stupid emily. you only had to pay attention for 2 movies! bah! but its okay cause i told her to take it home and watch it. huzzah. i solved my problem. and then today i went out and bought some bagels cause i really wanted to yesterday but 22 and its closedness scared me. and...then...later im gonna do something with emily and heather i think. not sure whats up with that yet. but we'll find out. and now since emilys in the shower and emilys not online and heather doenst know whats up, im gonna go sleep for a little bit. or osmething. cause im tired. cause i had emily sleep over. yaaaaaay! :-D       As for the important questions: one no, and one maybe. which is good."
D0SIWII,female,16,Oh. My. God.  CrAzY day.  i feel absolutely insane. and mentally unstable.   and i miss emily sooooooooo much.   and my life is so f*cked up. and i want to go back to the summer after 8th grade when there was no doubt in my mind that this would ever happen.  I swear it will be a miracle if i dont cry in english tomorrow.
D0SIWII,female,16,"okay, i never actually meant to publsih the thing on change and the thing on faith in change or whatever...i just kind of wrote them and ""post""ed them (which means it shouldnt show up when other people read my blog, but i can see it) so that i could decide later how i wanted to rewrite them or if i wanted to actually publish them, cept it seems to somehow have posted them both for me...i tried to get rid of the faith one cause i didnt even finish typing that (it was late...i fell asleep) but i dont know if it worked...so basically im just informing everyone who bothers to read this that i didnt mean for those to be on here, but if they still are, well...i tried getting rid of them and it didnt work. so just ignore it or read it anyway...do what you want."

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"coffe count: XXX    ""music, makes the people, come together"" ~madonna, music  I have just bought a Tchaikovksy greatest hits CD during lunch break. I was in this CD shop and was browsing through the collection when i saw the classical  CD collections. I was thinking of expanding my CD collection to other stuff when i saw the CD. I got it quite cheap for RM39. I have listened to some of tchaikovsky's work before. Mainly from an old flame's CD collection and also from  urlLink swan lake , (the all male swan version).

Suffice to say that I had a very good time there. The snorkeling trip was excellent. You don't have to go far to get to the coral reefs. It was pretty shallow and the fishes are very tame. They practically charged at you while you were snorkeling. Too bad I didn't get a chance to dive. In my next island trip I will make sure that I will get to dive.  I managed to play a few rounds of beach volleyball on Saturday at the resort. I saw that they were short of people so I just joined the game. I didn't get to know their names!! hehe. It was very good fun, I haven't played volleyball for a very long time. I paid the price the next day when my whole body ached!! (note to self: stretch and warm up before doing anything strenuous), but it was worth it.  On the way back, I stopped by at  urlLink Samsara Spa  of Swiss Garden, Kuantan for a massage and a scrub.

Q09F1DZ,male,24,"coffee count: XX   Life generally sucks, believe me. I am not pessimistic but this is reality. People would say the grass is always greener on the other side, that just means the grass on this side sucks and i would like to go someplace else that is better, being a cow doesnt help either.           So what would you do if life sucks? make lemonade if people throw you lemon, make the best out of it. It is no use being bogged down by life's problem, be it work or personal. Love lost, broken heart? be thankful that you did love someone and you still have a heart to love in the future. Things are not working out the way you planned it? view them as a challenge you can overcome.      It is a sign of a great person if you could climb back after you fall down."
Q09F1DZ,male,24,"Coffee count: XXXX    I've been robbed!!   I was fiddling with my lap top, tinkering with the presentation that I am about to do in about 5 minutes when 3 men barged in to the room. 2 of them were armed with a gun, one with a revolver, the other with an automatic gun. The third person went straight to where I was sitting and had my neck locked in a flash and he went for my wallet. The whole thing happened in less than a minute and they were gone. I was forever traumatised and could not really fiddle with my laptop afterwards. Hence the long break in the postings.  Now that I have your attention, the whole thing did happened, it is just that it was a mock robbery staged by the police during a meeting with my colleagues. That was part of the HSSE(Health, Safety, Security & Environment) issue highlighted. What to do when you are in such situation. The right thing to do is COPS. Calm, Obey, Picture & Safe guard.  Calm:  Stay calm and don't panic and don't pee in your pants  Obey:  Obey what the robbers tell you, don't put up a fight. Your life is worth more than what you have in your wallet  Picture:  Remember how the robber looks like, what he was wearing, any distinguishing features (moustache, scar, accent etc)  Safe guard:  Ensure that the crime scene is kept clear until the police arrived. Don't let those kepoh people contaminate the crime scene.  On another note, there will be this very big convention that I am going to next week in Putrajaya. On Sunday though I will be playing volleyball for my office. There is this inter office games carnival and I volunteered myself to volleyball. God I have not played for so long....

The final nail in the coffin came from the GM himself, when he saw me on the first day. I think it is all because of this new hair do, I have it cropped very,very short. I think i need to go on a diet, to get loose all those weight that I have gained when i started work.

5QXUY9G,female,25,"i'm just feeling a little beat down by the game right now, that's all.  boy meets girl, dating, hook ups, attraction, flirting, one night stands.  all of it.  there is no middle ground in the rules of love.  there are highs, there are lows, but no fucking middle ground.  relatively, i've had it somewhat easy in my dating career.  i've seen some doozies.  i'm currently witnessing some doozies.  and if i wanted to look at it that way, i guess i've had it somewhat easy.  however right now, it doesn't feel easy.  it feels frustrating, lonely, unfair, frightening, lopsided, confusing, and heavy."
5QXUY9G,female,25,"i got up this morning at 6 am and went to town lake to run.  it was dark when parker and i got there.  about 10 minutes into our run, we got to watch the sunrise over downtown austin.  it was incredible.  i'm not sure parker even noticed it go from dark to light, but i sure did.  i'm now running the 4 mile loop three to four times a week.  i never understood the attraction people had to running.  in my original observation of the exercise, it just looked painful and uncomfortable to me.  i adopted running into my life about three months ago, and have a whole new outlook on it now.  it is fulfilling, enjoyable, and beneficial.  off the subject, i apologize for my sporadic, perhaps boring writing the last few months.  it's not that wonderful, exciting things aren't happening in my life.  i think for a long period of time (this includes the span of time when my blog was born) things were fun and crazy, but not all that real.  things have become really real for me lately, so i've been dealing with a lot of it on a much more internal level.  but, don't wonder (as i'm sure you all have been).  i am having a REALLY good time.  making new friends, dating, and growing.  the here and now is positive, my outlook is positive.  can't ask for more than that."

5QXUY9G,female,25,deep thoughts have entered my mind this morning...  i love that i work in an industry where i can use the word unit.
5QXUY9G,female,25,"for once, there is more activity in my professional life than my personal.  i got a promotion at work last week.   leasing and marketing manager .  i have an 'and' in my title.  did you ever think that would happen?  my manager and regional manager called me in for a ""meeting"" where i was flooded with compliments and praise (just what my spirit needed after a few weeks of unnecessary drama) and then offered this new opportunity.  i am so fortunate to be in an industry that suits me so well.  it's my home.  my personality and talents are used to their fullest extent (this one's too easy brian and terri).      thursday, margaritas and mexican food with two girlfriends, that have been in my life since age five, to celebrate kaley's birthday (reference previous post about her deaf parents here).  i can honestly say they've been around for everything.  they just don't make 'em like that anymore.  friday, after a full day of productivity, i headed out to gina's house (the boss) on the lake to celebrate another friend's birthday.  mary, joseph, and jesus can that woman cook.  we swam, played cards, smoked cigars, and ate like it was our last meal before going to the chair.  saturday, the original crew (better known as the joy boys plus us fag hags, only better looking than your stereotypical fag hags) got together at a wine and tapas bar to celebrate the beautiful carey's birthday.     sidenote: holy fuck with all the cancers.  that's why this world is so fucked up.  we have an excess of people born between june 21st and july 22nd.  or perhaps i just attract a lot of these moody, sensitive crybabies in to my life.  (just jokes my precious little crab friends.  i've got nothing but love for you.  and you know this, man.)        saturday night (brace yourself, this might come as quite a surprise) we got a little bit out of control.  you know if you have to take your heels off to remain balanced (and by that i mean stand) you might want to slow down a bit.  after reaching the conclusion that one should no longer be in public when they can no longer stand without support, we headed to james' house for a little homosexual sleepover.  i woke up with my shoes in one room, my shirt in another, and my skirt in the bathroom.  why does this never happen to me at a straight man's house?  as my brother put it in his precious-abby-no-no-side-voice when i was telling him of our wild saturday night ""so amber, you threw caution to the wind.""  i'd say.     my horoscope told me that it was time for me to go after my object of desire.  which got me thinking of all the boys i currently have a crush on.  for fuck's sake, when i list them in my mind like that, i realize what a walking boner i am.  i think i'm going to change my criteria from breathing and good teeth.  i've started work on my 'list' at the recommendation of a good friend.  (number 19 on the list: owns underwear that is not overly worn, stained or holey.  and preferably no cartoon characters)     i started practicing yoga recently, and now i know what all the fuss is about.  if i sound really grounded and centered right now, that's cause i've been in the downward dog for the past hour.     thank goodness my posts are logical and not at all random these days.   i just realized,  i have another cancer birthday party to go to this friday night.  that makes like 10.  too weird.     note to nicole:  i love you"
5QXUY9G,female,25,"horseback riding jacked my shit up.    after james and my slumber party friday night, we awoke and saddled up the horses for my first ride in over 8 years.  my friend sternberger (of whom i'm trying to get in the habit of introducing as 'chris') came by my mom's to join us.  i rode boots (who gallops at free will), sternberger rode helen (who stops at free will), and james rode whiskey (who bucks people off at free will).  we had a really nice ride, even trespassing like the true shoot 'em up cowboys that we are.  the dogs worked hard to keep up.  bailey (chris' dog) sought shade almost as often as helen stopped and refused to take one.further.step.  i almost fell off the horse once, at which the boys just laughed.  and i saw places beyond the ferris' ranch i never saw in all my 20 years i spent growing there.    saturday night the only goal was to not spend any money.  and to get intoxicated.  the only thing we could come up with to keep within those guidelines?  sit on the porch.  so we did just that.  a pain killer and a few glasses of iced goodness, and our evening's company was sufficiently freaked out.  i wish my roommate wouldn't of mentioned some of my past illicit drug use to his innocent ears.  we were at club porch sit until the wee hours of the morning before turning to the bed for preparation for what might be my sorest day to date.  riding makes muscles sore in my body i never knew i had, and surely i don't need to use for any activity other than horseback riding (hence this being the first time i can recall knowing about them).  sunday, inbetween repeating ""ow, my back"" when there was any lapse in conversation or noise, sylvia and i ventured out to sport our domesticicty, seeking plants and things that hold plants.  for our porch, of course.  sylvia bought me the most perfect, amazing, beautiful, green, pink plant goodness for my birthday (i taught her well in the art and purpose of giving belated gifts.  actually i'm just a procrastinator and horrible at gift buying.  but my excuse is always that everyone gives people gifts the day of the event.  mine is more significant and memorable coming several days after the fact).  anyhow back to the vine, of which the name is currently slipping my mind (and i won't get up right now to go check the tag for the name of it because my roommate already thinks i'm a freak and that it is funny that i am so excited about some fucking vine with pink flowers and this would just give her further proof that i am a freak and that things like fucking vines with pink flowers makes getting up in the morning a little easier for me).  but yeah, we went shopping and we bought a vine.  and some cd's, including n.e.r.d.'s newest cd.  track seven rocks the house.  i squeezed in a run and some dominoes on the porch before retiring to what has been a stretch of nightmareless nights (this just dawned on me).  only pleasant dreams here.  monday, tuesday, and this day have been dedicated to working and working out.  not really any concrete examples to offer or recent events, but it's foremost on my mind today, so i'll talk about it here.  recently, i've become really aware of how much my job and the people that also work at the place i call my job affect me.  we are such a close group of strangers, yet not close at all.  it's a strange mix of characters (all of whom are going to be protected here), but we just work.  i have learned more at 12100 metric blvd than i've ever learned in any other environment (not including any environment containing my family).  i'm really thankful for my job.  for my job paying me, understanding me, and putting up with me.  but more than anything, putting up with me.  sometimes i have a hard time putting up with myself.  and humoring me with laughs at my need to be a smartass every 46 seconds.    i apologize for the overuse of parenthesis tonight.  btw, sylvia (who happens to be under 5 feet tall(i apologize, but that doesn't mean i'm going to stop using them)(okay, now i'm doubling up on parenthesis...i think i might have a problem)) just got upset with me for suggesting we get a stepping stool so that she can reach the top shelf of the cabinets."

N8USHL4,female,24,"i've been getting a lot of inquiries since my last post about what exactly a 'drant' is.  i'm sorry.  i thought it was common knowledge that a drant is a dress worn over pants (not to be confused with the infamous skant-- skirt worn over pants).  the drant is the province of hippies and faux hippies.  oftentimes you'll find loathesome hipsters sporting the drant/skant situation proudly as well...only in a dirtier, more rackish way.    anyone that knows me can see i'm certainly by no means a hippie.  i hate peace and love and dirt.  i like to wear real shoes and i hate the dead.  no, thanks.  shrugging off the hipster monicker is a little harder b/c, while i don't see myself as a hipster...i guess i do like their style of dress to the point of mild emulation, occasionally can be found listening to their music, and i like irony just as much as the next gal.  so, there you have it.  HOWEVER, i have always come out strongly against the drant.  it's been second in rantings-per-sighting only to the infamous backless shirt (which i will never approve of).    why did i do it, you ask?  well, the way i saw it, i simply didn't have a choice.  i was late to work, had no other clean clothes, and that dress was far too short to wear solo to work.  i'm not a prostitute after all!  what would you have done in my situation?  that's right-- you would have grabbed a pair of black pants, threw them on under your dress, and strode down the street like you knew exactly what you were doing and why.  this is new york city after all.  i've seen people wandering the streets in leg warmers, teddies, chainmail vests...i even once had an encounter with a guy wearing a filthy, tattered ball gown and combat boots.  granted, that guy was a heroin addict proposing marriage to me in washington square park for giving him a dollar.  but, he was still working his ensemble.  in the end, i think i'm going to have to eat my words.  that outfit was damn comfortable.  and cute, to boot.  i'm mos def gonna be rocking it again in the not-so-distant future.  so, when i said i hate drants, i guess i lied.  what else is new?"

N8USHL4,female,24,"i no longer have a cell phone.  it's been exactly 16.5 hours and i can barely function.    but, discussing our culture's dependency on digital technology is not the point of this blog.  please.  what do you take me for?  an intellectual?  hardly.  i'm a cantankerous old fool.  and i'm about to get grouchy with it--  why don't i have a cell phone?  let me explain.  see, when i moved to new york from atlanta, i thought it was too much of a hassle to bother with changing my number.  until about 2 weeks ago when jason casually asks me how much i pay for my cell service.  when i admitted it was a whopping $80, he was dumbfounded and told me that as soon as my contract runs out, i should switch to a more reasonable company.  turns out, my out-of-state number was racking up some serious fees and surcharges.  thanks for nothing, sprint!    contract.  you raise an interesting point, john...  turns out, my contract expired 2 years ago.  i was in the clear!  so, being the genius that i am, i decided to not waste any time and cancel my sprint service immediately.  why the hell not, right?  in my haste, i failed to set up replacement service for when sprint was over.    instead, i thought-- it'll take two seconds.  i just walk into the verizon office, put down my cash and walk out with a new phone and plan.  oh, i'm so naive.  on friday i went to the verizon store to enact my brilliant plan.  i picked out the cutest phone in the store, filled out the requisite 9000 forms, and braced myself for my brand-spanking-new '917' phone number.  sadly, it wasn't two seconds after the verizon guy took my forms and entered them into his computer that he went from jolly sales guy to disapproving sales guy.  he gave me his gravest face and said,, ""due to your lack of credit, you'll have to put down a $1,000 deposit to get a phone today.""    i responded the way any rational person would in that situation.  i said, ""say what, sucka?!"", grabbed my forms back, and ran out of that store.     so endeth my sad tale.  and, with it, my days of easy accessibility.    not having a cell phone is kind of like being in olden times.  maybe i'll start writing letters.    or, you know, get my mama to open an account for me."

AH4BJED,male,25,"Back in Boston.  Cold.  I saw ""Bowling for Columbine"" last night.  I liked it, thought it was very entertaining and parts of it were thought-provoking.  But what confused me a bit was the point Michael Moore was trying to make.    (Warning: Non-specific spoilers ahead)    The overall message was ""there's too much gun violence in America,"" which makes sense enough, and the data holds that it's the case that more people in America are killed by guns than anywhere else (although the documentary conveniently uses raw numbers instead of adjusting for population when comparing the US to other countries -- needlessly, really, because the numbers are much higher here regardless so why even try and mislead).  But his explanations as to why seemed contradictory.    He argued (1) It's not just because we have more guns, because other countries have lots of guns, like Canada, and nowhere near as much gun violence.  Then he argued (2) It's not because of lax gun control laws and too many bullets for sale -- because, again, Canada has similar laws and easy availability of bullets (although he spends a chunk of the film focusing on the fact that Wal-Mart and K-Mart sell bullets, and isn't that a shame -- which it is, I agree, but he contends it's not the reason for gun violence -- so why spend so much time on it).  (3) He doesn't blame violent TV, movies, and video games.  He says Japan has more, and they don't shoot each other.  And he spends a segment interviewing Marilyn Manson and trying to convey the point that he's not the reason kids shoot each other.  So we end up at (4) A culture of fear.  We have more gun violence because our TV news focuses so much on violence and fear.  BUT, he admits we have more gun violence.  So that's kind of why it's on TV.  They don't make it up.  So I guess he's arguing that it's a cycle that feeds itself.    But gun violence was high here before the emergence of the mass media and hysterical local newscasts.  And he doesn't present any actual evidence to show that fear spurred on by local newscasts leads people to shoot each other.  And then he spends a chunk of time talking about a 6-year-old who shot a classmate in Michigan.  Because he found a gun at his uncle's house.  I can't find the connection between this and the TV news.    He also takes a segment to blame welfare-to-work programs for gun violence, which I couldn't quite follow -- I guess he was saying that taking parents out of the house gives the kids more time alone to find guns and then go shoot people with them... but why welfare-to-work is different from just normal work isn't clear to me, and it was not at all clear that he was arguing that parents shouldn't work at all.    Nevertheless, despite my problems with the logic, it was thought-provoking and entertaining.  Definitely worth my two hours and ten dollars.  The New York Times liked it too but had similar reservations with the logic.  From their  urlLink review:   ""Mr. Moore vacillates between acknowledging their complexity and giving in to his own urge to simplify. He dismisses a number of possible answers out of hand. Is violent popular culture to blame? No, because in a country like Japan, with a tiny fraction of our gun deaths, people consume super-brutal movies, video games and comic books with even more voracity than we do. Poverty? No, since Canada and many European nations have much higher unemployment rates and much lower homicide rates. Is it our history of warfare and brutality? Compared with imperial Britain and Nazi Germany, he suggests, we're downright pacific.    ""But each of these assertions rides roughshod over some obvious doubts and qualifications. Unemployment, in countries with more extensive welfare states than ours, is not necessarily the same as poverty, and the wholesale brutality of states and empires engaged in wars of conquest is not the same as the retail mayhem of armed individuals.  ""But though he seems to be hunting for a specific historical cause for events like Columbine, Mr. Moore, when it serves his purposes, is happy to generalize in the absence of empirical evidence and to make much of connections that seem spurious on close examination. Several times he notes that the Columbine shootings occurred on the same day as the heaviest United States bombing of the Kosovo war. The more you think about this coincidence, the less it seems to mean."""
AH4BJED,male,25,"TO: All members of the firm RE: Appropriate and inappropriate interview questions  With recruiting season upon us, I wanted to ensure that we do not repeat some mistakes from the past, as well as ensuring we do not run afoul of the law.  Please heed the following points carefully, especially if you're disabled, since you're the first ones we'll fire in a downturn anyway.  1. It is very important to be sensitive to issues of race.  Do not acknowledge the candidate's race in any way, even if you have the best intentions in mind (e.g., examples from last year, telling a student who was either Scandanavian or just had really fair skin how the salary will allow him ""enough money to visit the Nordic homeland,"" or insisting the firm ""needs you for the diversity brochure."")  However, if you do find yourself making a reference to someone's ethnic background, please at least be accurate.  Recall the problem last year when Don asked the slightly overweight Canadian student if he was a sumo wrestler, leading to a puzzled reaction.  Finally, do not overcompensate with hyperbole.  ""I have never met a person like you I didn't like"" is not appropriate small talk.  Especially not when followed up with, ""of course, I live in a gated community and my father was a Nazi.""  2. Similarly, gender is a very sensitive area.  Despite what normally passes for appropriate talk in the office, do not refer to female candidates as ""bitches.""  Please keep that kind of language limited to non-interview situations or when the candidate is not within earshot.  Also, references to how much you would like the chance to get a particular candidate pregnant are usually not appropriate, with some exceptions (see Appendix A).  Finally, don't tell any female candidates about the mandatory sterilization for first-years.  3. It is unfortunate that 'political correctness' has made it impossible for us to continue using our old evaluation scale ('genius,' 'normal,' 'retard').  Instead, we will use numbers corresponding to those three levels: ""1,"" ""2,"" and ""absolutely not, due to apparent mental illness, or just doesn't seem Protestant enough.""  Please stick to those terms.  4. Don't tell Jewish candidates about the annual pig roast.  When in doubt, assume all candidates from Ivy League schools are Jewish.  5. Moving on, please refrain from using stereotypes about certain undergraduate institutions when conducting the interview.  ""I see you went to the University of Florida.  I think I saw you in a Girls Gone Wild video"" is not appropriate for an on-campus interview, although standards are more flexible during call-backs.  6. Do not vomit on the candidates.  Even if they are ugly.  Thank you for your attention to these matters.  Especially the morons on floor 17."
AH4BJED,male,25,"I'll soon be posting from elsewhere for ten days or so.  Next week is ""fly-out"" week, when basically everyone goes to whatever city (or cities) he or she is interviewing in and does callback interviews.  Or, in the case of 3Ls with offers they've accepted or 2Ls not taking part in the process (there are a few...), it's a week-long vacation to wherever.  I know one person going to Hawaii and another to Paris.  I am not.  It is nice that Harvard's schedule allows for this, though -- I hear there are lots and lots of schools that make everyone schedule the interviews around 3-day weekends, or miss classes, or other unpleasant stuff like that (perhaps you're thinking that having to miss class isn't unpleasant... and I suppose that's fair... but still, not having to deal with that is way more convenient).  The Office of Career Services had a session about what callbacks are like last week.  Unfortunately, they held it while on-campus interviews were still going on, and I had an interview.  Also unfortunately (for those that attended), I heard it was useless.  I was going to read up on the OCS web site about callback interviews, and whether callback is one word or there's a dash in the middle, but the password-protected section of Harvard's entire site appears to be down, or my computer is screwy.  Either way, whatever surely-valuable information is there is inaccesible to me.  The only solution?  I've got to write my own.  Bear in mind I've yet to have a callback interview, so this will not be useful to anyone looking for real information.  But what can you do?  JEREMY'S FIFTEEN RULES FOR CALLBACK INTERVIEWS  1. Only go to callbacks to which you have been invited by the firm.  While it may seem tempting to dress up in your favorite suit and go wandering through downtown wherever knocking on the doors of the firms that rejected you and trying to convince them that your name ought to be on the list, in order to spend hours and hours talking to their attorneys, who, in the end will figure out you shouldn't have been there and not give you an offer anyway, you're really just wasting your time and theirs.  Guidebooks that propose this as an appropriate interview strategy most likely were written by the same people who say that to get a high score on the SAT, you should always pick ""C.""  Everyone knows you should always pick ""B.""  2. It's probably a bad idea to schedule two callbacks in different cities in the same day.  Or at least at the same time.  Air travel has advanced by leaps and bounds since most of these big law firms were founded back in the days of Christopher Columbus (Did You Know: John Adams worked for 7 of the top 10 Vault-ranked firms in his day.  He kept getting fired for stealing office supplies!).  While you could theoretically interview in New York at 7 AM, be on a plane by noon, get to LA by 2 PM with the time change, interview at 3 PM and be in San Francisco for a late dinner, this strategy is ill-advised.  For some reason.  I can't remember why.  3. When a firm takes you to ""lunch,"" it's not really lunch.  It's a test.  To see if you are bulimic.  Big law firms have recently been in the news for promoting an unhealthy body image among young associates.  Rates of bulimia at corporate law firms have surpassed those at playgrounds, nursing homes, and construction sites.  Given this epidemic, law firms are now screening each candidate at a ""lunch"" to ensure healthy eating habits and a positive body image.  If you're invited for lunch, DO NOT, under any circumstances, go to the restroom at any point during the meal.  You will be followed.  You will not receive an offer.  Also: gratuitous intake of unhealthy food is encouraged at these meals, to ""prove"" you're okay with your appetite.  Eat pats of butter, by themselves.  Lick everyone's bread.  Steal food from partners' plates.  Get three desserts.  You'll get an offer, guaranteed!*  *note: the word ""guaranteed"" is mere puff and is not indicative of any actual guarantee about anything at all.  4. Lawyers LOVE off-color jokes.  Tell a lot of them.  Especially the one about the priest, the rabbi, and the Jehaovah's Witness.  They love that one.  5. All law firms operate on Greenwich Mean Time.  It's a little known fact.  But what this means is that unless your interview is in Greenwich (either England or Connecticut, both are fine), you'll need to set your watch differently.  A 10 AM interview is really at 4 in the afternoon!  I betcha didn't know that!  When you show up 6 hours late, the firm will congratulate you on your sophistication and understanding of complex legal matters like time zones.  Which are indeed very tricky.  A special problem on Monday, after the clocks change this Sunday (see, there IS something useful buried in here -- change your clock on Sunday! And every Sunday!)  6.-13. Some lawyers only have 8 fingers and toes.  Point that out to them.  It demonstrates your sharp legal mind.  And lets me quickly skip through 8 numbers quickly as I realize I'm hungry and won't be able to think of 15 things to write before lunchtime.  14. Urine sample.  Most firms will want a urine sample along with your transcript and three references.  It's very important to avoid going to the bathroom for 48 hours before your interview so that you'll be able to fill the three-gallon jug they will provide.  Anyone unable to fill the jug is automatically rejected, as per NALP guidelines and a recent National Board of Health directive entitled, ""Three Gallons is Just About Enough!"" (LEXIS, 2003).  15. Jokes about urine (see #14) are especially encouraged."
AH4BJED,male,25,"Here's something scary.  I just laughed at something in a contracts case.  I have become comfortable enough with reading these cases that I was actually able to find humor in a court's opinion.  This is very scary.  Let me try to share without being incomprehensible.  There's this case where a big company took out a loan from another big company, and the contract clearly says the company can't pay it off early.  But they want to pay it off early because interest rates have gone down and they're locked into a high rate.  So they sue, claiming that while the contract is clear, the intent of the parties when they signed it was to allow early payment -- and they have evidence they want to present regarding that.  The court wants to say no, this is ridiculous, you're stuck in your contract, you can't show us extrinsic evidence when the contract is so unambiguosly clear.  Go away.  But, there's a prior case where the court decided that words are never completely unambiguous and that one should always be able to show extrinsic evidence to determine intent.  So the court here is stuck.  Even though they really want to dismiss the case.  So the opinion says, ""While we have our doubts about the wisdom of [the prior case], we have no difficulty understanding its meaning,  even without extrinsic evidence to guide us .""  This is funny stuff.  This is laugh-out-loud law going on here.  And, yes, I realize how pathetic that makes me sound.  I have reached rock bottom: I am laughing at case law."

ME: Yeah WOMAN: What color were you thinking? ME: Ultra Lemon WOMAN: Yes, that's a nice color.  A litle acidic, though. ME: Oh. WOMAN: I was looking at your flyer.  I think Sun Yellow might be better.  You see, I'm a painter, and I know about colors and these things.  Sun Yellow is a very warm color.  Is your singing group co-ed? ME: Yeah. WOMAN: Yeah, Sun Yellow is a very androgynous color too.  I think you should go with Sun Yellow.  I used Sun Yellow.  The flyers look very nice."

AH4BJED,male,25,"Oh!  It's rare to have any sort of epiphany when reading something on a weblog, but, here, from Evan Schaeffer's  urlLink Notes from the (Legal) Underground :   Back in the office, I did something I rarely do, which was to ask for more time from opposing counsel to file a brief I should have filed yesterday. These requests for extensions are always granted--and I'm always willing to grant them for others--but I hate to ask for more time because I'm afraid it will develop into a habit. You mean there are extensions??  We spend all that time in Civ Pro learning about 20 days for this, and 10 days for that, and sanctions, and oh no!  And it turns out not only  can  you ask for an extension, but people do all the time, and they're granted, and it's just not that big of a deal?  Oh!"

1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I don't understand my fascination with making socks. I'm scared to death of double pointed needles, because every time I finish a hat with them I feel so awkward. I don't screw anything up, but I feel like I will any minute. And once the snow melts, I don't even wear socks unless I absolutely have to. My toes are freed at the first opportunity. So why my obsession with learning to make socks? I have all this sock yarn that I haven't even touched, because I'm apprehensive about trying.  Yes, I know it's only pulling loops of yarn through other loops of yarn, and it's not dangerous like open heart surgery or anything. But in my warped little mind, socks are the thing you have to be able to make to be able to say, ""Yes. I am a knitter."" Sweaters? Bah. I'm making one right now. It's just a hell of a lot of easy knitting. You increase and decrease when you're making hats, and I've made a ton of those. Lace? No big deal. Yarn overs are easy. Color work? Not really interested yet. Socks. OMG. You have to use those tiny double pointed needles, you have to use tiny little yarn, you have to *gasp* turn a heel and use short rows...damn. I will not be a knitter until I've made a sock. Well, preferably a pair of socks. Until then, I am just a random person who knits a lot. There is a subtle difference.  And I finally figured out what the deal was with my tension on my crochet scarf. I was leafing through my ""Learn to Crochet Fast and Save the World"" (okay, that's not really the title) book and found that I was putting my yarn over the hook in the wrong direction. So I made an effort to do it right and lo and behold, my stitches are looser and the scarf feels like a scarf and not a piece of particleboard! Rawk. (I'm still amazed by the size of this hook...it's 15 millimeters! I don't have knitting needles that big!)"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"Level 1 arrived in the mail today!  I barely want to touch it...I want to keep the instructions immaculate.  Yeah, I'm a dork.  I'm making myself clean the bathroom and computer room and finish Broadripple before I start it.  Hopefully tonight!"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"So here's my progress log for right now.  Almost done: Windy City Scarf (weave in ends) Blue/white Kitschy Kerchief (sew ties on, weave in ends) Booga bag (finish felting, block/dry, attach straps)  On the needles: Coney Island Fireworks Scarf (which I'm ignoring b/c I'm bored with garter stitch) Official Kittyville Hat (in some really scary cheap-ass Red Heart yarn...looks fairly cool, but needs some mega-softening--this one should end up being finished tonight)  Next up: Homespun hooded sweater Princess Snowball Cat Bed (from SnB) And maybe, if I feel really daring...socks. I'm scared of double point needles, but I want to learn to make socks, b/c, I mean, look at all the really cool self-striping sock yarn out there."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,Charlotte: 100% merino wool. Kelly's sweater: 80% acrylic/20% wool. Sarah's scarf: 75% acrylic/25% wool. Weather: hot and humid.  Is anyone else seeing anything wrong with this picture?   *digs for cotton*
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I went through my yarn stash last night, wrote down an inventory of all the yarn I have, and realized that I'm definitely making Christmas presents for people just to use a bunch of it up. Holy crap! I should go through it and figure out who would like what.  I made a lacy hat out of Cascade Yarns Fixation. I really enjoy working with this stuff. It's mostly cotton, with a bit of stretch to it, and you'd think with the extra stretch it would be hard to work with, but it's really not. You just have to make sure to keep your tension even. The colorway I used is a pale pastel rainbow, and it's nice. Very springy. It was an easy lace pattern too (yarn over, knit 2 together, repeat), so I got bored near the end. I want to make one in a more complicated lace, but I'll have to figure out the decrease pattern to blend in with the lace, as well as modify any lace pattern I find to work in the round, since most of them are written for flat knitting. BTW, I still hate double pointed needles, but they aren't as bad to finish something on as they are to start something on.  Kitty bed is going well. I'm probably a third of the way through the side of it, then comes the sewing. I should work on my sweater some more, I'll need it for the lab in the summer, since everyone here loves their AC."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"20 more rows to go on the Booga Bag. Haven't worked on it at all today...work, then hockey game. Though I might pick it up during the UMass-UNH game, as I'm not as excited about that...whoever wins, it'll be a good opponent for Maine tomorrow.  Got my yarn for Kool-Aid dyeing in the mail today. I'll have to wind the hanks later if I need something mindless to do.  What should I start for a project after I'm done with the bag?"
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"The stash is out of control. I've ordered the Koigu for Charlotte....yarn diet begins NOW. Not tomorrow, not after I check Patternworks.com one more time....NOW.  NOW.  I'll believe it when I see it."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"So I've started going through my yarn collection...Alas, I must sacrifice much of the Kureyon.  I'm only keeping the colors I absolutely love and know I will use.  I'm also going to get rid of some of the random wool (Colinette stuff, a couple skeins of Elaine, etc.) and some cotton blends.  Possibly some acrylic as well, not that I think people will really want it.  A bunch of the Fun Fur too.  So I have to get to the business of taking pictures of all the yarn and actually listing the stuff.  Dunno why, but eBay seems to be a pain to use.  Probably it's super-easy and my addled brain is making it harder than it actually is.  Weird sleep patterns will do that to ya.  The good part is, during the agonizing decision making I've been making some pretty good progress on Sophie.  16 rows left to the body, then the i-cord.  I ought to do some more on the sweater too.  I don't want to start anything new until I'm done with something.  My WIP list is way too long, even for KADD (Knitting ADD) me."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I ordered my yarn for Charlotte from Threadbear today. Rob sent me a picture of my colorway and I just keep opening it and looking at it and drooling....and drooling some more. Kelly said it looks like candy. I just want the yarn to come so I can start making it. I got a couple of skeins of Koigu from an eBay auction the other day--it feels sooooo nice.  Stocked up on cotton yesterday for hats and headscarves and things. I think before my trip I'm going to make a teeny Bottoms Up Bucket Hat for Son of Cousin (son's name eludes me at the time....Taylor I think?) I've got a blue ombre that would be super cute. I just have to finish up the one that's on the needles at the time, as soon as the replenishment yarn comes from Central Yarn this week sometime.  Found a pattern in my collection for a cap sleeve collared thingie that I think would be gorgeous in the Plymouth Fantasy Naturale I have in my stash...provided I have enough. Otherwise....oh darn, trip to the yarn store. The cap sleeves actually make me happy, for once, because I've already sunburned my shoulders once this spring, and maybe a bit of covering can help the sunblock."
1Z33ZR6,female,25,"I'm sewing up the seams on Shapely right now. I did the first one a few nights ago, and nearly stabbed myself in the eye repeatedly to relieve the pain. The second side seam seems (heh) to be going a little better.  I've found a couple girls to set up a Stitch and Bitch group with. I'm excited to find people who also knit. We're doing a yarn store field trip on Friday (during which I'm going to resist making a purchase) and then heading back to campus to knit in the Union. Yay!  EDIT: Shapely, she be done!!! w00t!!! She's a little clingy around the tummy, but fits nicely around the boobs and hips. The straps are a LEETLE wide for my taste, and I made the armholes SLIGHTLY too shallow, and the seams look like ass, mostly because my selvedge stitches suck, and I got bored with all the frickin' stockinette stitch by the end, but it's the first garment I've ever made!!! Pictures will happen at a later date, mostly because right now I'm lazy. I'm so impressed with myself right now!"
T10Q2TK,female,25,"Fasting for a day helps your body repair damage.  It also helps detoxify.  Fasting is also a way to practice self-control.  It is about exercising your mind and placing it in control of your body.  All the religions with which I am familiar incorporate some degree of fasting as a spiritual practice.  Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, First Nations spirituality.  I think fasting could be a useful way to promote greater will power and help quit smoking.  I will try a short water fast from Saturday 6pm until Monday 10am."
T10Q2TK,female,25,"Well, it looks like I am pretty much now alone and most people around have capitulated.  ""It ain't easy bein' green"", as Kermit D. Frog used to say.  But this morning I woke up and my lungs feel great.  I feel great, despite the Ouzo last night, and that's because I haven't been smoking.  I will not give in - but you guys will understand if I don't hang around at smoking parties as much as I used to.  Hopefully we'll find some smoke-free way of interacting like going for a walk or throwing gummi bears around."

T10Q2TK,female,25,"6th Day without Caffeine, 3rd without Nicotine.  I can feel my body detoxifying.  My lungs are clearing out already.  I am coughing, even though I didn't smoke last night.  I think I am coughing to get rid of toxins in my lungs.  I just want to say how important last night was for me.  Firstly, Calgary won.  Secondly, I broke the pattern of drinking and then giving into smoking.  It feels great to get schlammered in a smoke-free environment, go home NOT reeking like a cheesy bar, get a night of quality sleep NOT interrupted by the wafting gross smell of cigarette stench in my hair, NOT having a head-pounding cigarette hangover.    Instead I feel lovely.  It's a sunny day.  I am going for a walk to work for a few hours.  I will see if the Gummi Bear that I stuck to Alexander Keith's grave is still there.

T10Q2TK,female,25,What a lovely day.  I sat in my backyard and sunned.  Now I am going to paint.  And then I will barbecue.  Truly an all-Canadian Sunday.
T10Q2TK,female,25,"So here at the Agricola Method this is what most of our ashtrays are lookin' like these days. If you have been a watcher/participatant/cheerleader for/with us then don't be put off by the fact that some of us are weak, very weak. Frank Castle and Kiki are still going strong... and so can you!"

T10Q2TK,female,25,"Yes, Calgary lost.  So sad.  What can I say after watching the most hockey ever in my life only to see the team lose?  (Well, to be honest, I had been rooting for the Canadiens, but that's a secret.)  At least I can report that I drank a decent amount of liquour and did not give in (nor have) any urge for a cigarette.  Tomorrow is a new day.  Maybe we should focus on the upcoming election.  I will vote for the person with the best haircut."
T10Q2TK,female,25,"Last night was the worst. I am so unhealthy right now. From 3:30am to 12:00pm I was unable to get more than 5 minutes of sleep at a time. I just coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed. My head is pounding and I can't believe that my body is reacting this way. I feel like dog poo but I can't start smoking again cause then I'll have to do this all over again. Who wants to do this twice, three times, or four? Not me. A smoke sure would make me feel better though. I am one cranky bitch. Good luck today everyone. Don't let the weekend break you."
T10Q2TK,female,25,"""Sleep ways is right ways now"", a line (possibly I'm paraphrasing) from Clockwork Orange.  I am tired.  Today was difficult to keep from smoking, but I succeeded.  Thanks for everybody's support.  It means a lot to me."

After a quiet weekend in which we thought we had seen the last of 'Cliff the mong' he decides to give his violent and often weird relationship with out next door neighbour another go...much to our dismay!The guy is a fucking head case, he is like 'Begbie' from Trainspotting, but without the scottish accent.I dont think he lives next door now, but sort of visits when he needs to snort in privacy or drink dangerous amounts of booze whilst on a class 'A'. I dont want you thinking my street is rough, because its not. 99% of the people are really nice and me and Stace get on quite abit with them, Like Dave & Sam...great couple...and Kerry & Michael....

W824VM6,male,23,"In the news today , researchers have apparentley disovered that men do not suffer from a 'male menopause'. Thats right guys, so if your feeling down or you have a lack of libido then its not the menopause....its laziness....why does this sound like a women was researching it? ;-) I mean come on, are you girls the only ones who can have all the illnesses and us gents have nothing. We all know you have many illnesses like...not being able to throw a ball, run fast, play football (soccer)....but men have illnesses as well! Like not being able to lift the toilet seat, wearing underwear for more than a day and scratching pubic hair whilst in front of guests.   Quick Note from Stop Esso website - Greenpeace  Esso (ExxonMobil) is trying to get the world to believe that it has taken on a new, caring attitude on climate change and takes the issue seriously. But a number of organisations are waging a full-out war on US action on climate change. And the money they get from Esso has increased.  While Esso says it ""takes the issue of climate change seriously"", organisations like the George C Marshall Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Frontiers for Freedom are running an aggressive campaign against President Bush's ratification of the Kyoto protocol and continue to fight against any cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Many of them have also been fully behind the war on Iraq.  Over the past ten years, the company has spent millions of dollars bankrolling these groups, but in 2002 the support was ramped up, with funding for some groups increasing as much as ten-fold.  In November last year, ExxonMobil head of environment, Frank Sprow, told the media ""We need to do what we can to get the message across more clearly... We are trying to communicate that we see the risk."" Other execs from the company have tried to stress that they ""take the threat of climate change seriously.""  But just follow the money to see how hollow these statements are.  Last year, ExxonMobil funding for the Competitive Enterprise Institute jumped from $280,000 to $405,000. The CEI led the campaign persuading President Bush to stay away from the Earth Summit in Johannesburg (which he did). A letter to Bush from a coalition of right-wing groups assembled by the CEI claimed 'the least important global environmental issue is potential global warming, and we hope your negotiators can keep it off the table and out of the spotlight' (which they did). Guardian story  The CEI is also behind the Cooler Heads Coalition, chaired by former CEI director Marlo Lewis and directed by Myron Ebell, the CEI's Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy. The Cooler Heads Coalition was formed in 1997, 'to dispel the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific and risk analysis.'  They launched a legal action last year in an effort to bury an EPA report which admitted the existence of human-induced global warming and warned of the threat posed to the US. Bush called the report 'a product of the bureaucracy.'  The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) got a huge payrise from ExxonMobil, from $80,000 in 2001 to $193,200 in 2002. ALEC wrote to George W Bush after the Johannesburg Summit congratulating him on his ""tour de force performance""  ""We applaud your successful efforts to keep the Kyoto Protocol off the agenda"". See letter.  They also employed the arch climate sceptic scientist Patrick Michaels to write a paper ""Global Warming and the Kyoto Protocol: paper tiger, economic dragon"".  ( Will: just a thought .....but joining us to campaign will be a worthy thing...)"
W824VM6,male,23,"Ok, so its taken me ages to find any reviews of the Nickelback gig me and Stace went to in december but i have finnaly found one.   The Guardian / Online  Brixton Academy, London  Adam Sweeting Wednesday December 10, 2003  Rating 4/5  Maybe it's because they're from Vancouver, but Nickelback are a different species from the current wave of fashionable US metal. Whereas the likes of Korn or Staind sound so dark and diabolical that you could only imagine that they were saved in the nick of time from hanging themselves before they went onstage, Nickelback seem cheerful and well adjusted, and actually enjoy communicating with the crowd. It's amazing they've come as far as they have, but they've been canny enough to exploit a few reliable old tricks - like writing tunes and not playing everything so fast and heavy that it's like being crushed by a steel avalanche.  The Nickelback biography is littered with statistics and superlatives (the Silver Side Up album sold 40bn copies in 15 minutes, the band had to buy a new bus to keep all their Grammys in, blah blah), but their mega-anthem How You Remind Me is one of those songs you know backwards without having made any effort to listen to it. They played it tonight as an encore, and vocalist Chad Kroeger found he had no further use for his microphone since the crowd did all the work for him.  The 'Back have a useful batch of beefy, anthemic rock songs, among which we might pick out Breathe, Do This Anymore or the rather skilful Someday, and they can get heav-yyyy, as in the battered-wife saga of Never Again. But they also work hard to give the punters a value-added showbiz experience. Huge blasts of flame kept shooting up from the drum riser, threatening to incinerate both sticksman Ryan Vikedal and the lighting rig hanging above him, and the set was peppered with ear-splitting flashbombs. They sprayed the sweat-soaked front rows with water, and lobbed plastic glasses of beer into the balcony. The unplugged acoustic segment was prefaced by an interlude of darkness filled with some dialogue samples from Spider Man. When the lights came back up, the band launched into Hero, from the movie soundtrack. Kinda hammy, but was it brain surgery you were after?"

DSO5GN9,male,24,"In a daze  So, we had a canoe trip this weekend.  Went to Broken Bow, OK.  It was a great time.  I love camping and especially love being on the water.  I got a mild sunburn on my legs, but in the grand scheme of things it was worth it.  Woke up on Sunday, sped home so I could make it to a friend's wedding ceremony.  It is cool to see God bring two people together and to watch our church couple's group gather around to support them.  After the wedding (which was concluded by some awesome homemade mexican food) we spent time with some friends of ours from our ministry.  The parents help us out big time and the kids are involved.  We finished the night by watching Big Fish with some other pals. Our friend said this was one of his top movies of all time, so my expectations were high.  I found the movie entertaining and moving, but as with many things never truly being able to live up to grandiose expecatations.  So, here is where my daze comes from.  After such a long weekend I decided I would sleep in.  We went to bed at around 10:30 and I woke up around 11:30 this morning.  I am sure I needed the sleep, but man oh man, is my brain messed up!  I feel like I am in a cloud.  I feel like I could sleep for another 13.5 hours."
DSO5GN9,male,24,"Dreams   My friend  urlLink Robert  wrote this on his blog:  ""Everywhere around me I see dreams, ideas, and inventions. Everything I see, hear, touch, taste, smell, feel, and use once existed as nothing more than a dream in the mind of some idealist at another time, another place. Clothes, food, architecture, telephones, fax-machines, email, automobiles, sidewalks, skyscrapers, governments . . . all of these things at one point or another simply were not, but someone along the way had the courage to dream and now, they simply are. I cannot go anywhere, cannot do anything, without walking on the back of what once was sacred - what was once someone else's dream: I am surrounded by realities that at one time were only dreams . . . ""  My thoughts are as follows: I always wonder what dreams I have that may someday be reality.  I already feel the tug of ""maturity"" that is sucking the desire to dream away from me.  I want to continue to reach high and reach big. Dreams keep us creative, they keep us alive.  I think this is an essence of our Creator we have failed to capture in our theology.  God is big on impossibilities.  By that I mean He loves to work miracles with impossible situations.  I believe God loves to work miracles.  It is in His essence to blow the lid off our cenventional conceptions of time and space and possibilities.  Maybe miracles are the continuation of God's creative abilities on earth...God's dreams if you will."

DSO5GN9,male,24,"The Great Experiential Debate   Yesterday we had a debate in class about experiential elements of today's church.  Some people believe that having people experience God (through prayer exercises etc...) are diluting the Gospel and making experience more important than scripture.  Some of you, I'm sure, didn't even know this debate existed.  Reading the word of God is not the only way to take in the word of God.  In our current world experience IS worldview.  What a person experiences becomes what they believe.  Why don't we use that to our advantage and use scripture to create experiences that point people to Christ.  Thus, their experiences (of God through Biblical means) becomes their worldview.    Yes, scripture needs to be a guide, but Jesus' disciples didn't read Jesus' words, they heard them.  They saw the illustrations and tasted when Jesus made water into wine.  In fact, most Christians in History have NOT had a personal copy of the scriptures and they did just fine.  I am not advocating throwing the Bible out, but I am saying that we can take in God's word through other means than reading it.   Try taking a passage of scripture and rewriting it without using written words.  Take a hike with a large rock to symbolize your sin.  After carrying it with you for a while drop it and relate that experience with letting God have the weight of your sin.  There are plenty ways to take in God's word.  Here is an  urlLink experiential prayer website .  Check it out."

DSO5GN9,male,24,"Hot Dogs and Hearty Laughs  Kudos to Valerie for a wonderful night last evening.  It was her husband Jacob’s b-day so we headed to a Ft. Worth Cats game last night.  I don’t like watching baseball, but I really do enjoy going to a game with a bunch of friends.  Afterwards there was a fireworks display.  There is something tangibly American about going to a ball game, having a hotdog and peanuts, and watching fireworks.  The experience wraps you in a blanket of nostalgia that doesn’t leave you cold.  For the first time in a long time I felt exuberance for our country that I don’t often feel.  I tend to make my God my god, not my country, which leaves me with little patriotism at times.  Last night, however, was a much welcomed rift in that pattern.   Divine appointments  This morning, though I wanted to, I couldn’t sleep in.  Something kept saying to me, “Get up you lazy bum!”  So I got up and decided I would spend some quiet time with God while throwing a Frisbee golf disc around.  I figured I would get some leisurely exercise and be able to listen to God in between holes.  God had a different plan.  On the second hole I was walking up the hill searching for my wayward disc when a dog ran up to me.  Behind some trees I hear a voice say, “Have you seen a red disc anywhere?”  It was Claudio.  We ended up playing the rest of the course together.  It was fun and there was some good conversation.  I don’t get a chance to spend time with non-believers very much (working at a church and all) so the only place I see them is on the course.  Many of them are young guys with a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other.  Some are socially awkward but many are really nice guys.  I have decided that the disc golf course is my link with the outside world…a link that I desperately need.  I’m not out to be the Billy Graham of Zebo’s Frisbee Golf course.  I am, however, happy for guys like Claudio who keep me connected with a lost and dying generation.  After all, didn’t Jesus say, “Blessed are the disc throwers…”  I’m still trying to find the exact reference of that one."

2GXT57U,female,23,"Today I am going to write the most happy story in the world.   Begin:  The happiest day ever for Sara was the day Ted asked her to the prom. It was going to be in two months, and there was plenty of time to get ready.  ""Okay,"" said Sara, ""I need to get a dress, so I will have to work very hard and make enough money baby sitting for that, then I need to get some shoes and some panty hose, and maybe get my hair done.""  Milli, her little sister, stood in the doorway listening to all of this and smiling.   ""It's so exciting!"" she said, ""I can't wait until my prom! But Sara, how are you going to wear shoes and a dress when you just have one leg and it's slimy, and you live in a shell?""  Sara scorned, ""You are the most pessimistic snail I know. Where there's a will there's a way. Now, why don't you get out of here?"" and she pushed mud over the opening to her room.  The next day at school, Sara bragged to all of her friends.   ""I am going to the prom,"" she said.  ""Snails don't have proms,"" said her friend Tommy.  ""Ted's school does.""  Tommy frowned.  ""But Ted doesn't want to go out with you. He's a person. People who take snails ot the prom never get laid.""  ""Oh posh,"" answered Sara, ""Your just jealous because Ted doesn't want to take you to the prom.""  The next day was one of Sara's baby-sitting days. She was going to be watching little Mable, who was two years old.  When she got there, Mrs. mable-mother warned her, ""Mable is at that age where she likes to put things in her mouth. Watch her very carefully. You know how babies can be.""  Sara watched Mable very carefully. Mable watched Sara too. She had seen her Uncle Pierre eating snails once and wondered what they were like. Mable walked over to Sara.  ""Oh, you want to play patty cake?"" asked Sara. Mable popped her in her mouth.  To be continued"
2GXT57U,female,23,"Here are some stories from the past. I add them to my blogger for your entertainment.   Genes Through Time    Once there were four people named gene who played cricket with another person whose name was also Gene, but whom everyone called Smelly. Smelly owned all the land in the world, except for ninety-nine acres, and the land he didn't own was where everyone else lived. Since all the people were exceedingly small, they couldn't go very far anyway, and that is why they thought the world was flat. Smelly was educated and he believed the world was round, but he was wrong. It was indeed flat. Back then, there weren't any men or women because men and women hadn't been invented yet. Therefore everyone was a circle, a square, or a piece of bubble gum. Also no one ever had time to name their children, because they were too busy creating British dominated sports. Thus, it was assumed that everyone's name was Gene. The four people who were most accomplished at these sports were the Gene called Smelly and the three other Genes, all of whom were mentioned at the beginning of this story. Within the collection of friends, two were squares, one was circular, and the other was a figment of Smelly's imagination. They all got along just fondly, and loved to practice their games together among the blossoms of summers dusk.  As they were playing one evening, they were suddenly interrupted by a grotesque apparition wearing a black coat. The figure beneath the coat was completely white. He had stumpy legs like an elephants and had a menacing grin that stretched from his left eye to a moderate hump on the back of his neck. He stood, grimacing, for two curious moments before abruptly devouring the four companions. Years passed, then centuries. No one ever missed the athletic genes because they hadn't ever really existed. One day, the community decided to build a house on the very spot where the genes would have played, had they been around. The house was made of solid marble. No one ever went in, because there was no entryway, and no one ever came out, because it was empty. At one point the being appeared inside of the house and disgorged the genes, including the one called Smelly. The city council decided the house should be destroyed. Once they had cracked through the first wall, they met the Genes, as well as the entity in the black coat. They were perplexed that those who had not existed should materialize within a sealed stone house. The Genes explained that it was quit simple, for they had merely torn away from nothing, creating a deep void in Time that would suck them up so that they had never existed at all, and then spit them out so that they had always been. Then everyone understood and was happy. The figure in the black coat opened his mouth.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Entrails of the Sea Life    A man named Labon who was wealthy with a family inheritance went on a long sail in the middle of an uncharted sea. A little over half way through his journey, the winds became still, and he was able to admire the fathomless depth of his surroundings during a period of leisurely coasting. While he was about, he came upon something that startled him at first, and then drew him near, as it was an object of interest. It appeared to be a rubber ball, and it was red with yellow stripes. In order to be perfectly certain of its nature, he poked it several times with a long stick. To his genuine surprise, it spoke to him. ""That is both painful and annoying,"" it remarked, irritably, ""I wish you would stop."" ""I'm sorry,"" said Labon, ""I assumed you were a rubber ball, but now that I have a closer look, I can see that you are actually a very short man with neither limbs, nor a head.  The man replied, ""As a matter of fact, I am a sea captain who has lost my ship. If you help me to high shores, where I can contact my crew, you will be sure to receive a great reward.  Labon chuckled heartily, ""What could you possibly have to offer me? I see no jewels on your body, and your clothes are not of fine linens. You are not rich enough to grant me any truly desirable possessions."" ""I am unable to help myself,"" answered the desperate vagabond. Yet Labon was suspicious by nature, and he replied, ""You are probably a liar."" With that, he dropped him into the water, and the sea captain sank deep into the muddy recesses of lost cities. Not a tremendous time later, the wealthy sailor decided to inhabit a remote island where, having nothing else to do, he began digging holes in the shapes of different animals. As he was digging out an eye for his raccoon shape, he hit upon something very hard, which turned out to be a chest full of treasures to grand to consider.  He pulled the chest out of the ground, saying to himself, ""This must be the great treasure that the man I met was speaking of. If only I could thank him now for his generous efforts to give me things. Labon felt a deep sense of regret. He sat listlessly on a rock for several hours, crying sorrowful tears of his guilt. Having become remarkably distressed, he tore off his cloak and filled it with the contents of the chest. Afterwards, he threw the heavy bundle into the sea. It drifted hither and tither for a few anxious moments, until finally being devoured by a clan of poisonous jellyfish. That night, Labon dreamt of being stuck in the nose by a thousand needles, one at a time. When he awoke, he discovered a letter beside himself with only the four following words inside it: You are a fool, which he read aloud. This was most perplexing to him, for until that point he had been completely illiterate.  As Labon headed home the sea was calm, and when he reached his destination he recalled having had a very lovely time abroad for, he said, ""It is the one time when I have left, and then come back as well."" Everyone laughed agreeably and invited him to join them in suitable festivities, which he did. At midnight, all of the people turned into beautifully garnished platters of fish. Later the next evening, they all disappeared. The whole event was a distinct success, and everyone agreed that they should all do it again next year.  The End   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Mid Journey    On the side where once our fathers  Said the heavens met the earth Was a land that had not yet Been burnt away, And the trees, their branches all bore fruit  That ripened red and sweet And every babe was fed, And ne'er the skies were grey, And the skies were ever blue and all was day.  I had made my way to go there  Though an idle sloth I be,  I had dreamt of all the wealth and strength to see.  I was taken by the woods,  I was distracted by the dreams  And I tarried where one oughtn't ever be,  And so I slew the wealth and strength I'd promised me.   As I dawdled on the pathway, Calling obstacles to come  Before that land of wealth and paradise I sought  Then a tearful man came running down the path I lingered on,  Looking sick and shaken, fearful and distraught  And he asked if I may listen and be taught.  He said, ""I went to seek my strength, I went to seek a fortune there,  In the place they say the earth gave way to sea,  And the earth concluded there it seemed,  And the heav'n did there begin,  For there I found what earth had never offered me."" ""He said,"" ""I found the love that earth had never offered me.""  ""And her name meant all that sings,"" He said, ""And her skin was silk and bronze,  And her lips weren't red with roses but with fire, And her passion was not lust or greed, but mighty want for life  And her voice was like the strumming of a lyre.""  And then he cried,  ""And I knew my love for her could never tire.""  ""We were soon there to be married  In that place where beauty be,  Where the people grew like sunflowers from the ground  And I said, 'But I must leave you. I will search a home for us  'Til that holiday of union comes around'  And we parted on a melancholy sound.""  ""I was left for not a week, my friend,  When my heart grew sick for her  And I wondered why I ever left her side,  And I turned around to find her, Just to be with her again,  But when I got there someone told me she had died! And I prayed to God my wearied ears had lied.""  ""I asked who else had known her  And they said they knew her name, But a man had dug her grave a week before,  For the town had been in frenzy, She was trampled underfoot In a riot like precursory to war."" And then he told me what the riot had been o'er.  But I said ""You needn't tell me,""  To the anguish beaten man, ""There's a wild eye in the soberest of rings, And a mass can be enchanted  By the whispering of the wind  So their bodies are possessed by savage things,  And in the morning they are docile once again.  And I said some words to comfort him. What vacant sympathy.  Then he turned to me and said ""They did not care."" ""For they did not wrap her body And they prayed not o'er her soul  And they took from her the ribbons in her hair. They gave their daughters satin ribbons from her hair.""  He said ""You seek a crystal haven  In a place of legend told  Of a land so bright you'd fall upon your knees, But the women are like baubles, And the men are made of stone, And the babes all eat the embers of the trees.  I am the last to miss the heavens for the seas.  ""So my sister don't console me  For the face I wear this hour, For you are no more safe from dying in the cold.""  At the point his words were ringing from the howling of a storm, And I envisioned that his sobs instead were gold, And I am walking to that land of legend told.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sad Sad River Mountain      Life was a continuous chasm.    A man decided to put an end to the whole ugly deal, and so with the exclamation, ""I am all that is worth living for!"" he threw himself into a river which was filled with catfish and human corpses. The better to bring down the rest of mankind thought the man, but on all of earth there were only two people who cared for him, and they were strong souls and did not follow.    When he fell in, the river became too full of corpses and one of them had to step out to make room for the man. This was the corpse of a woman whose career had become to greatly of a burden, and thus she had ended her life prematurely. She had not been missed by any but four people, and they were strong souls and did not follow.   The dead woman buried herself beneath a mountain where she had been born at one time. People who did not know her threw flower petals over her grave, because they felt sorry for her.   A giant ogre with sixteen personalities discovered the mountain and destroyed it completely. His neighbor had beaten him in the head with a mountain when he was a child. Therefore, no one knew where the suicide victim had buried herself.   The man who had thrown himself in the river was still alive. The catfish were swimming around him and he was beginning to feel synaesthetic. The river was singing, and the faint gurgle of swimming life was the color of fire. The man began to scream. He hoped that he would live to reclaim what was once his - the love of two people and his own portion of Earth.    The man did live, and he returned to his home where the two people who loved him cried and welcomed him. They were glad to see him. They were angry that he had left them, but they were forgiving.   He and the two people who loved him and the giant ogre with sixteen personalities were the four people in the world who cared for the woman buried beneath the mountain, but she was dead.   The mountain was gone, no one remembered where it had been, and death flowed in the river.   Nobody in the world loved the giant ogre.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sigh of the Moon Dweller   There was once a young man from the moon who wondered about the meaning of life and death.  Of life he said, ""Ah, it is love to its fullest, but what is life to a mortal? Only a phase,"" and he was troubled thus. A monkey who was in a nearby moon tree heard this lamenting and replied, ""Oh, you don't appreciate the importance of life! First of all, let us dissect your own words and see if you are really capable of making these assumptions. What is love to its fullest? It is true the Lord gave us life because he loves us, and life may be the reciprocal of love, and it gives us the capacity to love, but you say 'What is it?' as if to imply that it is nothing."" ""Indeed I did,"" replied the adolescent, ""for life is grand and valuable until its inescapable demise. What use is it to live for a year, when you are to die or an eternity? The money said to him, ""I would think you might ask, 'Why do I live on the moon?' Instead you ask, 'why does a mortal man live?' This is the greatest puzzlement of all, for when you come to an end you will know nothing of the things you sought. You spend a moment asking what the meaning is, and the next moment saying there are no solutions to your queries. I can help you answer these things, but not today. I must feed my children instead."" With that, the monkey scurried back into his tree, and was not seen again. The young man pondered these statements briefly, and at the same moment was confronted by a butterfly who fluttered fro and to, twittering as gaily as a handsome spring day.  ""You are small and fragile, but also beautiful,"" he told the creature.  ""I am,"" said the butterfly, ""and not meek like the birds and insects who hide among the leaves to sing. I, rather, invite the world to gaze at me this way and see how much like a perfect painting I am."" ""But you are not a piece of art, and this is the moon, not the world."" At that time, the butterfly was floating away, singing to himself, and the fellow on the moon wondered why does a butterfly have wings if it is to exist in an atmosphere without gravity? Just then, he met a clicking bug who said nothing, but clicked, and appeared to dislike him. The young man felt so frustrated by this that, finally, he tossed upwards his hands and gave a deep sigh of resignation. When he did this, however, he made a noise that was like a storm to the clicking bug, who was very small. The bug fancied that the sigh of the moon dweller was a monstrous gust of wind, and his arms the waving of trees. It was a silly fancy to take, because a clicking bug ought to know that there are not windstorms on the moon. However, people are always taking silly fancies, and the clicking bug was no exception, so he ran away to spare its life under a toadstool. The young man watched the bug, perplexed. A clicking bug, a small creature who seemed insignificant, guarded its own life with every resource available, as it cowered under the spotted fungus, and dug its feet into the ground. The butterfly, far away, continued to sing in a merry tone, and spread its beauty to all.  He watched this, and listened, and then said to no one, ""These tiny creatures are fools! They save their lives for a morning on which they will no longer be, and they savor hours which are only fitted to conquer them!"" He had grown cynical just by watching living things because he did not understand why they should be at all. Then he began to wonder, if they were going to be, even in spite of what was logical, why then were they the way they were? Why were they small, and why did they make the moon their home? Suddenly he began to realize that there were so many things that seemed illogical, like the wings of a butterfly who could well do without them, and the great sighs he made, although there was no air to breath. There were so many confusions and perplexities that he could have spent a lifetime discovering them all.  Just as he once asked ""Why should there be life?"" he now cried out about the complexities which he encountered, and he could not say that his or anyone else's existence was futile, for he knew that each one would be spent in discovery for all of its days. Then, when his final hour was about, all of the universe was opened to him, and the questions he had were answered with one single utterance -- and he understood the answers which unlocked all of life's great mysteries, because he remembered having asked the questions a long time before. So went the life of the fellow on the moon, and so too went his death. As he had sought and wondered with an opened heart, peace then betook him, and never a life was belittled by a creature on the moon.  The End"
2GXT57U,female,23,"It began on a Sunday. No one could wear it off. There was a thing in the branches.   If you saw it, you would have just called it a thing too. There was nothing to describe it: not a name, or a shape or a form.   Shapes and forms and images are all differet things. Forms are formed. They deifinitly come from something, whether they are implied, or solid. Shapes just are. They are when they are, and they can change and then they are no longer. Images are very special. They can be made several times and still be the same. You might never see one, or you may see one that can be sensed only with sight, and never with any other of the senses.   So there was a thing, and it had no shape or form, but it had an image. It was the kind of image that can be seen, but not optically, and it started on a sunday, and no one could do away with the thing, nor could they use it, nor could they grieve over any of it, for it was simply a matter of what was, and could not be changed.  Often times, things that begin seem as though they always were. We are afraid to extinguish those things."
2GXT57U,female,23,"Well, I did not write a new entry in my blogger when I said I would, which can mean only one thing: I, Mulya Pinkerton, am a big fat liar. Horror of horrors! How I detest a liar. They are simply detestable.   My brain is completly dry. I keep wanting to tell you about some toads I once had, but I cannot seem to explain it in the same detail as I did in the first story that was erased.   Today, I shall simply copy and paste old stories, so that they will be on this blog. Then, perhaps something new will come into my life and I will be able to tell you about it."
2GXT57U,female,23,"Today, I don't feel like being here at all. Things are a little too much for me, and that's why I haven't written in a while. It turns out that I really am just a statue made out of stone. I mean, naturally, I have been animated, so that I am a lot like a real, flesh person, or otherwise I would not be able to type right now, but the fact is, I have suspected for a long time that I was a statue, and I finally asked my mom and she said, ""Yes, Mulya, you were a statue, but we sort of wanted to see what it would be like to bring you to life.""  Oh, I know I said I was born and all, but that was just a cover up. A few years ago I went to the doctor to undergo several tests. I was afraid of what was happening to my body because my feet and hands were cold too often, and I was always getting the shakes. I told him I had dizzy spells too, and he mentioned the possibility that I might be hypoglycemic.   ""That may be true,"" I said, ""but don't you think that it may also be true that once I was a statue carved out of stone, and that is why I have a chip missing from my chin, and why I often feel very cold?""   ""That may be a distinct possibility,"" said the doctor, ""But I suggest we test your blood/sugar levels before jumping to any conclusions.""  It seemed like a sound idea, so, although I am afraid of needles, I scheduled a date for the test. We also made plans to test my heart because it likes to skip beats sometimes. To tell you the truth, I just wanted to make sure I did indeed have a heart in there and not just a rock.  It took the nurse several times to find a vain in my arm. In fact, it took so long, and so many needles, that by the time she was done I felt that I had quite faced my fears about needles and doctors and hospitals, but that didn't mean I got to leave. Rather, I stayed there all day drinking cup after unsavory cup of orange syrup. Come to think of it, it was just one cup, but one was quite enough. I also had my middle finger pricked at least sixty times.   After the nurse had taken my blood, she fainted on the floor. I asked the doctor what had happened, and he looked at me with his old grey eyes and calmly explained that her time had come. This was surprising, because, although I never saw her wake up, I felt that she still seemed alive some how, for she was still pink and breathing. None the less, I never saw her again.  The doctor told me that my blood sugar was not low, but insisted that I was in fact hypoglycemic. I found this slightly specious, but at the time I chose to believe it over the alternative. The following week I had someone listen to my heart and view it with a sonogram. I was informed that I had a heart murmur: a swishing sound that occurred every few beats, of the beats it didn't miss.   ""But,"" said the doctor, ""this is highly insignificant, which is to say, it is hardly significant at all. I suggest that you go home and rest this off.""  Sleep it off? I did not believe that this was possible.   ""Are you trying to kill me?"" I asked.  ""Yes,"" said the doctor, ""but slowly and subtly, so please don't act like you noticed like that. We went through a lot of planning for this to be VERY subtle and slow.""  I remember that on that day, I felt very disappointed for some reason, and I trudged mindlessly through the forest until I had reached the very edge of the earth, which is located almost precisely where the horizon and the sky meet. I peered off of the end of the world for a while, and I even considered jumping, but it occurred to me that I had no idea where the open space beyond would lead me, if it lead to any place at all, and I didn't even have my jacket on that day.  After that I went home, and sat at the kitchen window where I gazed into the back yard, and here is what I saw:   I saw a tree covered in pink lilacs with branches that swept the brushwood beneath like a weeping willow. I saw a grey mass like a gelatinous boulder sleeping beside it and a rabbit loping through a field of golden eyed jonquils. I saw a deep green moss sprouting from the sides of the tree, and growing out from beneath the stones that lay scattered upon the ground, and a foggy puddle soothing itself with reflections of the sky. I also saw a space where something used to be, but I could not seem remember what once might have occupied the spot -- only that something once did.  The thing sleeping beneath the tree, the grey boulder-like thing, that is our boarder, Lunquin. He only wakes up once or twice a month, and it is only long enough to move to another area of the yard. He does not seem to like the indoors at all. He is completely unsociable, and rather a fright to look at, but he pays us well, and he never caused any complaints from the neighbors.  I asked the fellow if he remembered what used to be in the spot that seemed so empty. He was a little grumpy at having been awakened, but was obliged to speak to me once he felt right with the day, and I fixed him some black tea with honey.  I told him about everything that had happened with the doctors and tests, and how the nurse had fainted, and I had gone to the end of the world, and some back to look at the backyard, only to notice an empty space and be dismayed.  ""Why that spot has been empty for years."" Lunquin grumbled, raising his moutainous head to mine, ""At least twenty of them. Maybe less.""  He was starting to get tired again, but I implored him to stay awake for a while and try to remember what had once been there. He looked at me. His eyes were grey like the doctor's, but fuller, like someone who had seen many things and kept every vision he had ever had right there in his eyes, so as not to lose them in the depths of his memory.   I thought, so this is why old Lunquin is always so tired. He has the whole world to keep track of.   I asked him one more time, ""Lunquin, what used to be in that spot near the flowers?""  ""You and a statue."" He said, and fell back into a slumber.  Well, that was at least a few years ago, maybe less. Today I was thinking about that spot again, even though the tree is gone now, and so are all the flowers and the stones. They are either gone or covered in that green moss I that I had first noticed encroaching into our yard on that day I spoke of. Everything got covered in it except Lunquin, and so I suppose he does have some means of keeping it off. The spot is also covered in the moss so that it doesn't look so empty. Still, I know that something else used to be there.  After a little bit of research, I discovered that our yard was once part of a palace garden. Well, the whole yard wasn't, but a relative of mine, Great Aunt Babs, once visited a palace in Dreads Fram and brought back the ashes of one of the palace garden trees that had caught fire during a drought. She sprinkled the ashes on our flowers one year when she was visiting for New Years Eve. I found a picture of the back of the house and the back yard, and in the corner of the picture is a granite statue.   Well, to make a very long story short, I knew immediatly that that statue was me, and when I asked my mom about it she admitted that yes, it was indeed me, and that one year before I had been brought to life, I had been dropped and had my chin nicked by a nail that was on the ground. She also told me that it was raining that day, and that it had been very cold, and I had carried that into my life when I became a flash and blood person. Because I was made of stone, I was cold often, and because it had been raining, there would always be the whooshing sound of water in my heart.   ""Well,"" I said, ""That exaplains the murmer and the cold hands, but what about the nurse that fainted while I was being tested, and the doctor that acted as though she had died?""  ""Oh well,"" said my mom, ""I never really trusted that doctor."""
2GXT57U,female,23,"""The difference between a writer and an author,"" said the little girl to the librarian, ""is that authors are published and writers are not.""  ""That's right,"" added the young woman on the other side of the counter, ""And what do writers do for a living? Why, they work at grocery stores.""  (For flies and bees and butterflies never close their shiny eyes.)"
2GXT57U,female,23,"A composition/compression of things I have said in this blog so far (The expurgated version):  From the weathering of days and the trecheries of men their oversized mouths gape in disbelief.  ""My, look at you!"" said the toad, ""I suppose I will have to step around to the other side of this picture."" At the other is its end. If all the people on earth should forget, I wouldn't be upset in the least."
2GXT57U,female,23,"I like this very much. Should I continue to blog, i will be blogging continually.  How do I say something without saying anything? If I say something and not nothing, then you'll know what I am saying, and I don't know you, so I don't want to tell you what I am saying.  It is a flavor of cheese with no name.  It is a letter that makes you cry. It was written by an elf.  It makes noises but it has no feet. It floats.  It is a counterfit acronym."
2GXT57U,female,23,"Today is my birthday, and for my birthday, I got thousands and thousands of periodical cicadas named ""Brood X."" They have red eyes and orange legs, and they are very, very loud.   I have to go out right now, but I will be back with more news on my fabulous new friends."
2GXT57U,female,23,"I feel so good today that I will make a second effort to tell you the story about my toads.   When I was a child, which was over ten years ago, I discovered a scrap pile behind a house in the country. It wasn't often that I visited the country, and I don't know how likely it is that I would have found such a scrap pile had it been a different occasion, but I just happened to be lucky enough that day. This was, by far, the best kind of luck a child can have, for in and about this old retired assemblage were hundreds of itty bitty toads, no bigger than the end of my thumb, making themselves at home.   I suppose I was rather a selfish child, and it was not in my nature to simply let them be. I caught five of them, and put them in a jar to take home with me. To my credit, I did not put on a lid.  At home, I made them a house out of a discarded pail. It was a Halloween pail, the kind that is made to look like a pumpkin, and I offered every commodity I imagined five toads could need. The bottom of a paper cup filled with water supplied them with a recreation as well as something to quench their thirst. A twig from my crabapple tree provided shade, and it's fruit, I hoped, would attract bugs for their dinner each night. Yes, there was a whole tree of fruit for the ants and their cousins to enjoy, but hope flies where logic falters, and I truly I operated under the best of intentions.  I named my toads. Their names were Periwinkle, Rudolph, George, Squeak, and Monkey. Periwinkle was named for the blue circles around his eyes, Rudolph for the famous reindeer. George was a very down to earth toad, and needed a sturdy sounding name. Squeak was very noisy, and Monkey, he was named for the shape of his face. He did not look like the other toads, but was more... I can only describe it as ""squashy"" looking. His face was flatter, and his mouth wider. One day I picked him up and found that his jaw was broken, and the bone protruded from his face and poked into his abdomen.   I kept my toads for almost a week. Each morning I would go out to check on them in their pail under the crabapple tree, and each morning they would be on the outside of the pail, dancing around like a bunch of tiny magic folk, or little demons around a fire. I'd scoop them all up one by one and put them back in their house, but I always felt guilty each time. I knew that there was something better for them out there, and they knew it too. Worse yet, the had the power to escape completely, but never did. Toads will be like that. Toads are very odd that way.  I decided that the only possible retribution for their situation was for me to take them to a place that was much more beautiful than my back yard and set them free. I decided to take them to my family's annual picnic, where I would reintroduce them to the free world.   Only Monkey, who I was afraid for, would not go. It seemed as though he might not have lasted the three days it would be until the picnic, and I decided to give him an early leave. He made peace with the world in my back yard. Two days after his release, I found an owl pellet that reminded me very much of Monkey.  The others, I took with me to the park. When I got there, many of my younger cousins, who were actually the children of my older cousins, were very excited to see my pets, but I told them that the purpose of their excursion was to find a home in the park. One of my cousins, who was actually the daughter of the wife of my older cousin, held Squeak very tightly in the palm of her hand so that I had to tell her to be much more careful, and open her hand when there was a toad inside it. She opened her hand, and Squeak had spit out all of his insides, but just as soon as she relinquished her hold, he swallowed them up again, and was as good as new. This is a very strange thing that I would not believe toads could do if I hadn't seen it for myself.  After setting all four of my captives loose under a large maple tree, I went about making myself a plate of chips, hot dogs, and all kinds of other picnic delicacies. About an hour later, I went back to the tree, and saw that one toad, Rudolph, still remained. I knew him right away, because he had a slender body and a brownish tone to his skin, and I thought  Who knew that Rudolph would have been the one who loved me the most.   Then my cousin, who I believe is really my cousin once removed, suggested that we bury him in the sand underneath the swing set. At the time, it seemed like a mighty good idea, to test the driving will of a toad in such a manner. In retrospect, it does not seem anything short of cruel, but at least I can rest knowing that he was a strong toad indeed, and so we were not able to keep him buried beneath the sand.  I do not know if this story serves as a better lesson to me, or to toads everywhere. If it is for me, then I suppose I should have to think about it a few more times. Otherwise, I hope that the toads who can read are kind and wise enough to share their findings with the rest of toadkind.   If you are going to leave the pail, leave the pail. If you have left the pail, do not stand under the tree."

If it's one thing i hate in the world....its lazy ass co-workers...these two babes at work are seriously plucking my last damn nerve...see at my paying job i work at a after school center...basically our responsibility is to watch kids from 3pm to 6pm (when their damn parents are suppose to pick em up, but i'll talk about that later)...i dont have a problem with watching the kids because thats my job and i get paid for it...but i be damn if im going to be working while my two co-workers are sitting on their lazy asses philosophizing for 3 hours about their boyfriends and their fucked up relationships....hello people we are suppose to be working...maybe my work ethic is different...i know that we all are college students but maybe i am more mature than them...but still thats no damn excuse...that's the real world, if you want to maintain a job, you have to work hard for it....now i could be reasonable if this was a once in a while thang...but hell nah they do this everyday, its their ritual....let me further explain the situation so you can see what im talking about....okay there are 4 of us working and there is 4 rooms full of kids....now the logical thing to do would be split up and each take a room...but nooo these two dummies rather sit in the same room and chit chat, which often leaves me having to cover 2 rooms full of hyper ass midgets...another thing that urks me about those two is...that they are always late to work (especially one) and never wants to walk over to pick up the damn kid's from school...but when its warm...they dont mind walking...but when its freezin like a mutherfucka their asses purposely show up late so they dont have to walk...like i wasnt going to notice that shit...  now last week our school was on spring break...one half of the chatty duo went on vacation to a Dominican Republic resort...so the other stuck to my ass like glow...telling me all about her lastest sobb stories/drama with her boyfriend...how they are going to move into separate apts because they need to have space...like hello...""yall been together for a year and yall been living together for a year...thats what's wrong wit your relationship...yall went from mommy and daddies house...to living together"".....i be tellin her that shit too, im her psychologist, should start chargin her stinkin ass but thats another thought...so yeah she be going thru it..but she would rather talk about it during work, instead of actually doing some damn work...well her butt-buddy came back on monday...and guess where they were...sitting on the stinkin couch,catching up...its like they stuck together...if one person is one room, the other will eventually find their way there and hang out....meantime we have unsupervised kids running around like heathens...im gettin tired of that shit real quick... ooohhh let me give yall another good example...one day both of em were sitting in the kindergarten room putting on a video for my babies (thats the kindergarteners, im so attached to them since ive been around them since sept)...so i let time pass for a min...and i think that day it was only us 3 working...so eventually im pissed and i stormed back there like could one of yall come watch this other class...i was so pissed cause i shouldnt have to do that shit...i mean did they think it honestly takes 2 people to watch 12 kindergarteners while im watchin 35 other screamin kids...ohhh hell nooooo....  now on to my other gripe about work...the damn parents...im so so so so so so so so to the fuckin 100th power sick of them fuckers coming late to pick up their own damn kids...hello these your brats not mine dont ya want to come get em...now my damn work day ends at 6:01...not 6:05 or 6:15 or 6:35....i understand you may be in traffic but damn i have a fucking life...i work too, in fact im working from 8am (internship) till the time they pick up their brats...my ass is up at 6:45 in the damn morning...i need to go home and relax too, shit i need a break...and you know what really urks me....when they do come to pick up their kids...they dont even say thank you...what the fuck is up wit that, i be about really to cause a scene...its not like im gettin compensating for their tardiness, hell im only getting my bass rate divided by whatever time they came...im getting tired of this work shit...its all starting to push me away and making me search for a real job even more...  damn yall this is a long ass post...but hey i got to vent..ive been holding all this shit in for a min...one luv soulSag"

""Also it'd be nice to talk on the phone with you as well.""    And, most adorably, he called me  ""luv.""  I luv being called luv. Heh.         He misses me . I am not sure what exactly to make of this. Other than, of course, the obviousness of the statement...there is the subtext of what is said. And sometimes I am very very bad at figuring out subtext. In this case it was like, ""hi, how was your weekend"" followed by the ""I miss you."" And since I am notorious for overthinking just about everything people say to me, doubtless I will spend most of the day poring over these comments. Until of course I hear from him again, and being to pontificate over the meaning of phrases from the forthcoming email.  Help."
0W5F653,female,25,"Music for the Day: The Cooper Temple Clause - Kick Up The Fire...       Goodness Gracious what a marvelous night!        I think that as I sit here I might still be a wee bit drunk . The lady bartender at Saint Ex was not only generous with her charges but with her alcohol.       I shall begin at the beginning of the evening. Watched BB (yay Scott evicted!!!) and then got myself ready for some fun by putting on a black tee black skirt and my black knee high boots. Met up with Hannah on S Street, and proceeded to Saint Ex. There was a good amount of people downstairs, including a super hott boy whom I have met on several occasions in my Kingpin/Velvet Lounge past. Hannah and I grabbed some drinks and a table and waited for the fun to begin. About half an hour later, the Cooper boys show up, along with Laura and Tom. Melissa Auf Der Maur was with them, too. So I turn into a giddy nervous mess, which sometimes happens to me around boys I like (and boy, do I like those CTC boys; sometimes I wish they weren't in a band so I wouldn't be as nervous around them). So they all take turns spinning, and it's quite the eclectic mix. Kieran spins the most stuff I like, though strangely I am having a really hard time remembering what he played...anyway. JP showed up, and sat with me and Hannah for a while. Then Lisa showed up, too, which was lovely. The peer pressure Hannah and I put on her must have worked. After a few beverages, I finally got the nerve to go speak to Kieran at the bar. He remembered me, and might have even remembered my name (he remembered it started with M, and then I told him, and he said ""was I done guessing?"" in this very cute cheeky way). So we chatted for a moment, then went back to our respective tables. Later Hannah was talking to Ben, so Laura and I went over, and I chatted to Ben, who was perhaps even more boozed up than I was. He too remembered me, which was nice. And we had a brief conversation about his hair. He told me he cut it himself, and I'm not sure if I believe it or not. Later, Laura introduced me to Jon and Fisher. They're both really nice, but I suddenly got a case of the mutes. Matt from Muse showed up for a while, and Carlos and Sam and Daniel from Interpol stuck around for quite some time. Last call came around, and I chatted with Joel from Kingpin for a while before heading outside. I ran into Laura, Tom, and Kieran; who were waiting for Fisher and Jon and their tour manager to get pizza. We started talking to Ben once Tom went back to fetch him, and when he went to get on their van we all shook his hand and he winked at me. He is quite possibly one of the loveliest men in the world. Said goodbye to Kieran and Jon, and Jon asked if I was set for the show. I thanked him and said yes. I cannot wait to see them tonight.        O happy night.        I also finished my book yesterday after work, so the day was super all around.       Time to get to drinking this nice tall bottle of water."
0W5F653,female,25,"I am in some sort of apathy-ridden hell. I cannot come close to explaining it, but the aforementioned apathy is there, as is a clear and present blah mentality. People call with valid (though probably more often than not invalid) questions, and instead of telling them to fuck off it's on our website as I would relish doing, I smile and nod (pointless, since no one can see it) and do what I have to do. But I am feeling wasted. Heather, I believe this is a part of what you are feeling now, as well. I don't know what's wrong with me. This week has become nightmarish, but not in its' outlandish horror. Instead it is a nightmare of mediocrity and things mildly falling apart. I haven't heard back from my movers, other movers can't move my bed when I want it moved, and though I know it's eye-roll inducing, it is enough to frustrate my frazzled nerves. I feel on edge and like I am not entirely here. And I don't quite know what is wrong with me."
0W5F653,female,25,"I was just going through some of my old emails from the time I spent in Edinburgh, and it really has struck me just what a glutton for punishment I really am when it comes to love.     I have yet to have a fully-functional, long-term local relationship. I kid you not.      I  nstead, I fall for people like  Gavin . Gavin was a co-worker at one of the offices I did some temp work for when in Edinburgh. I had it bad for him as soon as I saw him and his eyes (big brown puppydog eyes). Basically we began an email/work flirtation, that at least for me quickly morphed into some hardcore feelings. During the end of my second week at work, and my last day seeing him there (he was going to be on vacation for my entire last week), we met outside the office and he kissed me. To this day he is the only person who has rendered me starry-eyed and seeing fireworks during a kiss. We only saw each other a few more times before I left Scotland (he, of course, had a girlfriend whom he wasn't prepared to break things off with for a girl who wasn't around for long), but the boy broke my heart. It was my own fault for falling in love with someone I couldn't have, but it was the most excrutiating pain I've ever felt in relation to love. It took forever to get over him, as well. He used to talk about coming to the States to work for a while, which never happened. We haven't been in contact for ages. Part of me would like to see him, just once more, but I know that's a bad idea. It was just weird reading through our old emails to and fro, it's like reliving the whole thing, to a certain extent.         I want a nice, normal relationship with a nice, normal boy who won't make me fall in love with him only to treat my heart like a pinata."
0W5F653,female,25,"Music for the Day: Brian Eno - Here Come the Warm Jets       It is way to early to be as hot as it is outside.      So I had the weirdest thing happen to me last night after work. I was standing on the platform at Foggy Bottom, towards the end (because I am very fond of being in the last car). There was no one else around me. I was just standing there, when all of a sudden I felt the sensation of a hand being on my left hip. And then it was gone.  There was no one else near me . I've never felt anything like that, apart from of course when a person's hand is actually on my hip. It wasn't just one of those metro train-entering-station induced feelings, either. It wasn't a breeze. I have no idea what it was. All I know is that it freaked me out.       I watched all manner of mindless tv last night. Big Brother was on, and evil Jase won himself the Power of Veto (I hate these cheesy things the US version of BB comes up with). If I had to live in a house with Jase and Scott I think I would probably nominate myself for eviction, just to get away from them. Then it was time for Outback Jack/The Amazing Race. I watched most of the Race, but tuned in to the end of Outback Jack to see ""Jack"" eliminate Maria. I was happy, but was in disbelief that Natalie, the total airhead from Kentucky, has gotten as far as she has. I can't see her last long in the Outback, really. There's nowhere for her to get her manicure...      Today I managed to wake up late. Again. It's rather funny, I live so close now that I just sleep later and later and later...will definitely have to work on this.     Only two days until the Curiosa gig! And only one day from the Cooper Temple Clause dj set. Double the happiness!!     Still no further word from Jeff. This is the longest we've gone without corresponding since I tracked him down.

So it'll be one fell swoop as opposed to several lesser swoops. I have made nice with Jackie (I did feel really badly about being sharp with her), so all is seemingly well. Now I just have to finish packing everything, which seems rather daunting even though it shouldn't be.     Funny thing is, 3 days before my move and I am still just la-di-da-ing along like usual. It doesn't feel different. I don't feel like in 3 days I will not be living in my house anymore. It's a bit unsettling, but also more than a bit liberating.

I4OFF0I,female,14,"ok...i had two weird dreams last night...or this morning considering i slept at 3:37AM...  First Dream:  it must have been a swimming carnival or something...everyone- girls and boys went in different change rooms- so we went to change and wen we come back out there was a place where everyone put down all their clothes and SHOES. after that i just see mieself and other pplz who i noe (u noe how wen u get the feeling u noe sombody but they dont actually look like the actual person u noe?) in the pool...then we had to go out and for some strange reason all the dudes were wearing speedos all lined along the pool. and omg...wen i walked out of the pool i wasnt wearing anything O.O"" like i couldnt see myslef not wearing anything but i ""knew"" i wasnt...so i shared a towel with my friend.   when i went and collected my clothes from that spot there was only one pile left...the clothes were mine but the SHOES werent...but there was nothin left so i took em neways. i remember seeing a black/dark blue shoe that had those lil elasticy kinda material on the sides...without any shoelace so u just shove ur feet in and a black ""rock"" one..the brand. it actually was my old (yr7) shoe type. so i took them into the female change rooms but there was only me a ""friend"" (the feeling u noe, u noe them) and another friend who was blonde ...i finished changing first so i left i remember saying ""im goin meet u outside""  so i walk out the change room but at that same exact moment an old dude walks out too...the male change rooms are next to the female but the male is before ours so the man will be infront of me. the old man walked and i just was following behind then he stoped and turned around. ""do u want a lolly?"" is waT he sed...i remember very clearly thinking to myself ""this is the typical way of lurring a child into being kidnaped"" so i sed ""no thatnx its ok."" but he was talking and talkin and walking closer to me so i was backing back into the change room...where i turned the man wasnt there yet so i sed to mie friends ""omg theres a dude coming he asked if i wanted a lolly..."" at that time one of my friends had only a singlet on so i sed from the corner of my mouth coz da dude was standing there ""omg put a shirt on hurry""...she did and come to think of it the man looked like an actual person ive seen. this man was abusing me and two other friends after skool wen it was real hot and it was the last day of skool. we went into binglee in parra and at the bak there is a big tv and they were playing musik. we three were watching and listening and dancing. then the dude comes and talks about niggas and differnt countrys taking credit for things...he sed the koreans and jap and chinese invent stuff...then he started insulting the music video coz it was a black person...the music was quite good actually..he sed its these ppl who start wars...and all this shit and he sed the music was crap..then we told him no its not its good....and i took a foto of him with mie fone coz if we ever needed to sue him for abuse i have proof he was there...  the person in my dream looked a lot lyk him actually...but that man in the dream was a bit shorter...well he was talking and talking to us in the dream then he left...then we left too...and that was it....very weird...  Second Dream:   it was outside a forest looking thing...a square glass cabinents were there...ok imagine a big square..cut out a square inside that square with an opening for ppl to enter. now the outside square that is left after ur cutting is all glass where u can put stuff inside.. but for some reason it doesnt hav nething inside....  back to the dream...there was a girl in it...not a young lil girl ...a teenage to abt 20 yr old girl...she was an actual person i knew (once agen that feeling u noe her) this time i remember thinking ""oh thats andrea"" but in actaul fact it had looked nothin like her. she was just standing there writing in a big book...and i walked into the square that that moment. then a dude (i hav a feeling this dude was some movie star or somthing) walked in too. he held me at gunpoint but i had a quick reation and took the gun off him...and now he was at gun point. he was looking at me and he sed ""ahah the gun doesnt even hav bullets"" so i say"" oh relly...well lets try"" and i shot him in the knee o.O"" and then he pulled out another gun and pointed it at me...i again hav a quick reaction and took that off him too. now i hav two guns O.O"" pointed at him....and the dream end there.  so weird...so very weird..."
I4OFF0I,female,14,"heyo there..   lol.. i am going to talk abt mie wonderful tae kwon do lesson =D...  ok.. i was waiting around for rachel to come pick me up.. and i hear their car.. so i open da door.. and its dark and raining and i havnt got mie glasses on.. so i was.. confused.. coz i wasnt sure if it waz them or not.. so wen i got close to da car.. i opened da door.. and rachelz like..

""gee.. u look at earings often?"".. and he goes.."" nah.. just its big.. and u notice.."" and im like.. ""ahah.. ok... ."" and then he goes.."" how come ones white and ones black?"".. and i go.. ""coz i wanted some contrast... .."" hez like.."" oh ok.. ive seen olympic earings too.. they were lil rings..

PUNCH.. yeh.. hit me like that.. i dont care.. just not my balls i told u that.. ahaha i was just laffing.. coz he kept telling me to hit him and then saying.. just not my balls at the end.. so i kicked and punched and everything.. then.. i got him in the head =S.. not good..   i moved onto nazza.. i think thats her name.. ins. mike changed the thing.. we started some self defence kinda thing.. like.. in da streets.. some dude comes up and pushes u.. and then he said.. most pplz act smart and are like cmon lets fight.. and put their heads forward.. and drop their hands.. let them walk abt 3 steps then..*wham* straight for the head.. 90%of the time u'll knock em out.. so he got the seniors to drop their guard.. and wen i got nazza.. she started sparring.. and im like..eh.. i think ur supposed 2 drop ur guard and ""taunt me"".. lol.. aahah so shes like ooh.. are we? ok then.. OoOOoOo bring it on.. cmon..  .. ahah lol and i was just laughing and i actually hit her in the head.. by accident.. and shes like.. oohhh ur good.. lol..   i moved onto this other lady.. she was alrite.. didun do much in teaching me.. but told me to keept moving.. then i got.. isobel or grace.. thing it was isobel.. anyways.. ins. mike changed the thing agen.. and said.. most pplz r taller than u.. dont think thats a disadvantage.. coz all u gotta do is jump and then punch.. so i had to try that on isobel while we were sparring.. coz i had to wait for them to drop their guards.. and i gotta jump and punch.. and shes way taller than me.. so i was trying.. and yeh.. we then did actual self defence.. now this is the interesting part..   ins. mike goes.. ""ok.. anyone have any questions?"".. noone says anything.. ""ok so if i hold u in any lock u wuld be able to get out of it?"" no one says anuthing..  *walks through the middle* *points at rachel* ""im going to pick on u.. u didun have a question.. u gotta have a voice in this class..""  *has rachel in a headlock* ""what do u do?""... *rachel does nothing*..  *ins.mike lets go* ""u have 3 seconds to save urself.."" *ins.mike walks throo middle agen* *points at me* ""u didun ask any questions either.."" *has me in a headlock* (i remembered wat natasha told me abt the lessons i was away.. u put ur chin down so they cant choke u..)  *puts chin down..* makes no difference* so i.. lifted mie arm up to punch him.. and like i didun mean to actually HIT him.. but coz i culdnt see his head.. being ina headlock and all.. i accidently hit him in the jaw... or chin.. or cheek.. or face.. i dont know.. but yeh.. lol..  *he lets go*.. lol everyones just laughing.. and he goes.. ""that COULD work.. but i woulda broke ur neck.."" *has me in headlock agen* ""step on my foot"" *steps on his foot* *he lets go..*  lol..ahaha so i punched ins.mike in the face.. ANYWAYZ.. we did more self defence work like pressure point on hand, underarm, how ta pinch pplz... lol.. so funii.. i had isobel right.. so shes tryna find mie pressure point on mie hand.. and shes like.. iz it hurting?.. and i culdnt feel anything.. and wen i culd.. u twist the wrist.. and push it back.. and break it.. i had to demonstrate that for mike.. he walked past and was like.. who punched me b4? ahh u.. grab me.. so i did.. and he gets mie pressure point .. twists mie wrist hard.. and then full pushes it back.. and im like.. ow ow ow.. evil bastard.. lol.. after that.. we had this other one.. where we pinch on thier back.. like big chunks of flesh and twist.. or lil bits.. so isobel is like.. ok.. we're at a party.. and im a guy checkin u out.. and im gna come and hug u.. lmao.. shes actin all drunk.. and gives me this big hug.. then i have to grab bits on her bak.. and pinch till she lets go.. lol.. it was so funny.. tthen.. we had pressure point in the armpit.. and we couldnt find it.. like i grabed her.. and shes tryna find it.. and i let go.. and shes like.. did it hurt or u just ticklish??.. lol ahaha it was ticklish... then mikes like.. anyone cant do that put ur hand up.. so i put mie hand up.. and isobels like.. dont put ur hand up!.. but then he came.. and she asked him where the hand pressure point was.. and hez like.. u serioz? u dno this?.. and isobelz like.. yeh.. i havnt done this.. so he shows her.. then grace.. goes..where is it? and hez like u dont know this?!.. and shes like no.. and wen he left.. isobels like.. geeez.. he expects us to know everything.. and im like yeh.. just coz ur blackbelts.. lol.. wen ins.mike needed to demonstrate somethign else.. he walked pass me and goes.. im not picking u.. ur an animal.. lol.. ahahha.. ahha.. lol.. i like self defence the best..  we did some stretching and some patterns.. then we finished..  tkd is fun wen u dont spar like crazy..   i got period 1 tomoro.. damn jap lesson..   anywhoz.. bb."

AX2K3G1,male,24,"After all the hype about the movie, I went to watch it First Day First Show. You have to admit that all these sub-plots in a movie such as this destroy it's intended moral. When you get such corny dialogues such as ""I made a promise to my son. So I have to keep it."", you will start disliking what is otherwise a splendidly taken movie. But had fun watching it and will recommend it to all movie lovers. Especially the scenes involving the city of New York drowning.  That is two movies per day for the last three days. I felt a sense of relief earlier in the morning after finishing the last part of the Godfather Trilogy. The movie was better than what I had hoped it would be, mainly due to the unexpected twist in the ending.  Spent the rest of the day with a friend with the admission to his course at the college. I got rewarded by being eyed by his father later."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Things didn't go as well as I hoped the other day at the zoo where Mr. Lion took me for a tour. But don't ever misunderstand me; it was still awesome. Even though I was not able to touch a tiger cub-they were just 13 days old and no one other than Mamma tiger has touched them-I got to see them very close. I got close to other big cats as well. The keeper of the felines gave us company this time and since he was nearby, the jaguars, lions and tigers were feeling more comfortable. One tiger, the oldest one in the zoo, came forward in the cage and settled near  us after the keeper called her by name. The couple of jaguars from South America (I guess) were much friendlier. In fact, they came to near us and rubbed themselves on the railings of the cage and even extended a paw of affection. I heard one of them purr and eventually we were able to see them trying to mate. I am ecstatic about the fact that I'm getting to see all this so up close and personal.  Apart from this, we visited some other animals with the zoo vet. It was amazing to hear the vet and Mr. Lion discuss the treatment options. It was much similar to what we do in our rounds at the hospital. The main difference was that animals were much harder to administer medications. Another difference in this trip was the fact that I didn't have Ray along with me. I sort of felt odd asking Ray if he would like to come along as well. Not because I wanted privacy with Mr. Lion. But because I thought about what Ray might feel about depriving me of privacy with Mr. Lion. Anyway, I thought it was up to him to make a decision and he decided against coming.  After this, Mr. Lion drove to a nearby parking lot. All you perverts, do not exert your imaginative skills too much. It was mid-afternoon and we were by a main road. Besides, we two aren't the all-sex no-talk kinda pair. At least, I am. I hope Mr. Lion is too but I've my suspicions about it. Mr. Lion, I must say I'm proud and surprised to find him like this, did not waste time and started on the topic of my sister and her problems straight away. He did it with such a level of sincerity and genuineness that I felt that I needed to take him in right then. But as I said earlier, we are no sex maniacs. During the discussion, there was an uncomfortable moment for Mr. Lion when I asked him his views about pedophilia. He apparently believed that sex between any two consenting  persons  was okay. I asked him whether he thought that a decision taken by a 14 year old (not just a random number) would be considered well thought out. And if no, how such a person could be considered fit to giving a learned consent. I was stressing on the fact that it should have been consenting  adults  instead of just  persons . Anyway, he didn't have an answer to this. This had somewhat lessened my urges to get it on with him then. But again, we are not sex-crazed adults to do it there.  My e-personal-life is getting hotter. Mr. Anonymous JK has informed me of his immense interest in me. I think we have a good chance of getting along well sometime in the future. Besides, Saul and I are exchanging mails (he is attaching his pictures along with mails) regularly. Is it a coincidence that I fall in love with him (he is attaching his pictures along with mails) regularly as well. My friend R. was very depressed the other day about the fact that we can never  meet in real life. He was so feeling down then that he thought that he should quit keeping in touch with me altogether so that he could get his mind off me. I thought that was too drastic and have been able to convince him from taking such a decision.  My Mom has started to come with me for a morning jog/walk. Of course, I and Chuck jog/walk by ourselves and Mom would walk alone without company. She is sort of pumped up about this and I'm happy about that. It is a shame that Dad doesn't even make an effort to join her. The talks with Chuck in the morning are getting more interesting. The other day, we talked about sexual fantasies. I was surprised to hear that Chuck (an ardent admirer and supporter of the porn industry) had very little few. The main thing he had was about having forced-sex; forced on his partner of course. Maybe it was the fact that he can't open up to me about such stuff. The curious thing to note was that I basically have the same thing in my fantasies. The only difference is that  I  (feeling elated) was the recipient of forced sex.  Oh by the way, I'm getting braces tomorrow. I've been frequenting the dentist this week to get myself prepared. I have had to get two teeth extracted in the last couple of days. It was not at all painful but each one took a lot of time to be extracted. Apparently, my love for felines has translated into the reality that even the roots of my teeth are shaped like claws. This also meant that Ray, who accompanied me to the dentist, had to go through a lot of boring magazines in the waiting room. He was so bored with a magazine called Filmfare that he has vowed to not touch it again.  Just after I had my tooth extracted, I've had physical reasons to be intimidating. There was blood dripping from my mouth. My lips were swollen. But most importantly, I was acting like I couldn't care less, thanks mainly to the wonderful advancements in the field of anaesthesia. I must have looked like a thug, a very thin one though. Why I bring up this point is that I have had a few points raised as to why I might be neglected/ignore in real life. One of them was the fact that I might appear intimidating (not physically but as a person who had achieved a lot even at this young age) to others enough to make them feel scared and neglect/ignore me. Well, you guys are going through my life and thoughts regularly. Do you think I can be intimidating?"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I’m very glad to inform you that I’m very happy about starting to work after more than 2 years out. I’m feeling great about it because everything was great about today. The team with which I will work in the future were warm and friendly. I got over my initial anxiety and nervousness in under an hour and was very comfortable doing those routine things. Talking with patients, discussing clinical problems, listening to little lectures, sharing a joke with a fellow doc; it was all so much fun. Yes, I’m back as a doc.  Why am I feeling so happy? Maybe it is because I have removed the possibility of another perfect stranger asking me what I’m doing nowadays and I having to reply to it with ‘… uh … duh … basically, nothing!’. Maybe it is because I have started on living my dream of becoming a successful Orthopedician. Maybe it is because, every day, I can go from my home where I’m considered an outlaw, to a place where someone would smile at me and give me some respect. Maybe it is because of the fact that I can get to see a lot of cute older men in all ages, sizes and shapes in the hospital. Don’t worry. I saw a couple of ‘woofables’ today (as patients) but was under total control of myself.  I guess, I should put this good mood to use and re-start song-writing!  But, things can never be so perfect for anyone. Not even me. On the downside, I’m having   a toothache because of one of the extracted teeth  a lot of silly arguments and fights with my parents in the past two days  getting used to my altered diet after my braces have come on   The funny thing about the problems with my parents is that, even though I realize what is going wrong, I don’t feel like doing too much about it. I can’t explain it why, but it is so.  Oh, there was this one thing that brought me a wonderful smile in the morning. There was a photo of one of the tiger-cubs in the zoo being bottle fed by the zoo vet; the guy who I was discussing about things the other day when I went to visit the zoo with Mr. Lion. First of all I felt happy. Then I started feeling jealous. I hope I can coaxe Mr. Lion to try getting me closer to tiger-cubs soon."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"The reason why I start blogging here is because of getting inspired by another blog ( urlLink Search for Love ). There are similarities between this blog and the one which inspired me. First of all, both deal with Gay issues. Secondly, both involve medical professional (I presume). So welcome!  Today was an odd day. Most of the day I spent trying to clean up my room before I start my JRship at a hospital. That was really messy. In between, I felt like writing and recording songs, watched the Godfather II DVD and caught up on some action on the tube. There is an amazingly hot man in the movie who is acting as the villain.  In the evening, I met a fascinating gentleman who has a splendid collection of Rock classics. I was dreaming of the day when I'll meet the gentleman with the kind of musical taste that I desire. Let's hope he comes around soon.  In the night, I watched a ""Catch me if you can"" and bits and pieces of the UEFA Champions league finals. Great movie I should say! How I wish Monaco had won! And now here I'm rounding up my first post amongst the many, hopefully, in the future."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"In the past couple of weeks, I have been mentioning about Crosswords. I've been searching the web for some good crossword sites. Here is the  urlLink list  and here is the best that I've come across until now -  urlLink Newsday Crossword . It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I, with Ray of course, have managed to solve one whole Crossword from the Newsday site.  Apart from that, I've been enjoying these hugely enjoyable, educated chat sessions with this guy named Docker from SF, USA. He is the one who ushered me into the world of MC Escher the other day. The fun thing about chatting with him is the kind of stuff that he comes up with.  For example, his name originated from the term 'DOCKING'. There is a new meaning for this word - In gay sex, this refers to the act of protracting one partners foreskin over the other's glans, masturbating and then finally ejaculating into the others urethras. See the picture below.  urlLink    The process of Docking  urlLink    The act is rounded off by a nice session of 69. Docker, who is circumcised, finds this as the ultimate in sex. And he believes himself to be the ultimate in Docking!  Finally, I've found a reason why I should find fellatio so attractive. The reason is pretty straightforward. And it is from Docker himself. Here goes -  ""Remember that if men were not meant to be sucked, their bodies wouldn't have come with a nozzle!"" - Docker  Doesn't this sound way too logical? For me, yes! And to take to my craze to another level, I went through this site, which incidentally was discoverd by Ray, which features a fellatio tutorial. Check it out here -  urlLink Fellatio Tutorial"
AX2K3G1,male,24,"Yesterday was very depressing; so depressing that I didn't feel posting despite the fact that I had so many topics to write about. For two days, I was stuck to my CSS layout making no progress. Everything I had tried ended in a total mess and I thought I needed to drop this idea about re-doing the website. Thankfully, today was a better day. I think I've gained some ground; something which I hope to confirm tomorrow. I'm feeling better. And that is why I'm posting.  The day before, I was lunch with Ray and my name-alike friend (who I'll refer to as Unni from hereon). Unni, by default, is very weird. He is hard to make sense of because of his fast articulation. He also tends to do many things that are unacceptable in social etiquette. We pretend to ignore his shortcomings and attribute them to his rather traumatic childhood. But this time he was even weirder.   Imagine having five separate conversations with friends going on at the same time. That is difficult enough. But what if it was with the same person? That would be unimaginably complicated. That is what happened.  Picture this. Us three sitting at a restaurant having ordered ' urlLink thali meals ' for each of us. It's a busy hour and we are waiting for the food to arrive.  Unni says, ""Busy day at work. I'm tired and I'm very hungry."" Looking at Ray he adds, ""You ass, what about tomorrow's presentation?""  Ray says, ""I have to go to the library to read a few journals in the afternoon. Care to give me some company?""  ""Sorry,"" says Unni, ""I still have a couple of patients to see. What is going on these days at the specialty postings anyway? Dude, I need to start reading. How is your Cardiology going?""  Ray says, ""Things are not all well. I'm getting to learn things the hard way. Chief isn't happy with me at all. I totally messed up the findings of a patient. Got the timing of the heart sounds…""  Unni cuts in, ""Tell me all about  urlLink Cardiology auscultation and percussion . Start from the basics. Dude, I need to learn. Shit, what's with the food?  It's been 20 minutes since we arrived. What are these SOBs thinking? You know, these Nephrologists and Cardiologists… they are messing the whole system. The side effects of the drugs which Cardiologists prescribe are the reason why the Nephrologist are getting their patients. You know what, you should never take up a specialization. Stick to to being a physician. A physician is the best way to go!""  At this point I entered the conversation and voiced my opinion about specialists. The argument seemed to go on  well until Unni suddenly interrupted me by asking Ray, ""What happened at the party yesterday. You were totally stoned. Saying a lot of bullshit. What if she had heard what you said?"" While he is saying this, he pokes in his ear with the ear pieces of his spectacles. Ray shudders.  When Ray tries to answer him, Unni carries on with his concepts about specialists. At one point, when the discussion was hovering around Cardiologists, I interrupted saying, ""Hey, you promised you would give me my stethoscope back a month back. Am I getting it back?"" A smile came over Unni's face and he said ""Kris, you are so nice. Don't you believe me when I say that I'll give it back to you?""  I say, ""Yeah right. You said sometime back that you'll give it back to me in 2 days. Why, why should I believe in what you say?"" He says, ""I'll give it back in 2 weeks. Sure. Please..."" Suddenly, he turns to Raghu and adds, ""You ass, you should have not gotten that drunk yesterday. You know I drank almost as much as you but was totally under control. Never lost it. What happened to the damned waiters? Bud, we should walk out of this crappy restaurant if the food doesn't get served in under five minutes from now."" And he starts counting down looking at his watch.  This is how the conversation carried on for another 10 minutes until the food arrived. While we were eating, Unni couldn't contribute too much because he was preoccupied with the fast-disappearing contents of his plate. I was contemplating saving money to buy another  urlLink Littmann stethoscope . And when we left the restaurant, I was wondering if I would live to see the day when I could have a sane conversation with Unni."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I was never a good reader during my school days, thanks to the 'quality' of teaching at the schools. Add to it the fact that my parents never seemed to have time to spend on these apparently 'trivial' leisures, you get a prefect mixture for 'hypolexia'. I noticed something while I was reading a passage about Gay Issues on the computer with a friend of mine - he would finish a paragraph in about 2/3rd time that I would take. If that made me feeling funny, a comment about having to read the entire Lord of the Rings book set, multiple times, during your childhood got me doubting my scholarly achievements.  Although both of these didn't directly pushed me into starting the jumbo paperback of the 'pseudo-trilogy', I feel better right now after going through the first thirty or so pages. It has got me really interested mainly because of the fact (that I think) that the plot is based on mythology which attribute the Human race's origin from other forms of intelligent life (Dwarves). That's very interesting indeed. I don't know how many of you are bored after reading this post about some thing which you might have thought about a decade back, but give me a break guys!  As I mentioned yesterday that I'm recording this new song called ""Promises"". I did some remastering today and the demo sounds balanced. I got wonderful reviews from friends from all over and I'm very glad about it. If you want to listen to the song  urlLink click here  to download. Listen to the song (lyrics are in an earlier post) and send in comments.  About the two issues that I've been working with lately, one has been resolved to some sort of solution now. The other one is still there. I hope it's not too late before anything bad happens. Late in the day, some persistent rain spoiled my plans to be at the Casualty (ER) at College after a gap of 3 years with my friends. I felt bad about the missed opportunity which had given me the time to start the book.  Comments please."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"I have a big problem. I think I am being neglected/ignored by far too many persons whom I know in real life. This has been happening to me from the time I can remember. And I do not enjoy it. Not even a bit. And it hurts.  Take the case of this friend’s wedding I attended recently. I happened to be one of only  TWO  friends of his attending the wedding at a city far away from our home. I was with the marriage party for close to two whole days. And I am relatively tall enough to be noted by any interested onlooker.  On the reception at my home town a couple of days after the actual wedding ceremony, I had the displeasure of being introduced by my Mom and Dad to the bridegroom’s family. They seemed to simply think that I was meeting them for the first time. Funny that I should know so much about four of them and none of them even remembered me. Okay, I might not be very attractive physically. But that should at least make them aware of my presence I guess.  This happens time and again, day in day out in my life. Today, when Ray, Chuck and I went to a restaurant to have lunch, a colleague of ours spent 10 long minutes catching up with my friends while not even bothering to look at my face. Maybe I  HAVE  a horrible face.  One reason why I’m so e-active is because I get more attention online than I can ever hope to get in real life. Take this blog as an example—At least 5 persons who I have not met in real life go through this blog everyday. Some of them even bother to comment about me and my life. The reason perhaps is that they don’t need to visualize me during this process.  Facts are facts and they must be accepted as they are. But they hurt, and hurt badly. I think I'm going to need some plastic surgery to improve my social skills."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"It is nice to be back after a tour to attend my friend’s wedding. It was a pleasant experience. Despite the fact that the wedding was a drawn-out, boring process, I had a nice time mainly because there were a couple of attractive older men in the bridegroom’s (my friend) party. One of them was his Dad and my friend knows about this. But he knows that I won’t do anything stupid.  One of the things that I was really worried about while planning this trip was if and how I’ll get along with a friend of mine who always seems to get to my nerves. We have had our share of squabbles in the past and are currently cool with each other. But I’m very uncomfortable around him and have been trying my best to avoid meeting him as much as I can. To my surprise, we found a couple of common topics on which we held the same general stand and spent almost the whole time on the train, to and fro, discussing them. That left me with very few instances of annoying remarks from him.  Along with that I got some quality time with my sister. I went to her home and spent a couple of hours with the in-laws. Like my friend, they were very nice as well.  Finally after coming back, I am feeling good about the trip. I am happy to have given Ray and Chuck some gifts that I bought and I’m actually giving my newly wed friend a gift at the reception party in my town today evening. I like this a lot. I’m thinking of the days when I never believed in giving gifts. I didn’t have any quality friends then.  The only let down in the scheme of things at present is the fact that my weirdo friend K is pissed after I refused him time at my PC. I really think that I had a genuine reason, and therefore, I’m not feeling too bad about this."
AX2K3G1,male,24,"The agony of not hearing from your date is horrible. Especially when it is due to such trivial reason - the computer guy sustained a freak injury which delayed the formatting an installation of the OS in Mr. Lion's computer. But after 3 days, I've had an e-mail with the preceding information which lessened the pain a little.  The agony of having to do something I hate is excruciating. Especially when the the aetiology is hopelessly shallow. Most of my relatives want to use me as their own personal doctor who could give them advice, which they could otherwise obtain, with a huge loss of money of course, from Cardiologists, Neurologist, Anaesthetics, Neurosurgeons, Infertility Experts etc. And I hate that. Why can't they ever try to understand what I would like to be talked to?  The agony of not being able to enjoy sex because of preputial stenosis, or in even easier terms ""True Phimosis"", is horrible. When you decide that you have to get cut, a dozen well-meaning Dads on  urlLink SilverDaddies.com , who are willing to go to any lengths to coaxe you to retain your couple of centimeters of skin, make you re-think. Their reasons are varied. Most center on the fact that prepuce is a blessing which you can't discard at will. Others argue that it is painful, causes decreased sensations etc. Now I'm going to try conservative methods after consulting a Urologist. If that don't work out, I'll try the radical method. Try this sit out if you have time -  urlLink http://www.nocirc.org   The agonies of being unable to master CSS, of not getting a JRship with pay, of not yet finding a new home for my dog, of suspecting my friends about their committment towards me etc. are being obscured by the aforementioned ones.  Well, if there is so much agony in my life, why am I not even crying? I'm not the kind of macho man who would waste a tear for fear of losing masculinity. Maybe my pain-control ""Gate"" mechanisms are state-of-the-art. Or maybe I'm hallucinating. Or maybe I'm just too cool."

I will miss many of the ladies that I worked with and several of the kids, there are several people and kids that I won't miss.  I spent the day in the classroom with Carla and Austin while the rest of the kids and Helen were outside with the field day activities.  I was glad to be inside, I didn't really feel like being outside with all the noise.  It was nice to chat with Carla and have a good day with Austin.  He wasn't as bad of a terror today as he had been before.  Well onward with my life.  Now the job hunt and apartment search begins.  Yesterday when I came home from work I was feeling horrible and needed to take another long drive.  Nathan was on and asked me to meet him at Ontario Mills.  I cleaned myself up and headed out.  There was a little traffic, but nothing bad.  I surprised him when he came into the bookstore as I was kneeling near a bookshelf while he was looking around for me and I popped up when he didn't expect it.  We shopped for gifts for Carla and Helen and did a little browsing.  Nathan kept setting off the security alarms at the stores we went into... sure he didn't steal anything, uh huh that's his story.  LOL... anyway, after shopping we walked over to Chevy's and I had a yummy dinner and conversation.  I think the hostess thought we hated eachother as Nathan was trying to tell me that my last post sounded full of vengence. Which it isn't. Anyway, we had a nice conversation and then went back to the car to chat and figure out what we could do.  Well I must say that Nathan is very sexy when he has one thought on his mind... hehe.  We went for a little drive into the business district and enjoyed eachothers company.  Then it was off to home. Leaving him is getting tougher.... anyway, I came home and wrapped the gifts I had bought for the ladies and then crashed.  And so the day ended around 1am.  Nice and long as usual.  Tomorrow I get to sleep in, for a little while at least.  I can't wait to go for the bike ride.  Woo hoo.  Anyway, right now I am working on laundry and preparing for my kidnapping of Nathan on Friday.  I still think he knows exactly where I am taking him.  It is going to be a lot of fun.  I can't wait to spend the time with him.. and Will too.  It will be the first trip I've taken with Will and that should be fun.  Hehe....hmmm how are we going to work the ""hump"" factor..

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Is nothing sacred???? Really! Oh My Gosh!  So I'm sitting here, eating my dinner and watching the WB, since there isn't really anything else on and I'm totally bored!  So what do I see?  A preview for the WB's new show this fall, TARZAN!  Can't they just leave the classics alone.  Ok it was cool that they turned Buffy into a show, because the movie sucked ass.  Then they had to go and create Smallville.  Superman is cool and all but leave it in the comics!  And now Tarzan.  A book that I loved as a kid is now the next big show on the WB.  I can't stand it!

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"I realize that I haven't really blogged much in quite some time and I now have so many things to share.  Oh the dilema of what to talk about first!  Well I guess I will just keep typing until my fingers fall off.  LOL  So today I went to my old high school, Saint Joseph High.  Why you might be asking?  Well stupid DH made me take the CSET today, which I was totally unprepared for (later story).  I realized as I parked my car across the street from the school and looked at it, that I hadn't been back in SJ in 8 years.  Yes, I've been there for the carnivals every now and again, but that is different, it's late at night and there is tons of rides and games, so the school has a completely different feel to it.  Today I set foot on the campus at the time I used to 7:15am.  As I crossed the street I noticed that the parking lot set up was completely different and appeared to hold less cars than before.  As you enter one of the side gates there is a rather large statue of Mary (I think) I didn't get a close look.  Sister Marianne was taking soda cans and water bottles out of the trash cans, just like she did when I went to school there.  In the middle of chapel court is a huge water fountain and the campus looks so different.  The old ASB office is now a bookstore, the lockers where I almost beat the crap out of someone my freshman year are still there, one even had decorations for one of the girls birthdays.  The test was in a History classroom that used to be used for Freshman classes, now it's a juniors classroom.  The theme of the lessons for that class were ""Fabulous Females of History.""  Great stuff, I'm wishing that my history class would have taught us something about the women of history.  As I walked through the hall I felt at home, I realized that SJ, despite how much I didn't fit in, was one of the best experiences of my life.  I had some great friends, wonderful classes and teachers, and I discovered who I really am there.  It amazes me how much my little high school has changed and grown, and it seems like it will continue to grow.  The Flynn center is amazing and full of such wonderful advancements, I only see the school going up from here.  I have thus made a new goal for my self... as soon as I obtain my master degree in English and my single subject in English I am going to go back to my alma mater and teach!  It was a wonderful place for me and it really instilled in me the desire to educate others, thus I want to give something, other than money, back to it! hmmm maybe I should apply at my old elementary school too! hehe  Tonight was our Annual Charity Car Show for the Women's Shelter of Long Beach.  We had a good turn out, although not as big as previously, and gave away lots of great stuff.  We were able to provide a truck full of toys, Mary Kay products, almost $400, and tons of cheer to the WSoLB.  I'm so thankful that our family puts this on.  My mother was a victim of domestic violence for many many years and is a survivor and I think that women that are out there being beat by their parents or significant others or both should have a place to turn to inorder to get their lives going on a different path.  I hope that next years show will provide more to the women and hopefully we've helped at least a few families.  Well I have begun to golf again!  I went to the Lakes again on Thursday with Judy, Laura Jo and Kathy.  I must say that I'm doing pretty dang well for being off the courses for so long!  My first time out I had 56 with a 5 on the last hole, I never got under a 7 on that hole before!!  My second time out I did fairly well too!  I had a 53 and a 5 on the last hole!  It's amazing.  The ladies are so fun to golf with too!  It's strange to be playing with women rather than men!   I do miss the antics of Roland, Ryan, Mel and Jeff!  They were always too funny!  So anyway, I am excited to be golfing again!  Oh LJ has this awesom club called the ""King Cobra,"" it's her wood and man is that thing awesome, she let me use it and I have never hit a ball as far as I did with that one!  So if anyone is looking for a gift to get me for christmas or my birthday I'd love to get one!!!  hehe  Oh, I am so loving how it feels like the holidays to me!!!  I haven't felt this warm and gooshie inside at night for a while!  I definitely am filled with the holiday cheer.  Yeehaw!  I think I may even go take pictures with Santa at the mall! hehe  Tomorrow is Bill and Sue's going away party.  I'm so bummed they are taking Abby to Utah with them.   :-(   Apparently, from what my dad says Bill really likes me!  Who would have thunk it!  I know I never would have, but I guess my love off Jeeping has really made him like me.  So today at the show I was talking to Bill.  He said that he and Sue have made a room for me at their house in Utah and that I am welcome to come out and see them whenever I like!  Bill even said he's going to get another Jeep to ride the trails with near their home!  I'm going to pass the Jeepaholics information on to him so he'll be able to meet some more people in his area to go on rides with!  He's even told me to bring Nathan and the Jeep along to try out the trails around him, he said there are a ton and that they are beautiful.  I can't wait to go!  If you would have asked me a year ago if I thought Bill liked me I would have said you were on crack! LOL.... So now I am thinking ... I'll borrow my parents trailer, put Nathan's Jeep on it (if he lets me)  and take Nathan and the Jeep out to Bill and Sues over the Christmas holiday.... Jeeping for the holidays that would be cool... hmm gotta talk to Nathan about this!  Wow that would be cool!  And then I'll get to see Abby again too! hehe"

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Well the official job hunt has begun!  I found several jobs I think I would really enjoy... but today was way too hot to work in this sweatbox of a room I have so I spent it in the cool water of the pool and shade.  Now tonight I can work on preparing everything to go out first thing in the morning. Woo hoo!  Wish me luck.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed and I know the perfect job will fall in my lap! It's about bloody time that it does.  So yeah, anyway.  That is perty much the latest update on that front and now time for the recap of last week...   So Sunday, that was like the 6th or something.. hmmm.. lets think back.. Becca came over and we spent some time sunning ourselves in the pool.  Bill and Sue brought Abby over and we taught her to love the water, she even goes in all by herself, it's so cute.  We had a yummy BBQ of good food that my parents cooked up.  Then it was time for Becca and I to release our boredom.... so we took off in her car and cruised around Lakewood, Hawaiin Gardens, Cerritos and Long Beach.  We even began to call people because we were so bored.  Nathan so graciously let us bother him.. hehe.  Anyway, we drove around for quite some time and then headed back here.  I don't remember if anything else memorable happened... I don't think it did.. But in all it was a very fun day.  Monday... I hate traffic.. have I ever told you I HATE TRAFFIC!!!! That's right.. It took me forver to get out to Moreno Valley to see Nathan.  But at 6pm I arrived and with some day light left we headed out in the Dark Prince to take some pics for Nathan's website and for the JA website too.  We found some great spots to take pics and great places for uh.. other things.. hehe... anyway.. On our way back to Nathan's we found this other hill that looked like fun.. so up we go.. we get to the top and Nathan says he thinks the path down the back will be better then the one we took up... ok .... so down we go.. then comes the big OH SHIT.. there is this drop and rocks.. hmmm very fun yet uh.. I'd never spotted someone going down a hill before... there was no way to turn around so down he came... and boy was it cool.. We got some really cool pictures as proof of the fun. (Gotta get me a Jeep!!!! or steal his.. hmmm gotta work on that driving stick thing)  After our little adventure we headed back to the house to get cleaned up  'cuz you know we were dirty... then it was off to pick up the half doors for the Jeep and dinner at the Spaghetti Factory, yummy.  We came back to Nathan's and had a nice evening together.  Off to sleep at last then it was up early in the morning so Nathan could get to work and I could go back to LA.  Ugh.. I hate LA.  Anyway.  I had a wonderful start to the week.  So Tuesday I headed back to LA and went by my Aunt Lee's house.. Well Jack and Jackie were over so we all decided to go out for a late breakfast/early lunch.  Then I spent a couple hours visiting with my aunt and running some errands.  We were all over Lakewood and Cerritos.  And boy was it a hot day too.. in that black little car.. ugh.  Anyway, I headed home and found out that the computer was not working so I spent several hours cussing it out and buying useless parts and Becca came over to try to help me relax.. and finally we all know how this story ends.  So Tuesday wasn't such a horrible day except for the computer thing.   Ok.. Let's see the movie that I watched on Wednesday was the Bourne Identity.. I must say it was very good.  Matt Damon... ahhhhhh.... *drool* ... oh hi... I'm back, anyway, very good movie.. could have picked a better leading lady though.  She didn't do it for me.  Oh well.   Crashed at Nathan's then on Wednesday night...  he's so cute when he sleeps... Gotta love him.. anyway...   Thursday.. woke up... headed to the donut shop.. grabbed a paper and some food.. then headed to UCR.  Nathan was already at work so I headed to the Rivera Library to do some reading.  As I was entering the building I ran into Rick.  Rick was Roland's old boss in Gov. Pub.  He asked how things were going and how Roland was, I told him about the moves for both of us and the break up and we chatted for almost 2 hours.  Rick has always been such a nice guy.  So yeah it was great to see him again.  So I headed up to the second floor (by the way the library has changed so friggen much, I miss my old dank, dusty, crappy library)  Well I found a nice secluded table by the window and began reading.  I look up not to long afterwards and who do I see but one of my old ""bosses"" from when I used to work in the Reserve!  ROFL.. Well he and I had a Hate-Hate relationship (I think it's 'cuz he was madly in love with me)  Anyway... I watched him out of the corner of my eye and at the instant he looked over in my direction I noticed that he recognized me and his face kinda went pale.. then he got up and left!!! The guy wasn't there more than 5 minutes and he left.  Oh I was rolling on the floor laughing it was so fucking hysterical!!!  I only wish I could remember his bloody name.. I remember the name of the cute frat guy I used to work with but I can't remember this ones..ROFL.. Anyway... So yeah that was funny... So I decided to head up to the fourth floor and find a private conference room to read in, so I wouldn't run into anyone else that I knew. Well I got carried away with my book, The Day the Voices Left by Ken Steele, it's such a wonderful book!!! Anyway, I was so caught up that when Nathan called to say he just left work I was totally shocked!  Mainly because it was 2pm and I hadn't even had lunch!!! So I met Nathan down in front of the library and we headed back to his place.  We decided to go to Jack in the Box for lunch, but when we got there it was all taped off by the cops and there was a new pt cruiser backed into a pole.. so we headed to Carls Jr.  We had a nice chat... discussed ties and button shirts and the girl in the car.  Very nice lunch indeed.  Then it was off to buy alcohol.. even though we forgot cups and milk, ROFL.  We came back to the house and cleaned and well the rest is history.  So it was another good day.  So I've already written about Thursday.  Let's see.... Friday I came home... things were not too eventful... Hung out with Becca and that's about it.  Saturday.. ahhhh Saturday..  Well I need to add a side note... I miss Nathan terribly when I am away from him, bah.. didn't think I'd feel this way so soon again.. Silly girl... ok... so Saturday... well Joy called on Friday and we decided it had been long enough and we needed to have lunch.. so she came over that morning and we headed to Roadhouse.  We had a very yummy lunch and a long conversation.  We came back to my place and continued our chat.  She's been having some issues with work.. hence the reason why I don't want to go back to corporate america at all!!!  So we chatted and then Nathan came (yippee).  She discussed her issue with him and hopefully she left with some good advice.  Well Becca soon arrived and the three of us took off to my parents first car show at the new location. We walked around and had lots of fun.  Becca tried beating up Nathan.  Becca got hit on by lots of old guys. In all it was fun.  My parents pissed me off but what's new.  Anyway.  So afterwards we brought the Ford back, piled into my car and headed to Friday's.  Friday's was fun.  We had tons of food and a really good waiter, too bad he wasn't all that cute.  There was a party on the other side of the wall that was clapping and having a good ol' time and there were a few instances where we felt inclined to join in.  What a blast.  So back home we came... So original plan was for all of us to get toasty on Becca's Absinthe.  So we open it up, Becca and Nathan take a quick drink from the bottle... boy was the expression on their faces priceless!!! Oh it was great... Well nobody really wanted to drink it after that. ROFL. So Becca took off since it was close to 11:30 and she had work the next bloody morning.  Nathan was about to leave, but I really really really wanted him to stay.  He decided to stay since he said it was too cold outside... woo hoo.  We had an amazing time together.. he's so  uh... complimentary. hehehe..  I drained him of his energy and we both fell asleep.  It was awesome to wake up next to him.  And I love to watch him sleep.  He looks so peaceful. Anyway, the alarm went off and he decided to turn it off. ROFL. We slept for another hour and a half and he decided he really had to go home to do his work.  So off he goes only to come back 2 minutes later to take pictures of the Bikini top on the Jeep. I stood in the door waiting because I knew he'd forget and then remember.  We took quick pics and then he was off.... I gotta move closer to him!!!  Anyway... I came back into my room.. worked on the computer for a bit then headed out to Becca's.  She and I headed to the Mall, ate at Islands... had a girls day... came back here and ordered pizza while we watched ""The Englishman that went up a hill and came down a mountain"" for her class.   She finally left and I came in to blog and vent... Then was calmed by Will and Nathan, they are both amazing guys.  And finally I was able to fall  asleep...   So I have just written a ton of stuff and I need to give my wrists a break.. I've got so much more to write about but that will come later... I'm outtie for the time being. Tubular!"
ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"So over the past several days (and couple of weeks) I have been going through one of the toughest experiences of my life both mentally and physically.  I have been so drained and overwhelmed by this experience that I have neglected to keep touch with the outside world.  Well this weekend was filled with the most stress, but also a lot of fun.  I spent the entire weekend with Nathan, which is becoming one of my favorite things to do ;-).   Let's see... Friday was cool.. I met Nathan in the afternoon for a meeting. Introduced him to Market Broiler.. K apparently I am no longer allowed to choose the restaurant. LOL.  Finally watched the ""Fast and the Furious.""  Found a cool lil mud puddle at the Metro link, hehe... gotta go off roading...hehe.  Belts are cool.. hehe... wonder what else Chris and Jen think?!  So spent a great time with an awesome guy. ;-)   On Saturday I enjoyed a wonderful Mongolian BBQ meal with Nathan, Will and Mauro.  Will mentioned an upcoming ""prom like"" event that sounds like fun.  (I went out and bought the ""dress that was made for me"" today. It's beautiful! I will be getting it on Friday! I can not wait. It is so purty! Yes Nathan it is the one from the mall that we saw!)  Then it was off to the talent show. Well of course I had forgotten my Pulp Fiction cd at Nathan's apartment, so Will, Nathan and I had to run to two different stores to find it.  I bought the collectors edition and gave Nathan the other one. (Sorry Will)  So we then went to the talent show.  I was so nervous!  I am comfortable SPEAKING in front of people but I have never SANG in front of a crowd without someone beside me.  Well I gave the song my all and I made the small mistake of looking at Will and Nathan, so I became even more nervous.  But, I finished the song to a roar of applause.  I did do the Dusty Springfield song I had planned originally.  Well when I was done I couldn't believe the applause.  And the DJ/MC seemed to love me.. hehe.  Well that just made me all the more nervous so I quickly went back to my seat and put my head in Nathan's lap to avoid throwing up.  The other performers were awesome and I thought there was not way I would win.  And Mystique.. oh my goodness.. what can I say.. what an excellent and entertaining performer and damn what a body!  ;-) Oh yeah.. Nathan can not blow up a balloon.. that's funny.. hehe  So finally it was time to be judged and we went back on stage.. I knew for certain that the other talents would all win and I was prepared to clap my lil heart out for them.  Third place was given to the Gloria Gaynor impersonator, second to the Marilyn Manson impersonator.  So it was down to myself and the gentleman that sung a beautiful Spanish song.  I was thinking ""that is so great that he's going to win, he did a great job!""  So I was SHOCKED beyond all belief when they announced that I won first place.  I was so amazed and I still am!  I couldn't believe it.  Me.. Hehe..Watch out American Idol here I come!  I did not receive the lifetime supply of lube or the book of 1,000 great sex positions, but what I did get was awesome.... a portable radio/cd player.  I've been needing a new radio in my car so this will be a perfect substitute for a while.  So.. After the talent show we headed back to Nathan's for a nice relaxing evening. Showers.. hehe...  So on to Sunday... Due to the meeting on Friday and the not so good news that I received (sorry my friends but I am keeping this to myself) Sunday was one of the most painful days of my life.  I never thought my body could hurt so badly!  I am so thankful that Nathan was there to support me.  Have I mentioned what a wonderful and caring man he is! :-)  Well I missed the turkey dinner with my parents and arrived back home around 7:30pm.  The turkey was great and Becca came by to give me an Easter basket.  I thought she was going to cough herself to death.  I hope she gets better soon!  So it is now Wednesday.  I am feeling much better, my body is still sore all over but it will be ok.  Things are looking up.  NOW FOR THE BIG SURPRISE................................................... .................................................................................................. is the suspense killing you yet?.................................................... ................................................................................................. I am moving to RIVERSIDE!!!  Yep... you heard right. I have given this so much thought over the past 3 years and have decided that that is where I am going to buy a house.  I am planning on transferring to either CSUSB or UCR and finish my credential out there.  So currently I am looking for a new job, hopefully something related to teaching, and a new house.  It was something that deep down I have always known I have wanted to do.  I am not saying it'll be for the next 30 years but at least the next 3.  So I know some people, Becca, will be mad to hear this and others may be ecstatic.  I am super excited and am finally looking forward to the future.  I can finally say that I think everything is going to be ok with the rest of my life! WOO HOO!"

ZGWZ7V5,female,26,"Well I corrupted Becca hehe.... We went to someone's house so I could rant and so we could get free alcohol.  I hate his cats!!! They bother my nose! LOL. K so yeah yesterday around 11am Becca and I arose from our slumbers (we went to bed around 2:30) and we had some yummy breakfast.  I had cereal and my leftover ravioli from the Olive Garden.  Then it was out to the pool to swim and relax.  The pool was nice and I can jump higher than Becca. LOL.  Well around 12:15 I decided to check the time and realized I was running late.  I came in and took a shower and got ready to head to Riverside.  I was ready around 1:30 but then I realized I still needed gas... Bah.. so off to the gas station.  I finally rolled out of Downey at about 2pm.  Nathan called and said he would be home at 3 so see I have perfect timing.  I jumped on the freeway and made it to MoVal at 3pm exactly.  Nathan and I went to a couple stores to buy me some rollerblades.  I found a really nice pair that are pretty dang comfortable.  Then we headed to the Performance center to buy a bikini top for his Jeep.  Back at Nathan's we took off his hard top, wow his Jeep looked so different all naked (although it is very dirty and is going to be massively cleaned by me very soon!!! he shows no love for his Jeep!) We got the drill out and made a few holes then installed the top.  It looks  a bit funny but who knows why!  I'm sure he'll figure it out.  Anyway, the Jeep looks really cool and is very airy, now I have got to remember to bring a hat with me. LOL.  And so after 2 hours the Jeep was complete and we were hungry. Nathan took me to Alculpolco (I don't think I spelled that right) and we had a very yummy dinner.  My burrito was huge! hehe I like things big hehe Anyway, Since we were sitting next  to one another we inspired another young couple to sit next to one another... aww ain't that cute.  We had their attention and the attention of the couple behind them throughout the whole meal.  I think they were just looking at the hottie I was sitting next to.  hehe.  So after a good meal we decided to return to the house make out for a lil and then head to the park to teach me to Rollerblade.  We almost got a ticket for parking in the park because apparently the park closes at 10 and it was 10:30, stupid rules.  So we moved the car and kept skating.  I have got the motion thing down I'm just not very good with the stopping or the turning, but with time I shall get better.  It was alot of fun... I was a dork... Nathan's cute when he's skating...plus from behind, yummy.  Anyway..... ahhhhh.. ok I'm back.  So I can kinda rollerblade. hehe.  Thank you Nathan for such an awesome night... working on cars, good food, skating, your right though it was missing one thing... ahh..next time. And so, I had a nice fast drive home last night. Was home around midnight.  Got online for a few minutes then crashed.  I gotta say that I love how Nathan is cool with my ""tomboyish"" side.  hehe... hehehe...   So I guess this is the week for working on cars! Nathan's Jeep, my dad's Chevy.   I just came in from helping him put a crank in his engine.  I smashed up a finger, but I don't think it is going to bruise.. cool.  Anyway.  I'm not sure how I'll spend the rest of my day.. I am waiting for my resume from someone so I can begin sending it out.  Other than that I think I'm just gonna try and relax and get some rest before the weekend comes.. it's the fourth of July.. I love the fireworks.. I love the outdoor bbq's, the alcohol.. wow so many good memories of the fourth. cool..."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"I pulled all my blood tests and realize that my cholesterol has sucked for a while.

I am taking bets as to what my current cholesterol is. I had a test last week but don't know the results yet. Elaine says 195, my mom says 203, Sue says in the 230's. I'm saying maybe 213 (random guess, I would say 230's but Sue already claimed it). I really hope it improved enough that I don't have to go on drugs. Fingers crossed."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Today went pretty well.  It was emotional, but good.  This morning I got that e-mail....very cool.  At my therapist things went well.  She wanted to see my shoulders which I refused to show her.  We talked how the scratching ect.. is actually a comforting technique.  When you get hurt, your body releases endorphines which make you feel good.  From what I understand, this is the idea behind flogging (S & M).  So, it makes sense that when I'm really upset I hurt myself as a form of comfort.  Yes, it sounds crazy, but it does make sense.  The trick now is to replace that form of ""comfort"" with something else.  I know that the posting talking about it was pretty weird.  That's cause it was right after I got out of the shower.  I wasn't feeling like writing, but needed to put something down otherwise I would just brush it off and forget about it.  We also talked about CC....alot.  And of course it went back to fear.  Why do I always continue to associate with people who can seriously injer me?  With my dad, I have a real, genuine fear that he will hurt me.  But I not only continue to stay around him (of course I'll do that, he's my dad).  But I also try to have real conversations with him.  I already know how they'll end.  He'll end up screaming at me and I'll get panicy.  Last summer when I was staying with him, I had to lock my doors every night and keep pepper spray on me, but I stayed there.  Well, until he flipped out on me.  And now with CC.  I am seriously scared of her.  I moved without changing my address (which almost ruined my credit) and changed my number.  So, after all contact is cut and I'm happy, what do I do?  I not only send her a package and a note basically saying ""I still love you"", I also send her my new address.  Now I can be worried all over again.  Well, she's overseas, so it isn't likely, but when she gets back it's a very real possibility she would just show up.  I just worry cause she's got so much hate in her and I know she has potential to hurt me.  She once even told me that if she ever found out I ever dated a guy it would not be ok.  So that takes us back to the MC thing.  Ok, I know I can get things worked out with her.  Just gotta figure it out.  Basically though I fucked up.  Red, you were right, I shouldn't have contacted her.  I should have known better, I just wanted to be honest and thought that enough time had passed that she could handle it.....I was VERY wrong.  Other stuff today, I wore heals for the first time in a while.  My calf spazamed a little but nothing too bad.  I got an e-mail from Archie.  I'm still on his mass e-mail list.  I have them go automatically to my trash, but sometimes read them.  I was even thinking about him yesterday.  My therapist and i were talking a while back.  See, he teaches at a high school.  I don't want to deal with all that happened.  I want to just forget about it.  The problem is, he works with young girls and i know he can be ""not-good"" (I don't know what word to use).  My therapist thinks I should send an anonomous letter to either the school or police dept saying basically ""Archie teached at the high school.  I was sexually assalted by him before and strongly believe he has the potential to do it again.  I am not interested in persuing any legal action.  If any other alligations come up against him, please take them seriously"".  I keep thinking about it, but don't know if I want to deal with it.  I know that this makes me a bad woman for not running out and making an example of him and burning him at the stake in the name of all women everywhere.  But, I need to worry about me.  I can't even get a fucking massage, I still get flashbacks sometimes.  I don't think I can face it so head on.  I think that I still just want to think about it as ""messing around"".  Anyways, football player asshole was much worse and I can't do jack shit about him.  Well, I guess it's more I won't.  I think I want to just forget about it all and move on.  It's so anti-feminist.  Oh, back to the e-mail.  Appently he is sick.  They don't know what's wrong with him but he had to go to the ER the other day.  I know I'm a sadist bitch, but fuck him I don't care.  Karma Bi-otch!!  Oh, and I saw Fahrenheit 911.  Oh, my god.  It was so good.  As always, Moore goes over the top, but he raises so many good points.  I think that overall just seeing all the shit that has been comming out over that last years condenced into one place really makes you think and realize how bad it is.  I think everyone there was balling.  I was no way an exception.  But it was kinda nice to cry and hurt over something real and bigger than myself.  Crying over your own life and crying over things bigger than yourself carry two entirly separate feeling. The one thing is, they showed alot of overseas footage.  All I could think of was CC.  I really don't want her to get hurt.  My first reaction is to write her and tell her to please come back.  She can use the gay ""get out of military free card"".  But, I know I can't.  In fact, now it's apparent that I can't even tell her that I'm worried.  I guess I have to harden myself....again, well at least to her.  So, I guess I'll just have to be sad and worry and not let her know.  What do I say to her?  Things are so bad over there.  I want her to feel comfort and love but if I do that it'll make it worse.  Please help me out here guys.  I really need some advice."
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Ok, we're leaving for Denver in an hour and a half so I went to my mom's house to meet them.  No one is here.  huh.  Theie suitcases are packed and in the kitchen but both my mom and Elaine are out.  I guess I'll just wait here (I got chocolate milk!!).  The other day I went to this shi shi jazz club cause my friend was performing.  You know that chick who played at pride who I used to go out with a little and whom I really like.  Ya, she sings at this one jazz club.  It was totally fun.  I think we were the most under dressed there.  It was super expensive.  I order a Grey Goose Cranberry (well liquor frightens me).  It was $9!!  But at least they made it good.  Well, I got to see lawyer chick (singer).  She looks a bit different but still really cool.  She is dating someone though so no luck there.  Her brother was there too and he remembered me.  Well, I went with my one friend (who also knows lawyer chick from a totally different situation) and her best friend who lives in the East Bay.  Her friend was totally cool.  I wasn't super interested cause I was busy drooling over lawyer chick.  My friend kept nudging me to talk to her friend more and after a little while I realized that she was trying to hook us up, huh.  I got a little tipsy (for $9 i better feel something) and started relaxing and we talked a little.  I'm very proud of myself though.  I didn't make an ass out of myself at all.  I was very careful to watch what I said.  Well, last night my friend called me to come hang out (she lives like 5 min away).  We hung out, watched the 5th wheel (yeahee!!).  She told me that her friend really liked me and wants to go out and said to give me her number.  While we were hanging out last night though her friend calls and we talk on the phone a little bit.  I told her that when I get back from CO I'll call her and we'll get together.  That was unexpected.  I must be getting better at something, just not sure what.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm taking bets as to how many dates till I fuck it up.  I vote 2.  Ok, no negativity....sorry.  I am awesome and everyone wants me, oh yes!!     (P.S.  Snoring really is sexy.  I realized this last night.  My friend kept drifting off and snoring.  Then she'd wake up and appologize.  There's nothing to appologize for, that really is sexy.  Ok, not when you're trying to sleep yourself, but it's a gentle, pure, relaxed act...very cute.  Think about it.)"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"It's been a while since I wrote, so I have a little bit of updating to do.  Last Thurs was a pretty good day.  I saw my dad and hung out with Red.  That was the first time in forever that my dad didn't make me cry.  So, as fucked up as that is, it's a start.  I'm trying to be more open with him and honest.  I even told him my cholesterol.  I've been dancing around the issue for a while with him.  He knew it was high, but I refused to give him the number.  Well, I finally did.  As expected, I got a long, involved lecture.  See, my cholesterol is the same as his was when he had his first heart attack (at 34).  I'm trying to accept the fact that he's worried about me.  It's annoying as hell, but I know he's just really concerned.  But of course, to offset this real fatherly concern about my health, he proceeds to expalin to me why I'm fucking up my life by getting a PhD.  It  ammazes me that he has the balls to say that.  I always thought he was Pro-Education, but I guess he's Pro-Education in the field I choose.  I'm going for a PhD!!  I'm going to be a doctor, and he thinks I'm a failure.  Oh, well...that's my dad.  Today was also a pretty good day.  I made a new friend.  I decided to join this queer women's group and she's in it.  She has a girlfriend, so it's not like that at all (in case that's what you were thinking).  Anyway, we met up this morning to walk.  We walked probably 3-5 miles.  That's good since I've been lazy with the gym lately.  But, we talked alot about things.  Mostly about how we've changed so much and right now trying to figure out where we are and who we are.  I'm not who I was in college.  In fact I'm embarresed of who I was back then.  I feel like I've changed so much.  But then it's wierd cause you don't really know who you are anymore.  I find myself sometimes slipping back into my old role and I hate it.  I don't like that person anymore, I want her to go away.  I'm not crazy like I used to be.  Sure, I regress sometimes, but that's not me.  So, in all we talked for like 3 hours.  I really think we're gonna end up friends.  Other stuff today.  I'll say the depressing one first so I can end on a happy note.  Today is Father's Day.  This is truely my least favorite holiday of the year.  It even beats out Columbus Day (and if you know me, you know how much I loathe Columbus).  First things first, no my father does NOT want to see me for Father's Day.  But, anyway I went to get him a card.  I hate shopping for Father's Day cards.  They all go off about how much he taught you, what a good dad he was, ect...  I want to know where the Dead Beat Dad section is.  Every fucking year I almost cry looking for a card cause they are all so fucking sweet.  Where's the ""you're an asshole but I love you anyway"" or ""i turned out well despite you, not because of you"" or ""thank you for giving me enough problems for years of therapy"" cards.  I just look for one that says ""I love you, happy father's day"".  But those don't exist.  They're all mushy sweet endearing, ""you're the greatest dad in the whole wide world cards"".  I only found 2 that I could give without being a total liar.  And I recognized them both as one's I'd given him before.  So, I picked the one I gave to him year before last.  I says ""Dad, I feel lucky to be your Daughter, and I may not say it enough but I'll always love you, Happy Father's Day"".  Yes, the first part is not entirely true, but this is the closest one I could find.  Don't believe me, look for yourself.  There are no plain cards.  Oh well, whatever.  Ok, on to the happy stuff.  This sat my friend is having a gender bending party for pride.  So, I'm going Butch.  I'm very excited.  I went to target today to pick up a pair of Dickies and a button down shirt.  I also got a sportsbra that's 2 sizes too small, so my boobs go from D to gone.  It's a little scarry, and slightly uncomfortable.  Just trying to figure out what to do with my hair.  I'm thinking low ponytail or braid.  Maybe a baseball cap.  Oh, I even went to Sephora and got free samples of cologne so I can smell like a guy.  My friend asked if I'm gonna pack but I'm a little apprehensive.  I think it'll look stupid.  Anyway, what am I supposed to use.  I was thinking just a sock if anything.  Some website I found said to fill a condom with hair gel.  Ummmm....no, I don't think I will.  I think that you'll be able to see my sportsbra under the T-shirt so if I pack it might just look wierd.  I'll think about it.  Anyway, won't that get uncomfortable, and what if my sock falls out when dancing or something.  Do you think I'll make an ok Butch or will I just look funny?"
RV8CJXP,female,24,"Well, I just got back from a date that actually went well.  We went to a lesbian show.  It was really fun.  I went with a FTM (female to male).  He's on horemones (has facial hair and deep voice) and has had upper body surgery (breasts removed) but I don't think the lower body (still had girlie parts).  If you saw him on the street, he looks 100% male.  (If you're reading this and feel uncomfortable it's time to check your stereotypes and tolerence levels.)  I've never dated a trannie before so I was a little nervous.  Oh, and to top it off, he's a cop.  There's another I never do.  Anyway he's really nice.  Looks kinda like an all american boy.  Which again is something I don't normally do.  So I guess this was different in all ways.  I'm just proud of myself for not fucking up a date.  Usually I do something stupid.  Tonight we just got along and had a really good time.  Even smooched a little bit.  We shall see (my choice phrase of the week). Time for bed, dyke march is tomorrow."

And I'm embaressed about the shit we're putting out for ""marketing"".  It looks like a 6th grade art project the the mom is just like ""oh, that's nice honey....let's just put it away.....for safe keeping"".  Ok, breath no more angry, negative thoughts.  I'm a little worried about that.  I'm back to my serious blank face.  I'm trying to be more expressive facially but it's hard.  I'm try harder.  I bought myself a present yesterday.  Kinda a independence gift.  I love lingerie but I only ever get it when I'm in a relationship with someone.  And then I get what they'd like.  Well, I am single but I like lingerie.  I passed by Vicki's Secret and they had a massive sale.  There were these little slips for $19.99 and for Vicki's that's really cheap.  So I got myself a bright pink nightie.  It's for me.  No one's gonna be seeing it, it's just for me to have and enjoy.  I decided that I'm going to start wearing cute lingerie again regardless of my relationship status.  So yes I am sitting at my desk, my myself, typing this entry in a black lacy thing.  But you know what...I can do that!!"

It should be a pretty easy problem, just the writting will be the trick.  I'm feeling kinda sick right now.  Not too sure why.  I think I over ate.  I had a late lunch then at a meeting today they had Indian food so I had a little (about 6).  So, I'm gonna skip a full dinner.  Today I realized that I'm kinda sensitive about Indian stuff.  The people at the meeting didn't know what anything was and kept calling everything by their own names.  ""Do you want some crispy nibblets?""  I know that it's stupid, but it was really starting to annoy me.  I don't want to go into it cause I know it's over reacting, but it really annoyed me. Also, Ali sent me a good luck e-mail.  Let me see if I can insert it.  Nope, I can't insert it.  Oh well.  I'm not gonna respond.  When I talk to her next time I'll ""break up"" whatever it is this is.  On an up side I'm seeing this girl I REALLY like on Sun.  We're going to a concert.  We'll see how that goes.  As for Tyler, we haven't spoken in a few days.  Whatever.  On a different subject, I'm super excited about this weekend.  It's gonna be crazy till Monday, but It'll be fun.  Let's see......

How about Kris) for dinner followed by concert.  Damn, next Tues is my roomate's B-day and she wants to have a party.  So I gotta worry about that too.  And call the manager to get a work time.

Is there such a thing as 'too much material' or just, perhaps, the wrong kind of material. For example, if I'm in a phase of watching a lot of junk TV, I'm 'inputting' a lot of material, and I do see it effecting my creative process. On the other hand, if I'm 'inputting' inspiring things, l don't feel like there is a 'too much' point."

N6J7KCU,male,25,"urlLink     urlLink     Irony.  I've bitched about it before.  So many of us seem to have forgotten what it means and use it to legitimize apathy, dishonesty, laziness and bad fiction.  What's so interesting about saying the exact opposite of what you mean?  What's so great about quotation marks anyway?    And hey:  what's so ironic about a chimp wearing terry cloth and pointing a pistol?  If chimps were regularly murdered with pistols, perhaps this might approach irony.  Like my college roommate used to say:  ""Rain on your wedding day isn't ironic unless your the greek god of sunny weddings.  Otherwise, it just sucks.""  But I don't want to overstate the case, either:  A gun toting chimp is pretty goddamn funny.    So why can't it just be that?

N6J7KCU,male,25,"Brown Eggs are Local Eggs and Local Eggs...   The results of the banking poll seem to indicate that you people prefer a local asshole to an international one.  I guess I do too, because a less sucessful asshole is, perhaps, less of an asshole.  Unless, that is, he is desperately trying to move up in the asshole hierarchy, in which case he might be worst asshole possible.    There's something oddly provincial about the assumption that a local bank is preferable to a larger one, even if it is definitively ""just as greedy.""  It seems people are willing to pay for the right to say they bank locally, because even a great mug can't make up for all the free shit those conglomerate bastards pile on you.  Free checks, free card, no monthly this and that, etc.; one saves enough money to buy a case of novelty mugs.    Of course, the appearance is that local banks can't afford to give these perks out like candy, but I wonder if, to whatever degree, the spartan account package provides a more valuable commodity of customer self-satisfaction, meaning, that even if they could give out the same amount of free shit, they have a stake in not doing so, in allowing their customers to feel like their banking decisions are moral decisions.  That's pure speculation, of course, but it strikes me that while it would be easy to frame this discussion in terms of David and Goliath, we cannot forget that we are talking about institutions that have much more in common than they do not, including but not limited to a hardline profit motive, willingness to screw you over, and, of course, an assholed nature.  I don't mean to make them sound evil, either; I just mean to say that morality is irrelevent to this discussion.  The solution?  Well, I've been assured that my gold doubloons are in the mail.

N6J7KCU,male,25,"It's not often that one has the luxury of choosing their allegiances.  I once met a guy who had gone from being a Quaker to a Skinhead to a Joycean to a Russian Orthodox, all within a few years.  When I met him he was still a Joycean, but was shopping for a new faith.  We discussed this quest in a New York diner.  I remember watching him pour gravy over his waffle fries and being mildly disgusted. It was difficult not to understand his eating habits as relevant to his identity crisis.    My first and only question to this pilgrim was:  What's true?  He didn't understand what I meant.  So I said, list your beliefs for me, and we'll figure out which religion is most consistent with those beliefs.      But to do it that way made no sense to him.  He was evaluating the different options on the basis of his preferences, what he would like to believe.  This didn't make sense to me; you shouldn't believe in transubstantiation because your Catholic, you should be Catholic because you believe in transubstantiation.  Especially, or perhaps only, if you are a convert rather than born into a faith.  Being born into something is admittedly arbitrary, but at least then it is intertwined with your upbringing and formative identity.  And most religions account for this arbitrariness with ceremonies such as confirmation, bar/bat-mitzvahs, various other rites of passage that parallel one's nominal development of free-will.  To convert on the basis of mere preference is a bit mercenary, if not whorish, if not the the ultimate expression of a bland consumerism.  Nonetheless, with the impending move to Chicago, I am in the position to make just such a conversion.  Raised a Red Sox fan, the disappointment, incredulity and perennial feelings of betrayal all in my veins, I am for the first time moving to a city with it's own options.  Of course, of course, of course: I am and always will be a Red Sox fan, first and foremost.  Forever.  But which team's games will I attend?  Listen to on the radio?  Discuss when drunk?  For whom will my love of the game transcend my love of the Red Sox?  Prior to a few days ago, it was a foregone conclusion that this team would be the Cubs, MLB's other cursed franchise.  But now, I'm not so sure.  The White Sox might actually be more my style, dare I say it, more Red Sox.  Alas, this is a decision that calls for careful research, consideration and counsel, and I cannot make a decision at this moment.  (Please feel free to advise me, but please don't bombard me with bullshit.  This is an intellectual exercise, not a dogmatic one, so don't act like a thug.)  Needless to say, my decision will not be made on the basis of the team's performance, but it's personality and essence.  I will not be choosing based on which team is more likely to enter the play-offs, but on which team I think can better serve as proxy for my living, once again, in Boston, surrounded by like-minded cohorts and cultural implications.    More later."

The Cubs are quick to claim underdog status, but who is keeping them down, exactly?  It's a usurpation of sympathy and it isn't attractive.

(all im gonna say about that encounter is that its EXTREMELY funny to be hit on outside of your own house - esp by a kid you very well could go to jail for - the kid has balls i must say.)  anyway, this kid and i end up leaving at the same time this morning and played car-tag down some streets.  (granted you cant go all that fast near my house in the morning - lots of traffic and lil kids going to school - but it was fun - i havent done that in years)  so that was one event.  the other was that i thought i saw kae and luke on the expressway but it turns out that it was just some white hippie people - very weird. (the scary thing was that the white girl really did look like kae (who is a dark filipino girl) from far away. of course i didnt realize it wasnt them till i almost had an accident.  new rule: if you think you see someone on the expressway, just call their cell - dont try to get their attention."
YB0WDIM,female,23,did you know that they have k-marts and walgreens in puerto rico?? how like home!! so the question of the day: did anyone make enuf cash to go there this spring?

YB0WDIM,female,23,Sometimes all it takes is having the right conversation with the right person to make you feel 100 times better. =)
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Nick is a daddy's boy!!!~all weekend long Nick was only truly happy when he was in Shawn's arms  or  in Shawn's presence. I love it! I'm so glad they bonded so well this weekend. I don't think they have  ever  been as close as they are now. It's so cute.  We both miss Shawn right now. Keely's sleeping over tonight! Nick and Keely get along really well. She's entertaining him right now. Tomorrow Keely & I are finally going to see, Fahrenheit 9/11. I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I can't wait! Both Keely & I are huge Kerry supporters and we both want Bush out of office  4 years ago !"
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Nick got his very first hair cut from great g'ma Jan. She did a great job evening out the sides and the back of his hair. He had a huge patch of hair on one side and not the other. He fussed and cried only because we had to hold his head. Thank you G'ma Jan! Awesome job.    Today Nick and I had another 1st...we ventured to the Whole Foods Co-op and got Soy Ice Cream and teething biscuits. Nick has been teething like crazy. He was up almost all night long. I was so crabby by the time 6 rolled around and I was up. Poor Shawn-I took out my frustrations out on him because I can't take them out on Nick. I need to find a better way to vent...maybe meditaton or yoga of some sort.    It is so hot & humid outside right now. I miss Shawn more than ever. I am so lonesome for my husband. I think Nick is, too."
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Nick has become the ultimate wiggle worm! He can quickly wiggle himself off his vibrating chair, his car seat, even if you set him on your legs...anywhere and everywhere. He's has also been much more expressive the last few days with his voice  and  he's ticklish! G'ma Lu discovered this one. I tried it once this morning...ok, twice...and he squishes up his face and laughs! It is so funny to watch.  Nick has got much better at putting his fist in his mouth and anything else he can grab! G'ma Lu & Billy are getting Nick an excersaucer! ""To support Christian's weight loss."" My mom usually calls Nick, Christian. Hopefully today or tomorrow we can get that because both Nick & I are so bored...It's going to be a very very long day. Duluth is cloudy and today is supposed to resemble yesterday which means periods of rain here and there all day long. And it's cool out, which is fine by me!"
BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Today, Shawn took Nick up to Menard's to pick up something and when he was leaving the parking lot-actually BEFORE he left his parking spot-another car hit our back drivers side panel. Thank God Nick was strapped in his car seat in the middle of the back seat and not right behind the drivers seat or he could have been really hurt. Shawn & Nick are ok. The other vehicle doesn't even have a scratch on it! My Toyota Echo is obviously not great in accidents!  Hopefully ...It's considered totaled and we can get a better family car!!!  Last night Shawn & I finally completed Nick's hand and foot prints in clay and mounted it on the wall in a frame.   Only 19 1/2 hours until Shawn leaves =(   Tomorrow is our 2 year wedding anniversary!!! SOmetimes it seems like we got married yesterday and other times it feels like*in a good way*we've been together forever!"

BKBDZEZ,female,23,"Nick has screamed almost all day long! Nothing has helped him. I called Shawn in tears to hear his voice. Shawn said he'd come home and I told him not to and that I just needed to hear his voice and it made me feel better already. To make a long conversation short, he's on his way home!~for the night and then he has to leave by 4:30 am. What an amazing husband. I think he just felt like he needed to come home. I feel guilty though. I am worried about him driving all these miles and being exhausted. I gave Nick benadryl and feed him and right now he's out for the count. I didn't want to give him benadryl because the pharmacist was surprised the Dr recommended it for someone as young as Nick. The dose recommends by our Dr is 1/2 tsp and the recommended dosage for a 6 yr old is 1 tsp...Nick is only 3 months old! I was planning on calling the Dr again tomorrow to confirm the benadryl dose recommendation but I didn't know how eles to help Nick. I used all the resources I had and then some. I tried ever trick I knew of. Poor Boy!"
