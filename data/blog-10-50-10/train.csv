ROAO66H,male,25,"i still haven't decided if this is a mistake or not.  i have two basic tenets concerning girls: 1) they're crazy 2) they do whatever they want.  i'm not a misogynist or anything.  in fact, i'm very far from that.  items 1 and 2 are just what i've observed from my 22 years.  and just so nobody thinks i'm making baseless arguments here, i had two sisters that i lived with for 12 years or so, and i currently live with a girl.  on the whole, those girls were not 1 and 2, but they certainly have their flashes.  i'm glad it's like that though.  if everyone went about making rational decisions all the time, we would lead quite the boring existence.  i also understand that guys don't always make the most informed choices; i've lived with them too.  this post isn't really about guys though.  actually, it's not about girls in the plural sense either.  it's about 1 girl who had slid off the radar but has now resurfaced as a little blip somewhere in the distance.  little blips can be the worst:  you know that something's there, and you know you don't have to do anything about it immediately, but you feel like maybe you should.  i'm currently doing something about my blip.  i saw her in the mall just last weekend.  it was a 'small world' moment if there ever was one.  i only go to that mall about once a month now since i no longer live 10 minutes from it.  once upon a time i went at least once a week, but those days are long gone.  so are the days of me talking to this girl.  the girl that for no imagineable reason i saw in the mall as i was headed towards Strawbridge's.  small world.  i know she saw me too.  there was a moment where our eyes met, and while i couldn't see mine, i know there was panic in hers.  i passed her though, kept right on going.  i felt no obligation to say anything since i feel that our demise was mostly her fault.  the tense of feel and felt are very important.  i 'felt' that way.  then i heard that earlier you had seen me when i wasn't paying attention, and that you really thought about tapping me on the shoulder.  it was no surprise to me that you didn't; you never were any good at that sort of thing.  consider this the tap.  you have my attention.  you now have a chance to explain why you decided to take up 1 and 2 after fully convincing me that that wasn't you.  there are some rules though: 1)  i'm not doing this over IM or over the phone 2)  you'll have to come to me 3)  my direction skills have improved, so if i give you directions, you'll find me.  that's it.  i know you love making decisions, so here's one for you.  it's a chance to set the record straight, because my record is pretty warped.   haven't played any poker in a few days, which means i'm still up.  go me!  oh yeah, i officially locked up the average title on thursday nights, meaning i bowled in 2 leagues and won 2 averaged titles.  not too shabby.  -ziks"
ROAO66H,male,25,"So NeTeller finally deposited this morning...Skiz, hopefully, you'll be doing better than the we did last night.  Everytime I got a decent hand (Ace/King suited, King/Jack offsuited, pocket Jacks, etc) I'd get a flop of 2clubs, 4diamonds, 9spades and lose.  Then, when I'd get 4/5 suited or 8/10 suited, I'd get a flop of 2 Kings and a Jack.  WTF is up with that?  Meanwhile, on those two mentioned flops, Ken..errr..the winner would be holding pocket 4s and pocket Jacks, respectively.  Yeah, there's luck involved...but still...I mean really, that was getting ridiculous. JAM has almost completed SYS201...unless the blog decides it's hungry and eats it.  I really don't understand why we are forced to take all this stuff.  I've pretty much forgotten all the stuff on the Firebird ACQ201 already.  PPBES?  Come on now...that's probably the most painful training in the world.  Period. Speaking of pointless training, I got CC'd (not BCC'd) on an email to my boss regarding my upcoming promotion in July 04.  The training coordinator mentioned that I still have 3 different training classes to take (PPBES, ACQ201, and SYS201).  I find it funny that as training coordinator: 1) she had no clue that PPBES is out of stock and not sending books (and even telling people not to continue it) 2) I finished ACQ201 in December 2003 and emailed her to let her know. Way to stay on top of things. Anyway...once the August hits, I'll no longer be an ""Intern"" not that it will change anything buy my paystub.   urlLink Poker chips , anyone?  I really think I'll wait until I see a sweet deal.  They're all over eBay and 5stardeal.com so I'm not worried about anyone running out.  The deal with Party/Empire Poker is pretty sweet, but then again, you technically are paying $100 for them.  BUT, if you win while playing your 125 hands, you're gettin em for free.  Either that, or I drop about the same amount and get an extra 150 chips.  Hmmmm...such decisions.  By the way, I have a feeling that I'm addicted to Mt Dew.  The problem is that when I get one every afternoon, I wake up immediately.  I'm sorry, but does Code Red flow directly into my blood stream?  Maybe it should.

ROAO66H,male,25,"Another morning, another shshen sho frenzy. Day after day I come into this place I like to call ""work"" but as lil_skiz pointed out not much work transpires. All of us in room 190, except perhaps the newest member of the play pen, are under Master Sho's wicked spell, sometimes not stopping to do even the more remedial tasks required to sustain life, like WDT.  Alas, today is a new day and Master Sho's grip only tightens. Today, however, I vow to end his tyrannical reign! No longer will room 190 be victim to his atrocities.   20 minute pause  Ok, that was probably the weakest rebellion I have ever started. Curse you Master Sho! Perhaps it is best to strike a deal...in fact yes, that is what must be done. Luckily for me deals with the Devil always work out for the best. That being said I have decided to dedicate my time here at ""work"" to a more novel and worthy project (no offense to Master Sho of course), namely writing a flick (which may be edited to a short series based on the amount of content I can stea....er think of). Anyone care to contribute to the creative works of Room 190 throw it up here and we'll see how things progress"
ROAO66H,male,25,"so i'm sitting there with nothing.  i mean, nothing.  one of my cards i think is a 5 of Diamonds, and the other card has a Bird illustration on it with a roman numeral C.  i couldn't trade these cards at an Arabian market for an american flag.  but i'm the big blind, so i'm in already.  flop comes out, everybody checks.  so i get to thinking that maybe no one else has anything, and i bet $1 on the next hand.  fold,fold,fold,fold.  i'm a winner. this happens all the time.  people in online poker are scared to bet on anything less than a sure thing, so as soon as someone throws a little action the pot's way, they're folding like london bridge.  what i love about it is that it's a .50/1.00 game.  that means, that the bets are either 50 cents or a dollar.  you can't buy anything for a dollar, besides a game of bowling at the fort.  but these people will just muck if they don't have the nuts.  so let's go over skiz's tips:  1)  if you have any semblance of anything, and people are checking, raise them. 2)  if you have the nuts, and someone is betting, check him.  number 2 is really based on number 1.  people are scared to gamble, despite the fact that they have given people they don't know access to their bank account and social security number, and they will bak away so quickly if they see you raise.  better to let them bet themselves into a corner and raise at the absolute last second.  here are some money totals so far:  bought in for $100 with a 8.9% charge for the instant deposit (-8.90) before today i was holding $73 (-$27) after today i was holding $79 (-$21)  luckily for me, i've played 125 hands, and after that many hands, they're going to throw me $25 dollars in bankroll.  so really, i'm only down the finance charge at this point, plus through another promotion, they're going to ship me 300 free clay chips.  so far, so good.   so what.  time for cards.   BANKROLL:  $120 (approximately)"

ROAO66H,male,25,"According to the MLB's official site these are the Top 10 reasons why it's better to be a fan of the...         Red Sox:    Yankees:     10. The Green Monster  10. American League Pennants: NYY 39, BOS 10    9. Kenmore Square vs. the Bronx,'nuff said   9. World Series titles: NYY 26, BOS 5     8. Seats that aren't 10 miles from the field   8.

Season series titles since 2000: NYY 4, BOS 0     5. Epstein's younger (and cooler) than Cashman   5. A-Rod plays for: New York     4. Cy Youngs: Pedro 4, Mussina 0   4. Babe Ruth     3.

The chowder's better in Boston   1. 1918        This is probably the most horrible list ever composed.  How can you go ahead and make a mockery of Ted Williams like that by putting chowder as the number one reason why Boston is better than NY.  And although most of the people alive in this day and age don't know much about history, there were two guys by the names of Carl Yastrzemski and Cy Young that played some time for the BoSox that I heard weren't too bad either.  How the hell can you put down Babe Ruth and completely forget about Yaz and Cy!  Now I know you are all going to say, but when Ruth was traded that's when everything changed, no shit, that's why they have 1918 there.  This poll had to be compiled by either a 35 year single guy who listens to too much Joe Buck and Tim McCarver (who both suck by the way, good job Deion in hosing McCarver), or was an actual poll passed around elementry schools in the NY and Boston areas.     The Yankees side I can't argue too much about, but I would like to know how Aaron Boone made it up there.  He sucked all year long, had one big hit, and instantly he is changed from goat to god....I don't think so.  Somehow I don't understand how Boone can be put up higher than Ruth.  Was this list the best reaons to be a Yankee fan in the past 6 months?  No, it wasn't.  Perhaps I missed the memo that all MLB polls should be crap, that is the only possible explanation.  So go New England Clam Chowder....Boston's best attribute."
ROAO66H,male,25,"I've eaten some sick things in my life... a pig brain, a dead fish on the beach, and a sheep testicle, but 2 year old Easy Mac took the cake.   Every night when I go to my cupboard looking for something to eat... a packet of Easy Mac falls to the counter and teases me with its potential cheesy goodness. But, I don't eat it because of all the Thiamin.   Last night I had to eat something quick to get to the bar in time to catch the end of the Pistons game. Pistons won... and I had to make something ""easy"". Some food I could ""mac"" on. Some Easy Mac. I was excited. I was going to eat the Easy Mac.   I opened my cupboard in anticipation waiting for it to fall down to the counter, yet tonight... it stayed put. It sat there and taunted me like a little bitch. A little bitch I would devour.   I snatched it out, emptied the crusty noodle into a bowl, splashed some water in, and nuked. As I kept my face pressed against the leaky microwave I caught a glimpse of the noodle wrapper. I saw what I thought was the serial number and started thinking to myself what a huge dork would understand what that shit actually meant. I mean honestly, how boring of a person would that have to...  BEEP!  I emptied the cheesey pack into the bowl and stirred. It wouldn't be long now. A cloud of cheese powder floated into the air with the toxicity of what I could only guess was that of asbestos. I took my first bite. It didn't taste like easy mac at all. It tasted like Satan.   I ate three more chomps wondering if maybe I just hadn't had the shit in so long my body needed to build up a tolerance. The third bite kind of sat in between my lungs. Almost like there was some sort of problem down below...   I waited for my food tube to push the easy mac down yonder and started looking at the serial number again. Maybe I could decipher it...   ""EXPMAR01""   Hmmmm... before I could let the realization of my own stupidity sink in, it felt like I'd been shot in the stomach. I keeled over and stared at my trash can for a couple seconds and as quickly as it came, it went away.   I got up, threw away the easy mac, and ate a sandwich.   The next day I was at the Secretary of State renewing my licesnse plate. I'd taken my number and was sitting in the row of chairs that face the wall, when a little thimble of gas arrived to my rectum. It was a minor disconfort and I was sure nothing would come of it. I put my arm over the chair next to me, lifted my right cheek as I acted like I was looking behind me, and released.   pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffsssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  I hadn't noticed but a small black kid was curled up behind my chair, I had probably just killed half his brain cells. I soon realized that was the least of my worries. I could watch the smell move through the room as people one by one became extremely uncomfortable. I finally smelled it, it smelled like death.   My number was called. I sat motionless deciding on my next move. Would I sit and wait for the smell to leave and then get another number? Or would I give away the culprit. There was no was I was about to sit here for another hour in this room, besides it smelled like shit now.   I walked through the aisles and approached the counter. As I walked through the aisles I heard comments behind me.   ""Oh for Christ's sake...""  ""Damn, that boy needs a Doctor!""  That one got people laughing.  ""Yes, I need to renew my plates.""   ""Ok sir..."" she looked at me with a skeptical look, ""here's a pass to leave and come back, you won't even have to wait in line. Go out that door, use the bathroom NEXTDOOR, and come back after you've made sure that won't happen again.""  ""Yes maam,"" I'd just gotten a Federal pass because of my ass.   As I walked out I saw the little black kid's eyes roll into the back of his head. He fell over and the mother exploded in agony...   ""naw NAW NAAAAWWW!!! MUH BABY BOY!"" she turned to look at me, ""you did this, cracka!""   ""No maam, Thiamin did this. Thiamin."""
ROAO66H,male,25,"Recently I came up with a movie quote that has stumped a large number of us.  Between, Skiz, Ess Cha and myself alone, I expect almost every good movie/TV quote to fall into our field of knowledge.  The quote was simply ""I'm taking this"".  About a dozen people got roped into trying to figure out which comedy film it came from.  We all remembered the scene, but couldn't quite place where it had come from.  Upon searching the internet for such a basic series of words, we were bombarded with over a billion irrelevent worthless sites.  An IMDB search proved to offer every TV show and movie known to mankind that has these words EXCEPT for the one we sought.   (On a high note, I did learn that some very classy woman says ""I'm taking this in the a$$!!!"" in the ever popular film ""She Likes it on Her Face"". Obviously a classic) In the end....the search proved fruitless as weeks passed.  Enter Kenny Richards  In a random conversation yesterday I brought up the quote, not realizing that Kenny had been on travel for 2 weeks all throughout the search period.  He immediately piped up with...that's Jim Carrey in, i think ""The Mask"".  We brainstormed further and realized it was when he's paying for his car being impounded and he grabs an air freshner on the way out.  I then remembered that it is from ""Liar Liar"", and soon after all was right in the world.  So there it is Ess Cha, Skiz, and anyone else who gives a crap (probably no one). It's Jim Carrey inLiar Liar....  and I'm out like Skiz's love of men."
ROAO66H,male,25,"as i was parked on the new jersey turnpike this evening, i began to ponder something:  if i start plowing through cars to get to 7a, will i be charged with double/triple vehicular homicide, or would it be 2/3 counts of vehicular homicide?  truly a question for the ages.  then i began to ponder another question:  what is the worst stretch of road in the united states?  here are my candidates:  1)  NJ Turnpike between 6 and 7a Almost always bakked up, even at 1130PM thursday night when you're coming home from bowling.  Nearly every turnpike accident/disaster happens in this 10 mile stretch, and don't be surprised if it takes you close to 45 minutes to navigate it  2)  Las Vegas Strip Since Las Vegas is always awake, people are always driving somewhere.  Besides Fremont St., they're almost all on the strip heading towards a parking garage or evading police.  Between people trying to run across and gambling depressed motorists swerving in and out, this has to be one of the worst stretches.  nice lights though.  3)  Schulykill 'Expressway' All you need to do for this one is attempt to go anywhere when the phillies, eagles, sixers, or flyers are in town, and you'll see why.  I love the 50 MPH signs that just mock you as you stop and go for miles and miles.  Not so bad around 1AM though.  4)  George Washington Bridge I've been to Connecticut about 5 times.  I've never been over this bridge.  I have, however, seen the people waiting to go over the bridge.  I could not see the bridge at that time.  Nuff said.   Cast your vote, and submit your own."
ROAO66H,male,25,"a brief respite from the vegas report while i go bak to vegas.  that's right.  i'll be out there will lil skiz and the gang for a few.  in the interim ... here's what happened at burger king.  so it's lunch time at BK.  there are a lot of people.  i mean, a lot.  and when i arrive, most of them are waiting for food.  this is a bad sign.  that means that in addition to the time i'll have to wait to place my order, i'm going to have to wait that much longer for food.  it's my only choice at this point though, so i soldier on.  when i get my ticket, which is 78, i hear the guy call out order number 62.  at first i thought that this would just be a long wait, but no, now i know that this will be a very long wait.  like waiting for godot length.  actually, i have no idea how long they waited for godot.  my understanding was that he never showed.  as i'm sitting there, i'm wondering how all these people came to be at this particular burger king at this particular time.  i do this a lot.  but today is very interesting because there is a such a diverse group of people.  i'm fairly certain they are not from outer space.  i look at one of the older folks in the crowd.  he acknowledges me in that sort of, 'hey, i'm not from outer space, but i'm not sure about the rest of this crowd.  they might be.  me, i'm from arkansas, or arizona or some place like that.  i've been in jersey for about 10 years now.  it's okay.  it's not extraordinary or underordinary.  just kind of is.  in fact, i kind of wish one of these people was from outer space.  wouldn't mind hearing about it.  maybe it's the kind of place where a guy like me could retire to.  i could be done waiting in line for crappy ass burgers and sodas and start making progress in the great beyond up there.  always wanted to see neptune.  not them other ones.  just neptune.  it's the only one with any appeal to me.  it's far out there, but not too far.  not pluto far.  i think that would be too far.' suddenly i realize that this old man might be right.  i really am not certain about the rest of these people.  they may all be from outer space.  i figure the probability is high that someone is.  about 20 people here, i'm not and this other dude isn't, that leaves 18.  someone here is a superterrestrial and not fessing up.  when my order gets called, i walk up to the counter and meet the shifty eyes of the burger king lady.  she is not from outer space.  that is an earth look.  and i don't like it.  i'd much rather she be a bubbly extraterrestrial, than a grizzled earthling.  but this is the way of things."
ROAO66H,male,25,"First night of re-establishing the bankroll and playing some cards.  it's also probably the last game of poker before i throw in on some online poker. anybody remember seeing game 7 of the 1991 world series.  it was twins braves in the first of a long series of braves disappointments, save for 1995 which began the first in a series of indians disappointments.  anywise, morris was a god that evening.  morris threw 10 innings of shutout baseball.  as it is now, coaches pop a huge one when their starter goes 6 and a third and lets up 3 runs.  they had to create a stat called, 'quality starts' that says, 'if you pitch 6 innings (it may even be 5) you get a quality start.'  jack morris spits on that stat.  for jack morris, a quality start is 9 and 0 thirds with a victory.  he won more games in the 80s than any other pitcher, and he was on 3 world series winners. so there i am, like the 91 braves, like lonnie damn smith turning third and holding up thus costing them the game, and i'm trying to hit jack morris at the table tonight.  every hand was a take-a-seat morris fastball.  i kept looking at coach to see if there was going to be a bullpen move, but no.  the heat just kept coming. eventually i actually got a king.  it was kind of like lonnie smith actually.  i even raised right away with that king cause i was desperate.  bam, flop comes and i've got top pair. 'there goes lonnie smith streaking into third' bet, bet, bet. up comes fourth street.  disaster.  an 8 falls, matching up an 8 on the board.  alright, someone could be swinging the 3 8s now, and i look over and see jack morris staring me down.  suddenly the dirt around third starts to swallow me up.  timeout:  if lonnie smith makes that turn on third and comes home, i bet the braves would have won.  that game had so much tension that any little break would have totally broken the other team.  i wasn't even near minnesota at the time, and i was almost broken.  further extending that, let's say the braves win that game and the world series.  who knows how many times they would have won in the 90s.    meanwhile, jack morris has me way in the hole.  for some reason i'm still betting at this point, even though i'm fairly certain i'm going to get smashed by the three 8s.  at this point though, if i forfeit this action, i may be forfeiting the only thing i see all night.  knowing that lesser hands have won, i push some more chips in. fifth street comes, no help to anybody, bet, bet, call.  there comes the 8.  jack morris saunters off the field and gets ready to win another world title.  had we played every hand face up tonight, i would have lost every time.  at least when you can't catch anything, you can't play poorly.  so, from tonight i gathered that i didn't suck, but only because i didn't have the chance to suck.  ess cha was sitting right next to me, which sucked because i hate him.  he couldn't catch anything either, and we both went home $30 lighter.  i got no complaints though, since everything fell my way friday night and led to a $70 take.  Morris was not nearly as impressive in '92 when he was bak in the series with the toronto blue jays.  even the greats can be taken down.  just like poker.    just for a last thought, had to stop at hollywood video tonight to return something, and i was totally disgusted by what i saw.  there were two titles in the new release section:  Living the Life Livin' tha Life  in that very order, left to right.  what disgusted me is that clearly Livin' should precede Living.  are we counting ' as a letter now?  that word stops at 'n'.  i briefly contemplated telling the clerk, but then i found a video called Cheerleading Ninjas, and everything was made right.  a review of said film may follow.     BANKROLL:  $120"
ROAO66H,male,25,"i finally put 5 strikes in a row together tonight.  problem was, the game looked a little something like this:  80 63 7/ X X X X X 80 80  way to make a spare.  actually, in the second game, i let the f word go about as loudly as i've ever done it.  felt so good.  shot a 531, which in any other place would be a disaster, but on the fort, i'll take.  for now.   speaking of bowling, i've decided to bring the rest of the world into the fold as far as our bowling lingo goes.  i figure we've been bowling at lunch for about 6 or 7 months now, every monday and thursday.  after all this time, we've come up with a million terms to describe what happens out there, so for those who don't get to roll with us, here you go:  Stew'd:  this was probably the original.  Stew has a propensity for picking up the 7 pin and then the 10 pin, and only those two pins.  i saw stew do that twice in one game and i told him it was the most amazing thing i'd ever seen.  and just to give you some reference, i've seen the version of transformers where they say, 'shit.'  it's more amazing than that.  so a stew is when you throw two balls and get a 1 both times. Hews:  we have Shawn 'Hews' Mathews to thank for this one.  to spare hews the pain, i won't recount the lurid details of how he became known for throwing a double gutter.  unfortunately though, someone had to be saddled with that shot.  when you see a double gutter, just say you saw a hews. JAM'd:  leave the 7,9 or the 8,10?  not only did you just get boned, you also got JAM'd.  Jamie E. Johnson has been JAM'd his fair share, and one time it just became his shot.  kudos JAM, you're a split. Nebe'd:  Nebe loves throwing the ball right down the middle and leaving something in the middle.  it's one of the things that makes bowling wonderful.  and by wonderful i mean frustrating.  and by frustrating i mean i yelled the f word as loudly as i could because i freaking left a 7 pin when i really could have used a run of strikes to make my series better, but no, that just wasn't possible.   anywise, anytime you throw a ball and you leave pins in the middle, you got nebe'd.  that's just all there is to it. Jen'd:  no one gutters and then spares like jen.  it's the thing she does.  if only this trend could be reversed ... but no.  then we'd have no one to name the shot after. Conti'd:  the most recent development.  you conti when you choke down the stretch.  i'm not sure if conti or hews has the worse bowling debacle tied to his name, but it really doesn't matter. Skiz/Reverse Skiz:  7 pin/10pin.     on a side note, when you try to sell your house to someone with terrible credit who has no business buying a house, we call that Jik'd.  in fact, any sort of real estate scam is know as a jik, or just getting jik'd.  nuff said.  by the way, i'm down about $25 again."

ROAO66H,male,25,"dear philly,  i remember bak to 1987, but only because of pretzel day.  wednesday was pretzel day.  it was a wonderful thing.  after school, i would frolic in a pretzel playground to the tune of 10 cents a piece.  many pretzels were had.  many. perhaps someone should have taken some pretzels down to your ice mates, the flyers.  in 87 you'll remember, the flyers were busy losing the stanley cup.  again.  they had taken a one year break from presenting someone else the cup in 1986, after their true to form performance in 1985.  that was after getting the islanders going in 1980, and sparking the canadiens in 1976.  both of those teams went on to win 4 consecutive cups.  even though the oilers didn't win 4 cups in a row, they did beat your flyers twice, so that kind of atoned for it.  then in 1997, just to prove that they hadn't forgotten their hospitality, the flyers got the red wings off their 42 year stanley cup winning snide by giving them the cup in 4 games. knowing all of that, it's good to know that your boys didn't make it to the cup this year.  see, the flames haven't won the cup in 15 years, so it would have been about time for them to cash in their philly chips.  you should send along an apology to calgary.  you've really thwarted some of her chances.  i'm sure you know better than me that that's just the tip of the iceberg with your sports teams.  if it's not the eagles losing the NFC championship game 3 years in a row (not to mention having one of the most dismal teams in the history of the league (thank you cardinals!)), then it's the phillies winning one championship in 100 years.  i really don't understand.  first of all, if you ever see boston, please kick him in the balls.  all i ever hear is griping: 'we can't win a world series.  we have our heads shoved way up our asses.  we're stupid and deserve a title.'  eat shit boston.  you've only won about 48 basketball titles, and your football squadron has somehow squeaked out 2 of the last 3 super bowls (did i mention the eagles didn't make it to those super bowls because they were busy losing championship games?).  sorry phil, i'm really not even a flyers fan anymore.  i just think it's kind of sad at this point.  and as the days get longer, my eyes do their normal turn from an ice-bound loss to a hopeful field of fortune.  this is the time of year where the jerseys come off, and the Phillies caps are dragged bak out, hoping that this year will be different.  anyway phil, not really sure where i'm headed with this.  just wanted to know what makes you so different.  why is it that miami can have a baseball team for 10 years and win the series one more time than we have since 1880whatever?  why do we spend all our time hosting other dynasties?  how come a team from carolina can roll in to your humble dwellings and rock a team that just completed a 4th and 26?  why didn't we hit the homerun in game 6 in 93 to send it to a seventh game?  why wasn't anyone shocked when any of that happened?  so if you could get bak to me, that would be great.  love, ziks  ps, also, could you send a detailed guide of what to do in the case that the phillies win the series this year.  it's been about 20 years, and we really don't know how to react to winning.  thanks  z"
ROAO66H,male,25,"Once upon a time, a young man went to the circus. He was very excited, as he lived in western Manitoba and had never seen a circus before; the kind of town where you shave and the trolley stops. Anyway, as circus days drew nigh, the young man grew ever more excited. He arrived before dawn to get the best seat in the house and sat down hours before the first trapeze act.   Finally, the trapeze artists gave an awe-inspiring performance, the elephants danced and the lion tamer tamed. At last, the clowns came out in full regalia and green hair. They rode around by the gross in a purple Volkswagen. The Volksie pulled up to center of the ring and an overweight clown with orange hair, acne and a purple nose advanced to the podium: ""Will the person in section A, row Y, seat 42 please stand up?""   The young man looked at his ticket, and to his surprise, he was sitting in that very seat. The young man stood up. The clown then says, ""Well-l-l-l-l-l, there's the horse's ass, now where's the rest of the horse?""   The entire crowd burst out into laughter. The young man, dumbfounded, stood for a moment, then made his way quickly through crowd and out of the tent. Returning home, he wept for days, and mourned the loss of dignity and honor.   Eventually reason overcame his grief and the young man grew determined. ""I'm not going to get mad, I'm going to get even and avenge the honor of myself, my family, and this town,"" he exclaimed. He picked up the curriculum guide for the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) correspondence courses and started to read. Eventually  his eyes came to rest on an ad for a class in ""Quick Wit Retort.""   ""Learn how to use those snappy comebacks to your advantage, now!""   So the young man sent in his $19.95 and soon received the course materials. In a few weeks, the young man mastered the materials and sent the final back to UNLV. Much to his surprise, a registered letter arrived from the president of UNLV. It read: ""Dear Sir: We are utterly flabbergasted at your performance in Quick Wit Retort 101. We would be most gratified if you could come to UNLV to complete your degree with our fine academic institution. Here's a check to cover your expenses.""   To make a long story short, the young man made straight A's in the QWR program. He was awarded numerous distinctions and when he graduated, the graduation speaker, General Colin Powell (U.S. Army, Ret.), awarded the man the Presidential Medal of Outstanding Quick Wit Retort, signed by George W Bush himself! Some days afterward, Harvard University sent a Lear jet to pick the man up for an interview.   The graduate admissions officer didn't mince words. ""If you complete our masters/doctoral tenured track program in QWR, you will never have to worry about money again,"" said he. Needless to say, the young man promptly moved to Cambridge. In five years, the man had finished his doctorate. By this time, the young man was known throughout the world as the leading expert in Quick Wit Retort. Word had even reached western Manitoba, which, of course, made his mother very proud. Everyone from Pentagon pundits to Beltway bandits consulted the man on technical questions of QWR.   One day, while sitting at his desk reading his hometown newspaper, the young man noticed that the circus was coming to his hometown again. An evil smile crossed the young man's face. ""Hobbs,"" cried the man to his assistant, ""We must be away to Manitoba. Ready the jet!"" As the plane crossed the purple mountains majesty and the fruited plains, the young man savored the moment of victory that was to be his. He arrived at the circus tent very early, making sure to get that very special seat: Section A, Row Y, seat 42.   Finally, the circus began. The trapeze artists gave an awe- inspiring performance, the elephants danced, and the lion tamer tamed. At last, the clowns came out in full regalia and green hair. They rode around by the gross in a purple Volkswagen. The Volksie pulled up to center of the ring and an overweight clown with orange hair, acne, and a purple nose advanced to the podium: ""Will the person in section A, row Y, seat 42 please stand up?""   The young man glanced at his ticket. This time he was ready. The clown looks up at him and says, ""Well-l-l-l-l, there's the horse's ass, now where's the rest of the horse?""   The young man rose to his feet, full of confidence. He knew from his years of training that there was only one thing he could do. He thrust out his chest and said in the loudest voice you can imagine: ""FUCK YOU, CLOWN!!!!"""
ROAO66H,male,25,"An interesting series of events occurred today, SYS 201a is done (thank god because that sucked) and for the 4th time in 5 days I went to afternoon services (yeah I am pretty religious).  SYS is finally over and there is one great thing about SYS I'd like to say....but I'm not going to lie to you.  Bowling: I may finally be on the road to recovery.  Maybe some background would help here.  Prior to leaving for Ft. Huachuca the lanes and I had an ok relationship, but a little spat broke out and we left things unsettled.  While I was away I tried to call, but just couldn't find the words or the number for that matter, so I have been attending her services basically daily trying to repair the burnt bridges.  Today I didn't bowl a game under 130 (the last few weeks I couldn't say I didn't bowl a game under 105!), and topped out at a 173.  More importantly though I have fallen back into her good graces...  Ask CON and JRO about the mayhem later, it will probably be better than I can type it here."
ROAO66H,male,25,"my pants are vibrating.  something is happening.  perhaps an illness.  no, it is moles.  he is utilizing his cellular telephone device.  he is in las vegas.  i'll answer him. 'hello' seemed like the right thing to say.  sometime later after being battered with hacking knowledge (my legitimate purpose in las vegas) i return home and find my associate.  we shake hands.  it's what people do.  it's how you spread disease. seemed like the right thing to do.  armed with some winnings, one moles, and one smo, we venture into the world for some dinner.  it is about that time.  although in certain parts of the world it is breakfast time.  some people are asleep.  they would not be interested in dinner.  we were. seemed like the right time to eat.  la salsa cantina beckons us.  they offer very large glasses of alcohol.  they only asked for $17.50 in return.  we pass.  smaller quantities are purchased.  pidel brings us food.  his name is not fidel.  that is important.  his parents have decided. seemed like the right name to give.  we are coming bak, but not unscathed.  moles has purchased a fifth of whiskey.  a fifth is one fifth of one gallon.  we do not purchase a gallon.  that is a good idea.  some whiskey is consumed.  smo should give himself a fu manchu.  his face demands it.  to a lesser extent, we demand it.  it is now a good time to gamble.  we play blackjack.  moles is winning.  moles has won bak the money he spent on the fifth, which is not a gallon but still a lot.  there is some left.  we celebrate moles' victory by drinking the rest of it.  mostly. seemed like the right time to drink.  my left foot and right foot are no longer speaking.  they are having a tough time deciding who should go first.  on occasion, they both take off, and there is a forward sensation followed by a reverse correction.  we slow down.  now they wait to hear, 'mother may i?'  it is a game they play.  i have to sit down.  i sit down at a blackjack table.  a young lady deals me some cards.  i win.  she high fives me.  this continues to happen.  i have won approximately $150 at this point.  we retire to bed. seemed like the right time for bed."
ROAO66H,male,25,"Yes, you do.  No one has a profile, but me, Stew, and Skiz. You could have a full profile in as much time as you all take throughout the day to check the blog for new posts. Please see our profiles for inspiration, not plagiarism."
ROAO66H,male,25,"That past few days have been trying ones.  Bowling has gone from bad to horrible and work has decided to basically stop.  Now you'd think the work issue would be a plus but do you have any idea the sort of things you do when you have 9 hours of time on your hands?  I do.  Your day consists of WPC challenges, discussions on the shape of Shaq's bed (thank for that one Smo), a quick visit to the LPA website, an enlightening conversation about peanut stuffed pigs in comparison to peanut flavored peanut stuffed pigs (if you don't know, trust me you don't want to know), how Big 6 could possibly pitch 4783 innings on his way to 373 wins with 2502 strikeouts all in a lifetime shorter than Roger Clemens' tenure with Boston (what is he like 80 now?), and a good amount of this...blogging.  (for anyone interested the WPC puzzles were/are hard as hell, Shaq's bed is circular, yes the dude on the LPA site looks like Mo, peanut stuffed pigs aren't better than peanut flavored peanut stuffed pigs, and sorry but Roger Clemens hasn't died yet).  But the days go on...  On other fronts, www.bornatthezoo.com is active again, and by active I mean someone made a post recently, and by someone I mean me (nothing exciting, maybe soon though).  We are also now out of attorney review and are having the house inspected next Friday (JiK we finally got the disclosure form, the house isn't condemned)."
ROAO66H,male,25,"i may have had a breakthrough tonight  i sat down to play some .50/1.00 hold 'em tonight.  for the last several weeks, i've stuck to a very strict game plan:  only play the top few hands.  let's examine that.  in texas hold 'em, you are dealt 2 cards.  i play the following hands: AA,KK,QQ,AK,JJ,10s,9s,8s,7s,6s,5s,4s,3s,2s. that's 14 hands which can be generated 94 ways (13 pairs which occur 6 ways, and AK which occurs 16 ways) in a 52 card deck, given two cards, there are 1326 possibilities (52 C 2) that means i play about 7% of the time. 'Isn't that boring?' well, to me, no.  cause when you catch one of those hands, you're fairly confident that someone is going to get smashed, and that you're going to do the smashing.  also, i enjoy the following activities:  1) computer progamming 2) math 3) making my own t-shirts  so playing 7 of 100 hands really doesn't faze me.  anyway, tonight, something happened.  i played computer-like for a bit.  but then i analyzed the table and discovered something:  these people were playing tight, just like myself.  so i changed up and started playing aggressively.  i made moves and stole pots with nothing.  i was in when i should have been, and out when i should have been.   i stole blinds, i pushed people around, and more importantly, i won.  a lot.  i was up 20 big bets in about 20 minutes.  it was the first time i really read a situation and responded.  i left that table because i pushed the last guy all in and won.  there was no one left when i left.  it was radical.  i think i may be on to something here ...  current stats:  $180 after a $100 buy-in and a $25 gift"
ROAO66H,male,25,"So today was the first day of class... Let's first give some background info on this class.  It's taught by a guy who works in another building and teaches for Stevens from time to time (usually at AT&T/Lucent before they went bust).  I dont consider him a professor.  His name is Bud.  The class is called Linear Systems Theory.  Yeah, I have no clue either.  Let me also start out by saying that class is from 1:30pm til 6:30pm (not 7pm as thought previously).  Yes, five hours of funtime.  Let's run thru the first day's lecture(s).  Each class consists of two lectures.  Today, the first lecture had a packet of handouts that was 12 pages + an Appendix.  The second lecture had 11 pages with 3 Appendices. 1:30pm - We wait for Bud to finally finish fiddling with the projector and the screen.  He took about 10 minutes and kept asking us if we could see the text.  Finally, after the 3rd or 4th time asking us, we all answered that we had printed out the notes and he didnt need to even have a projector running.  Moving on....finally.  1:40ish - Lecture 1 starts...  3:00pm - We're only on page 4 and it's been an hour and a half.  Let's do some quick math, we have 5 hours of class and only 20 pages to get thru.   That'd be what, 4 pages an hour, right?  Ok, so were not too far behind...for now.  3:30pm - We finally made it thru the 5th page...that's not a typo...5 pages in 2 hours.  So now we're almost halfway thru the class.  For a few minutes, Nebe and I figured he'd go into ""Turbo mode"" like our last professor did and skim thru the rest of the 7 pages in 20minutes.  Nope.  It was break time.  Normally, you'd think in a class this long that you'd get about 15 minutes of break, right?  Does this sound like a normal class to you?  We got offered 30minutes, to which I asked if it could be 20 instead.  20 it was...or so I thought.  4:10pm - After Bud plays 20 questions with the class on various topics including: where some of us went to school, what classes we've taken, how many we have left to take, why the sky is blue, etcetera, etcetera we  finally  start Lecture 2.  It was during this extra break time that I did get to throw in some key Lehigh sucks jokes cuz two other guys in the class besides Nebe went to Lehigh and complained about some undergrad prof they had that supposedly sucked at teaching them Z-transforms (Skiz - Z-transforms are just like Java, except it's spelled Jaza).  5:00pm - After 45 minutes of going through way too many examples on the same subject, we move halfway thru the page of deuces.  5:20pm - Page 3 got ""Late 360 Shove-it to Boneless'D""  5:40pm - After realizing that he's not as prepared as he thought, Bud decides to stop the lecture early because he doesn't quite understand the mess on the next few pages.  Maybe he didnt think we'd get that far?  I dunno. IT'S OVER!  OK....so that's day 1.  We also found out that there are 6 classes and then an inclass final.  Woot.  On to post-class foolishness... So after class, I had some time to waste before I met Jackie at the train station (she was coming down to go out to dinner).  I decided to go to the gym to see if people were playin ball and to use some facilities.  I parked along the street right out front of the gym where there's a line of parallel cars and the reserved spot for the Commanding General.   I was in the last spot closest to the handicapped spots.  When I was walking out, there was a black toyota highlander truck with two women in it trying to parallel park in a spot two up from mine.  It was quite a sight.  Basically, they were almost perpendicular with the spot.  How they got that way, I have no idea.  It didn't make any sense.  They kept backing up, missing the spot, pulling forward, turning a  tiny tiny  bit and then backing up again.  Repeat.  Yes, I almost stood and watched because they missed the spot 3 times by the time I walked past.  I got in my car and noticed them turning around.  They must have seen me because they immediately cut across traffic and instead of pulling into the handicap spot to wait, they just sat immediately behind me but again, perpendicular to me.  I only had about 2 feet to move out, I did quickly for fears of J-RO flashed before my eyes.  Sorry Jen, but they were so unpredictable, I didn't want them to hit me.  By the way, did I mention that they cut across traffic and almost caused an accident?  Yeah, I heard a horn while I was pulling out.  Nice move, jackass.  So I left and they backed up across traffic again to finally pull into the end spot.  Ridiculous.  What a day...can't wait til next class."
ROAO66H,male,25,"There's a new King in town.  Yep, I led off with 5 strikes in a row enroute to a 202 finish.  Ziks put up a decent 166 but couldn't handle my Jersey style.  Yeah, so 4 of the 5 strikes were Jerseys.  For those reading who don't know what a  Jersey Strike  is, it's when the ball crosses over the head pin and hits in the opposite pocket.  Some people also call them  Brooklyn Strikes .  We don't exactly like when that happens, but it counts.  Anyway, I SMOthered Skiz and now we will have to rename that term to the EssCha (or a variation - open to ideas).  i.e I just EssCha'd Skiz...or I just Schwartz'd Skiz...or I just EssChopped Skiz... SMOthering just sounds so good, so we may want to discuss just leaving that term alone.  It's hard enough to get one term to stick so trying to change words around might not work too well.  In related news, Smo moves to the Queen spot with 3 wins and a tie, while JAM slips down to the Jack.  In other related news, Skiz may be bowling 20 games a week this summer...whoa"
ROAO66H,male,25,"Watching the NY Boston game tonight I was sure the Yankees would hold the lead when it was 3-0, but when they didn't I was fine.  After all 3-3 with your closer coming in you should feel pretty good.  After NY proceeded to load the bases 3 times (I think anyway) and not score, Boston ground into the first triple play I have seen this year (sure they got Manny out twice but who is counting?), and Manny who has made Tanyon Sturtz his woman his entire career (I mean really who hits 13 for 35 with 7 homeruns and a double?  Who does that?) Tanyon does what....that's right gives up a home run.  With all but the smallest glimmer of hope gone I sat and watched the final half inning.  As Posada came up to the plate I prayed for a base hit or a walk, which I don't think is too much to ask for, instead a strike out.  Up came Clark, again just a simple base hit was all I asked for, instead a ground out to the pitcher (can you say swinging bunt).  Then up comes Big Rube, and I say Big Rube even though with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 9th when alls we needed was a fly ball Sierra struck out on a fastball that had a better chance of hitting the backstop then his bat, but still up he came.  With the strangest swing in baseball history Rube powers a ground ball through the infield for a single.  Now Cairo, with a guy on first, 2 outs and an 2 strike count, hits yet another extra base hit to chase Big Rube all the way home.  I mean Jesus another extra inning?  We already have Shef playing 3rd base what next?  Instead John Flaherty steps to the plate and shows the kiddies how to do it up.  With a single swing of the bat he deposits the ball in the left field corner to score the winning run, ball game over.    There was an interesting development during this game involving Nomar.  I like Nomar which most of you should find strange since I hate Boston.  But Nomar is a classy guy, good hitter, usually solid defender, all around top shelf player.  But where was he when the rest of the team was battling?  On the bench.  Now this may not seem surprising, and you'll probably say he just had the day off, true.  However, how can you stay on the bench when your entire team is hugging the rail, watching the game as if it were October?  Nomar stayed planted on the bench.  This was probably emphasized by the fact that Jeter dove head first into the first row of seats to save a pop ball that would have scored the go ahead run, but instead extended the tie and allowed Jeter to float off the field elated even after his face plant.  Looks like it might be the end of an era in Boston, how soon until Nomar hits the trade block?  Deal with my ramblings and spelling mistakes it's late, and I just saw possibly the best game I have ever seen.  Go Yanks!"

ROAO66H,male,25,"i need to clear something up.  bagelhands are very different from bagelhammers.  lemme explain.  when hews and i stroll upstairs for a morning bagel, there is a moment of sheer terror that whisks by our earthly selves:  will there be bagels at the bagel station?  for if there are not bagels, we'll simply be jimmy and joey emptyhands, and we'll have to return to our seats without bagels.  this is a terrible start to a day.  usually it takes at least until lunch time for disappointment to set in. our saving grace is to see someone cavorting about the hallways bagelhanded.  that person has a bagel.  and unless it has been brought in from the outside or somehow cultivated within the confines of our engineering building, which i doubt could support hydroponics but could possibly be irrigated, then indeed there are bagels at the bagel station. but i got to thinking ... what if someone who has become bagelhanded forfeits their opportunity for morning hunger slaking and instead continues to be bagelhanded.  maybe they stay bagelhanded throughout the remainder of the day.  maybe two days.  at some point those bagels become stale, and stale leads to hard.  bingo.  that's when you've become bagelhammered. at that point, you're basically a superhero.  you have bagelhammers for hands.  if you're standing in line at your bank, and someone attempts to dynamite your safe deposit box and steal that picture of your cat Horace from when you were five, just start swinging.  bagelhammers will separate foe from consciousness instantly.  most deliciously too.  and since he'll be expecting the lovingly soft embrace of a standard bagel, it'll be that much more shocking when he realizes that he's been clonked with a bagelhammer, a tool that doctor claw would most definitely administer to his MAD agents were he to have enough time and bagels.  so it is of dire consequence that you take great caution when toting bagelhammers about.  keep your hands close, and your bagelhammers closer."
ROAO66H,male,25,"wow.  i don't know if anyone noticed, but looks like i got served real hard.  in the comments section of the post, 'on the matter of a recent recentry,' i found a new post by Anonymous.  in it i got served like red leader at the death star.  anonymous, while i appreciate your entry to the blog and invite you to post whenever you please, i'd just ask that you not just recklessly slander me.  you say that you are familiar with the entire situation, and maybe you are, but i find that hard to believe.  had you been, you would have known that when i got the call, i was not by my phone: i was bowling. bowling is like my church, and since jesus never calls me anymore, we all know that you shouldn't bring your phone into church.  by the time i got home from bowling, it was late, and i didn't want to wake any one with a phone call that would require some attention.  that was wednesday. thursday i also attend church, but after giving to the collection plate i left a text message asking if our heroine would be available that evening to talk.  again, it was around 1115, and i didn't want to wake any normal folks who don't consider 3AM a bedtime.  we have since talked and arranged a meeting, so i think that issue is moot.  i was not screening her call.  why would i be doing that?  i asked her to call, and then she did.  i'm also afraid i don't know what you mean by this: 'this means one thing; your disgusting acts of cowardiceness are surfacing themselves, and some of us are beginning to see through...' i have not had some ongoing campaign of torturing this girl. i have not been going behind her bak to find out what she does or where she hangs out. i have not ranted and raved about her for the last year and a half to everyone i could find. (i am in no way saying that our heroine did any of these things.  as far as i know, she hasn't.  that's definitely not her style).  in fact, the only thing i have done is post this blog, which i thought took some guts, but maybe i was wrong.  i took the first step.  that's all.  my other complaint with you, anonymous, is that you call me cowardly, and yet you don't leave your name.  something about that seems inconsistent.  posting your name will not jeopardize your safety.  i will not tell your mom.  i will not tell my mom.  i will not tell my mom to tell your mom.  no moms will be involved.  we are all grown ass folks.  i am glad that you posted and took the side of our heroine.  however, by not leaving your name and presenting inaccuracies, you're not exactly lining our heroine up for the purple heart.  i believe our heroine to be a nice person, and i don't think your post does her justice.  you make it seem as though you are a minion sent to besmirch me in front of my friends.  again, not her style, but how is anyone going to know that?    thanks though, for livening up the blog.  -ziks"

ROAO66H,male,25,"so brendan asked that i post about the no limit tournament i wrote about in my away message, so post i shall.  i had actually been having a bad run at the sit and go tournaments on partypoker.  i knew it was going to be rough though, since i had so little experience, so i wasn't afraid to sink most of my winnings into tourney practice.  i placed 4th and 5th and 6th countless times (actually, no more than 12 i guess, but still, that's a lot of 10 dollars).  unfortunately, 4th place isn't good enough to cash.  so i had to bak off and play a little bit in the $5 entry fee tournaments.  the last few days have brought much more consistent cashing, albeit with lesser returns.  but that's okay; a return's a return.  monday night i got into a head's up final at the $5 tournament and just got run over.  i had no idea what i was doing.  seriously, playing heads up is hard for me since i'm kind of tight.  i'm looking at hands, and i'm not even considering the fact that the other guy might have even worse cards.  so i get crushed, but afterwards i chat with the dude for about 10 minutes on how to play heads up a little better.  this is good; one of my better poker qualities is that i have no problem telling someone i'm not good at it and would like help. so i enter another tournament, this time around 215 (which is when you start to wonder if you're addicted).  f it, you only live once.  i've watched a few guys bust out, i'm down a little, and then some douche starts taking forever to make a move.  turns out that douche is actually me, and i've lost my connection.  i scramble.  i'm on a wireless connection, so i grab a wire and jam it in.  no dice.  looks like comcast has bounced on me.  i have no idea what the tournament policy is on disconnects, so i'm thinking that $5 is gone.  more scrambling.  comcast comes bak.  i've missed about 4 hands, but the game had me on auto post and auto fold.  i have no idea what i mucked, but it doesn't matter.  i'm bak.  i keep playing, catch a couple cards, and eventually i'm heads up with a guy.  i proceeded to run him over, just as the last guy had done to me.  he's folding against my crap, and i'm loving it.  it took a minute for it to sink in when he moved all in and i won, but it was great.  granted, i only won $19 all told, but i feel like i've done something.  finally."
ROAO66H,male,25,"Have you ever listened to a song, and I mean really listened, not just hum the tune, but really hear the words?  Well most of the times I don't, but when older songs come on (by older I mean songs from the 60s-70s) I try.  On my way into work today I got a chance to really listen, as I had many times before, to a song mainly about nothing, but a certain piece I had heard a thousand times before grabbed my attention.  ""Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio, our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you..""  Now I am well aware that this line will ultimately be interpreted as meaning 500 different things, but it got me thinking about the present day New York Yankees.  In advance let me just say that I love the NY Yankees, but it seems to me that with the way the team is ""bought"" these days instead of ""grown"" really makes it hard to care about anything but your team winning.  In the early/mid 90s things were different, we had Donnie Baseball, upcoming stars like Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte and a bullpen that got the job done (although not always before giving up a few runs and brining the winning run to the plate).  None of them were superstars yet (and by yet I mean before the season started), in fact the 1996 team that won the world series was really a rag tag bunch of guys that happened to be in the right place at the right time.  Now I am sure I will be attacked by those who say Wade Boggs, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez, Mariano Duncan (yeah who?), etc are not rag tag players, and you'd be right, but my point is these guys were not superstars, and there were holes in their team.  I mean seriously who played left field for the Yankees that year?  It definitely wasn't the best player in Japan.  Who was their DH?  Does DS ring a bell?  Before the year started who knew what Derek Jeter was going to do?  Would Cone stay healthy?  Would Wade Boggs break a hip?  Who the hell was Scott Kamieniecki?  All unknowns...  They had one great starter in Pettitte, a bunch of Veterans that won more than they lost (but in most cases not much) and a bullpen filled with blue collar guys who could shut down the other team.  When they won the World Series it was a David vs Goliath type victory, especially being down 2-0 and losing game 3 by 6 runs in the 6th.  There was an unbelievable sense of accomplishment around that team.  They had done the impossible.    More recent Yankee teams are bought to win.  The team is filled with superstars, all within the top 10 at their position (except 2nd base this year).  We buy guys like Shef, Hideki, Giambi, Kevin Brown, Mike Mussina, Javier Lopez, Tom Gordon, and A-Rod.  We build teams filled with other teams' superstars.  This is most likely the reason why when someone is struggling it is so easy to say trade him, or to look around the league and think of all the players we could have playing there instead, especially since we know that someone in Yankee-land is thinking it too.  It is unfortunate, that there is no surprise to Yankee fans when their team wins another series, it is simply business as usual.  The ticker tape parade no longer seems anything extraodinary to anyone except the guy forced to clean it up every October."
ROAO66H,male,25,"just a short, smo-friendly post for now.  bmack, glad to see you still trying to root for the flyers.  i gave up with bobby clarke.  he is way too much man for me.  okay, when did the f*cking skychefs on f*cking airplanes decide that every f*cking person in america loves lettuce.  they gave me a 'thai chicken wrap' in which i found, lettuce, peppers, something that looked like a liver spot, a small thai man, and noodles.  seriously skychefs, did you take a poll and ask everyone if they liked food packed full of crap?  did i miss the poll?

ROAO66H,male,25,"Random Rant:   Can anyone tell me why so many people feel the need to protect me from myself?  I mean seriously, I don't know how many more articles  I can read about some crazed mother trying to take away my Jackie Chan Adventures because her kid tried to do a backflip out the 3rd story window of some apartment building.  What ever happened to parental responsibility instead of blaming the tube?    In other news, PHP 5.0 was released this week with some pretty big improvements over the last release (specifically changes to how objects and XML are handled) and only one small step backwards (it doesn't install).  Now I am sure the later is my fault, but when you follow the directions you expect things to work, guess I'll have to try again tonight.    Perhaps the most laughable thing happened in room 190 today when from a dead silence a loud distinct snore was heard from the back of the room.  Now knowing that it could easily have been any of the inhabitants in room 190 (except myself of course) I waited for some extra noise to pin point exactly who the guilty party was.  A few seconds later it came in an ""Ooops"" from T.J. and that familiar laugh of Jim's.  I would just like to say thank you T.J. you have just made my day, that is of course until I see Jeopardy's Ken Jennings get destroyed.  I hope it's not wrong to hate that guy..."
ROAO66H,male,25,"hews wanted a poker recap, so here's some recent happenings.  i decided to play some no-limit tournaments to get some no-limit experience.  i'm definitely not as good at it as limit (in which i'm no expert either), but it's a lot of fun.  you get a real surge going all in, which you certainly don't get when you call the big blind in a .5/1.00 hand.  format of the tournament is such: 1)  buy-in for $10 + $1 entry fee. b)  every one gets 800 chips iii)  1st - $50, 2nd - $30, 3rd - $20  as can be seen, 4th is just as good as 10th, which is just as good as a girl in a bug touching contest.  i think i entered about 5 tournaments before finally cashing in the 6th.  i felt like i was improving though, since i gradually moved up from 6th place finishes to 4th.  considering this is my first no-limit experience, i'll take it.  all these tournamenting though has put me down a bit, so now i'm hovering around $95 in my account.  i'm just waiting for hews to sign up for party poker and give me 50 extra bones.  that's tournament money right there.  so with one 3rd place in the bank now, i'm going bak.  all in"
ROAO66H,male,25,"so i've been thinking about poker (surprise).  here's a pair of stories for you:  5 of us left in a 10 person sit n go tournament.  top 3 cash.  i'm hanging in there.  i have 500 chips left, which is 4th place.  i'd much rather have 2000 chips.  so it is.  suddenly, i'm given the opportunity to get some chips.  i get KK.  the dude in front of me raises.  i move my mouse over to the button that says, 'All-in' and hit it.  i'm all in.  there's nothing like being all in.  it is either all done, or all coming your way at the end of this.  there is no in between.  unless you chop.  but who does that.  dude to my left goes all-in.  betting comes bak around ot the guy behind me.  he sits.  we sit.  he thinks.  we wait.  he types in 'AJ'.  AJ against my KK ... he's a 2 to 1 dog.  he has 3 outs.  i have no idea what lefty has, but 2 times out of 3, i beat righty.  he calls.  cards start coming out.  Ace comes on the flop.  i lose.  so it is.  some joker says, 'good call.'  i close my window to prevent damage to my work laptop.   hand 2:  four cards are out: 3,2,5,4.  two spades two clubs.  i'm holding 3,4.  this is bad.  it's just me and one other guy, and there are only 4 people left in the tournament.  he bets 800, which happens to represent my entire stack.  i think.  he waits.  i have 2 pair.  i think he has that ace.  i know he has that ace.  but he could be trying to muscle.  no, he has the ace.  i see my cursor moving towards the 'call' button.  something clicks it.  he turns over an ace.  a 3 comes on 5th street.  i rejoice.  i end up 2nd.  so it is.     here's what i was thinking.  did that joker who called my kings make a good call?  did i make a good call?  obviously, the first answer is no.  we were both way behind without many options.    but then we won.   so what does that mean?   what i love about hold 'em is that the results of the entire game are established immediately.  the cards have already determined the winner before anyone bets.  each player then takes a turn screwing up what the cards have decided.  countless times the winner is laid down before the flop even because it looks like crap initially.  you put down your 9 deuce off suit because it looks like crap, but then 2 2s and a 9 flop.  you smack yourself, and the dude next to you buys the pot before you see a 4th card.   supposedly, if you make the 'correct' decision, i.e. the decision the odds favor, consistently over a long period of time, you will end up ahead.  so if that guy calls my AJ 3 times, he loses twice.  but he won't call it 3 times against KK.  he may never do it again.  he did it once and won.   in how many other games will you hear this: 'just because you didn't win when you could have doesn't mean you did the wrong thing.'  what?  there is no other game like that.  in baseball, if you have a man on third with 1 out, and you decide to swing for the fences but strike out instead, no one will tell you you did the right thing even though you didn't win.  it is in our nature to associate the right thing with victory and the wrong thing with defeat.  poker is so counterintuitive.  nothing about it makes sense.  as i said before, the winner is predetermined.  as far as results go, there is nothing you can do to change the fact that you either have the best hand or you don't.  somewhere though, everything goes wrong, and some people become better at telling the cards that they are the winner.  and that is really something.   i love this game.  see you in a week.  i'm off to vegas."

It lasted about 10 minutes, but, man oh man, was it intense! Let me set the scene: I'm here at work, second to last day. I've got a wicked case of senioritis (if that's possible to have at a job). Rather than continuing the one or two projects I need to finish by 5pm tomorrow, I logged on to PokerStars as I (yes, ziks) ate my toasted poppy seed bagel with regular cream cheese. I haven't yet grown the cojones to play for actual money (plus I wouldn't do that at work, what with the interruptions and all), so I'm with the nobodies at the ""Play Money"" tables.

ROAO66H,male,25,"i can't even tell you how many times i was told not to smoke during my school career.  be it the 5th grade DARE program or my 10th grade health class, someone was always in my ear about putting out the cancer sticks. 'you'll get lung cancer.' 'i KNOW some one with emphysema, and it is a terrible disease.' and yeah, it is.  i can't refute them.  i'm the first one to say that i think it's a disgusting, smelly habit.  every time i see this girl at work light up, i give her a hard time and go through the litany of charges against smoking that i've been told 1,000 times before.  today i saw something worse than smoking though.  i saw decent, average looking, human beings at a meeting.  what was supposed to be an informational session used to get people up to speed on a project turned into a horrifying, 6 hour long confirmation of my most Office Spaceian fears:  these people exist.  when i left school, i knew things were going to be different.  our entire life we have goals and motivating factors pushing us forward.  whether it's trying to figure out how not to crap in your pants or graduating high school (or crapping in your pants while graduating high school), we're all moving towards something.  and then it stops, pretty much without warning.  it is a very cruel sort of thing.  we were told that we would need jobs, and maybe we have them and maybe we don't, but the last part was kind of glazed over.  no one mentioned what happened after work.  i have personally met old people, and not even they could offer me insight.  they say it just sort of happened.  one day they were teaching or making paper towel dispensers, and the next day some schmuck 30 years younger than them was saying, 'i'm sorry, we're moving in a new direction.'  so what happened in between?  i saw it today.  it was horrible.  these people were sitting around a table talking about this project and how it was looking for the next 5-6 years.  they were just throwing these numbers out. 'we're looking a little tight for next year, but in 2 years we should probably get some money.' what?!  what about those two years?  where are they going?  they spoke as if they'd rather just wake up in 2 years having skipped the intervening time so that they could fill out their reports and be happy people. what scared me the most was that i was the only one terrified by this.  to everyone else, it was just another item on the agenda.  a goddamn action item as they'd call it.  no where on the agenda did it say, 'this is the part where we lose track of the fact that we're alive.  from here on, we're just working automatons.'  i even looked on the bak and at the bottom.  nothing.  i don't smoke; i work.  i work 40 hour weeks.  i forfeit 24% of each week to work.  if i kept that up, and worked from 20 until 60, i would have lost 10 years of my life.  and not only will i lose those 10 years, i won't remember what happened during the other 30.  wow.  if i stopped working and started smoking, i think i could cut that down to about 7.  now i know why people smoke:  they're just training for life after work.   sorry for the down note.  on the plus side, i'm up about $5 today.  i feel like i'm starting to play with a little more of a clue.  good job me.  alright, i'm out like the trash on tuesday"
ROAO66H,male,25,"First off I have to say good job Ess Cha, may your reign be long and fruitful, and by that I mean ends today.  Now that is out of the way on to more important issues.    While sitting in my cube (which is not a cube at all), a question came to mind (actually it was forced into my mind), Is no response better than a forced response?  Obviously the members of this blog think the forced response is better (see  urlLink this ).  I don't understand this logic, now instead of having no profiles we have contrived profiles.  Now before Ess Cha goes on his rant and fills in the quote we all know is coming (""Do you want cheese with that whine?""), I have one thing to say, Shut it, just shut it.  How can someone complain about my complaint, when I am only responding to his complaint (got all that?)?    Ok, enough bitching and back to random thoughts.    Possibly the most interesting tid bits of information you'll ever pick up are from hall way conversations.  Now don't get me wrong, I am not trying to listen, in fact I try not to listen (although there seems to be an inverse relationship between these) but when someone says ""FIGMO"" you can't help but wonder, what the hell is ""FIGMO"", well now I know.  Now you can't help but listen, you're engrossed in the conversation to the point where you almost blurt out ""Yeah, the Mets do suck this year!""  But somehow you restrain yourself.

ROAO66H,male,25,"So, I was trying to log in here to post but it's been so long that I couldn't remember my username/password combo. So I went through my standard three or four usernames, turns out I created a blog back in 2002.  Who knew?    After playing poker for 5 hours last night, and as I sit here watching the first night of WSOP coverage, I just wanted to say... well, ask... is there anything like stacking your chips after winning a big pot?  I love that feeling."
ROAO66H,male,25,"They say that in order to get better at anything in life....you have to jump right in and do it....  Now I love playing poker....it's not about money or even the satisfaction of winning.  Those are the bonuses but I love the game.   I've been playing tons of online poker, reading a few books and articles on poker strategy, and holding weekly friendly games at my house.  But I'd never played poker at a casino against a group of strangers that can see my face and read my style.   So when I walked into the poker room at Harrah's Las Vegas for the first time and bought my first rack of 100 one dollar blue chips, I all but kissed each one goodbye before I sat down.  The rest of the night was a blur of gin and tonics, constantly changing players, dealers cycling through over and over again..... the only thing that stayed fixed was me.... at table 9.... corner seat.... across from the dealers left shoulder.  This was a night of learning, I wasn't expecting to win so I wasn't planning on going up a bit and then running off with winnings.  I wanted to play a lot of hands and see a lot of different  players at the table.   Skiz and Schwartz  left at some point in the early morning, bidding me good luck, which I surely needed.  I had gone up early and kept telling myself that if I get back down to even, I'd stop and go to bed.  When we had started playing, I had already been up for 16 hours.  Flew in that morning, no sleep on the plane (damn you Denzel Washington and your great acting!!!!), roulette for a couple of hours, drinking with the group for a while, then the poker room.  As hour after hour past I kept raising my ""go to bed"" limit higher and higher.   Leave at +$50....leave at +$100.....  Finally, this dealer Xiu Li sits down at my table for the 10th time of the night.  She was very soft spoken and very sweet.  We had played many hands together over the night.  As she dealt the first hand out, she leaned over the table and quietly pleaded ""John, go to bed. It's past noon"".  Holy Crap! I had spent 13 hours at the tables.  I'd been awake for 32 hours straight and I was very drunk.  Time had flown and I had to leave.  I cashed out for $240 on my $100 buy in.  Not a bad start at all.  The second night didn't start til around midnight (granted only 12 hours later)  I had caught a quick nap for like 3 hours, then hung out with the guys all day.  Skiz suggested poker at midnight, and suddenly there I was again.  I was very hung over and destined to lose, considering the last night's good fortune.   I walked in and a handful of players immediatedly acknowledged me....calling out my various nicknames from the night before ""Hey, Kid Jersey!"" or ""Yo, Atari!"" (my previos night's T-shirt) or ""It's Johnny T&T!"" (my drink Tanqueray and Tonic).    I had realized that the night before I played very sociably....talking to everyone, commenting on lots of hands, making jokes about almost everything, making a lot of friends. This isn't how you play good poker at all, right?  You have to hide your emotions and play with your head.  Focus on other people and what they do.  Concentrate.  I decided to play this night serious and sober....very quiet, sit like a statue, give away nothing.  Besides I was too hung over to be as upbeat as last evening.  I dropped 100 bucks in the first hour.  Everything went wrong.  I bet the right hands, I layed down at the right moments, nothing was working.  I bought in for a second rack of 100 and lost half of it soon after.  I started to think that casino poker really wasn't my game and my luck (and that's all that last night was) may have run out.  If I play here a few more nights I'll be down a ton of money.  Maybe I don't belong here and I should keep my gameplay in my house or online in my room.  Things were pretty bleak.  Enter Joe, the dealer from China, who I called ""Big Brother"".  I gave him that nickname because of how well we hit it off and simply, he shares my older brother's name.  After losing a big hand at his table he looked at me and said ""John, you're not yourself tonight at all.  Uptight doesn't work for you.""  I laughed for a moment and thought about the comment.  He was right.  I wasn't having as much fun.  This game seemed more like work and I was failing.  I quickly re-introduced myself to the table, making a joke that Joe had just woken me up.  Then I ordered a gin and tonic saying that I was like Pop-Eye and Gin was my spinach.   The rest of the night I played like myself.  Talking all the time, laughing at the tough breaks.  It was fun as hell.  I met a few dozen new people and replayed many from the night before.  I learned everybody's name, where they were from, what they did for a living.  People from almost every state and every walk of life.  I even got a new nickname off the T-shirt I was wearing.  At 9am as I was walking up to cash out for the night, the floor boss shook my hand and said ""See you tomorrow Harvard?"".  I looked down at the 5 racks of chips in my arms ($500 total).   Then I looked back at the rooms where a bunch of hands shot up for a last wave goodbye.   Joe was just sitting there smiling.  ""Are you kidding me?"", I said, ""This is where I belong.""  I love playing poker....it's not about money or even the satisfaction of winning.  Those are bonuses but I love the game."
ROAO66H,male,25,"While feasting on Kwong Fat, Hews and I found out where Stew's bowling ""Jazz-Hands"" came from.  At first, we only found out that Stew took a musicals class in college.  Luckily, it was just a class  about  musicals.  We could have left it at that.  Nope.  Unfortunately for Stew, he took it a step further by letting us know that in high school, he was awarded  ""Best Thespian""  for his Tony-award losing work in his school musicals.  Doesn't Conti have Jazz-Hands?  Hopefully they won't team up and try to start a Jazz-Hands club here at work where they try to redo The Producers or Cats or The Lion King....  On a different, yet sort of related subject, I've been giving this bowling term stuff some more thought.  It's not that I suck consistently enough that I could get a shot named after me, but more that I'm so inconsistent that I don't have some quirky shot that always happens to me when I bowl.  I mean really, who bowls a 99,  205 , 132?  A+ for consistency on that one...and by ""A+"" I mean ""F-"" I still haven't come up with anything.  I was considering ""Ess Cha-oked"" but I haven't been in that type of situation too many times.  Not like when the term ""Hews'd"" was first coined.  The only other thing I could think of was my  Versatility  shot.  No one else does it, so I don't know if it would stick.  Plus, you can't make up your own nickname.  (side note: I think I just got that line from a BK commercial I saw last night - pretty funny commercial actually)  I'll take suggestions cuz all I can think of is something like, ""EssCha-tility"" Anyway...feel free to comment like I know you will."
ROAO66H,male,25,"Day 1 so i'm ahead on this table about $125. this is better than expected, but would be the only day i was actually ahead in poker. the game in vegas is a savage, discovery channel, meat tearing run at the pot where nothing is held bak and everything is played. you cannot bluff away a lion's lunch, and such is the case in the wild of las vegas. if you were not carrying the absolute best hand (which is predetermined despite what some yankees fans might tell you), then you should take a seat and see if the pack leaves any entrails. i was the one leaving the entrails on day one. i should have saved them for later days. bet, check, bet, raise, fold. 'sorry ma'am, no offense.' 'ma'am? ma'am?! do i really look that old.' the scorer records an error on the third baseman. i've thrown the ball into the grandstands. 1) this girl is not old. b) she has tickled my optic nerves i hate reeling. but here i am, reeling. i apologize several times. i mention that i am a slight man and that i've had 4 miller lites. bet, check, bet, rake in. bet, she folds. 'good lay down.' (this means, you folded when you should have folded, thus saving you money). 'you and me would never make a good lay down.' and then she winks. when ms. heriot explained the DBQ section of the AP history test to me, i never thought i would ever apply it to real life. here's a question, here are documents. use these to answer this. unfortunately, my question was about gonorrhea in the french and indian war, and the documents were scrawled on papyrus. no sense could be made of them. this DBQ was harder. Question: 'should i say something to this girl?' Document 1: Author: that girl Title: what she said to you Body: 'you and me would never make a good lay down.' Document 2: Author: that girl Title: the thing she did after her ambiguous quip Body: <wink> and where in one situation i parlayed my knowledge of syphillis amongst fur traders into 6 college credits, i had no such luck in this situation, and was forced to retake girls 101, girls 102, and generally fucking things up 307 (prereq is a seminar about crystal pepsi, which i passed out of). nicely done. i retired to my room. i am left to watch a documentary on giraffes. they frolic. i ponder the giraffe. he is merry. his neck is long. he can eat fruit from even a tall tree. i cannot do this. giraffes needn't take DBQs. they have many advantages. when i grow up, i will be a giraffe. but not a swan. they have long necks but are stupid."
ROAO66H,male,25,"Before I start this blog I have one question for the rest of this Blogdom.  Why is it that whenever you are about 5 minutes late and you think you can make it up on the road, someone decides to get into the fast lane and drive .005 mph faster then the person in the slow lane?  Then they think they are going too fast so they hit their brakes, but no one is in front of them.  The left lane should no longer be the fast lane, maybe we can rename it the piss off the rest of the people driving lane.    To be continued after WDT....."

O7ZBGSW,male,24,"A friend sent me this forward last night. Thought I'd post it instead of emailing it out to all my twenty something friends. I wish I could take credit for writing this but I can't... so I won't. Kudos to the anonymous author who read my thoughts and so eloquently put to words what I couldn't.  **looking forward to my 30s...I hear it gets better, especially when you feel more secure about yourself, and less accomodating to bullshit. ""Being Twenty-Something"" They call it the ""Quarter-life Crisis."" It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you. You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out......  GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US!!!!!"

Hey guys do you know this fact Please read on  #################################################################### An Eyeful a day keeps the doctor away* by JONATHAN HAYTER Staring at women's breasts is good for men's health and makes them live longer, a new survey reveals. Researchers have discovered that a 10-minute ogle at women's breasts is as healthy as a half-an-hour in the gym. A five-year study of 200 men found that those who enjoyed a longing look a busty beauties had lower blood pressure, less heart disease and slower pulse-rates compared to those who did not get their daily eyeful. Dr. Karen Weatherby, who carried out the German study, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine: ""Just 10 minutes of staring at the charms of a well endowed female is roughly equivalent to a 30-minute aerobics workout. Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation. There is no question that gazing at breasts makes men healthier. Our study indicates that engaging in this activity a few minutes daily cuts the risk of a stroke and heart attack in half. We believe that by doing so consistently, the average man can extend his life four to five years. She added that sexy stars like Dolly Parton, Heather Locklear and Demi Moore had proved to be especially good for the men's health. #############################################################  Happy bird watching.

On Forest Gate Road in Oakbrook, there is only the Oakbrook Park District (1450 Forest Gate) and a luxurious subdivision (from 1 to 75 Forest Gate). A mail lady was stopped there, so I got out and asked her where 1500 Forest Gate Road is. She says: ""1500 Forest Gate Road doesn't exist! But we get mail for them all the time!

GOZA6UZ,male,33,"Actually, what I have been struggling for, the creation of a viable, honest contemporary spirituality, is not that difficult to define. The task is to see worth in each thing, without exception. Everything is here for a reason. Obviously, I don't mean that in a mythic, supernatural, moralistic way. Everything is here for  reason, but not only do we not know what that reason is, the reason doesn't even  exist  fully. The point to existence evolves along with the evolution of existence itself. This is what I call ""holistic spirituality"", and is a task for a lifetime. To see the necessity of every person, every minor thing, every action, however seemingly stupid, minor, violent or hideous. This seems to be similar to Nietzsche's Dionysian ideal. (You mean that ideal that he had a hard time living up to? Yeah--that one.) Which makes sense, since both his and my spiritual ideal is Goethe.  I think that what is necessary for this form of consciousness is a deep, abiding trust in and love for existence, below the superficial everyday ups and downs of emotions.    So, waiting, I have won from you in the end: God's presence in each element. ~g"

Today, I am more accepting of religion, and Noonan's column, apart from my visceral distaste for her general political and moral outlook, makes me wonder about the transcendence of prayer. How can I recommend Eastern meditation or contemplation and not recognize that prayer is not really so different?  I suppose that a major difference is that petitionary prayer is often quite egotistical. Prayers for a better job, etc. are centered on what the individual wants or thinks they need rather than aimed at expanding consciousness beyond the ego. (Echo of Kubrick: ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"".) But that seems to be a difference of degree, not of kind."

GOZA6UZ,male,33,"I promised someone an essay on Goethe and I haven't come up with anything yet. But  urlLink here is an excellent article  surveying Goethe's life and works. Note especially that his  Sturm und Drang  period was prior to even the birth of most of the English Romantics, and that the German Romantic movement was named in opposition to Goethe and Schiller's Classicism. So why is Goethe considered a Romantic by most English majors and even some textbooks? You tell me.  From the article, I put together a chronology of Goethe's works.   1773	Goetz of Berlichingen - A play about a Medieval hero with a (literal)       iron hand. 1774 	The Sorrows of Young Werther -The ultimate Romantic novel of       unrequited love. 1775	Faust: A Fragment - The core of Faust's romance and wager.  1787	Iphigenia in Tauris - Goethe's ultimate classical play, about the         triumph of honesty, strength and ethics over adversity. 1789	Torquato Tasso - A play about an Italian playwright who represents all         poets. 1789	Roman Elegies - Poems, some off-color, written while in Italy. 1790	The Metamorphosis of Plants - Attempt to discover a primal form in       various plants. 1794	Reynard the Fox - Fable of the utility of cunning. 1795	Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship - A  Bildungsroman : an novelistic           account of the cultural education of a young man.  1795	Conversations of German Refugees 1798	Hermann and Dorothea - A classical poetic epic of a German couple. 1809	Elective Affinities - A romantic and tragic novel about partner           switching and a mystical scientific principle.  1810	Theory of Colors - An attempt to ""save the phenomena"" of light           and an attack on Newton's very well established optic theory. 1811-33     From My Life: Truth and Poetry - One of the first psychologically           literate autobiographies, not unlike Rousseau's  Confessions . 1816	Italian Journey - An autobiographical account of Goethe's flight from         literary celebrity into the land that is the inspiration for Goethe's         classical period. 1819	West-Eastern Divan - The first book of world literaure, a book of         poetry including many homages to eastern writers including         Mohammad, Rumi, and Hafiz.  1821         Wilhelm Meister's Travels - Continuation of the  bildungsroman  and a         ready vehicle for Goethe's opinions.  1832	Faust, Part Two - Faust has more symbolic, mythic and bizarre         poetical adventures. 1836	Conversations with Goethe - The conversations of Goethe's last ten         years, arranged by date and recorded more or less accurately by         Goethe's assistant, Eckermann."

GOZA6UZ,male,33,"urlLink Kelli  asks about the difference between cults and religions.  I have studied religion for some time and have  NEVER  seen a definition of cult that does not just as well describe many forms that the major religions, and some non-religious organizations, take. It's a useless word, in my opinion, used to bully groups that other people don't like. When I went to Baptist Sunday School as a kid, I was taught that Catholics were a ""cult"". No joke. Yet the Baptists are at the very least just as manipulative and deceptive as Catholics. So it's a name-calling, bullying, insulting, worthless word. The origin of the word ""cult"" is a Latin word meaning to adore or care for, which ""cultivate"" also comes from.  I'm not saying that many religions are not manipulative. Obviously, many are, and many do not deserve to be placed in the same group as the great world religions, all of which I respect deeply. But these religions are great and staggeringly long-lasting because they take many many different forms. Some of these forms are some of man's greatest accomplishments. Other forms of the same religions can be malignant, as we see coming from the Middle East."

We ourselves possess Beauty when we are true to our own being; ugliness is in going over to another order; knowing ourselves, we are beautiful; in self-ignorance, we are ugly."" -Plotinus   A major problem with a thorough-going holistic monism like Plotinus' is that is begs the question: what is the opposite of being? In Plotinus' view of the world, meditation brings us closer to the One. Physical matter is less permeated with the One than mental entities.   In reply, any positivist will say, as oppossed to what? What else is there other than the One? If the One is all there is, how can something be less permeated with the One than something else? What is the background behind which the One exists? Basically, according to logical positivists, if you say that everything is made of something you aren't saying anything at all.  The response is that this is not a metaphysical theory, but instead, a theory of consciousness, and that, in any case, there is no difference between the two types of theories.  Another response is that there is a rhetorical component to Plotinus' words that is more substantial than the literal meaning. But Plotinus definitely seemed to believe in his system.  And, you know, materialism, for all its contemporary, and hopefully short-lived, hubris, has the same problem. Namely, what is the substance in which protons, neutrons and electrons exist (or quarks, if you prefer the sub-subatomic level)? ""A void"" is not the most theoretically satisfying of answers.  Others that I consider holistic monists include the Buddha, Lao-Tsu, Heraclitus, Plato, Goethe, Hegel, Schelling, Schopenhaur, Emerson, and Aurobindo. Augustine and Dante were influenced by Plotinus' and Plato's holism. Note that there is an Indian, a Greek, and a German school of holism."

Ill take a shot at answering them.     would we gaze in wonder and awe as David did during the last day with his 'mother' if we knew it were the last day with someone in our lives?     I think the answer is No, and made the final section of the movie somewhat implausible. Butlets face itthe entire movie is enormously, audaciously speculative, and the last section completely so. But why wouldnt we be able to enjoy our last day with our mother, as David did? Because our emotions would irrationally interfere with the experience that we would like to have. Davids did not. Was Kubrick implying that there were ways in which  David was superior to humans, that, mature, he had better control over his emotions? I think yes, in fact, David and the other bots were almost continuously and multi-factedly portrayed as superior to human beings.    is it true that life is merely a journey to fill the empty gap created by the separation with our parents?    Is this a quotation from the movie? Very interesting if so. Its a bit too unreconstructedly Freudian for me, but probably does describe one level of our existential quest. So my answer is: take out the word merely. Life is that, in addition to a host of other things. The problem with Freudianism is its typically reductive use, reducing all of life to its rather meager outlook.    would the gigolo dude replace womans need for sexual fulfillment so that she could concentrate more fully on 'nurturing' relationships with other women? this appears to be the more important question for me. female/female relationships are smoother.     Im going to cowardly duck away from this question, with the excuse that, being a man, I have no female/female relationships. Suffice to say that the excess of hormones that nature has imbued both men and women with insures that there will probably be a significant amount of unsatisfied sexual longing to keep Gigolo Joe and Jane busy. Personally, I doubt that female/female relationships are any less competitive or aggressive than male/male relationships, the aggression just takes less overt forms.   sz"

To find something beautiful is to believe that making it a larger part of our life is worthwhile, that our life will be better if we spend part of it with that work. But a guess is just that: unlike a conclusion, it obeys no principles; it is not governed by concepts. It goes beyond all the evidence, which cannot therefore justify it, and points to the future. Beauty, just as Stendhal said, is a promise of happiness. We love, as Plato saw, what we do not possess. Aesthetic pleasure is the pleasure of anticipation, and therefore of imagination, not of accomplishment. The judgment of taste is prospective, not retrospective; the beginning, the middle, but never the end of criticism. If you really feel you have exhausted a work, you are bound to be disappointed.

GOZA6UZ,male,33,"Someone wrote me and recommended Kundera to me. Here is my response.  Kundera and his ""Unbearable Lightness of Being"" is actually illuminates many of the world's problems. A better title for Kundera's book would be the ""Unbearable Flatness of Materialism"". And Kundera very accurately describes the unecessarily flattened and lightened world that many people live in today.  Think of the cosmos as the ancients saw it. A timeless, incomprehensible cathedral infinitely reflecting itself. We moderns often laughingly marvel at the navet of the ancients and medeivals. The planets, perfect musically-integrated spheres in harmony with everything else. That's where astrology comes from, another beautiful ancient scienceand not a separate science or belief, but a small, utterly integrated part of the vision ofwhat?the world, life, existence, reality. It was a vision of being. Yes, matter exists, but that's a less interesting part of the world. This was the view of the Pythagoreans, with their mathematical cosmology. Aeschylus, Sophocles, Pindar, Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, Dante, etc. all had this view. Shakespeare saw it slipping away forever. (cf. Ulysses' speech in Troilus & Cressida below.) Socrates, Aristotle, Copernicus, Newton, and esp. Darwin all helped to take this vision apart bit by bit until now, in the 20th century, we are left with Kundera's unbearably light being. It is totally unbearable to me. We have benefitted materially from this materialismample food, clean running water, electricity, antibiotics, etc. But we have suffered spiritually. Others have tried to repair the damage: Goethe, Hegel, Schelling, Emerson, Nietzsche, Rilke, Heidegger. I don't think the romantics got itBlake, Wordsworth, Whitman, Baudelairethey seem to accept the materialistic dogma too sincerely, rather than transcending it. It is an attempt to create an animism of the spirit. I think that we are all post-Kantians, like it or not. Just as we are all moderns. We are all post-Socratic, post-Copernican, post-Newtonian, post-Kantian and post-Darwinian. Creationists belong to the same group as flat-earthers. We don't live in Plato's or Sophocles' world, or Jesus' for that matter, like it or not.  Kant showed that our senses create our consciousness, that we don't see things-as-they-are-in-themselves (ding-an-sich), but only things-as-they-appear-to-us. He created back doors for Christian dogma, but they were obviously insufficient to actually instill belief in anyone. I believe Existentialism is a reaction to the crisis that Kant created.   To me, existentialism is all about believing that your intuition (usually your moral intuition, but could also be your artistic or other intuition.) is REAL. As real as anything. Existentialism is post-Kantian. It says, ""Kant says that my perceptions do not reflect the real world. Well maybe the objects of my perception aren't real, but I know what is real. To Kierkegaard, that was his commitment to Jesus. That's what he knew was real. Kierkegaard: ""Purity of heart is to will one thing."" That is to say, following your intuition simply IS morality. That's all we truly have, all we are given with certainty. He also called it the teleological suspension of the ethical.  For useful consciousness to evolve through random processes is the height of improbability. If we do not perceive things as they actually exist, how can we communicate? How can we know anything? Hegel's answer is that Geist (German for spirit or mind) is the stuff that the whole world is made of. The corollary to Hegel's idea is that evolution is not simply the natural selection of random mutations, but is rather spirit maturing, and is thus a mentel phenomenon as much as a physical one.   ""Just as the seed bears in itself the whole nature of the tree, including the taste and form of its fruit, so do the first traces of Spirit virtually contain the whole of its own history...The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom..."" Hegel, Lectures on the Philosophy of History  Emerson takes this idea a step further. He tends toward mysticism, because he extends this reliance on intuition to include all of knowledge, to include our mental, spiritual and scientific lives.   So although Kundera is an interesting writer that I liked, rejecting his worldview is central to me. And that's why tracing the history of consciousness is not merely ""the evolution of culture"", but a spiritual aspiration par excellence.  Heres part of Ulysses' speech the Troilus & Cressida quotation. If you'd like to see it in context, go  urlLink here  and hit Ctrl-F and search on the term ""lack'd"".  Shakespeare was a conservative who thought the world was getting steadily worse, whereas I sam a progressive that thinks the world is progressing towards something, but I can't say whether it will be better. I think it will be different and incommensurable, as ours is when compared to earlier periods. I like this quotation, because Shakespeare, at the beginning of the modern age, saw the medieval/ancient cosmology, which had his deep respect, slipping away, and being replaced with our materialistic view. I believe the Goethe is among the authors who moved beyond materialism into a cosmology that more resembles the interconnected, hierarchical view of the ancients.           The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,     Observe degree, priority, and place,     Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,     Office, and custom, in all line of order;     And therefore is the glorious planet Sol     In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd     Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye     Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,     And posts, like the commandment of a king,     Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets     In evil mixture to disorder wander,     What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,     What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,     Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,     Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,     The unity and married calm of states     Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak'd,     Which is the ladder of all high designs,     The enterprise is sick! How could communities,     Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,     Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,     The primogenity and due of birth,     Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,     But by degree, stand in authentic place?     Take but degree away, untune that string,     And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts     In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters     Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,     And make a sop of all this solid globe;     Strength should be lord of imbecility,     And the rude son should strike his father dead;     Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong-     Between whose endless jar justice resides-     Should lose their names, and so should justice too.     Then everything includes itself in power,     Power into will, will into appetite;     And appetite, an universal wolf,     So doubly seconded with will and power,     Must make perforce an universal prey,     And last eat up himself."
GOZA6UZ,male,33,"Saw ""Fellowship of the Ring"" again Tuesday night. The movie portrays a world in which one seems very small in relation to the immense problems of the wide world. In which we walk among the ruins of a past time that seem larger than life. In Tolkein's world, it seems like we were born too late to struggle with the ultimate powers. Until we realize that our struggles are just as epic and just as momentous as those of the past."

GOZA6UZ,male,33,"urlLink Robert Musil  linked to a neat  urlLink story  by Arthur C. Clarke. (The story has the added virtue of being very short--four pages.)  Thinking about the story, I realize that I would like to know much more about historical Buddhism than I do. (Please  urlLink email me  any Buddhist book recommendations.) Is Buddhism innately Pelagian?   By Pelagian, I refer to the heresy in Christian Church history that our life here on earth, rather than to ""glorify god"", in the typical formulation, is a process of ""soul-building"". That is, when we have suffered and learned enough from life in this world, we pass onto the next. This is an idea that has ben around as part of Christianity as well as many other religions.   Now that I get that question down on paper, I see that the answer is almost certainly yes."

It's  urlLink half-way down this page ,  urlLink here  with a geocities ad, and  urlLink here  with some graphics and a pop-up. Click on the one you find least offensive.  To me, it shows Wilber's transformation of traditional Buddhism from a rather pessimistic system--I've always interpreted the concept of Nirvana as meaning that existence should be escaped (a typically inaccurate Western view)--into something pretty affirming and positive. It is slightly other-worldly, but consider that in context, it comes as a prayer-like outpouring after 700 pages of intense philosophical reflection on consciousness in this world in the book  urlLink Sex, Ecology, Spirituality . In that context, it seems very appropriate."

GOZA6UZ,male,33,"I just used the phrase, ""Thanks for the heads up"" in an email. And it made me think. It warns me about reading poetry in translation. The phrase, of course, comes from ball games--when a wild ball is lobbed, one yells ""heads up"" so people will look at where the ball is and get out of the way. But I wonder, if the phrase was used in poetry, how would one translate it meaningfully into another language? ""Thanks for the warning"" doesn't convey the same thing at all.

MFUZWD0,female,17,"aggghh. Baseball was rough last night - no pitching, played short all game. Wasn't the fact that I was short all night that bothers me. Nlo back up. Ball hit between 1st and 2nd - 1st stays on first, 2nd gets the grounder, short covers for the tag out on 2nd. This is how it should have worked. I was covering 2nd, ready for the throw, when the left fielder had actually run in to 2nd, to also get the ball, which made everyone look ridiculous. Agggghhhhh. Why don't they know what they're doing? I also don't understand why SH and DB put CS back in to pitch for another 2 innings. I mean, at least put SS back in. When yu pitch like that for 3 innings you have to do something about it. I mean, if yu're not going to let me pitch, then thats fine. But you have to prove to yourself that you're good enough to be put back in, something CS didn't do. I work my butt off for nothing, or so it seems. We have another practice on Sunday. I hate knowing it's going to be very frustrating only there's nothing I can do to prevent it, just go.   Uninvited. Can I say anything? No. Because you invited yourself. You wonder why I can't and don't talk to you. This is why. I just can't. There'd be no point. I'm not putting myslef up for a huge blow out. I don't want that. But then I also can't pretend everything is fine forver. I tried that one. Didn't pan out so much. The one day I'll have in 2 weeks to actually talk to MI about anything, and it's already gone before it comes. I don't think anyone quite understands. Invited yourself. But I can't stop you.

MFUZWD0,female,17,"I'm happy today. Makes sense I suppose. It's a good good day. I wonder.  So what happens now? I wonder. What happens later? I don't know. Who does really? Nothing is ever for certain. Life is what you make of it, so I guess it's all up to me. If I'm not having fun or am not happy, something must be wrong. But not today. I am happy today. Baseball? We'll see. Go and make the best of it, what other choice do I have.  Only a couple more to go. I wish I was on KK's team, but that didn't happen. CL rigged her team so of course her team is better. KK is lucky, but in a way she's not, not just KK, CL's team in general. I think it helps to put 13 year olds with a bunch of different ages and experienced players so it helps them. It helped me when I was 13. But not this. Not when her team is purposely good. Extremely good. Good to begin with, not to mention there's always room for improvement. How are they supposed to get better when they don't come to practices? How are they supposed to get better when they don't observe the more experienced, and stick to their own methods? Closed minded. Immature. Have no idea what theyr'e talking about. I think it's even too late to begin.  I don't think SH and DB are very good coaches. Not very experienced. And because SH and JB are younger, SH and DB may have experience, but this is a diffferent league now. Age group change. CL is good, well at least I thought she was, but then look at what she did this year. Exactly what RH did last year, and she was the first to complain about that. Yet she has no problem doing it herself. I didn't think she was the type of person to rig her team. Unexpected. I hope I get to pitch. Probably. Yet it's so frustrating when they hit it, and there's no help whatsoever in the field to back you up. It's like at times a one man show and you just hope someone will be there to back you up. I don't feel I have the trust with my team mates that was there last year. I think we had better players last year. A better team. More experienced. I don't understand why CL would do that, especially when she knows what it's like to be on the other end of it, as she was with RH last season. I wonder if I'll play nexxt year. Maybe. Maybe KK and SW will play. Hmmm. I don't know, just get through this week and next week and I'm done. It's like SH doesn't even feel the need for the practices, we called the one last Sunday because I asked for it and I pushed for it. I guess it worked, but ONE good practice is not worth it. We may as well give up. I feel the playoffs are a way of showasing what you're learned as a team, and even how far you've come, as individuals as well as a team. Not this year. My pitching gets better every game - but does SH always put me in? No. I feel he sometimes gives me a chance, but definently favours SS. He would. Makes sense. SS is the kind of person who is aware of it, just because of her situation. Likely. I don't know what else I can do. Push for another practice? Would people come? Would they be willing? Or is it too late.  Make the best of it."

MFUZWD0,female,17,"When I ask you to listen to me and you start giving me advice,  you have not done what I have asked.

When I ask you to listen to me and you feel you have to do something to solve my problem, you have failed me,  strange as that may seem. Listen! All I ask is that you listen. Don't talk or do - just hear me. Advice is cheap; 20 cents will get you both Dear Abby and Billy Graham in the same newspaper.  And I can do for myself; I am not helpless. Maybe discouraged and faltering, but not helpless.  When you do something for me that I can and need to do for myself,  you contribute to my fear and  inadequacy. But when you accept as a simple fact that I feel what I feel, no matter how irrational, then I can stop trying to convince you and get about this business  of understanding what's behind  this irrational feeling. And when that's clear, the answers are  obcious and I don't need advice. Irrational feelings make sense when we understand what's behind them. Perhaps that's why prayer works, sometimes, for some people - because God is mute,  and he doesn't give advice or try  to fix things.  God just listens and lets you work  it out for yourself. So please listen, and just hear me.  And if you want to talk, wait a minute for your turn - and I will listen to you."

I can choose my friends. I can be myself. If they don't like me or our lifestyle then fine. If that's how they're choosing to behave, then there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. No one talks to my mom like that.   I can accept my grandparents for what they are and move on, perhaps een laugh about the ridiculousness of theur so choosen behaviour. I am not going to pretend everything is fine when it is no where close to being fine. I can however put it out of my mind, and when it chooses to come back, I will be ready for the rush of emotional feelings that will follow.   If she calls, I will answer and talk about nothing in general.. smile and nod.. on the phone.. if in fact that is possible..   As for visiting the rest of the family, nana and uma included, I honestly do not see myself ever going back there. Why put myself through that? It's not fun to go there and be glared at. Its not fun to walk into a room, and everyone stops talking. You walk into another room and hear your 'beloved cousins' speaking of no one else but your sister, and why she would ever go into engineering, let alone dye her GPA purple. They simply do not understand.   If they cannot accept the fact that Holly and I are growing up and are living our own seperate lives, then that's their problem. They dont come here ever, so they will have no chance to really get to know us again.   You think you know someone, but you have to realize that when you're that close to them, everything seems normal. But once you move away from it all, you also take a step back and realize.. man this is one fucked up system we have here.   If they choose not to talk to me, then they're the ones who are missing out. I will no longer beat myself up with the question of why. There is no explaination for their chosen behaviour, and I have to admit I will never understand what's behind it all. I now have to fill my life again, and also fill the now empty voids my family and my grandparents have created with friends, my parents, holly, marilyn and bill, and most importantly uncle ken and aunt joan. i can't explain how happy and greatful i am that they moved here. they're more like grandparents to me than nana and uma have ever been.

Today is a brand new day. Yesterays are over, even though the hurting's not.  Nothing lasts forever, so I must cherish what I've got.  Don't take my love for granted, for soon it will be gone - all you ever wanted of the love you thought you'd won.  The hurt I'm feeling now won't dissappear overnight, but someday, somehow, everything will be all right.  No more wishing for the past.  It wasn't meant to be.  It didn't seem to last, so now we are free."
MFUZWD0,female,17,"tonight was the first night of my 2-weekend hardcore hours course NLS (national lifeguard service) there are about 14 of us, i know a couple people already, everyone is so friendly! its actually a very interesting course.. includes things you wouldn't normally think about. i like that. think of things you gnerally would not think of unless asked to think about it. for instance, the difference between life savers and life guards and just how important being a lifeguard is.. some poeple go to high school and then train to be a life guard as their chosen career path.  for some people, it's a summer job opportunity. for others, its a dream career. interesting."

I'm calling SH tomorrow. I'm still really upset about the whole thing. This is just ridiculous. RB thinks I should wait until after the finals so I can talk to him about the whole season and not just one game. They're so young. MI thinks I should go over and talk to him today, before work of course. I don't think I can do it face to face, I'll lose it. This is ridiculous. Why am I letting myself get this bothered? It really does bother me. So young. I'm not calling SH before work, that's not  a good idea. My head needs to be at work when I'm at work. Call tomorrow. But what good will it do? Maybe I should talk to Buck. He'd understand more than Horn would, Buck knows me better. I don't know. I have to talk to Horn at one time or another, Buck will tell Horn anyways, so I may as well talk to Horn. Would Buck take it sesriosly? They're so young. I don't know what to do."

THWVU51,male,25,"Man am I ever lethargic.  I sleep wayyyyy tooooo much.  I think my diet is completely fucked up.  I mean, of course it's fucked up.  I've been doing it to myself for a while.  So now it's time to change.  And although I did just finish eating McD's, it is officially the last one I am having until the New Year for sure.  No fast food unless it is Subway or a Salad.  And I need to ask my Dad to take me grocery shopping tomorrow as well.  I need to have good food here to eat if I'm going to do this.  I wake up in the morning feeling like shit.  So this needs to change, so that I can use my days for something constructive.  I didn't realise it has been so long since I've written anything.  Not that much happened.  Johnny came to visit, that was nice.  Ummmm....I ain't got nothin'...that's what I mean with the ""lethargic-ness"", I should have stories to tell but I ain't got shit.    But at least I can say that this is by far my most curse filled blog to date.  Shit fuck fuck ass boobs crap pubes bush fuck shit."
THWVU51,male,25,"Well there's two things I suppose I need to talk about.  My apologies for no updating of late but I've had to move and all that crap.  So first thing....""fellow"" is still not talking to me.  And although he's explained why I can't help but be frustrated.  I don't think he understands how hurt I am over the whole thing.  I feel awful for saying something I didn't mean, and I realise I pretty much brought it on myself but we should be able to work it out.  I am sick of coming online for the sole purpose of hoping he'll talk to me.  I wouldn't be going on gay.com at all if it weren't for this situation, I am quite tired of that room and all that goes with it.  *Sigh*...all I want is to be friends again...or to make him understand that I really care about him.  But that seems so hopeless.  Second the first boy I had a crush on story.  I'll mention this person by name because the chances of them reading it are slim, and even if he did I would hope he would be flattered as opposed to offended.  So yes...it has been 10 years plus since the last time I had seen him, as a rather small blonde haired, green eyed boy.  Tyler Field is his name.  We played basketball together one year, and I so desperately wanted to make sure he played again the next year that I managed to get his phone number and call him a couple days before registration.  His eyes are as close to perfection as I could imagine, that's really where the appeal is.  Don't get me wrong, he's a good looking guy, but they eyes are distinguishing.  I so wanted to be his friend, to hang out with him....just to be around him...and yes I always hoped he was on the skins team in the scrimmage.  So I ran into him at the store....and I looked into his eyes, and was taken back to that time.  A time of awakening I suppose.  Desire awakes, and the mind flourishes with thoughts of romance, love and the ever elusive happiness.  There's a part of me that really wants to ask him if he'd like to hang out sometime...realising he isn't gay...I don't want to go on a date.  But I always thought he and I could be good friends, and I didn't sieze the opportunity back then.    Such are things in this crazy mixed up world.  My back hurts, I miss ""fellow"", and I love that boy who first brought out my gay self."
THWVU51,male,25,"You know it's a week since the last entry and although there were lots of ups in the past week I am right back to where I was.  It is an inevitability of being me I guess, I'll always come full circle, especially where the circles origin is negative feeling.  I'm not making any sense.  Sometimes I get the feeling that I never do, my way of thinking doesn't seem to fit within the reality of the world that we actually exist in.  Not to mention the people who inhabit said world.  I care but I don't.  I'm not sure whether to think of it as apathy, or as a form of hypocrisy.  I want to be better, to get better.  But I am either unwilling or incapable of making necessary changes.  Malaise forever.  I went to bed last night at...hmmm...I'd say 3:30am, although didn't fall asleep until 5 at least.  And despite getting up for a couple bathroom breaks, and missing 2 appointments in the process I stayed in bed until 6pm.  Really I didn't even want to get up then.  I didn't feel bad or anything until after this...That's the problem.  I hate it when I stay in bed all day, but I still don't get up.  And negative feelings are an unavoidable result of this.  It's the same as when I have a one night stand, or brief relationship, I know I'm going to feel guilty afterward but I do it anyway.  Do I really hate myself that much?  I guess I would have to say I do.  Although I'm not sure what I did to deserve the hatred.  Maybe it's more things I haven't done, or that I should have done.  A lot of my self-deprecation is to keep people at a distance.  It doesn't work most of the time, it just makes people more interested in me.  At least it roots out all the shallow people.  Right now there are three people who are interested in me in some way.  Two are in the navy, one of whom is out at sea the other who is French-Canadian.  The other is a cute Taiwanese student at Acadia.  Now as of right now, I am not interested in any of these people.  I'm not even sure if I want to be friends with any of them.  Two of them seem a little needy, and the other one seems like a whore.  Two I would have problems communicating with, and two likely lack the kind of intelligence I require in a person.  Such is that situation.  We'll see how it plays out I guess.  I still miss ""fellow"".  He still isn't talking to me, but I guess it's really showing me what kind of person he is.  Which is ""not a very good one"", as sad as that is to say."
THWVU51,male,25,Actually to her credit though...that is the girl in my prior entry...She was the first person to ever ask me if I was gay.  I should have told her 'yes'.  I wish I had said yes to the other few people who asked me that when I was closeted.  Not as though things would have been better that way.  Just because I am curious as to what would have happened.
THWVU51,male,25,"Oh lord what am I doing up???  I have to get up for work in three hours.  I was just laying in bed with a million thoughts coming to me, many of them surprisingly clever.  Mainly focusing on an idea for a book I had with a title along the lines of ""Opinions that don't matter: A guide on how not to think.""  Which would essentially be a book of some of my opinions and theories.  Most of which many people don't know.  It is this laying in bed and thinking that has made me realise that someone should invent software that will take the thoughts I am thinking and transfer them to the computer.  I am so much more clever when simply thinking as opposed to speaking or writing.  Everything is so much more cohesive in my head.  Well, at least in terms of certain things.  Well I guess it's time to try sleeping again.  One more day of work to face then a day off.  Which of course is Sunday, traditionally my worst day of the week.  Marvellous.  But you never know how this week will be.  We'll see how it goes."
THWVU51,male,25,"It's about time I posted something isn't it?  I don't really have anything to say.  I've finished reading the Harry Potter books.  So now I, like millions of others, must wait until the next one comes out.  I met someone knew tonight.  Someone from online obviously.  Had a good time blah blah blah.  I don't put much hope into anything coming out of it.  He's too attractive for me and I think he knows it.  Plus I made myself sound like a total dumbass, which is something I tend to do when I meet people who are of equal if not superior intelligence.  So he's got brains and he's got looks, he'll make someone very happy and maybe we'll be friends or something.  Who knows what the future holds?  I really don't know what to write.  I never intend to make entries about my negative feelings.  But it seems that as soon as I sit down to write and entry I'm completely flooded with negative thoughts.  All the things that happen to me in the run of the day and at the end I always feel the same.  Now this would be a good thing of course if I went to bed happy and satisfied.  But that's not the case, and I can't see it ever becoming so.  Ooooh I got home in time to catch Harvey Birdman and Aqua Teen Hunger Force....jesss!!!!"
THWVU51,male,25,"Ewwwww oven cleaning.  Okay I don't actually gross out that easily, nevertheless the oven is not pleasant.  Sigh, still waiting to know when I can move in to my new place and getting impatient with it.  My roommates can start moving into there place tomorrow, and I naturally am helping with that.  The irony there is that it's likely that when it comes time to help me they won't be able to help me.  It's just the way things will probably work out, I don't hold it against them it's just annoying.  And I once again must remind people, that if you don't hear from me for a little bit I am alive and doing fine (I hope), just without phone or internet for a while.  What a vapid entry!    I shall make it my goal after the move to actually make some interesting entries...maybe even thought provoking.  Maybe...you never know...anything is possible..."
THWVU51,male,25,"So here I am at last to update my blog; And despite the fact that it has been weeks since I have posted anything I've got nothing to say really.  I promised myself that I wouldn't simply write about how much I hate myself, and life...but without that fodder I'm left with very little.  At least when you consider that I will turn any topic into how much I hate life and myself.  It is inevitable.  So yeah, there's nothing to say then.  I asked for 2 weeks off work and that time has officially started as I just returned from my final pre-vacation shift.  Ummmm....Go see the movie Napolean Dynamite.  This is all I've got for now.  I'm not in a very clever mood so there's no way for me to come up with anything good to put in..........  My name is Shake-zula the mic rulah the old schoola!"
THWVU51,male,25,"It's always funny how the strangest things upset you.  Unfortunately of late, in the past couple of days anyway, I have been more open to negative thoughts than I have been.  This is not a good thing.  The last thing I need is to get depressed before Christmas, since I usually have alot of trouble getting through the season without feeling sad that Christmas is over, or feeling trepidations over the pointless year to come.  It is also funny to realise what a tenuous hold you have on things.  I probably could have gone to bed happy tonight, but I saw one thing and now happiness will not occur until the bliss of sleep has taken me.  Oh how I hate my waking hours.  I don't even think falling in love could cure that (no, I am not falling in love that's just an example).  And yet I am aware of many things.  The joy that I have been feeling can remain if I stay positive and follow the course of treatment.  I also realise that if I fail this time at ridding myself of such negative thoughts and emotions, I probably won't get another shot at it.  I will never be able to articulate exactly what it's like in my head.  I don't think I would want to either.  Nobody needs to know that stuff.  People shouldn't have to hear about it, but then again, I shouldn't have to live with it.  But I do.  For now, at least.  Live with it."
THWVU51,male,25,"Our weaknesses are as much a part of us as our strengths.  We all have the ability to be fragile as glass, and yet solid as granite.  I am just realising that my last post is gone.  I wonder why that is?  There are few updates to give of course.  I officially am the heaviest I have ever been.  Will this prompt me to change the way I eat and live my life?  Probably not.  It really should, but it won't.  I have finally started talking to ""fellow"" again.  I am looking for jobs.  Wish me luck, because my unqualified ass is going to need it.  I have met a couple of interesting people.  But it's not like that interaction makes me feel any better about things or myself.  And it's not like I am meeting people who even live in the same city as me.  My friend Jay moved to Toronto this past Friday.  Good for him is all I can say, and I wish him the best of luck.  He has joined both the gay soccer, and basketball leagues there.  You want to talk about things that make me jealous.  Ah well, I'm too fat to play sports now....Six foot one and 185...I may as well be a derelict, stuck in a hammock all the long day with five fans around me cooling the air and spreading my foul stench throughout my trailer in Eastern Passage.  I hate Sundays.  No matter how good my weeks are, everything always resets.  And then I have to start anew, trying to get the week to go my way.  That is until the next Sunday when it resets and I must begin again.  This is also why I hate the word cyclical.  Well I am going to try to find out what happened to my last entry.  Hopefully I will start updating more than once a week.  And even more hopefully will write something that's not quite so self-centered."
THWVU51,male,25,"Wow I can't believe I haven't written anything all week.  I suppose I should be changing the date and time on these as it seems it is never correct.  For example it is now Thursday Oct. 16, 2003 at 4:00am, I'm sure it'll say something different after I finish posting.  I cannot sleep.  I do not know why I cannot sleep, but I couldn't even settle my mind or body for more than a minute whilst attempting to sleep so I thought perhaps I would come on here type something out then try it again.  Type what out I'm not entirely sure.  My night at work just plain sucked.  There's no good reason for that it just did, the last part of it anyway.  I have been letting that bother me, among other things.  As I constantly do, I allow past events to bother me...making up hypothetical ""if I had done this"" situations in my head thinking about past events that I can't possibly go back and change.  And even if I could the likelihood of them happening the same way again are very good.  I have met someone that I believe intrigues me.  Whether or not this person is interested in me even for friendship is uncertain.  However there is something interesting to me about a person who pays no attention to politics and doesn't watch The Simpsons.  I never said this intrigue was a good thing.  But maybe it is, who knows...it seems that once again my old arch nemesis Time will be the deciding factor.  Damn you Time, you've won again!!!  If time is of the essence.  Then wouldn't the present be of the convalesance (can't spell that word)??"
THWVU51,male,25,"Dammed Fry, I can't teach.  I'm a Professor.  That about sums up the University experience right there doesn't it?  Don't get me wrong.  I have had some very good professors, but, I have also had a couple that have no business in a job that pays well over 70,000.  If you want to know why tuition is so high why don't you take a look at what your school is spending money on and quit looking for money the Government not only doesn't have, but realistically doesn't need to be giving to schools in the first place.  Say what, you say.  Government gives money to universities more as a courtesy.  The Government knows that this is where the next batch of workers come from and we want a well educated work force not only for domestic reasons but also to improve ourselves on the world stage.  Every university in Canada is in effect, a private organization.  And thusly, should not technically be given public money.  Obviously for the greater good they are given money, which is fine.  But I really think that if you want tuition costs to freeze or go down there is nothing the Government can do to help.  They have enough things to poor money into.  You know like sponsorship and things.  I'll make that point now before anyone gets all high and mighty on me.  And another thing.  What's the big fucking deal about that??  This is hardly the first time that tax payer money has been used for inappropriate things.  I'm willing to bed that almost every Government since Confederation has lost money somewhere.  Are we going to collect from the corpse of Sir Wilfrid Laurier?  Probably not.  A Government is a large institution.  All the more reason why it should be downsized.  Hello Senator *glock glock*...See you in hell you rich do nothing bastard.  How do you like that for downsizing???  Again, please don't get me wrong.  I am upset about this.  But this is part of what living in a Capitalist society is...Business will always be grabbing at the pockets of government, and sometimes they're going to get something.  I find it hard to be outraged.  I would rather have my Government misuse 150 million dollars, then misuse billions.  You know what I'm talking about.  *Cough cough* war in Iraq *cough cough*.  Well that's enough ranting...And I didn't even talk about anything personal.  Not that there's much to say.  I mean...Considering how pathetic I view myself to be, no wonder nobody ever gives credence to my opinions.  As true as they may be."
THWVU51,male,25,"It is a shame I am not a teacher, for there are so many lessons people need to learn.  I sometimes wonder if most people comprehend the gravity of the word 'genocide'.  As I recall nobody leaped to Rwanda to stop all the killing.  In fact well over 500'000 were killed before anyone batted an eye lash.  I mean the people who were being killed no doubt batted their eyelashes right before they were hacked to death with a machete.  Where was the outrage???  It is 10 years later, and we honor the memory.  Which is good.  We should never forget.  But I have had people tell me they didn't realise how big a deal it was.  Granted at the time I don't think I did either.  I did learn much sooner than now, however.  Does nobody comprehend that over one million people were senselessly butchered???  Now we have the most powerful nation in the world hunting down those for killing 2000 people.  It's a shame not all people are allowed that kind of justice.  Actually, forget shame.  It's not fair.  Of course life is not fair.  That may even be the meaning of life, at least for some.  Bah!  I lost my train of thought.  Which happens all too often and explains why I can talk big but can't back it up.  Thoughts are one thing, and actions are another.  Although it is true that words can be powerful.  It will take a lot more than I am capable of to make people care...to make people see."
THWVU51,male,25,"What is love?  Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more.  Let's face it now, Haddaway did not have a way with lyrics.  He must have had some pretty messed up relationships.  Hmmm I don't think I came on here to talk about that.  I'm not sure what I came on here to write about.  I was listening to music in bed and it always makes me feel like coming out here to type something out.  What that thing is I have no idea.  Coolest chick in the world who wants to become an Egyptologist Laura has introduced me to the utterly bizarre show that is Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  The first cartoon I have ever seen that was definately written by members of the Marijuana Party.  Anyway check it out if you can, it's hilarious and so weird you'll forget what dimension you're in.    Right now I'm just stuck in a state of mass confusion.  I just don't seem to know anything.  I need to figure alot of things out but I seem unable to even figure out what the options are.  I'm very frustrated.  Hopefully after tomorrow night at least one thing will be sorted out.  I'm trying to figure out whether or not I am still together with ""you know who"" who is now in Fredericton, I'm not sure for how long.  I would very much like to know where I stood there, I just want to know whether I am single or not essentially.  Not like people have been beating down my door or anything.  I'm hoping I don't choke in my upcoming job interview.  It's not like it's the be all end all of jobs, but I really need to move on and I would like to do it before I get fired from my current job.  I really want to be able to walk away from this job with my head held up, instead of down.  But I do need to walk away, and I can't do that until I have another job.  Anyways...."
THWVU51,male,25,"I hate food.  Food is the beign of my existance.  Because to say I hate food is a lie, I love food, I can eat all the time.  I eat when I'm hungry, I eat when I'm bored, I eat for the sake of eating.  This food obsession is gonna get me in trouble some day.  My arteries are probably just as gross as Halifax Harbour.  Although I don't think I have condoms floating around my arteries.  Stupid food...I'm completely hooked.  Only by the grace of some unknown force am I not 300 pounds.  I remember the days when I used to be an athlete, ah those were the days.  The days before I had a job and made my own money.  The days when I couldn't eat out all the time.  I swear there must be addictive additives in fast food.  Because nobody in there right mind would want to continuously eat it if they could choose not to.  I don't want to eat fast food, and yet I do.  It practically brings me to tears sometimes...well not quite, but perhaps someday.  Because it seems as though I can't stop myself, like something makes me do it.  Maybe they put mind control devices in the hamburgers, and there is a massive control center that targets people with technological voodoo, forcing them to eat their greasy disgusting food.  Why am I whining about this anyway?  That's not a rhetorical question, somebody needs to tell me.  And the first person who says it's because I'm a native Maritimer is gonna end up with a broken limb or three.  Now if you'll excuse me I am going to go purge and read a non-threatening Boys magazine."
THWVU51,male,25,"Well it is Sunday.  Or at least it was.  It is after midnight so I guess that makes it Monday.  Regardless, it is Sunday so we can all guess what kind of mood I'm in.  You'd think I would be able to get over this whole ""life is pointless"" thing by now.  How did I ever end up this way?  If poor self-image and depression were strictly the result of environment then I probably wouldn't be in this state.  I  think it really comes down to letting go.  Letting go of negative thoughts, memories, traits and images.  That's easier said than done of course.  But I still let things that happened when I was 3 years old bother me.  You know, I kick and I scratch and I fight everyday to take some semblence of positivity away.  And yet at the end of the week it is inevitably lost to some unknown force that seems hell bent on ruining me.  Then again, perhaps it is not so unknown.  I would dare say it's me.  It has always been me sabotaging my own efforts to improve and progress.  I also don't understand why I always make entries like this one.  Yeesh.  You'd think I could write something light hearted and fancy free for once.  I am capable of that with some effort.  When did this become a tome to my self-loathing???  Time to go to bed, hopefully to not ponder any further questions of major severity.  Wishful thinking I imagine."
THWVU51,male,25,"On another note, after reading one of Johnny's posts I was inspired to go take some quizzes at thespark.com which is a site I hadn't visited in a while.  And I am not tryin to steal your thunder by posting my results Johnny, but after the last entry anyone reading may want a lark.  So yes, I am 50% gay, which is 7% more gay than the last time I took the quiz...I'm not sure why.  I am 66% dateable.  According to their personality test I am a Mastermind(Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker).  I am 48% sexy, which is giving me credit I think.  And I will have sex with 28 people in my life.  I'm curious as to what their definition of ""sex"" is.  Because the number of partners I have had varies depending on that....and I very much doubt I would have ""sex"" with 28 people in my life.  If that were the case I've got a long way to go."
THWVU51,male,25,"So yes I am finally writing again.  I made another addition to my home today.  Yes I now have another roommate.  The Care Bear known as Grumpy has come to live with me.  So now I have 4 roommates...Grumpy, Topper the Penguin, the stuffed cat which still has no name and my other personality Peyso.  Peyso rarely surfaces, because he is the confident organised and incredibly smooth version of me.  But he's around, and he says hi.  I need to start writing some articles for the school paper, which is still going forward despite my complete incompetence and neglect.  If Peyso were in control I certainly wouldn't be in this predicament.  I feel like I could use some Ritalin right about now.  I have been on it before, and it's very helpful to me...because I can't concentrate on anything for very long.  I get bored with this awfully quick, and the only reason I haven't gotten bored with it already is because I've got some people messaging me as I type.  So I can break concentration on this and move to something else.  And then come back to type some more but lose my train of thought.  So anyway I cloned a sheep.  Wait a minute.  Where was I??    Invisible Robot Fish.  Hmmm.....When I can't stops my fiddelin' I just takes me Ritalin I'm poppin and sailin' man!!     Special thanks to The Simpsons for always knowing exactly what to end an episode with."
THWVU51,male,25,"I for some reason want to cry.  There's no reason for it whatsoever but I'm almost thinking it's necessary.  Just for the sake of purging.  I've really been doing a number on myself the past few months with my diet.  I eat crap and now I'm paying for it.  I feel like crap.  It's so hard for me to get out of bed.  And there are so many things I need to be changing.  The most painful thing is that I know this, and yet nothing has changed.  What's up with that.  One of the main things I don't like about me, is the rather large schism between knowledge and action.  If I know I need to change certain things than you would think that I could easily change them.  But I don't work that way.  So on the other hand American Thanksgiving is this week, the day that usually marks the beginning of the Christmas season.  At least it does in my eyes.  Specials should start airing around December 1st.  Not like it makes a huge difference because I have them all on tape anyway, but still I like to watch them when they air.  The quality of picture is better off of the TV than off of a tape made a couple years ago.  Third paragraph.  I want to have a relationship with this person.  I realise it has been a little over a week and I am looking to far ahead.  However he is talking about moving home in January until April, May, or June.  I personally don't like this prospect.  And am admittedly disheartened at the thought.  But I would wait, and I would hop on a bus to go visit.  I say this now of course.  There are at least 36 days until January and many things can change.  But then again, there are 6 hours until 8am, and many things can change."
THWVU51,male,25,"I am supposed to go to lunch with my friend Michelle today...Well it's technically Sunday at 2:55am...Later today.  I mean, I will go to lunch with her I forget when she said she was going to call though so I'll have to get up and get ready around noon.  No sleeping in for me, plus I have to come home to put the ham in the oven.  Some of few are probably snickering at that.  Get your minds out of the gutter you perverts!!!  Someone wrote to me; ""Happy VD Dane"".  To which I reply, ""Happy Venerial Disease what the hell kind of friend are you?  You know I'm very sensitive about my STD's.""  I know it's a bad joke.  I don't have any STD's for the record.  I don't know what I want to write about.  I am surprisingly stunned by something I was watching on TV.  And despite the obvious social message it is delivering I think I was more affected by how useless the teenage girl was.  I mean, she enters into a competition where you have to kill the other contestants but she does jack shit besides get beaten to death by an old man.  Jeez.  Pathetic.  And yet very disturbing because her family and boyfriend watched it happen.  It was called ""Series 7"" or something to that affect.  Anyways interesting....I also caught the tale end of John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars"".  That was much less interesting.  So...""Fellow"" has reappeared on my MSN list.  I suppose he's expecting me to be all excited and message away.  I don't think I'll do that.  Don't get me wrong, I do really want to talk to him and everything.  But I want to know if he actually wants to talk to me.  The only vibe I ever got from him was that he was using me for something and didn't really give a shit about me.  And the fact that he would ignore me over so small a thing really points to him just needing any excuse to remove me from his life.  As if moving to another province wouldn't do it??  Anyways...I the I am going to go listen to ABBA or something.  Ain't got nothin' better to do until the morning comes."
THWVU51,male,25,"So I'm listening to a cheesy song.  Well that's what I'm doing now.  Before I was reading the great book I got for Christmas; 'At Swim, Two Boys' by Jaimie O'Neill.  It's a hard read for me, not just because there seem to be so many words that I don't understand.  But moreso on my own psyche it's pretty difficult.  If the end of the book isn't what I'm hoping it will be I'll be very upset.  And the other main thing that bothers me, is that the book is so romantic and beautiful, and it makes me realise that I have never experienced anything of the sort in my life.  And I really don't expect I ever will.  Now if I were to play the blame game, I would probably place my wish to fall in love and have a great romance on my friend Natalie.  Sorry, N-Babe...I'm not saying this is a bad thing but I wonder sometimes if I would actually be bothered by loves abscence if it weren't for the queen of romance herself.  As I have alluded to before I consider myself to be a big ole puzzle.  The big piece in the middle that is missing is my love and my soulmate, and everything will fall into place around that if only I could find it.  And yet, it doesn't seem like it will fit perfectly even if I do find it.  On top of this stuff a customer called me ugly today.  On top of that I made a couple of judgement errors Friday night, so now I am left desperately trying to hold onto any remnant of positive mood.  As anyone knows nothing quite bothers me like making a mistake.  Ugly??  Imagine that, eh.  I mean, I think I'm unattractive, but ugly my be a tad harsh.  Certainly if you go more than skin deep I might be construed as being ugly.  Mind you in that sense I could also be construed as being beautiful.  I am nothing if not empathetic, I try my best and sometimes how much I care for others can affect me negatively.  In case any of you wonder why I don't show my empathy much that would be why.  But when it comes to myself I don't allow much 'self-pathy'.  I'm not sure if there is a word for empathy of the self.  I don't give myself a break.  I care very little for myself and my value.  In fact I value myself alot less than I am sure most of you would begin to think I do.  So you ask the question, am I depressed?  I would say no.  This is the way I live my life, constantly in this purgatorey of mood, I am neither here nor there but I am more likely to fall then to ascend.  So it goes."
THWVU51,male,25,"It has occurred to me over the past couple of days that I love music.  This is hardly an epiphany, but it is funny how I don't listen to much music when I'm feeling down.  A special friend of mine who happens to be named after a city in the fine state of Texas made a CD for me which helped remind me of that.  I am currently listening to a CD of my own ecclectic taste...and It's putting a smile on my face.  So the next step is to try to make a CD for this friend of mine.  Turnabout is fairplay after all.  I finally had the talk with the parents about leaving school.  They weren't upset at all, except when I alluded to things I'm sure they didn't want to hear about.  So I didn't continue that line of the conversation.  Really I don't think my parents have to hear all about my inner pain to be able to feel compassion for me.  Indeed the last thing a parent wants to hear is that one of their children hates being alive, and has wanted to die for a long time.  And thusly I will not say these words to them.  But rather just make sure that they understand that the inner workings of my mind are not all smiles and sunshine.  But of course they only want me to get better, and they support my decision to leave school for the time being.  And obviously support my getting help, and also wish to help any way they possibly can.  I am blessed to have the family I have, I truly am, and I know it's what keeps me here.  So I have pretty much decided that I have a major crush on this guy that I met.  The problem is that I haven't heard tell of him in a week and I am starting to become paranoid.  This is the problem that comes hand in hand with feeling better.  When I am depressed I don't mind being alone at all.  However when I emerge from that I really want to find someone...then the question becomes ""do I actually like this guy, or am I just desperate.""  I honestly don't know.  I want to find that out, but I can't do that if he's avoiding me or not interested in talking to me anymore.  I am very confused by this current situation, and bothered as well.  I mean, I want to see him and talk to him so much I even went to NRG briefly on Friday night hoping he would be there...and for those of you who know me....You know what a big deal that is!!  Haha, I'm being such a silly boy...it's pathetic, but cute and funny at the same time so I guess all I can do is smile and try not to focus on it too much."
THWVU51,male,25,"I feel funny.  Likely owing to the fact that I have yet to eat today.  My parents always ask me whether or not I have eaten.  As though I am not eating or something.  I eat plenty, and plenty of the wrong food while I'm at it.  If they are wondering if I'm eating then all one would have to do is look at me as I leave the bathroom after my shower with the towel on.  Then you can see how utterly 'jiggle-rific' I have become.  There's yet another term that I have made up.  I shall add it to the Dane dictionary.  I believe I am up to a whole page now.  So this week I have been on vacation.  I was also supposed to be on vacation this week however I agreed to work on Tuesday and Wednesday because they needed people.  I had forgotten that Tuesday was my birthday, but I'm off at 4 so it really makes no difference.  Usually there's a big birthday dinner.  That's what my parents do for us kids...take us out to dinner.  We don't give presents in my family, just cards and dinner.  I like this arrangement.  I am a much bigger fan of food than I am of sweaters that don't fit properly.  This year however I really don't want to have anything.  Mind you I'm pretty sure I feel this way every year, and my parents usually get me to do it anyway.  This year I probably could have convinced them not to do anything...However my cousin whose birthday is August 12th is in town and so the families want to have a one night two birthday thing, and I can't very well say no to that.  If you're wondering why I don't want to celebrate my birthday I'll run down as many reasons as I can.  Although my head is sort of swimming with lack of sustinence I can try.  I don't like getting older of course, that's everyone's generic reason.  Another year lacking accomplishment, lacking improvement, lacking my self you could even say.  I also hate people spending money on me.  I don't feel deserving of it.  Not when the money could go to much better use on either themselves or some charity.  This past year in particular is nothing to celebrate.  The only thing I can really take from it is that I'm still alive.  That is a good thing, that I'm still alive.  However that seems to be all I ever take from any year.  I can never find solace in the fact that I am living.  I have never learned to create my own happiness, and it seems so improbable that I ever will.  So when it comes this time of year it seems that no matter what the coming year will always seem draped in utter futility."
THWVU51,male,25,"My final night in this apartment.  This is the first place outside of my parents house of course where I actually made it to the one year mark.  I must say I am feeling oddly emotional about the whole thing.  I have never been one to revel in the idea of hard physical labour either.  I hate moving.  In fact I already hurt my back because stupid me, yet again(I've done this everytime I moved), put almost all my cd's in one box(which is 200 something) then tried to lift really fast.  So that didn't work out so well, and now my back hurts.  Well what can you say besides I am an idiot.  And before anyone gets all excited: If you ever come visit me remember that I have rather eclectic taste in music and my collection if you can call it that deserves to be made fun of.  Although don't make fun of it to my face or I will hurt you.  My apologies but moving makes me violent.  Just be happy that I am moving into my own place away from my roommates and their swords and fighting sticks.  I do however have a baseball bat, tennis racket, and a Darth Maul double edged lightsabre.  Why yes I am a big geek, thank you for noticing.  I also found out today that my new computer has arrived...hooray...although my hookups for phone, net, and cable aren't until Aug. 7.  But I will do my best to get to the internet where I can, most likely at the home of my loving parents.  My eldest sister went to the ""I love SARS"" concert.  At least that's what she called it...because of course if it weren't for SARS the event never would have happened.  Hence the I love SARS.  But I digress.  I'm hardly jealous, I mean if I wanted to see a bunch of old men try to be young I'd....well I'd something anyway.  It was like the geriatric empowerment sessions or something.  ACDC???  The Rolling Stones??  The Guess Who??  Blue Rodeo??  Sass Jordan??  Who let these people out of the home??  Really they should be sitting in a chair eating honey mush, not playing music for the Gen X croud.    As you can tell I am going to miss my internet for the next little while so I am ranting on majorly to make up for it.  But all good things must come to an end, and I must rest up for my move, and final cleaning.  Well there will always be the memories, oh yes, I'll always have those."
THWVU51,male,25,"So I'm desperately waiting for my counsellor to come back from vacation because when he gets back he's getting me into the clinic so I can get some meds, praise jesus, because only the lord knows I can't go on this way especially with school starting.  Haha I am the king of the run-on sentence.  I'm still trying to figure out how I am supposed to co-edit the school paper when I have no grammar skill whatsoever.  Well that's probably the least of my problems in terms of that situation.  How about that I did nothing about it all summer, the other editor was in Prague all summer, I don't know if we'll have the money to publish, at least by the first publishing date.  I don't know whether we'll have anyone writing for the paper, and more importantly I don't even know why I'm doing it.  I suppose it has something to do with the former editor believing that I was the right person for the job.  Although personally I still believe it's a big conspiracy because people just want to watch me crash and burn.  But I mean if that's the goal just sit me down and make me listen to ""It Won't Rain All The Time"" by Jane Siberry and see what happens.  You know, I'm just doing the whole...""I don't know how I'll ever make it"" thing.  Honestly, I have no idea how I made it through last year.  I had meds for most of that, and that helps.  But still, and especially the 2nd semester the meds started failing and I really stopped doing well.  Looking back it's amazing I passed a couple of my classes and wrote for the paper, and worked, let along finished the year with a not incredibly terrible GPA.  Mind you the lack of structure in that sentence should knock me down a grade point.  Thank goodness this isn't a school project.  My entries are too long, nobody wants to read this stuff.  But there's one story I feel like telling.  I'm working the other day, and this girl comes up, and I know her and she knows me, she's friends with my older sister.  And she wants to buy a chair, it's a cool chair, good for her.  But then this girls sister, who is my age comes in.  Words can never express the contempt I feel for this person.  I went to school with her for 10 years and not once did she make me feel like I was anything even close to human.  I despise her, and I always will.  I suppose it's a good thing I don't consider myself catholic anymore, otherwise I would be forced to forgive her.  I'm sure she's quite the mature and wonderful person now.  I mean we all grow up.  I haven't even talked to her in 8 years, aside from the hello I gave her when she came in the store.  However, sometimes I think people are forgiven too easily for past transgressions.  Or at least it's passed off as ""oh well that's what kids do.  They just need to grow up.""  Do you want to know why I hate guns so much??  It's because I'm afraid of what I would do if there was one in my hand."
THWVU51,male,25,"How pathetic do I feel right now?  Well I don't have an answer for that but certainly I am feeling about the apex of patheticness at the moment.  I got up this morning...key word is morning...but after eating breakfast, I was cold and got under the covers once again and slept until 4.  How absolutely wonderful it is to sleep for so long and to never accomplish anything.  It's almost like my life, with the exception that in most of my life I have been awake when I don't accomplish anything.  And while I'm in this mood I may as well go on about my new theory of how my Dad likes my sisters boyfriend more than he likes me.  I am not saying love here...love is unconditional I know he loves me.  But on Sunday he didn't ask anyone if they wanted more garlic bread, there were three pieces left and he brought them all down and gave one to my sister, one to her boyfriend and the other for himself.  I realise it was just the mood I was in that day but it really bothered me.  He didn't even ask me if I wanted it.  And I did want it too.  Then it seems like I just get looks...and I know what they (my parents) must be thinking, I mean, I've been back for 4 days and haven't done jack shit.  I mean yes my back hurts but that's no excuse to spend the bulk of my time sleeping.  But somehow I need to get the idea of my head that I can hide from the world while sleeping.  Really that's what it's all about is hiding.  When I'm asleep I don't have to think of any of the things that plague me during my waking hours.  It was bascially a guaruntee that I would become depressed after moving.  In the period of adjustment there is always that weakening of my mind and will.  But I really don't want this to happen, I have so many things that need to get done around here...well not just around here, I have alot of stuff that needs to get done.  But the only things I have any attention span for are sleeping and staring at the tv...now that's pathetic!"
THWVU51,male,25,"So.......  So yes apologies for not updating in a long time.  Aside from moving I have been putting it off because I honestly have nothing good to say, and by that I mean I'm likely to write something horribly depressing.  Today is my birthday by the way.  Thank you Dallas for my wonderful card.  I hate birthdays.  Not because of getting older, or anything like that.  Just because it's a day that doesn't warrant celebration.  Although sometimes I think that the fact that I managed to live another year does warrant some form of celebration.  Recently a friend of mine pointed out something about my behaviour.  He said ""Do you think that by trying to make people stay away from you, you are in fact doing the opposite and making them want to know you more.""  I'm paraphrasing, he was more articulate than I am being.  When I think about it, it's a valid point.  I guess I come accross as being mysterious to alot of people, and this is intentional in that I don't like giving alot of myself up to people.  And yet at the same time I am forthcoming with people, but usually only with things that I hope will drive them away from me.  There are few people on earth who know me well.  Indeed even my best friends would not be able to claim that they know me all that well.  Because I do not talk about many things with people.  Subjects that aren't talked about in detail:  1. My Depression 2. My hatred for myself 3. My lack of will to live 4. Severity of depression 5. Suicide 6. My hopes to die everyday  I've got more but you get the idea.  And no, typing those out for all to see provides no catharsis whatsoever.  It honestly makes no difference if people know or not, because everyone offers the same help and nobody really gets it.  Although I fault nobody for that because at least they try, and I can't explain my feelings sometime anyway.  I had a Psycholgist promise to cure my depression.  He doesn't return my calls.  Hahaha, I think I'm too far gone for him.  And as I get older I am actually getting worse.  Time was that I could hide it well enough, I never used to have problems getting up and going to work or whatever.  Now over the past year it's nearly cost me my job because I don't want to get up in the morning to face it.  I had gone to see another Psychologist once and he was absolutely shocked that I had a job, and left my house.  He was also shocked that I was even still alive.  And do you want to know why I am still alive??  Because I have a conscience.  I cannot hurt my family like that.  So I live for them, because it's the only reason I can think of.  I hate being alive.  I hate getting up in the morning.  I hate going to sleep at night.  I hate inhaling, I hate exhaling.  But most of all I hate myself for being this way.  There now you know that I'm nuts :)  So I suggest that you re-evaluate whether or not you truly wish to know me."
THWVU51,male,25,"Why is it that when I try to write bad poetry is turns out great and when I try to write good poetry it sucks.  I'd write it on paper, tear it up and throw it out, but there's no point.  Birds won't even use them in their nests.  How long have I been doing this blog, and I've already stolen like 10 Simpsons jokes.  Matt Groening is gonna have my head."
THWVU51,male,25,"It's been a while since I have posted anything.  I am not sure why that is.  Who wants to read what's on my mind anyways?  I know I don't.  It is always fun trying to live your life resgined to the fact that you can never be anything.  I always see people I know my Dad knows...and would love to say, hello I am Rick Butler's son.  But I don't, and not because I am not proud of my father.  But rather, because I don't want people to lose respect for him because I am the son he had.  Let's face it, I am pretty emberassing.  I have little education, I work a part-time job that I will get fired from more likely than get promoted.  I sleep 12 hours a day, I have no self-esteem and seem hell bent on making sure I never get any.  And I can't change.  What is more pathetic than a lack of ability to change and adapt.    My counsellor doesn't agree with this assesment, but that's easy for someone with an MSW to say.  Living your life just because you love people enough to realise they might miss you if you weren't around is very tiresome.  It really is a good thing I don't take my own feelings into account much because lord knows if I did I would probably be picked out of the harbour by a net and a pool skewer.  I mean really if you look at what I am good at.......the only things I am good at are having no self-esteem, and being pathetic.  Well three cheers for me on accomplishing that much.  Otherwise I seem always to be caught in the in between:  I am too ugly to be attractive, but I am too attractive to be ugly I am to intelligent to be stupid, but I am too stupid to be intelligent I am too straight to be gay, but I am too gay to be straight I am too good to be bad, but I am too bad to be good  I could do that all night but what's the point really...it's not like I am making any sense.  I'm sure many people just think I am being self-depricating for the sake of it.  Alas, no.  For I am self-deprication incarnate, no compliment can pass my walls to attack my self-image.  Pleasant thoughts must be purged forever lest they create a stable mental environment."
THWVU51,male,25,"Get this people I was actually in bed tonight before 1am.  And I don't work tomorrow until 4pm.  That's a rather odd thing to happen.  Of course now it's 1:45am and I have come in here to write and entry on ye ole blog.  Aside from it being Sunday, which seems to be my main update day.  I suppose I was prompted by a couple of things I was reading in bed.  I was reading my book ""Disturbance"" by Jaimie O'Neill, who also wrote ""At Swim, Two Boys"" which I can't possibly rave about enough.  The other was a letter I came accross on a day where I actually unpacked a little.  I found it a while ago but haven't bothered to read it.  I know what it says.  I suppose I didn't want to read it due to how utterly complimentary toward me it is.  And as we know I am not a huge fan of a compliment directed at me.  The letter I recieved last year as a result of the writing I did for the school paper at MSVU.  Sure the guy is probably a crack-pot.  That certainly remains my opinion.  Especially considering his high praise for someone whose grammar skills are  elementary school level at best.  However at the heart of it is the real question.  Am I a good writer??  Aside from my poor grammar of course.  Could I become a good writer??  What would I write about??  What is my voice??  My cat Agatha just spontaneously looked up at me and now wants pets.  I often wonder about animals and the way they read me.  Especially after a certain incident with my now deceased cat Spooky that happened a few years back.  Animals just seem to have that sense.  Truly amazing if you think about it.  Anyhow I have lost focus on this.  I am not sure if any of the questions above are meant as anything besides rhetorical.  But if you feel like answering I'll listen.   urlLink   That's me...although perhaps I will take up this offer to try out the google mail.  Tell me if I should do that too."
THWVU51,male,25,"Going to see a movie tonight.  At least I think I am.  Reviews will follow.  I know this is dated, but anyone who though The Matrix: Reloaded sucked donkey balls say ""aye"".    So let's see....it'll either be the loveable Yeti Sean Connery in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  Or Johnny Depp and uber-hottie Orlando Bloom in Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl.  As long as it's good summer fare I care not.  I am hardly expecting a cinematic masterpiece.  I mean hey, a movie like Demolition Man is only made once in a lifetime.  How that got shut out at the Oscars I have no idea.  Speaking of terrible movies.  I bought Independance Day on DVD today...hooray for bonus features.  Oh well, I never bought it on VHS, so I'm allowed to get it now.  As I am currently too poor to repurchase me VHS collection (not that it's large) on DVD.  I don't think I have anything else to comment on right now.  Talk about sad.  If I wasn't going to pack boxes all night I'd watch the news and write a brilliant response to some story that was on.  Oh yes....and the hands down best use of a cowbell in a song is most defiantely ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" by Blue Oyster Cult.  Just so you know.  Close second award goes to ""Hey Ladies"" by the Beastie Boys.  Man this blog is vapid beyond belief.  Yay."
THWVU51,male,25,"Ah I see how this works.  *Sigh* I am about as computer savvy as a blind lemur, and am equally as likely to jump off cliffs.  So yes what an exciting day.  I went to my parents house as I do on most Sundays, to visit and make use of the free laundry facilities.  My parents are renovating the house and it's coming along nicely.  I ended up moving furniture, which was completely unexpected, and has led me to the epiphany that I had better hit the gym before I move into my new apartment at the end of the month.  My roommates are packing, it's all so very exciting really....I mean it....it's just soooo exciting.  Of course I am aware that I had better start packing lest I leave it to the last minute and break all my stuff.  Of which there is very little.  Does anyone else think that Paul Martin needs to have an anvil dropped on his head?  I know that just comes out of nowhere, but I mean seriously, the guy can't be trusted.  You don't trust someone who is rich to handle your money, they tend not to have a great sense of fiscal responsibility.  Not that I do.  I mean, I eat out more that I sleep it seems so I guess I'm not one to talk.  Stupid bickering roomies...Man, I am going to revell in my own place.  I love these two but they drive me nuts.  If I am ever in a relationship and I act like that someone kill me in an absolutely horrible fashion.  Perhaps force me to listen to Avril Lavigne while forcing me to watch wrestling.  That's a pretty horrible way to go.  OK, I've actually disturbed myself.  Oh well, I will go vomit now and then I'll come up with a plan to write something more intelligent."
THWVU51,male,25,"Let's see now, what time is it?  Ah yes, 4:42pm, and I have been out of bed now for about, well 42 minutes.  I have got to do something about these destructive sleeping habits.  Of course I say that, but I'm not actually going to so I suppose it's a moot point.  It is not like there's anything terribly interesting going on at night.  I usually just sit at the computer, hang out in the chat room, surf around.  Not very exciting stuff.  I really should hang out in the tv room and watch Conan, I haven't watched him in a long time.  I need to finish getting ready so I can go meet up with Laura.  I feel bad because I am not in the mood to spend time outside, and that's what she wants to do.  If it were cloudy and dank I'd be all for it.  I'm not one of those people who gets all cheerful and empowered over the sunshine and warmth.  As usual I am the opposite.  I don't like being outside under the sun and the blue sky anymore, because it is beautiful, and I am not."
THWVU51,male,25,"I guess my last Blog was censored.  I can't say I blame them due to the rather large amount of swearing that I did.  I apologise to the webmasters for that.  And apology...How Canadian of me.  So yeah I don't know what to say.  I feel like I should be dumping alot of stuff on this site, and yet I can't seem to do so.  I'm more empathetic than apathetic of late, I really care what's going on in other people's lives.  As things don't seem to be going to badly for me.  Although I have realised that I have screwed up a could of things big time, and once I come down from my high I am bound to punish myself for it.  But I digress.  For those of you who don't know, I guess I'm dating someone.  The reason I say I guess it because I find it hard to believe he wants to go out with me.  I mean, to me anyway...he seems at least superficially to be way out of my league.  Although time may teach me otherwise.  I do really like him, and I really hope this one goes somewhere.  I haven't met too many people (at least not in a romantic sense) who make me smile when I simply think of them.  Weird eh??  I don't really remember what it's like to be enamoured, it really only happened once before, and I am far removed from that feeling.  But anyways I shouldn't really talk about it much.  Because things are just starting out and things could change very quickly, very quickly indeed."
THWVU51,male,25,"I don't actually know what the word firmament means.  It is simply the title of a song by Dar Williams.  I suppose I should look it up before using it to describe something, but I don't own a dictionary, so I guess I'm stuck.  And I don't think that saying ""man that guys ass if firmament"" is correct usage.  This being my first post I suppose I should write something of myself.  So that way if anyone was actually reading this they could follow along comfortably and understand what on earth I am talking about.  First things first:  If you are going to follow this site keep in mind I have no life so you will likely be able to look in every couple of weeks and not miss anything.  But I suppose you never know perhaps ranting over the internet will become my new favourite passtime.  My name is Dane, I am 23, I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I was born and raised here etc.  I am gay, I likes men etc.  Perhaps I'll discuss that later who knows.  I like sports, I like movies where things get blown up, ditto for video games.  I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series because nothing is more cathartic than hacking hundreds of people to death.  I am manic-depressive, but I get by.  I am currently a student at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax.  I wrote for the school paper ""Jargon"" this past year focusing on being editor of a section on 'Sexuality'.  This coming year I will be co-editor of the paper and will continue to write about sex and sexuality as it is something I am interested in.  Moreso academically than in practice, honestly.  I don't enjoy sex all that much and don't tell me it's because I've never been with anyone good because believe me that's not the case.  Oh and I should mention that my grammar sucks.  Taking two and a half years off school tends to weaken some of those skills.  But hopefully in time it'll all come back to me and my nightmare of red marks all over my essays will end.  Damn comma splices, I hate them so much.  So anyhow.  I am a huge fan of The Simpsons.  Indeed I love cartoons, especially Saturday morning cartoons from the 80's, and many of the modern sitcom animated shows.  Everyone write to MTV to make sure the produce another season of ""Clone High"".  That's a great great show.  Well that's me in a nutshell I guess.  There'll be more to tell I'm sure, and all of it as equally boring as this."
THWVU51,male,25,"Speaking of DVD's, why is the stuff I want so damned expensive.  I mean, hello, the Star Trek series dvd's are like $150 per season.  Plus I would love to get all of the Dr. Who stuff.  I need to find a way to make some money.  It's a shame I know nothing about html programming, otherwise I could just start a crummy porn site and get cash from silly horny people who buy memberships without thinking with the upper brain.  Hmmm that's got me thinking.  There is much to do.  Or actually not do, but I'm trying to make you think I am doing it.  I suppose I'm ruining it by telling you.  Oh well."
THWVU51,male,25,"I was trying to make a nice pastel work for my friend, because I owe it to him...let's just say my first effort has turned out a miserable failure.  And I'm not being overly harsh either, I know a little something about miserable failure after all.    ""Yeah and now I'm runnin' down this camp town drive, with your laughter in my head, and I'll have to block it out some how to survive.  Cause those dreams a dre dead, and I'm alive""   That's from a very very good Jackson Browne song called ""I'm Alive""...taken out of context that sounds really depressing eh.  Of course I think I have the camp town drive part wrong I'm not sure what kind of drive he says he's going down.  Rest assured that drive is correct though.  I mean, really probably the most depressing song for me to hear is Duncan Sheik's ""Reasons for Living"" which is a song that I usually only listen to if I feel an overwhelming need to cry...and please keep in mind that crying can be cathartic is doesn't have to be a bad thing.  ""Even my wonder, even my fear.  Only amount to a couple of tears.  There is a rythm, it's near and it's far and it goes to the heart of us.  It's already in you, it's already there.  You may disagree but I don't really care...""  Of course I haven't unpacked my CD's so I can't find the CD inlay to get the lyrics and I'm not in the mood to find them on the net.  Well I will but I'm not gonna post it here...nuts to that.  haha....oh Burton Cummings...hahahaha...fine state of affairs...is a great song just so everyone knows."
THWVU51,male,25,"Some one explain to me what the hell just happened.  I was innocently searching for jobs, when all of a sudded the life was sucked out of me.  I have been in a good mood.  But it has floated away, as though it was only a vestige that had briefly taken refuge within my mind.  I need to get a new job, or a second job.  But what am I going to get.  I am not qualified for anything really, and potential employers don't look at how capable you are to do a certain job.  I like that sentence because at least it implies I do believe I am capable of something.  I try so hard to be able to help others through their insecurities.  It's hard for me to do it, having plenty of my own to deal with.  But that gives me a good insight on what other people have to work with.  Which is why I can safely tell people to pull their heads out of their asses and smell the fresh air.  Guess what folks??  You've got talents.  How unfortunate for you that you can't live in this dream world where you are useless, and going nowhere.  That world doesn't exist.  You live in the real world.  Where if you wanted to accomplish something, you have the tools to do it.  But of course, you'll never believe what I say.  You'll just continue to make small obstacles into gigantic life movement blocking structures of complacency.  And I know what you're thinking...I'm a big fucking ass hypocrite for saying all this shit about others and not myself.  Well guess what??  I love my friends and family...but they don't see the things that are lacking in me.  And there are many many things.  I don't possess the life skills to go far, not right now anyway.  I have no skills to get another job that is better than what I have.  And even if I did, I likely don't have the dedication to do it.  I don't want any of you to think you are being singled out here.  Over the past few days I have had similar conversations with at least 4 people.  With talk of ""lack of accomplishment"" etc.  Well what you define as accomplishment and what others may see you have accomplished are two different things.  Personally I feel that anyone I know who has fallen in love, regardless of whether they fell out of it has accomplished a great deal.  It is certainly more than I have done.  To me the idea of making over 20,000 dollars a year is a pipe dream.  I'll always say that I don't want to argue about who has the worst issues.  I am working on mine, and I feel that if you have similar issues you need to work on them.  The sooner the better, hopefully before you get to the point where I am.  Which is essentially my last ditch effort to save myself.  Well i think I have gone on long enough and not really done much except possibly offend some friends.  Which is never my intention.  Nor do I wish to make them think they can't talk to me about these things.  You really can.  I am a good friend, or at least I try to be.  It's about the only thing that I do try to do well."
THWVU51,male,25,"I should have packed today but I didn't.  Oh well, I'm sure I'll get it done.  I'm still waiting to hear from my new landlords about movie in time.  Here's hoping I can move in the same day I leave here, the 31st I hope.    I ordered my new computer (as the one I have written all this on isn't mine), which will hopefully arrive Aug. 2nd.  And since I am not entirely clear on what my new address is it's being shipped to my parents house.  Which is only 5 minutes drive away from me anyway.  But without knowing the address I can't get an appointment with eastlink to set up my phone cable and internet.  And even if I made an appointment I can't be sure when the computer is coming.  Shipping is supposed to be two weeks, and I placed the order Tuesday.  I am looking forward to my move, or at least the move being over with.  It's way too hot in this apartment and it's interfering with not only my comfort level, but my sleeping pattern as well.  I could probably be sleeping right now, but instead I'm writing here.  So I guess if there's anyone who may need to call me next weekend it's unlikely I'll be availabe...I can still check my email at a couple different places.  I'll likely hang at my parents, as I need to sort through alot of my old stuff that's still sitting in their house.  Let's see...today is July 27 (my time it is anyway)...I turn 24 in 2 weeks.  Time to put myself out to pasture, because I'm an old mule."
THWVU51,male,25,"Oops not writing enough.  Over the course of the past few days I have come up with many great things to write about.  But now, as the time comes to write, I've got nothing.  This is like writing an exam or something.    If I were to test the people who know me, I would bet the results wouldn't be very good.  Although I'm also willing to bet that I would fail a test on myself as well.  What is this drivel I spewing?  Apparently I'm in moos to be cyclical.  That's no fun.    So allow me to pose a philosophical question.  If I am my own worst enemy.  How do I fight myself?  I know all my tricks, I know all my moves, and all my arguments.  So how do I do it?  I'd like to know...but then once I know how, I won't be able to pull it off because ""I'll"" know."
THWVU51,male,25,"I lost a blog in here somewhere.  Well that is to say the last one I wrote seems to have disappeared.  I'm sure it was my fault but it still upsets me.  So I went to see Return of The King tonight.  It was great, I could nitpick about the story changes forever but I don't because it works anyway.  As most people know I find Elijah Wood to be super duper attractive.  But really there is a more existential reason for my like of him.  Don't get me wrong, I find him sexy, I respect his acting ability, and enjoy his personality in interviews.  But it's those eyes of his.  I look in his eyes and I can see my salvation, not as in my salvation is Elijah Wood.  Moreso that they are windows into wonder.  I feel when I look that somewhere I can shake my burdens, where all is well and I am happy.  I know it sounds strange.  That's because it is.  But the feeling always fades when those big blue pools aren't there to gaze into.  The clouds move in and it's impossible to see clearly again.  Man I hope he doesn't read this, I'm making myself sound like a big ole freak.  How very un-Christmasy I feel right now.  How very lost I am.  I guess you could say I feel like the sword that was broken, and I am waiting for the Elves to reforge me.  But alas, since Elves aren't real, I suppose I will remain shattered."
THWVU51,male,25,"Oh man I don't feel good right now.  Laura nad I went to Vortex on Saturday night.  She was sick on Sunday, apparently Adam isn't feeling great and I can assure everyone right now that I am also not feeling great.  I haven't thrown up or anything yet, but the operative word is yet.  This sickness will delay my writing about the story of running into the first boy I ever had a crush on.  Because I just can't sit here, I need to go lay down.  But I will say, that since I am sick I needed something better to watch than tv so I rented two movies.  I haven't watched the second one yet...but as for the first I'll just say I need to stop renting weird gay movies from Europe.  Bizarre!!!"
THWVU51,male,25,Why did Fox cancel 'Futurama'.  Those morons!  Season two DVD set in stores now.
THWVU51,male,25,"I still have no power.  But I'm sure it'll be coming soon.  And yes once again I could allude to the fact that not having power can be taken in more than one way...but once again let us go for the literal sense.    I cast a magic spell to allow myself this brief time to update my blog.  Indeed I am a powerful sorceror, conjuror if you will.  They call me Granger the master of Gray Magic.  At least they do in my head.  Damn I just realised that I need a number that I left at the apartment...I also have no phone service...and I should probably call and confirm the appointment that I have on Monday...oops...oh well there's still time.  Anyhow gotta go for now...yes yes...but I'll be back....yesss precious....I'll be back."
THWVU51,male,25,"The thought just occured to me that perhaps I really do need to move home.  I have no doubt that things will start to turn around soon anyway.  But perhaps adding that safety net of ever present unconditional love will aid the process.  Of course there are many things which would have to take place.  I would have to inform my landlord of course.  I am not bound to a lease here, but they were kind enough to give me this apartment, and I am not out to betray that trust/kindness.  But on the other hand, perhaps I need to start being a little more selfish, and deciding what will make my life better.  Then of course, Mom and Dad would have to say yes.  And it is fair to say that most of my stuff would have to go into storage, and I would be happy to pay for that in place of the rent I am paying here.  It was just a thought I had.  In fact I have it alot.  Part of me just doesn't want to admit that my old psychologist was right.  That I am better off at home.  It is true that I hate being in the environment where people do things for me.  But I also hate being in the environment where I have all the control, it is because of that that I have spent the past 72 hours holed up in here fearing to go outside and to have to face people.  Aside from getting horribly unhealthy food I have stayed in, slept the long days, ate the awful meals, frustrated at my inability to stop myself, and yet pleased that I am succeeding in my own destruction.  Are there two me's, I sometimes think to myself.  Are there more?  What is it like to have more than one personality?  Must they both manifest in ways that are obvious to other people?  I'm not a psychology student.  I have no idea.  When you sit alone at 4am thinking these things, there must be something truly wrong with you.  I live out every day hoping that that one event will happen, that one thing that will change everything for me.  Of course life doesn't work that way.  Epiphany's are hard to come by, especially for those who seem to not want to have one.  Paradox, you say?  Well perhaps, although likely not in the truest meaning of the word.  But since I don't know the truest meaning of the word I can use it in this way.  So I call myself a paradox, either because I believe it to be true or because I think the word sounds cool.  One of the two.  The first thing that any counsellor or psychologist or what have you will ask you is ""How long have you felt this way?""  To which I answer always.  Or at least as long as I have memory, but it has been getting worse as I get older.  The follow up question is usually ""Why do you think you feel this way?""  To which I respond I don't know.  Because I truly don't know.  I hardly have the right to be this way, nothing particularly tragic has ever happened to me.  I don't know how I became this way, and I don't know why, and if I did know why...why on earth would I be seeking counselling trying to find the answer to that question.  More inane ramblings.  I'm trying to figure out if I should just stay up all night or should go to sleep and set my alarm early as though I were just going for a nap.  The problem there is that I know what will happen if I go to sleep.  I will set my alarm, and it will wake me up, and I will simply get up and turn it off and crawl back to bed, after having reset it for the time I need to be up to go to work.  And it will go off again, and I will turn it off, and I will rest my eyes, and low and behold I'll wake up with only 20 minutes to get to work on time.  That is what happens.  I am so predictable.  My eyes feel tired but that might be only from looking at this screen.  I slept for a very long time yesterday.  And there are things I need to do, and if I try to sleep, I'll end up doing none of them."
THWVU51,male,25,Ooops...I meant to put my email address in the last post.   joes_mon@hotmail.com  there ya go.
THWVU51,male,25,"For those that would like to know I now have power.  It finally came back on tonight almost a full 10 days after it first went out.  Thank goodness for family and friends with power, because I can only stand the sound of my brain so long.  Nevertheless the hurricaine was good for me it would seem.  If I may be so selfish as to say so.  Almost as if my own storm had passed.  Of course there is much I need to get sorted out, and a couple of hard things to decide and to say to people.  The other thing I would like to note as I write this, is that this is the happiest I have felt in as long as I can remember.  I don't know what it is, but for some reason all day...or most of it anyways I have felt comfortable in my own skin as you might say.  That was one of the questions the psychologist asked me on Monday, ""How comfortable do you feel in your own skin?"".  Interesting question eh?  I thought it was.  I constantly fidget, whether I am calm or nervous I can't sit still unless I am holding myself in some way, arms crossed, legs crossed etc.  Anyhow I thought that was interesting.  A girl at work asked me today ""What's with you tonight."" and I said ""I guess you could almost say I'm happy, if I'm cured somehow I'll probably be like this all the time.  Do you think I'm acting weird.""  She said ""No it's just nice to see you this way.""  And it probably is, for those who are witness to my day to day stupor the happy me must be a stark contrast.  I'm practically dancing a merry jig right now.  It won't last, I know that...it will probably reset in the morning.  But I want to mark the date, so that I will know at least, that it's possible for me to step out of my shadow and to feel the light on my skin."
THWVU51,male,25,"I suppose you're all wondering where I got the name for this blog.  Well perhaps not but I'll tell you anyhow.  One day while feeling disallusioned, as I am apt to do, I made up a second hotmail address because I was going to use it for junk mail and such.  That never did happen and I'm sure that account has closed.  During this time I was a student at St. Mary's University in Halifax, which is essentially the capital of the generic.  I have never been anywhere that I felt more left out than while attending SMU.  And since is seemed as though my uniqueness was something to be ashamed of I tried to remain a cog in the gritty machine.  This of course did alot more harm than good for me.  Now I have had a theory for a number of years of: ""Unique in mind, not in body.""  That is not to say that I look down upon people who take it upon themselves to look different on the outside.  Far from it.  My belief is simply that for me, I can be very a unique person who thinks differently from the majority and still look like an unassuming dork.  Who needs crazy piercings and tattoos when you have thought?    I still often feel as though the 'majority rulez' as I don't seem to fit in anywhere.  And indeed I guess I can say that I subscribe to the theory that sheep go to heaven and goats go to hell.  Goats being people who are different.  Bla bla bla...it's also a great song by the band Cake.  Do I believe the majority always rulez??  No.  However with all the pressure in our society for people to ""fit in"", it can certainly be a big factor in peoples lives."
THWVU51,male,25,"Let's play a little game shall we?  I have been making tallies of a couple of different things over the past few days at work.  Your job will be to guess the acromym for what I have been observing.  I am not giving any hints right now.  However you can ask for one through email, or post a message.  However you must ask it in a form such as ""are any of the words not english?"" or something to that affect.  It's sort of a Front Page challenge thing.  The first 2 days I only did the 1st group the OGG.  So here are the stats.  Fri. shift: 4pm-12 OGG=17  Sat. shift: 11-5 OGG=34  Mon. shift 3-12 OGG=30                 GLB=61  Wed. shift 630am-12 OGG=1                     GLB=14  Thurs. shift 10-5 OGG=15                   GLB=32  Now I will say this much; The two groups can potentially relate, and the may be counted in more than one category.  Meaning that when I tally something as an OGG, I may also tally it as a GLB although that's only happened a couple times.  Notice that the time of day also has an affect on the stats, and that Saturdays number of OGG's was highest.  So...guess the acromym, play along, it'll be fun :) For me at least.  And I deserve a bit of fun.  email is joes_mon@hotmail.com by the way, if you don't have it."
THWVU51,male,25,"As Nat said, ""this blog is far too self-depricating"".  Well that it is my friends.  Which never seems to be my intention, but does always seem to be the result.  So is this one going to be different?  Not as far as I know.  But we'll see how it ends shall we?  One of the reasons I guess I have been so slack when it comes to unpacking is as follows;  I don't like to be reminded of what my life is.  Or for that matter who I am.  I don't like to be reminded of my uselessness.  Even though I go to bed every night and tell myself I am useless regardless.  So I know, if I feel I am unaccomplished I should go out and do somethign about it.  Well, things are not that easy.  Or maybe they are.  It's not like I have tried anything.  I realise this Blog tends to get more personal than I ever meant it to be.  I suppose that's because I have a hard time talking about this stuff with even my best friends face to face.  Not that I necessarily want to.  But at least this way if you want to know the inner workings of my mind you may occasionally catch a glimpse.  It's hardly Babylon I know.  If only the things that other people saw in me were actually there.  What a person that would make me.  But nobody can live life in ""if only's"".  ""If Only's"" are basically regrets.  But also, in a way, we all need to have our regrets.  Do I ever make any sense???  Am I even capable of making sense???  Can I ever use less than three question marks???"

1E4S6QW,female,25,"So...  The weekend is over. How was it for you girls?  whimsy: It sure was scary that we went into a drinking rampage. We literally went straight to the bar, ordered our bottle and slosh it all down in a wink! *blink blink*  i'm proud to say that i still got up for the driving range session, plus swimming, plus Paulo's exhibition and finally berber's screening of her film.  berber: from what i could see, i thought you did great in the film! you looked hot!  Many people asked me what I thought of the film that night. I couldn't really answer.  My viewing experience wasn't right to start off with. I was kinda disappointed with the set up. It was a fantastic venue with the right elements but if only the organisers had the brains to removed those balloons that were sticking out and blocking everyone's views. Perhaps, put in a little more effort to make the sound system sounding right and adjust the projection so that the constrast was set right?  Everyone could then watch the film and appreciate it rather than trying to figure out what they have missed. :p it's just uncomfortable for me to see that. I would have expect that they would have got that covered since they're from a production background.  Overall, I did feel that the film was light hearted and there were many funny parts that almost made me fall off my chair. So, for those of you who didn't make it to the screening, berber's got the dvd version. you should go watch it!!  astro: last night was really nice and chilled. sushhhiiii anytime babe! anyway, would really love to see your pictures from calcutta.

Astrologically, the Blue Moon this July 31st occurs in the idealistic sign of Aquarius, opposite the Sun on its annual summer journey through passionate Leo. At the same time, Neptune, the planet of dreams, is cozying up to that Aquarian Blue Moon, adding imagination, illusion and inspiration to the timing of this rare event. So dream big... but don't let Neptune sweep you completely off your feet!                plan something romantic with your love ones for this friday!    the moon shall be on our sides..."

1E4S6QW,female,25,"Asking a Guy Out      by Mark Sullivan    Men definitely like it when women ask them out. What's not to like? But before you get busy with your phone and address book, there are a few things you should know.   For starters, a part of the guy will wonder if you've called him up because you want to have sex with him. Guys are generally hoping to have sex whenever they go on a date, so this probably won't mean he'll behave any different, but you might want to set some limits early on. (Unless that is why you called him.)   Also, be prepared for lots of dating gray areas: Who'll drive? Who'll pay? Who'll decide where to go? The impetus is generally on the guy to control the flow of events on a date, but since you initiated things, how far will the initiative extend? Ideally, this will be part of the fun, but it can lead to baffled expectations on both sides.   Another thing to consider is something guys have been dealing with since time began: The answer might be no."
1E4S6QW,female,25,"was rather good. :)      after watching a movie, dinner, and pool with val till past midnight, ngak and i went on to hangout at the middle road muslim food centre (middle earth) for teh tarik and some crappy prata. to my surprise, he suggested getting some beer from 7-11 if i could hangout abit more. it was raining, quite heavily too - but off we went, splashing through unsheltered junctions along the way. after corona and wild turkey were purchased, we parked ourselves on some metal chairs and a glass table outside a quiet hotel just opposite hotel81. the going-on's at hotel81 proved quite entertaining... we could see everyone going in and coming out. heh... the most dodgy ones were this buncha ""queens"" with one angmoh dude. 3 of them, very hot... but when we heard their voices drifting across to us across the road - woah.      so anyways, we talked. about everything under the sun. and sometime in the middle of it all, he asked if he could ask me a personal question.      ""well, quite a number of people have been telling me this... is it true that u have a thing for me?""      i laughed and said, ""who told u? how come so many people know?""      he couldn't quite remember exactly who, but nick and lina were included. i've never told nick or lina but i know that they would know. they woulda seen telltale signs. and they're both smart people. and they've seen ngak and i stay back late so often... besides, from the things that nick says, i already knew that nick knows. besides them, val has also told him the same thing.      then he carried on to say, ""actually, i have a thing for u too.""      i said, ""really?"" and just smiled. all this time he was quite bashful, and would only look at me once in awhile. though after this, he managed to look me in the eye and smile. then after a beat or two, he said, ""but u do know my stand, right?""      ""yeh, sally told me about it. ""      ""well, there's more to it actually."" and he went on to explain that his previous (many) relationships have kinda ended the same way, and that the problem lies with him. none of the relationships he's had lasted more than one year. it seems to be a pattern happening all the time, and he doesn't want the same thing to happen again. so he's gonna try and change himself before going into anything with anyone.  ""u're not disappointed or anything, are u?""      ""nah, we'll just see how things go.""      and he seemed happy with that answer.       we went on to talk till 6+am. i always seem to be doing crazy, irrational things with him around. sigh. before we parted, our goodbye hug felt tighter than usual. as i closed the door of the cab, he was beaming at me while peering in the window.      i went home, had a shower and went to work. it's amazing how i got through the day. i think a main factor which kept me up was the knowledge that he does like me too. :) at least now i know that he's not being nice to me just because he's the same with all the girls. and i feel much better now that he knows, and i know... and everything's out in the open.      i managed to convince my graphic designer kamil to share a cab home with me come 6pm. already started dozing in the cab... reached home at 7pm, my brother was in the shower so i went to lie down first. guess what? i slept all the way through to 3am, still in my office clothes. ate some leftover dishes (left for me) and went back to sleep till 930am. called in sick. then slept till about an hour ago. i think i will go sleep somemore in abit...      well, so the plan is to keep hanging out whenever, and see how it goes... :)"

1E4S6QW,female,25,"I was harassed by a weird-ass shit-face monkey...     Sitting in KLCC, having my sashimi lunch and sipping my green tea away, I was waiting for Craig to swing by KL to pick me up to Singapore.  Oblivious to people around me, I was totally relaxed and deep in thoughts till this shit-face, dirty looking young dude approached me and asked if he could sit in the next table.     It was strange.  There were a gazillion of tables at that cafe and this dude has to pick the one beside me!!!!     ""May I take this table?"" he asked.     I shrugged and nodded.  What else could I say?     He sat down, shuffles around a bit, turned to me again and asked, ""May I have your number?  Oei!  Your number!  Can I have your number!""  ""Oei! Oee! Number number!""     At first I thought I was hearing things cos he was kind of soft.  Shaking my head, I motioned him to go away.     He left.     But not for long.     He came back... This time, he didn't asked if he could join me or to take that table, he just sat down beside me and looked at me from head to toe.     and he whispers ""Hey, your number.  give me your number lah... oei""     I asked the waiter for help.     But this dude in turn asked the waiter to bring him a coke.  As a paying customer, the waiter couldn't ask him to leave.     I got to give it to him.  He's got some brains.     Anyway, he took his time to drink his coke while whispering to me.     I could have left that cafe but I just didn't think I should be the one leaving,  I liked that spot so, I just completely ignored him.     I drew a sketch of him on my notebook.  Occasionally he looked over my shoulders.     When I was done, I smiled, flashed the sketch to him and I told him that I'll bring it to the police.       He ran off.     I don't know if it's my sketch that was that horrendous or he panicked cos I'd mentioned the police.     Oh well.... *Shrugs*"

1E4S6QW,female,25,"astro sweetie, that must have been an extremely interesting experience for u. aren't u glad u found out more, and that he was actually willing to spill the beans on his dating status? at least he was honest about it... i've met men who have purposefully concealed their status just to source for unwittingly willing participants in their game of bastardry. oh believe me, there are so many of these scumbags around. although his behaviour to your mutual friend which is causing her distress is another matter altogether...  but alas, i am by nature a schizophrenic, even at times multiple schizoid. i believe there is no absolute in everything and anything, yet certain things are very concrete to me. all men are bastards.. but some of them are less so than the others. u gotta admit there is a bitch in everyone of us, right? ;)  of course, it is much better to be a bitch than a bastard. anyway.  my friends have always marvelled at my ability to bounce back from everything that has ever happened to me. being jaded doesn't mean i stop trusting people. i kinda just wipe my databank out and start afresh. flick a switch in my head. when i get over something, or someone, that whole episode is not only closed, but almost certainly deleted from my mind. coldhearted? perhaps. but it is my defense mechanism and it keeps me sane.  sometimes i feel sad about something which has happened many months ago. which means i did not completely throw it out of my head, left remnants to rot and grow, and let it resurface again. it's a good thing this seldom happens.   no regrets - i live by it.  *** this weird post was inspired by the mention of bastards ***"

1E4S6QW,female,25,"Extracted this from   urlLink   www.romanceclass.com           What is a Crush?      Crushes are sort of easy entry-ways into the world of strong emotions and relationships, without having much of the scary risk involved in really dating someone.         People have crushes on their teachers, on actors, on band members, on scout leaders or pastors...       A crush involves admiring someone from a safe distance. You feel a hugely powerful emotion, stronger than anything you've felt before. You obsess over this person. You would die for them. You think about them constantly. You are thrilled when you are near them and miserable when you are away from them. You desperately want to tell the person how you feel - but are frightened of it at the same time.     If you're involved in a crush - enjoy it! We have ALL had crushes over the years and they're something you look back on with great fondness. Look at what makes your crush special. Those qualities that you admire in your crush are qualities that are very special to you, and it's very important to learn what those are. It helps you when you look for a real boyfriend or girlfriend to date, to know what you are drawn to.     Also, learn how to handle your feelings. Most of what a crush is about is learning that you get POWERFUL emotions in relationships - and that you need to deal with them. Just like you learned in earlier years how to deal with strong anger and strong sadness, you're now learning how to deal with strong feelings of attraction. You're learning that it's a nice feeling - but that it's a painful feeling if you let it take over your life. You need to be able to balance those feelings with the rest of what is going on in your world.     As hard as it might seem right now, your feelings for your crush will even out over time. It usually takes a few weeks to a few months, but you will learn to bring them under control. And as you learn more about life, you will find someone that is your own age, and actually someone you can *date* to start to become interested in. When that's the case, you can work to be their friend, and then their best friend. And it's at that point that your interests change from a crush to a real, meaningful relationship.          Oh no, will I survive even a few days???"
1E4S6QW,female,25,"urlLink   If you work in a office building, you'll share a communal toilet with different companies on the same level.   I'm not too sure about you but I do have a favourite cubicle I'll always use. It's closest to the window so that my ciggarette smoke could be aired.   Recently, in my visits to the toilet, there's this wasp flying in and out the window and into my cubicle, scaring the shits out of me while I'm doing what I need to do.   This is a female wasp.  Meaning, it comes with a stinger! Many times I had to blow my ciggarette smoke at it to scare it away.   And this wasp was persistent.  It's always there when I'm there.   I found out early last week the reason why she was there.  She had formed a tiny combed nest inside the toilet paper dispenser.  Today, I've found out that it has grown bigger!   Oh how many times have I reached in to pull paper from that dispenser!   Not wanting to scare any of you.. but here's a picture of how it looks like.                  urlLink"

1E4S6QW,female,25,"It's hard to really sum up a place like Calcutta.   Nobody seems to go there for a holiday. In five days, i only saw a handful of overseas volunteers, seven british airways stewardesses and the odd wandering backpacker.   What you see is alot of poverty and filth. Assaulting your senses constantly are the stench, the blaring horns and most of all, the dreary landscape. the monsoon made it even more depressing - sloshy, muddy and muggy. The humid air made it hard to breathe. At every corner, there were the homeless lying on cardboard sheets and kids begging with eyes wide open with hunger.   I went to calcutta with three journalists, one photographer and two organisers. In our  bubble of aircon, we were driven to the slums everyday to visit former prostitutes and children of sex workers. It's hard to imagine who could live in the dirty wet hovels i saw.  For the first two days, I threw myself headlong into getting The Story. My editors reminded me again and again i had to get it no matter what. And so i did.   Initially, I felt numb to everything there. Basically, I recorded whatever i listened or saw, like a documentary maker. But after doing my job, it all sank in. Dangerous and unforgiving, this place has hardly any love for those who struggle.   I talked to a couple of former prostitutes and their stories were truly tragic. They all say they have no family but it's actually because they don't want to contact them ever again. They were sold into it by people who were supposed to love and care for them. It seems you can't trust anyone, not even your own family.  Virgin sex workers are most prized and go for as high as 10, 000 rupees (S$500). that's alot of money in india, i was told. if you're an old prostitute, you're only worth five rupees a session. Barely enough for some bread and dahl!   There's a huge fear of AIDS in india  so child prostitues are in great demand. the men who visit the brothels range from bureaucrats to cab drivers.  They even have these wickedly painful contraptions to stretch these girls' vaginas to make sex less painful for the men. What?! How about the pain these girls go through?   The red light district flashed glaring eyes at us foreigners toting our cameras but really, it hid tales of extreme pain and sorrow. we were strongly discouraged to visit india's biggest and most famous red light district - Sonagochi. Completely run by the mafia, we were told if we go there, they'll send us running back home with our balls in our mouths.   Though it was hard going emotionally, i was inspired by the counsellors over there who were passionate about helping these underserved people. I was there to help too and it made it easier.   Having said all this, I'll do it again. And again. There was the thrill of danger and excitement, plus it felt like meaningful work. I don't think my articles on relationships and men really have an effect on people, but hopefully, this one will make a difference..."

I met a stranger whom i thought was an interesting personality. okay, i was fighting with a certain significant other and needed a distraction.   He was sparkly, well travelled, witty, charming, adventurous, mysterious, silly, intense, bohemian.....the list goes on. I was told he was sooooo nice and amazing. I didn't think he was hot cos he's not your typical gorgeous Adonis, but his personality more than made up for it. I was wondering why this rare find only had one girlfriend all his life!  i thought - either he has the small dick complex or highly dangerous.The first meeting intrigued me and i set up a second to see if there were other sides to this seemingly fascinating creature...  But alas, more talk revealed he was seeing a mutual friend. And this friend could have possibly confided in me about him before! Believe me, she was very troubled. Maybe she could've been seeing someone else, but my gut feeling tells me otherwise because of what SHE revealed to me about this certain someone. After more beer flowed, i found out he was seeing somebody else AND her a few months ago. You really can't tell maaaan. They should put an X on dangerous boys' foreheads...   Boo, you're right about being the buddy. When guys really tell you what's going on, it really makes you wonder...are all men bastards? These guys are cool and great to hang out with. They're sweet and lovely people but how they deal with women can be so f***ed up!  What a turn off. But he's cool as a buddy. And i doubt he's short on a certain body part.  The dating game can be so perilous....:S"

1E4S6QW,female,25,"i have been prodded (very hard) by my darling co-blogmistress boo to word in further detail about my recent juicy encounter...   sigh.   ok, well. ummm. not sure where to start but anyways, the current situation now - him and i are now still friends. getting closer, but not quite THERE yet. when we're hanging out together, it feels reaaaally good. he'd be really attentive, he shows concern like a bf would. one night when we hungout in a group all night, he never left my side. and we were leaning on each other all night despite a bunch of friends being all around us. but then everyone was quite drunk... so.   when we get asked to go somewhere, he'd turn to me and ask, ""are u going? if u're not going, then i'm not"". and he stuck with me till 11am the next day because i had to come to work.   i do like him alot. despite him being 3 years younger than me and is a musician who sings for his supper.   ok, so things are great when we meet up. but when we dont, he doesnt seem to initiate meeting up very much. well, ok he's done it once (last thurs) but i wasn't free. but i did suggest next thurs (this thurs ie). and besides that, he's been pretty low-key.   i'm pretty sure he's on my mind more than i'm on his. :P not good huh?   i can go rambling on about this... but not much really juicy bits to let on so far.... we're only at the hug-goodnight stage ok? i do like hugging him very much. does that count?   :)"

4GG3WMN,male,26,"Internet connection was out lastnight.  I don't have a clue why, but it's been acting a little shaky recently.  So, no post from last night.  *boo-hoo*  I've finally finished ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and am glad I can move on to the next book.  It's taking a while, but I'm slowly moving through it (the trilogy).  I went to the park tonight to play my guitar on the steps by the waterfall.  I always liked going there at night because it's so calm and peaceful.  Several people later walking by gathered 'round and sat and listened, complimenting every so often when I'd pause for a moment.  Of course, as always, underage girls tried their womanly wiles on me, but fifteen will get you twenty, if you understand.  However, I did realized that I'm no longer in Tuscaloosa, and the talent of the local guitarists is MUCH lower here.  So, it was nice to hear what they had to say, but it was more fun just playing my Takamine with the fishies.  I fgure I should play/practice a little more often now that I'm teaching.  It can sometimes be a little frustrating trying keep up with three instruments when your spare time is being devoted more to reading and writing.  Thus, I've decided to go to the park a little more often to play since that's where I feel most at home around here.  Looking at least five years younger than you are has great disadvantages before the youthful old age sets in.  It was nice when I looked five years older...  Maybe I'll never age.  Woohoo!"
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Started ""The Two Towers"" and sent my first offical letter to someone from the Peace Corps last night.  I've come to the full realization that I can go wherever I want.  I'm finished with schooling (at east for now), and all I'm limited to is where I'm willing to work and live.  The Peace Corps has definitely become a big option right now.  I'll be living the dream my mother and sister both wanted, as well as myself, if I do move forward with it.  If you pray, keep it in your prayers for me!"
4GG3WMN,male,26,"My little nephew gets his allergy test shots around 2:00 PM, and I get to be the bad guy to hold him down for it.  My sis' doesn't want to be the one he thinks back on as contributing to his bodily harm, so she gets her brother who absolutely hates needles in the first place.  It's not the poking and prodding, but that there is a foreign object being thrust into the body.  It's just not natural.  It may not hurt much at all, but it looks as odd to me as a three-eyed fish.  There just shouldn't be something forced through the body like that.  Ick.  So, I play the bad guy for a while, and then I head off to teach all afternoon and evening at the studio.  I picked up another piano student and, more importantly, a new drum student.  Booyah.  I've picked up twenty students in one month.  Pretty sweet for now, but I hope to double that.  I'll add another six or so at Madison Academy, and I'll pick up a little more cash that way because I'll be working for myself instead of a studio.  That'll be nice.  I haven't been writing much in the past week.  Moving took its toll on my momentum, and I've been doing more reading in place of it.  Currently reading ""The Legend of Bagger Vance.""  I saw the movie and loved it.  Now I'm reading the book it was based on, and of course, it's different.  However, there are exact lines and scenes used, but the story is very different by design.  I'm half through the book now, and I hope to have it finished in my spare time this week.  It's only about 280 pages, so it's not bad at all, and it's easy reading.  Next I'm going to hit up ""The Hobbit,"" followed by ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  Yes, I'm finally going to read them.  Gettin' excited."

Yes, I will update this more often when that happens.  No, I will not have time to do all the writing I want to do.  T-town has flipped upside down, and I'm so far out of the loop it's frightening.  I kinda like it that way.  Makes me feel special."

4GG3WMN,male,26,"Sinus infections hinder my teaching ability.  Had one for the past two days and I've finally broken down and taken a single pill of medicine for the first time in a great while.  Have to work at both the pharmacy and the studio tomorrow, and I don't think I'm going t be able to do much of anything for Halloween aside from watching scary movies.  I may not even be able to do any kind of costuming.  That stinks.  I put the deposit down on the apartment today and should start moving in on Saturday, assuming all goes well and my roommate gets the paperwork in tomorrow.  It's going to be nice to have a place again.  I'm going to have on room for a studio where I'll be able to teach, write, and record my music with my computer setup, synthesizer, and electronic drums.  Gonna be sweet.  Super sweet.  Oh, and there's a fitness center, too.  Beefcake."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"It's dirt cheap to hop a plane out of the country right now.  Even more tempting for me to fly off to Ireland or Japan in December, although I probably won't do it...  It still feels good that I can go if I choose to.  ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" has been a little slow, and I so far see that the movie's changes were for the better.  However, I'm not going to make any official opinionative statements until I've finished the whole trilogy.  Who knows?  I could change my mind as the story unfolds.  I'm 1/3 through the book, and I'm still waiting for something really interesting to happen.  My 4 1/2 month old nephew is here tonight; up, of course.  His dad's gone off to Dragoncon in Atlanta for the weekend, and mommy could use a little breather.  Tonight she's only taking care of the 1 1/2 year old.  He actually sleeps at night.  I love those two little guys."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"So I didn't realize exactly how long the trilogy really is.  I'm about 16% through ""The Felloship of the Ring"" (P.71/458) and I'll read some more before I go to bed.  However, I think my previous schedule of reading all four books before the middle of September is pushing it, and maybe even the end of September, unless it encompasses all my spare time.  (That's a lot of reading.)  Though I may just do that because I want to finish it before the last movie comes out.  Hopefully I will be watching the second movie this weekend--yes, I can't believe I missed it in the theater, as well--but I want to know how the books end before I watch how the movie ends.  I've had too many movie scenes in my head already, which are nothing like the book, but my mind is expecting them.  So, I'd like to see how it all ends in writing before I see Hollywood's tale, however much great eye-candy it will be.   Mmmm...  eye-candy...  Wireless broadband is great when you live in a home that allows it to work properly...  I wouldn't really know about that...  On, off, on, off, and no, you can't go in that room or around that corner, but if you tilt your head just so, lift your pinky, and sing the alphabet song backwords then you'll have access for ten minutes straight before it goofs.  It's okay, though.  It's a luxury, a frustrating one, mind you, but a luxury nonetheless.  I was finally told of the Asian market in town a couple days ago--can't believe I forgot to post that.  One of the waiters of the Chinese restaurant I frequent daily entertained his notion of my needing an Asian girlfriend, explaining how they are much different than American girls.  Of course I know this all too well, but he had no idea.  His first comment was that they know how to cook, and I laughed as I informed him that I can cook most of what I order from the restaurant.  He was shocked, but impressed.  That's when he told me where to go in order to find the different foods I've been wanting to get--and where the Asian girls were, too.  I have yet to stop by the shop, but I plan on going sometime this week just to look around, check some prices, and maybe even begin some more Asian networking--I can never have too much of that."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Heads up:   Unless something big changes I will be applying to go to Japan to teach English as soon as the applications for JET are available in September.  The deadline is December, but I will have mine in ASAP.  I should know by March whether or not I will be leaving July 25, 2005.  I will most likely be applying to go to Kyoto, but placement in the requested city is not guaranteed.  Please keep this along with all the other stuff I'm wanting and wanting to do in your prayers."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"I can feel things are beginning to change.  I'm going to start another job part-time within a week or so to give me something to do during the day.  That means going to bed before 6:00 AM.  I finally have no more students on Saturday.  It would be awesome if I could get my Friday or Thursday students to switch to the other day so as not to be so scattered, but things are fine for now.  I've been working on some electronic music for the past few days and now have two songs completed.  They're about seven minutes each, so I figure I'll put ten on a CD for dance mixes and such.  I really want to go to a good rave... one without all the drugs and such.  (They do exist, but they're just not around here.)  Some of this stuff is definitely rave material.  My friend is going to Georgia--the country--with the Peace Corps. in March.  He finally got his invitation.  I meet with the regional rep on October 15th to find out more about the Corps.  If things go well, I may start my application this month or next.  However, that all depends on what hapens within the next couple months...  I feel change in the air.  I can smell it."

4GG3WMN,male,26,"Saturday was a most eventful day, to say the least.  It's one I won't soon forget.  It started with teaching as usual.  As I was waiting for my last student to show up at noon I noticed his name had been scratched from the list.  So, I asked if he had cancelled, and as soon as it had occured to her, my coworker informed me that his parents had called during my last lesson to let us know he was in a car accident on his way to the lesson.  They mentioned nothing else.  So, right before I head to a wedding, I am thinking of my best student and know nothing of his condition.  I prayed for him and his family before I drove away from the studio.  Hopefully I'll find out how he is when I go back to work.  The wedding was small, but amazing.  I was honored to have been asked to play djembe for it and to be a part of that special moment in their lives.  It was also a reunion I wasn't expecting.  People I had not seen in up to eight years were there, as small as it was.  Some of us caught up as little as we could as we listened to Camraoonian music and ate delicious food.  I even danced with an old friend's six year-old daughter, who was barely at my knee the last time we danced.  She didn't remember me from back then, of course, but acted as if I were her long lost friend.  It was beautiful.  I exchanged conact information with most everyone I hadn't seen in so long, and I'm sure some of them will go on just as we had before, but if I stay contact with half of them I will be happy.  The groom and his brother, both from Camaroon, are very loving people, and quite thankful for everything as they constantly reminded me.  They both offered--against my notions of doing too much for me--to send me a very good drum each from Africa once they go back.  I hope to actually go with them or at least visit them in the future as my desire to visit Africa grows every day now.  Later that evening after we had all dispersed I made my way to Barnes & Noble, as usual.  As I was reading on in my book and sipping on a soy latte, I was shocked at what happened next.  As if the previous reunions were not enough, there walks in a face and a pair of clear-blue eyes I was sure I'd never see again, though I had try to find, someone I used to be close to but had left long ago.  I had only heard unfortunate things and had been thinking about her and her whereabouts for years, trying in some way to see if I could help her or maybe get her turned around in the right direction.  Much to my surprise, she recognized me on sight--the last time we spoke my razor-bald head was full of hair past my shoulders.  She immediately changed her previous intention and sat down at my table to talk, but not before we shared a reunion embrace.  She was only in town for they day visiting her parents.  We had only a couple minutes to do some brief catching up, and much to my relief she had been doing better than I had ever expected.  Now in New Orleans, she had left town several years ago, went back to school for a bit down there, and started her own business, which from what I gather is doing quite well.  As with everyone else, we exchanged information and hopefully won't lose touch again.  Okay, so it was reunion day, and it didn't stop there.  Once again, as if it were all planned way in advance, another old friend came in and we caught up as well.  It was definitely an interesting day, and although it took up a great deal of my hobbit time, I welcomed the untimely distractions.  Concentrating on the book was pointless after that.  So, I settled on reading it more later.  I now have seventy pages left in the hobbit's adventure, which I hope to have read by tomorrow night.  I've already spent more time on it than I had planned.  It's getting better, but I can't wait to get to the trilogy.  I'm feeling as though I will regret reaching the end of the books, and I will have to find more like it to read, if there exists other books like them.  I don't know.  I'm still ignorant on the great books that are out there.  So, after I finish the trilogy, I will resume randomly picking up books and reading little bits here and there continuing in my search for more good literature.  I'm beginning to feel the pull of something greater getting stronger every time I wake up.  I feel as though I shouldn't stay still here, though I know I am here to teach for the time being.  I am free to do whatever I please, go wherever I wish, and yet I still feel trapped in responsibility and duty.  Thus, I will stay where I am for now, continuing in my teaching, but will not make anymore long term commitments.  This does not exclude, however, the aquiring of a travelling companion, though I think I may not find one until my path ends, wherever that may be.  I think my true journey in life has just begun, though it seems as though I have just completed one at the same time.  I just pray that it is God that continues to lead me and that I do not stray my first priority given to me in His word: to take the gospel to all people, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  Amen."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"I need a cheap ticket to Orlando and back.  The last time I had checked they were under $100 round-trip.  Now I can't find one under $200.  It's a conspiracy, I tell you...  a conspiracy..."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"A little short notice, but I don't mind at all.  I start travelling to T-town this weekend for Honduras meetings.  Super sweet.  Everyone in T-town better prepare themselves for D's return!  I plan on seeing everyone Saturday!  Wow...  That's a lot of seein'."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Pounding headache.  I rarely ever get them, but when they come, they come with a vengeance.  Watched, regretably, ""The Medallion"" with some friends.  I didn't know Jackie Chan was capable of such cheese.  There wasn't even a great choreographed fight scene in it like every other one of his movies.  Still trying to find someone to watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" with me.  If you're around and wanna see it, call me.  I'll go to the very next showing.  There's just something odd about going to the theater by yourself, but I'll do it if I have to.  I'm warning you.  I will.  *grin*  Everyone smile!  It's beautiful.  All of it."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"I met someone who doesn't believe love exists.  I've known people to say it but not really mean it before, but she really believes it and lives it.  It's sad, and several of us that she told are on a mission to convince her otherwise.  No matter what we said, she had some excuse and said we are in a false reality for believing otherwise.  So sad.  My van is temporarily out of commision due to an immobile ""pully,"" which is in turn causing a belt to burn due to the friction.  This is both good and bad.  It's bad because, obviously, I cannot drive it.  However, it's good because I now know for sure which one has been making noises for the past several months, and that noise will now go away once I've replaced it.  So, I think it's more of a good thing.  I can do without it for one day.  I know I said I'd write about my thoughtful insight tonight, but it will have to wait.  When?  I don't know, but it will hopefully be soon.  I have several other things I'm going to be looking into over the next few days, and some things have to be put on hold.  I will get to those writings sooner or later.  I promise.  Autumn is on its way, and I'd love to be prepared.   urlLink Oh, how good I would look in an XL one of these!   *grin*"
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Back to T-town this Friday.  I pray things go well.  Wednesday is going to be a day of errands.  I need to get my passport in the works and try and make an appointment somewhere to get my first round of immunization shots for all that fun deadly stuff down in Honduras.  I don't need to wait another week on this stuff.  I picked up a new book lastnight that will hopefully guide me in a direction I'd like to take myself in.  We'll see what happens.  I'm still looking for some more inspirational books to take with me while I'm in Honduras.  If you have any suggestions, send them my way with a brief synopsis, the author's name, and any other pertinent information you might have on it or the author."

4GG3WMN,male,26,"I have about 150 pages left in “The Fellowship of the Ring”.  I don’t think I’ll make it through the entire trilogy by the end of the month, but I’m still shooting for it.  It’s gotten better since I last wrote about it.  Hopefully it will continue in that direction.  The council has just finished their meeting, and now it’s time for some action and real adventure (from what I remember seeing in the movie).  However, I’m still trying to forget what I saw in the movie and stick with what’s in the book.  It’s VERY different most of the time with some dialogue here and there verbatim."
4GG3WMN,male,26,Today was a good day.  Fasting is good for you... helps you focus.  I'm going to try and start getting myself on a normal schedule now that my body's fully rested.  I feel something big is going to happen.  I pray it does.
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Although I own several movies I have yet to see, I watched one I've already seen tonight:  Where the Heart Is --the Wal-Mart baby movie.  Love that movie.  Guess that's why I own it.  I want to quit my current teaching job ASAP, but ASAP isn't until I get back from Honduras.  I'll lose four students I'd like to keep teaching, but they don't outweigh the problems and the bad students.  I'm very much looking forward to my new place because of the good that is being done there, but change in employment is always a bit unnerving.  I just have to keep telling myself not to keep asking myself questions.  Hypotheticals don't help matters.  For those who know about my van being backed into (it's not bad, but it's a fun story to tell), the total estimate is about $680.  I want that check.  Forget about a new bumber, I can deal with a small crack.  I want that check.  It will help me get through the summer without any worries while changing jobs (and allow me to quit my other one sooner and concentrate more on the new one).  ...  I've been staying away from the computer lately--more importantly IM programs--and forced those who want to talk to me to call me.  It's worked well except for whom it was intended...  Still waiting on a phone call.  And thus the plan has back-fired.  grr...  I guess it only strengthens my assumptions.  Much love, my peeps, homies, and g-money foo dogs.

4GG3WMN,male,26,"Morning came early.  Had a new piano student today.  If I'm counting right, I think that makes thirty students.  I should probably know that for sure.  Three hours of sleep is not enough for a ten-hour work day, and add all the Friday night nonsense to that and you have one tired me.  It's still early, but it feels so late.  Saturdays have become melancholy.  If it's not cold, I think I'm going to the park and sit with my guitar like I used to.  I've been getting the itch to write some new songs anyway.  I'm inspired."

I was hoping to be able to talk to someone sooner than a month from now, but I guess I can wait.  I'll just do all the reading I can on the website and in brochures until then.  More thoughtful insight will return tomorrow when I am awake enough to write it.  Topic?  I guess you could say it's ""respect in dietary belief.""  I opened up a friend's eyes while having dinner, and I decided to share some of my thoughts here, as well.  Alas, it's night-night time.  Getting up in...  Yeah...  Less than four hours...  Right...

I need to send a couple e-mails and opportunities for me to move may arise soon.  Made some great connections down there.

4GG3WMN,male,26,"I finished reading ""The Legend of Bagger Vance,"" and now feel less intelligent for having done so.  If you have seen the movie, don't read the book.  If you haven't seen the movie, then you can go ahead and flip through its pages.  That way, when you do see the movie, you'll have a much better appreciation for what Hollywood did with it.  Or you can simply watch the movie and forget that it was ever based on a book or that it was ever written.  I met with my newest drum student yesterday afternoon, whom had switched from another teacher at the studio.  I was shocked at what he didn't know at his level of playing.  Today I became fully aware that I am teaching these kids, and they are learning more in a shorter amount of time in comparison to others.  This isn't something I'm proud of or can brag about, but rather something I'm happy to have been blessed with.  God's given me the ability to bless others with the knowledge I have, and He's allowed me to do it in a kind an efficient way.  So, in that, I am blessed.  All I want is to teach others, and He has given me the ablility and opportunities to do so.  Sweet."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"God granted me today.  It was absolutely beautiful, and I did go to the park.  It was nice to watch the kids feed the ducks, some people flying a kite, and others just enjoying the sunshine while I strummed away on my guitar.  It had been a while, and I needed it."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"I’ve often wished I could pass unseen and watch others unaware as they moved through their day.  I would watch those things others miss; like the way someone reads the newspaper, talks to a baby after it’s fallen fast asleep, takes deliberate care to cut up a salad no matter how long it takes to make it perfect—the little things.  I do this as much as I can without appearing a little psychotic or the like, but it’s rare I ever get the chance to really put it into practice.  I want to know more about people, why they are, what they are, and where they are.  I find strangers the most intriguing.  The less I know about someone, the more I want to know, but without ever saying a word.  Psychologists and psychiatrists do this kind of thing, to an extent, but their presence, however little, is always known.  There’s something different about a person’s actions when they think no one is paying attention, even when they try to “act natural” when being monitored or watched.  I often wonder how much more the angels or celestial beings (whatever you wish to call each of them) know about us than we do ourselves for having access to this invisible treasure.  I wish I could for just one day be able to follow one person’s entire day, however exciting it may appear to be.  In following this dream, I often sit in a few places in town and watch the passersby.  Some are always there the same time of day, others are sporadic, and then there are those who simply come and go on occasion or maybe only once.  I’ve been doing this for over a month now in three places, and I’m learning quite a bit of them.  I’m usually reading or writing, but at the same time my eyes are open to my surroundings, which goes unnoticed by others.  I will sometimes overhear conversations, observe unique mannerisms, their approach to others of different relations, and I keep an unwritten log inside me of each one.  It’s amazing how much I’ve already learned in the past month, and I plan to continue my “research” indefinitely.  Maybe I’ll use them as characters in a book, a poem, simple daydreaming, or maybe even something more that has yet to come.    I want to know more about Israel Kamamawio’ole and to hear more of his music.  For over a year I have been listening to his arrangement of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World” for ukulele and voice (himself, of course).  I share it with everyone I can for it is a rare jewel, sweet and precious with a light of joy unmatched by most songs I have ever heard.  Had he not left this world, I would have made it a point to thank him for that little gift.  It often brings tears up inside me, though I’ve never let them flow.  I think I will surely do so one day.  I’m simply waiting for that day to come, though I hope there will be no such horrible day that causes me to weep from hearing such beautiful emotion.  Here’s to you, Israel.    We are beautiful.  All of us.  Show others that beauty and play your part to bring out their own.  Sometimes people need a hug, a simple word, or even just a smile.  Do not reserve these things only for those you know.  You may just save a day, a life, or even a soul.  Sometimes you just might help yourself more than the other.  Try it.  Love is all around, and it’s waiting for us to find it."

4GG3WMN,male,26,"I didn't have to hold the baby down for shots, which is a good thing.  Sis took him and decided to just have me watch the other while she was out, which basically meant sit on the couch while he runs around the living room playing with a hundred toys.  Yeah, no needles.  I had a new piano student today.  Five years old and scared to death of someone new.  She clung to her mother for the first few minutes without aking a sound and refused to even touch the piano.  For a minute I thought she would simply refuse altogether and her mother would take her away upset that she wouldn't even try, but I knew I couldn't give up and I also knew no child can resist the charm of yours truly.  Sure enough, within five minutes I had her playing all the notes on the piano with the right fingers and laughing like we were at an amusement park.  Kids rock.  So, I'm flying through the last bit of the book, and it is becoming increasingly different from the movie.  I have 84 pages to go, and I don't see any way there can be any kind of simile between the two endings.  I'm still not certain which I will like better in the end, but I'm still hanging on to the movie side for now.  However, I can't seem to see the two characters as anyone other than Matt Damon and Will Smith even though I know they are truly nothing alike.  Had I read the book before I had seen the movie, I'm sure it would have been much darker for me.  But I still see Will Smith and the demeanor he portrayed, which is by far more comforting than the book illustrates with its details.  There's just something about a facial expression one sees that can't be written on pages, or at least I have yet to read."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Had the Peace Corps meeting a while back and things went really well.  I'm not going to apply just yet.  A friend of mine and I are going to get an apartment soon (probably this week), and we'll sign a year lease.  That'll give me time to do some volunteer work here in Huntsville and try to start a jazz scene with a few connections I've made.  The application process takes six to nine months from turning it in to when the volunteer is shipped off.  So, I have about three months before I'll put it in.  We'll see how it goes.  Right now my top choice for the Corps is China.  I've been doing a little more studying on the language (or languages, I should say) and the different parts of the country, as well.  My previous stay in Panama won't give me any leverage in going there because there are so many people who want to go to Central and South America who are already fluent in Spanish, and that Panama is more urban than most others.  So, that won't help me any.  However, being in Honduras may help me get there, if I so choose, but I think I will be of better use in Asia.  I've begun working at a pharmacy again to give me something to do during the day.  They've been begging me to come back and are paying me a ton more.  So, it's a good chunk of money I can save up and still have an apartment.  I just hope I can teach more students at the apartment than at the studio.  Then I can cut back hours because I'll be making more money.  Then I'll have enough money to get by, save up some, and have plenty of time to do the volunteer stuff I want.  I have this urge to take my guitar to the pediatrics ward and have some fun entertaining some sick kids.  Joy."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Leaving early in the morning.  Not much time to write, but here's a quick post.  Several of my students want to follow me to my new job.  Sweetness.  I didn't ask them to.  They asked me where I was going because I was leaving.  When I told them I was going to teach somewhere else the response was usually, ""Where?  We'll follow you.""  Good for me, bad for the studio I'm at and the owner.  He might try something to get me into trouble with that, but it's their choice.  On other weird news, the brother of one of my student's mother is leaving his wife and two kids (one less than a year old) for a 23 year-old Honduran girl, and he is moving there to be with her.  This affair has been going on for a while, and he's decided he's going to leave.  Members of the church (he, his wife, and the Honduran girl), but apparently not for long.  Everyone knows about it now, and I'm not sure who all but those at the church in Honduras know some of what's going on, too.  Seems as though he's been involved in helping build a new surgical facility in Honduras, and that's how this began.  Hmm...  a new surgical facility...  related to the church...  Yup, that's where I'm going Saturday.  Small world.  Makes me wonder what kind of something is going to be stirred up in the church down there.  I've been told to ask about a certain person and see if I can aid in putting a stop to this somehow.  Not that I think I'll be of much help, but I'll keep an eye out.  Drama everywhere.  Everywhere.  After she told me that today (the mom) I had to tell her I was leaving.  Yeah, I hated to do it, but I had to.  Bad news on top of bad news.  She did her best not to cry.  So, if I don't come back or I die or something, I love you all.  Some I wish I had loved more, but all none-the-less.  Yeah.  So...  Bye."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"I'm going to be doing some early spring cleaning in my life.  I've had too much tea.  *boing*  I'm hoping to see the ""Passion"" movie tonight or tomorrow.  I'm most interested in its proclaimed accuracy.  Always a skeptic.  Sis is moving back to AL from L.A. in April...  Poor thing.  Going to T-town two weekends a month 'til I leave for Honduras.  I'll have meetings there for the trip.  No more work on the weekends for me.  Time to see old friends and hopefully make some more music while I'm there, too.  Definitely miss playing with the combo, even though half of them are gone, as am I...  Work in 6 1/2 hours...  Need sleep...  Too much tea...

4GG3WMN,male,26,"A good friend of mine moved back to town this weekend, and we went to see ""Pirates...,"" which was an okay movie.  Depp was excellent, the special effects were intriguing, and the plot was full of holes and less than satisfying.  I think I'm going to stick to foreign films and old black & white stuff.  Nothing as of late has proven to be especially entertaining or intellectually stimulating, with the exception of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and a couple others I've seen that were released several years ago.  I need to find a fabric store around here.  I'm trying to find the material I want to use in order to make a traveller's cloak and/or robe.  I have yet to come across a good pattern I can use, and it looks like I'm just going to have to do the designing myself with what little I know about textiles.  I was planning on designing the outward look anyway.  I might as well go all the way.  The weather forcasts weren't pleasing enough to go hiking, but I'm glad I didn't go now that my friend is back in town.  We're both in dire need of something to do in this town.  Before going to see ""Pirates...,"" we stopped by Starbucks to ingest some caffeine and play a few games of chess, in which I have an undisputed record in schooling him.  I thought later about my past desire to sculpt my own set of pieces.  I'm not sure what I want them to look like, but I had wanted to do it in sandstone some time back.  I guess that's something else I'll have to sit back and think up to design.  Need to do laundry. Need to make another hemp necklace. Need to get more students. Need to leave Huntsville. Need to stop using the word ""need.""  Four and a half more years until I'm thirty years old.  ...  I still wonder if I'll make it."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"I often wish the Bible were written in a different voice, like that of characters in novels or simply that of a different author.  Maybe then I could tolerate reading more of it.  However, the Bible was written and inspired so that all may understand its words, and I'm sure the Psalms and the Song of Solomon are just as poetic in their native tongue.  But in the English language it just doesn't translate into ""good reading,"" as some define it, including myself.  As if trying to translate the true meaning of scripture weren't enough, now there are translatios which attempt to use ""modern English"" or some form thereof concocted by the translators.  These lose even more of the original intended meaning and they sound even less profound.  ""Give us this day our daily bread"" is now translated ""give us three square meals?""  Some things are just lost in translation, and we should accept them, as have I, but this outright rewritten language is blatantly wrong.  The Song of Solomon, as inspired as it is, to me is horrible writing in the English language and contains something less than what I would consider to be beautiful, let alone the most beautiful song in the world.  Singing about a woman's breats isn't exactly what I would call lovely, but there it is, plain as day.  Maybe the Hebrew sounds better, flows better, or even has some sort of rhyme scheme.  I don't know.  I can't read it.  I can look at it all day long, with its scribbling curls and dots, view the line breaks and its form written right to left, but still nothing.  And then someone translates it, strips away the poetry and culture, and reveals to us its literal meaning.  This, unfortunately, is the way of the scholar.  But now at what costs are we trying to make the Bible ""sound better"" or ""easier to read?""  What are we losing or even adding when we read things like ""three square meals?""  What have we lost already from the beginning of our translations with ""placing the knees"" translated into the single word ""praying?""  What embedded culture have we lost that could have been savored all this time?  Why do we not shalom?  Isn't that only in the Middle East?  Isn't that Islamic?  No, it's praying.  It's what we took away from the scripture and lost in our own culture.  It's something beautiful that we could still be doing today, but instead think it odd because we see it as foreign instead of seeing King David doing it himself in scripture.  These things bother me; always have and always will.  I'm now almost afraid to purchase a Bible that has ben published within the last twenty years out of fear of false translation even moreso than what has already been done.  Jesus wasn't born in a ""manger.""  He was born in a ""cave,"" according to the Ancient Greek text, which in the later Greek was translated differently.  Oh, you didn't know about this?  You've never heard about any of these things or read them in your own Bible?  That's because we're comfortable.  We're complacent.  We take the sermons already given to us, take out our King James or Newe Living translations, and regurgitate them in our own words, our own twists.  We don't look at the literal translations of words, look at the culture, study the ancient texts, and put it all together to gather a true meaning of the scripture.  And someone forbid we map out the actions of the first century church as it really was: communism.  ""What?"" you say.  Yes, communism, but use that word in America and you're likely to get hog-tied and beaten for such blasphemy against our ""modern way of life and democracy.""  That's because we don't look at the word communism with emphasis on its root word ""commune.""  We see exploitation and oppression insead of love and compassion.  It's how we now translate that single word in our culture that has altered the way we even perceive the church.  Restoration?  No, I don't believe we've acheived it.  Can we?  I believe so, but not without accepting that our own culture and way of living needs to conform to the Bible instead of conforming the Bible to our own culture and way of living.  Am I going to jail for saying this?  No.  Did the first century christians go to jail for saying such things?  Yes.  Is that a blessing or a curse.  I don't know.  Maybe I would do more good if I were thrown in jail for saying it.  Maybe people would listen.  Maybe people would read their Bible and ask questions.  Maybe people would seek out answers.  Maybe people would evaluate their lives a little more.  Maybe people would really think ""What would Jesus do?"" instead of simply wearing it around their wrists and necks.  Maybe we could communicate with one another.  Maybe we could commune with one another.  Maybe.  Just maybe."

N5H7URL,male,23,"RED BEARD  Time ticks away. I don't have much free. I need some people to start returning my phone calls. I'm getting knee deep in the sludge that is preproduction but I'm enjoying it very much. As we push on thru to the other side-- Thru. It's so much better than Through. It makes so much more sense and saves you some of the time/cost of typing those extra letters.  That aside- real fast-- why is the Office so great? I mean- whats so great about it? I can't really find anything too funny so long as it has an english accent. Let me re-phrase that. I can't find anything with an english funnny - if it's trying to be funny. English people really aren't very funny to me. Their sense of humor seems off.  THis excludes Charlie Chaplin, and I imagine a great number of funny people. Includibng things from Monty Python.   So what is this really about? It's about the office. I mean, it's kinda funy. But people at work not taking it very seriously.. it's just not all that funny to me. They just sit around and act english. In england it seems as though just the slightest deviation from the status quo is enough grounds to be called humor. I don't understand this. But I love it.  Did I say that I loved it? I was kidding. I had a dream last night But I don't really remember much of it. But I know I had it.  Today at the gym I toook a shower. it smelled. The shower did. It's kind of hard to imagien your getting lceaner if your in a place that smells.  Speaking of smells, there is this one guy at the gym who smells so godawful. It's hard to describe. He smells befre he even st arts working out. he just fucking stinks. Why? Who am I to say.  One more thing- and then I'll be one my merry way. I'm going to post less and less often as now I will begin tot focus more and mor energy on the movie which brings me great joy and happiness. The movie is a big deal for us and it will be something worth seeing. I'll send you a copy some day. If you ever let me know that you want one. And iff you want to help make the movie, just give me a call. my new cell phone numer is 310 569 3325. And if it's wierd to put your phone # on the internet then too bad. Casue I just did.

N5H7URL,male,23,"Hello friends  Been some time now.  I went to a 'writers store' today to buy final draft. Stores like that always bug me because there's all these books telling you how to do things. And the more time you spend in places like this the more you start to think that you need a book about doing something to be able to do it.  You know what's weird about the emmys? Nobody cares about them. I know people watch them- I've watched them before. But nobody really cares about them except for the people who are winning. And even then I don't think it's SUCH a big deal to them. I know somebody who has an Emmy, and it's pretty cool to hold it and it's definitely on display in the home. But at the end of the day, I don't think it's such a big deal to this person that they have one.   Maybe this is how it should be. Because we place so much damn importance on the oscars. Which makes them silly in a reverse way. But the people who deny the value of their oscar are just trying to look cool. They love their oscars.  It's probably because when you win an Oscar you are counted in history along with Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Steven Speilberg, etc. And when you win an Emmy you are counted in history alongside Kelsey Grammar.  But then again some people who win an Oscar are counted alongside Kevin Costner and some people who win Emmy's are counted alongside Jerry Seinfeld.  It's a fucked up world we live in.  I like when celebrities get upset for not having any privacy. It seems like the one thing they have to complain about and they really zero in on it. Thats not entirely fair though. It's possible that some celebrities have normal shitty things happen to them just like the rest of us. But it's a lot nicer to have normal shitty things happen to you in a private jet.  Some celebrities don't have private jets though. Like Ricardo Montalban. Is Ricardo Montalban a celebrity? Would he count himself as one? Would William Shatner count Ricardo Montalban as a celebrity? Who's more likely to be in awe of Ricardo Montalban- William Shatner or Leslie Nielson?  Is being gay enough on it's own to make someone  funny? And if so, is being a woman enough, on it's own, not to be funny? And if both are true than where does that leave Ellen DeGeneres? The truth is though being gay and being a woman more likely make people not funny, which is part of the reason why Ellen DeGeneres is twice as unfunny as any unfunny person. It's because of this misconception about gay people being automatically funny that people keep giving her t.v. shows.  Is Whoopi Goldberg a lesbian?  I saw a postcard once while my roomate was buying an American Flag Keychain, and this postcard was of a really fat nasty woman posed on a beach in a bikini, barely covering herself.   I thought a few things.  Firstly, where did they find this woman? She looked like she was homeless, because her hair was all messed up- and we all know that's a sign of homelessness. So did they go out one day looking for an ugly, fat homeless chick willing to pose on the beach for money? If so, did she ever in her wildest dreams think it would be for a postcard? Even if she wasn't homeless- Did they hold auditions? Did they put an add in Backstage west looking for a fat ugly woman? Did they contact plus sized modeling agets and ask for the ugliest model they had? How often do modeling agencies get calls like that? What's the market for ugly fat models?   And once they got the woman in question, did they laugh at her while they were taking the pictures? Did they lie about what they were doing so she wouldn't know the whole thing was designed to capitalize on her ugliness as a source of laughter?  And, now that it's all completed, and she's got her paycheck, does she ever walk down the street and get recognized as that fat ugly chick from a postcard? Probably not- but does she ever come across the post card herself and laugh thinking 'Boy, I sure am funny looking and fat and disgusting'.   Do her parents know? Or her kids? her friends? Or- god forbid- her husband? Do they see it at the key chain store and say, ""Shit Olga, you really rocked on that postcard gig.""  Even more curious yet, is does this woman put on her resume, 'Posed naked on the beach for a postcard' And then when she comes in to the interview do the people look at the resume and think she's lying because she's fat and disgusting. In case that might happen is it possible that she adds on her resume, when describing the postcard job, 'it was for a joke because I'm really fat and disgusting and in this case being fat and disgusting was an asset, so don't be quick to judge when we meet when I interview for your job- you never know when having a fat and disgusting person will come in handy for some good laughs.'  It was some postcard, I'll tell ya."

N5H7URL,male,23,"J-LO  I'll tell ya a quicky, then I'm off.   I was going to Disney Land with my Dad. BUt first we had to walk around this giant new hotel they were building next to disney land. We got to this place that was fenced off and my Dad tried to get in. There was a big scary dog barking and there was Barbed wire. He grabnbed the barbed wire as though he could remove it. I guided him away. he was confused.  I watched a movie Starring Toshiro Mifune as a wandering Samurai. He also played an Emperor who happened to look a lot like the wandering samurai. THe Samurai knew he bore an uncanny resemblence to the Emperor so he travled to the Emperor's palace where they met in sword fight with a batleh. The sword fight lasted many months and was most glorious. Eventually the Wandering Samurai took a steel umbrella and put it in a clay tube then stabbed the Emperor with it and opened the umbrella once it was inside the emperor. He shattered. Like the Rolling stones song.  Then the Wandering Samurai was chased out of the palace by the guads and he took to the sky in a bi-plane. This is when I joined him. We flew across the state of california, larking and plunging across the meadows. We flew over disneyland circa 1960. Then we flew so high we flew into the future. And in the future we flew past a house and a drive way. But quickly we realized this was not the future, but the future according to the 1980's. Still, said the samurai, it was a future, and we should appreciate it regardless of it's connection to the 1980's.  I was at the gym with my trainer and I went to the bathroom. Which turned out to be a bedroom. Jennifero Lopez was there and we had sex. I felt uncomfortable with it though because I wasn't sure if she had any veneral diseases or not. I tried to postpone the sex as much as possible. Then she turned into Madonna. This frustrated me and finally I escaped her only to find that she was in fact my Trainer's wife and he would kill me.

N5H7URL,male,23,"THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO BRONXVILLE  Not really. Just for a night.  It's funny that ,y brother alex made a top ten list of movies. I more think of alex and movies in terms of hatred rather than love. Which is to say that I can more easily see alex's top ten worst movies, or top ten most overrated.   BUt in the meantime I'll say that I have always had more or less of a top ten in my head. But I don't have enough readers for it to be woirth posting.  If I have any readers at all.  Instead I'll say this. I saw Some Like it Hot recently. That's a kick ass movie. Very good structure. It's funny to me that I'll bet everytime people try to make a 'romantic comedy' they check out that movie- but they don't seem to get it.   I love the coen brothers, and I enjoyed their recent effort with George Clooney, but it didn't have any of the same structural genius of something like some like it hot.  I mean- you can take the best movies ever- of all different genres and types, etc. And you can see where true genius lies. I think there's this common horseshit floating in the toilet bowl of life that 'if it accomplishes what it want's to' then the movie is good.  I used to subscribe to this floater, and truth be told, it was for lack of a better understanding. It's the right idea- but it's not just about what something intends to be or do- because who the hell knows what that would be ,really. But what something is. And how something is.   I guess, to be more exact. Is given movie anything? Is it something? And if so? Is it that on all counts, does each cut, and line, and beat, and moment work to be what it is. Maybe thats what people mean when they talk about being what it wants to be.  And maybe not.  I like Lawrence of arabia as much as the next guy- but I think it's been touted to highly. It's just not that fucking good. I mean, it's great, and I won't argue with that, but it's no citizen kane. But I have strange tastes. I just don't think you can see consistent genius in Lawrence of arabia.   You know who gets the shit end of the stick? Akira Kurosawa. Because even though he's known as this kind of ananymous film gurur that Lucas worships, he doesn't get enough credit on his own, while David Lean, John Ford, and Howard Hawks(all of whom I respect and revere and love) garner a shit load of attention.  Kurosawa's movies are all so close to perfect.   Anyway, check out some like it hot. It starts to lose some of it's greatness during the end of the second act- or beg. of the third- but the set up is so tight.  And- as long as we're on the subject of marilyn monroe- I really like The Asphault Jungle- and it's never mentiioned along with the better Huston movies. It's a great opportunity to see Marilyn young and looking as goood as any body ever did on film probably. But it's also a great movie. They say the first real hiest movie- or 'caper' movie.   And With that I must go. On the waterfront at the new bev in an hour or so. Some good young brando. Truth be told I think his best work ever is Last Tango in Paris- and I think he was so great in it because he knew he couldn't fuck around- or thought he couldn't because the director was italian- and thus he gave him more respect. In brando's mind that must have meant tsomething.  -Terry Malloy"
N5H7URL,male,23,"A WATCHED POT ALWAYS BOILS  It's very true. The title of this blog is a recent discovery I made. I had to boil two eggs, and it was my first time in my 22 years of attempting such a thing. In order to to do this I first had to boil some water. And I watched the water boil. And it did.   It too a long time. Very long. When I saw the first bubble rise I thought, 'there we go. Now she'll pick it up and REALLY start to boil."" This was not the case. I watched longer and longer and longer and eventually more bubbles rose, and then more. Time passed very slowly, but eventually the pot did boil under my total supervision.  I reccomend this excerscise to everyone simply because it puts to rest not only the comment, 'A Watched pot never boils', but the very notion of such a thing. Obviously it will boil if you watch it. But maybe in ignoring the watchnig part we really do come to a point where we expect it NOT to boil if we watch it. Which is to say that if we leave something, a task tedious as it may be, somehow it will solve itself.  Life is filled with these. I make movies. Movies are like the pot. I make them though. I'm trying to make a website right now. One bubble at a time. And sometimes I want to put my fist through the computer screaming because I just want to SEE my website, perfect and finished. No questions asked. But this is because I am unaccustomed to watching a pot boil, let alone taking part in the prrocess. The pot never gets frustrated when it boils. It goes through the same motion every time. The water never gets bored, or tired. The fire doesn't throw up it's hands in frustration when things don't move fast enough. They all stick it out, take their time, and boilt eh fucking water. Rome wasn't built in a day- sure, I'll beleive that one. But a pot doesn't boil in two seconds either.   I find myself, in general, so result oriented that my entire life is geared towards destinations. How long until we get there, how soon until it's done.. etc. etc. But this is not the point I am finding, and as I realized in watching the pot boil, the pot WILL boil- it is only a matter of time. And to ask the pot to worrry about how long it's taking, or if it's doing this the right way, or if it should try another faster method, or maybe hire another pot or recruit some cleaner watter, or hook up with a better burner... all these things... would be besides the point. The pot would tell you to fuck off because it knows it'll boil and it just needs to sit down, undistrubed and focus for a while, then eventually it'll boil.   The ultimate truth beyond the truth is that once it's boils it's not such a big deal. Drop in yor eggs, move on. Put in the pasta, get the sauce, move on. The pot boiling, no big deal- happened before, it'll happen again. So the end product is ultimately consumed, or forgotten as you slurp down wahtever you needed that boiling water for. What was it all worht then? Just that moment of eating. I guesss some would say so. But I would say it was worth the wait- and worth my attention. People complain that life goes by too fast- mine sure does- but not when you're watching a pot boil it doesn't. You can't believe how slow it gets. Don't watch because your bored, don't watch because you want the eggs hard boiled THAT BADLY, watch because your attention matters."
N5H7URL,male,23,"Just want to take a moment to aknowledge Mathew 'M.K.' Kellard, an old friend of mine who currently lives somewhere in North Pole. Or is it Chicago? Same thing.  You see, Old MK left the comforts of sunny Los Angeles and it's beautiful scantily clad peoples for the harsh reality of ... wherever he went. Lets be honest: To those of us from Los Angeles, anything else is a harsh reality. LA misses people like MK, just as she misses all her lost children, whites and latinos alike. But I guess MK doesn't belong here anymore. Maybe he never did. I know whenever knew people come to visit him in that place he is now he says, ""You truly belong with us here among the clouds."" I don't know if it's some kind of pick up line or what. I know he probably would have liked having Conan as our Governor.   Basically I felt it necessary (largely due to death threats) that I mention MK by name. There are few people who can go by the one name type of thing. MK has it down to a science.   To be honest I don't know why it was important that I mention his name. Nobody reads this. I think I've said that before. See you tonight.  -Optimus Prime"
N5H7URL,male,23,"People of California,  You have spoken.   Or have you?  Regardless of outcome, we should all vote. Regardless of party, or preference, or olitics, we should all vote. Because voting, to quote the videos at westwood driving school, ""is not a privledge; not a right.""  A privledge for whom? Surely while we seemed headed towards facism(in more ways than one) we are not yet facistic in nature. One day when meat-headed movie stars and illiterate Texans TOTALLY dominate what was once a land of the brave, we will all look back on the days when we could vote, and our votes counted, with great sadness. So enjoy it while it lasts.  You know, not to sound like a codgey old person, but lots of people have suffered and died to get the right to vote. To get a voice. So who are we to turn it away. Th funny thing about this system and all it's quirks, is that we actually have a direct influence on it. Any person who chooses, be it laziness, ineptitude, or disinterest, not to vote has no place complaining about the outcome of a vote. More than that they have no right complaining about a candidate, or recalling a vote. Well, of course they have a right. But basically if you don't vote you're a fool.  Partly just because it kicks ass to vote. To have a say. COunted just as much as any other.  Okay- now I'm exaggerating. A vote from the CEO of a tobacco company means more than a vote from a poor brown person. Because with that vote comes money. ""An den you get de power, and den you get de women.""  I think next time someone like Tony Montana should run for govenor. How about Tony Montana versus Ethan from ""The Searchers""? Sure, they were both characters in movies and not real people. Furthermore, one of the actors who played one of them is dead. But they can ressurect people now. Like Fred Astaire in those lame vaccum commercials, or John Wayne in the beer- there you have it. John Wayne is ready to go. They'll use clips from the Searchers, and from Scarface, and put together a debate. Montana will represent the people, he'll probably vote for the illeagal aliens getting drivers licenses. I'll Bet Ethan will vote no on that one.   Ethan will run a smear add calling Montana a 'half breed' and in a debate Montana will counter, 'joo wanna peese o' me mang?'  'to be governor joo gotta have balls mang.'  To this Ethan will answer, 'a half breed governor? that'll be the day.'  The two will disagree on a lot of subject, but they will agree on not taxing the rich. Tony is a self made man, and Ethan is more into stealing money from the government than giving it.  It'll go very nicely, and about five people will vote. All five old and on their deathbeds, and as a cruel joke they'll write in 'Conan the Barbarian'.  Shit. Too late. It already happened.  Sorry if you've never seen the searchers or scarface. you don't really get the jokes then. But you can probably get the idea. And eitherway, you can go rent one or both of the movies and forget about all this silly politics crap."
N5H7URL,male,23,I have been told that I write too much in this blog. So I'm actively choosing to write very little today. Thanks for comin' to the blog... check back later.
N5H7URL,male,23,"Tonight I want to turn our collective attention to a phenomenon knon as the fan film.  If you've never heard of a fan film, it goes something like this:  1)Star Wars comes out 2)People really like it 3)Some people REALLY like it 4)Those people make spin off movies of the original Star Wars.  This works with things besides for Star Wars. Like, say, Star Trek.  Regardless, I think the entire phenomenon is interesting. When you think about it, Fan Films are really a wierd way of getting involved in the fiction you love. And that's cool. No. Actually it's really not cool. But it's okay- if you want to do that with your life.  Sure, we live in a time where everything is a fan film. Right? Everything is derivative, and everything has 'homages'. Sure. I've been responsible for a few 'homages' myself over the years. But these aren't homages friends. These are fan films. And thus they do not have, nor do they pretend to, any individuality from their master creator. This is a shame.  When we 'homage' we allow for something that means alot to us to influence our own work- and our own vision. Just like when writing a love scene you might drawn on a time you had with your sweetheart, when writing a space ship launch scene you might draw on your favorite time watching a space ship launch. Sure, one happened to you and one you watched, but in this media soaked world we might as well assume your behavior with your sweetheart was influenced by that weeks episode of Happy Days. Which you also watched.  Regardless, when you 'homage', you allow for influence from the things you love. When you make a fan film you just try to do your own little thing with the scraps from somebody elses table. With homages, cross overs, rip offs, and even franchises we have a world where new ideas pop in here and there- new expressions. With a fan film you can never find something totally new- something devoid of any influence.   Originality is a funny concept. A wise man once told me that he felt the history of movies had people building on the same themes, and every once in a while somebody would twist it a bit to achieve an unachieveable effect, then that would become the status quo, and everyone would twist it that same way to achieve that same effect. We stand on eachothers shoulders to try to help tell new stories- in new (and exciting) ways.  But even if our stories and our methods are new, if the very premise- the very foundation- is not than we cannot hope to really find creative growth. That growth comes from somebody having the hard time of saying their own thing. In a sense, the fan film eliminates the challenge of making it all up- even if some of it you saw elsewhere. If you hide from that challenge, your work can never add somethnig new to the forward motion. You chose to be stagnant. In the words of another wise man, you chose poorly.  Now this is fine for some. And I don't mean to condemn fan films entirely. I just have found them increasingly depressing lately- for me. In my opinion. I wish all those who put their lives into them good luck. But I urge everyone to keep pushing to come up with something new- even if it's only a little new.  Sorry for going on about this. But I figure nobdoy is lisening anyway, so this becomes my own forum tolay out my own thoughts. If anybody agrees or disagrees( supposing sombody reads this) feel free to contact me at unittk421@hotmail.com"
N5H7URL,male,23,"THE SONG OF TROY  The Illiad is not the story of a war fought over a 'face that launched a thousand ships"". In fact, it is far from such a tale.  When the Illiad begins, the war in troy has been waging for a very long time. And when the Illiad ends, the war in troy is far from over. It is not about who wins. Not in such a small sense as a war.   Achilles is the hero of The Illiad, and to put it simply, he is a god among men. the greatest of all warriors. In the end, the Illiad is about the fact that no matter how great a man Achilles is, he is still just a man, and in the end he will face the very same fate all men do. Whether it be in battle, or of old age. His greatest will fade as he dies.  When Hollywood's intention to make the movie 'Troy' became clear I was excitied. Wow. One of my favorite books will be a major motion picture. But now, as we near the release date, I hyave started to fear the movie.  Hollywood does this thing... it's not just as simple as slapping a happy face on a sad tale. But Hollywood does this thing that can be best described as coloring by numbers. I saw this movie 'Hidalgo' which had many opportunities to be interesting but managed to choose 'poorly' at every turn. It was a movie hell bent on coloring by numbers. It had to fit it's story into the numbers. Some stories fit quite well. Like ""A Beautiful Mind"". So it's a big award winner, and a pretty good movie. Hidalgo did not fit so well. And sometimes movies are made outside the formula, and sometimes movies made with the formual still managed to be interesting- somehow.  But the song of troy, and more importantly, of the wrath of achilles, is not a song that fits the formula. And I join the ranks of countless book-to-movie naysayers when i say that the book, one of the oldest and most enduring classics of our time,  will be gutted. I hope I'm wrong. But I can';t help but be pessimistic when i see a trailer that opens with King Priam discussing the value of fighting a war for love.  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Even the myths and stories that revolve around the 'love' between Paris and Helen aren't so clear. What TROY will be is today's values slapped onto Yesterdays text and yesterdays words.   The inciting incident in the illiad is not Helen and Paris running off to troy. It is Achilles refusing to continue to fight for Agamemnon since Agamemnon has taken the woman achilles won in the most recent battle at Troy.   Why is this not appealing to us today? Well, Achilles sense of entitlement makes for a kind of unlikeable hero by todays american standards. But we must remember- the idea of Achilles is not to make a man by todays standards- but a man who is greater than any man can be- he is any of us realized to the fullest potential. And even he is snubbed. He is snubbed in the beginning by King of men Agamemnon, and he is snubbed long after the book ends when he dies.  The war in troy has been going on for ten years when the book starts. And the book ends a few weeks later. Not even a month later. The narrowness of the time frame shows us more the story of Achillles, and Hektor, than the story of troy. In fact, i think paris is really a non-issue to the Illiad. And he should be. He should be a two minute prologue. He's ridiculous. I like the idea of trying to show the conflict between Hektor and Paris- but fuck that. I don't think was any conflict. I think Hektor was so noble, he took his job of protector of the city on.  GOD as I think of this book and remember it I can only think of it's complexity and genius. The acts of Achilles, the path of him, as one of the earliest examples of the tragic hero- is so great, and so powerful to the greater narrative of Troy, that the implications about war, humanity, religion(the role of the gods in this case) mortality, freidnship etc. But if there is one thing I didn't get too much of a sense of in the Illiad it's romantic love. And that's clearly what the movie TROY wasn'ts to make as it's inciting conflict. So it's Okay. Troy isn't the illiad. It's about the fall of troy literally. Maybe that's why they called it troy.The word illiad means 'sgon of troy'- but I think thats a clever title implicating that the events of the book point to the ultimate end of troy, etc. etc. But this is frustrating because the illiad is such a great book they should make a real movie out of it. Not a kind of colage of veraios myths surrounding it and it itself. amybe I underestimate them. But I want them to prove me wrong.  Ahh but the ending is so great. I hope they don't fuck up the Hector character and his part of the story. My guess is they'll get it about 50% right. That'll be close- but the spirit of the book will be missing. And without that spirit and perspective guiding- directing- the film, if you will, it will not sing. Which is to say I wish I could have directed the film. But for now I'll read the book- or parts of it. And I'll leave you with the first line: ""Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus, and it's devastation..."""
N5H7URL,male,23,"MUTINY  One of the things one just assumes when one is directing a movie, as far as I know, is that everyone around you on the set thinks your a complete idiot. Sure, if you're speilberg or Scorsese they all think you are a genius, but I'm not quite either of those guys yet(and I stress the yet) So on MY movie set I am considered to be an idiot by the people I work with.  Idiot is a harsh word. I'll try to illustrate the principle in more detail through examples. On this level everyone thinks they could be doing the directors job better than he is, and more than that not everybody involved really knows what the directors job is. My job as the director of this film is to make sure it turns out goood. If it doesn't turn out good, it's my fault. The director is responsible, in my eyes for seeing that the movie is the sum of it's part, and to make sure the parts are good, AND if he really wants to do something good then he also has to make sure it's more than the sum of it's part. That part is a sorta magic trick.   But it's everything from making sure that things cut together right to making sure you have enough c-stands to making sure that the key grip gets lunch even if he doesn't tell you he's hungry. Making sure everyone is happy is key- it's more than key- it's critical, it's huge, it's very fucking important. And, as I alreadty explaining, everybody is pretty much sure I'm crazy, mad, selfish, slef invovled, obsessed, and destructive.   My personal life has blended with the film ina  manner that is both highly unprofefssional and given the specific circumstances, morally questionable. This hasn't helped me. I really shot myself in the foot, and while at tiomes I still limp a bit, for the most part I've tried to run through the pain and pretend there is no bullet lodged in my foot, or just pretend that it's helping me be more motivated to run harder.   The other night things started to turn inwards on me. My lead, who has often seemed half in and half out of the project, told me he was very upset with me for asking him not to get involved with the female lead, and then going ahead and getting involved with her myself. This guy is also my roomate/best friend. Bad twaysh as they say. More than that, my brother worries fro my sanity and thinks the brain pills I'm taking might be the cause of my 'mania'. Everyone is angry that I made them stand on top of a mountain that was crumbling beneath their feet while I got the shots I needed. The DP has bruises all over his body from holding our arribl on his shoulder all weekend, and the oproducer I think, feels that I have stepped on his toes a bit.   Somehow I quelled the resistance by trying to ask everyone to ddetach my personal life from the movie, by trying to explain to them where I was coming from, and asking them to please stay on board, not just for me and ""my movie""(which it isn't- it's all of our movies, the sound guy, the make-up girl, the leads, the extras, the bit players, the AD's, etc. etc.) we don't get money for this. our reward is doing good work. Having a good time and having something of quality to show for it. Thats all I can offer these people for their hearts and souls. Their bodies and minds. And so whenever I stand in the shower, hot water blasting the sweat off my body, and I think of which close-ups I didn't get, I just pound the wall: how could I fuck that up. How could I forget something. How come I made that mistake. Why didn't I stansd firmer ion getting that shot.  When I look at a piece of make-up and think it looks wrong or amateurish something inside me breaks. When I look at a set and think 'This ain't a jungle. It's a fucking backyard"" something inside me screams. we don't have the advantage of knowing our movie will be weaqtchable because we have the things at our desposal to make it that way. We have to first make sure we can get the bear minimun of watchable covered, and on top of that we have to make it good- not good greatp- fucking amazing. And we will. And for some reason they all still sorta kinda believe in me. I have to show them proof. Maybe some dailies cut together....   more later...."
N5H7URL,male,23,"So Far...   I just have decided to make this a place where I can record thoughts/moments and things alon the way of making ""The Search for the Golden Bird"". It has been something of a challenge, and yet also a joy to make the movie thus far. We have already, in our two endsless weeks... no... it's just been one week really... we shot stuff on a mountain top, we sweat in an office(we sweat on the mountain too). I'm even sweating now. I have sweat a lot. So far Blood and sweat have both be a big part of the movie makking process. No tears, but I punched some walls, which is about as close as I get to tears. There have been some serieous personal life catastrophes for me since we began. The ending of a 4 year retlationship, the nbeginning of an 'entanglement' with the lead actress, which in turn has alienated much of the cast and my faily/friends to some degree.  I have also had good days and bad with the shoot. Some days were very disapoitning, to find that my boards and my plans wouldn't work and that we'd have to find other ways to do things. making up on the spot entire sequences. You see, with the kind of budget we have, you ccan't waste film. We want to use every shot we expose. And this means not tooo many takes for the actors to get things right. So there is a lot of compromise. But I'm trying not to comprpmise too much. But at the same time I feel about one shot in five is exactly what I want. So now the challenge is picking which shots to get absolutley the way I want them./ Both big film shoots have been laden with problems, but also I have found myself so happy with them at times. Climbing down the mountain carrying the camera, or the tripod, sweating, bleeding-- whatever- it is fun. It is grueling, but it is fun. Especially in those moments where everything miraculously falls together perfect. And believe it or not, that has happened.  Ryan and Graham have been pulling the most wieght aside from me. Ryan more than graha, but for a DP Graham has done quite a bit of work. Turk, the Ad sent to us straiught from heabven, hasn't missed a beat. he worke, literally, until his legs cramped up and he could no longer move. When our one dry erase marker dried up atop the mountain, I said, 'Thats it, we can't shoot if we can't remark the slate'- two minutes later Turk messed with the marker and got another slate or two out of it. He also almost sailed down the mountain, hanging onto only the 4 by 4 flag. Which has been punctured, so in addition to getting equipment, film, actors, crew, planning, and shooting this week, I also have to get two giant flags reparied. The flags only fit in a car I can't drive because I'm no insured on it9long story).  Point is- my mind and my soul are both completely scattered. And yet, they are very focused. Every moment is geared towards the movie. Or it should be. When I go to long without making a phone call or scribbling down a note, or a plan, I start to feel lazy. I hardly sleep, and my smoking has really become absurd. Packs and packs of Marlboro reds getting sucked fdown into my lungs. Hardly been to the gym, eating when possible, and drinking sometimes to shut up my mind and just pass out. Only to wake up always too late, and run out the dooor and back into the fray.  Locations are never secured, actors always have schedualing problems, crew people always cancel at the last minute. And it's always hard to get what we want. At the same time, everything has come out right so far- of course the film has ye to be developed. So for all I know everything is garbage., under exposed, overexposed, or just looks like shit. Maybe it's all great but won't cut together. WHo knows.  And at the same time I am dreading this being over. It gives my life meaning and it's all I want to do. Regardless of the discomfort it may require. I just hope we can keep weathering this storm and get this thing done. It's fun, and it's hard and so far, we're doing okay... Or so it would seem..."
N5H7URL,male,23,"This entire blog must be prefaced by 'in my opinion...'  Many movies came out this weekend. For the first time all year there was a multitude of interesting movies to go see. Of the three Once Upon a Time in Mexico was the one worth skipping- unless of course you need to jump onto or hold your spot on the Johnny Depp band-wagon. That's not entirely fair. The movie was fun.  In the meantime, both Lost in Translation and Matchstick Men are worthwhile movies. The difference seeming to be that one was another well polished, and interesting piece by a few well paid professionals at the peaks of their hollywood careers. The other was a sophmore effort from someone who had a big hand in ruining the Godfather trilogy and made a really really really interesting movie the first time out.  I think these things summarize the difference entirely. Both lacked in the screenplay department- and had strange story problems. They also both seemed to me to be very deliberate and very well executed. But why compare these movies? I don't know. I guess because I saw both of them recently.  At the end of the day I preferred Matchstick Men, and am curious to hear from people who agree of disagree. While I think it was easily the more 'hollywood' in all the bad ways- it was so beautiful and it was edited and paced so wonderfully- while Lost In Translation hobled along at times leaving me in scenes I didn't understand the purpose of- I guess I was 'Lost in Translation'. This may have been the intention. And thats fine. Matchstick Men also was experiential in a similar fashion. The movies put you in the heads of their characters well- and at the end of the day it's kind of a question of what head you liked being in more. Though I can't stress enough how much each movie pulled this phenomenon off- and how well. In this sense I am in awe of both.  I'm sure most people who want to sound smart would like Lost In Translation more on principle, just like most people who really are devoid of any intelligence at all would like Matchstick Men more on principle. It's a complicated world we live in. Be it Tokyo or Los Angeles.  Bill Murray is a genius- by the way. And had he not been in the movie, I never could have watched it. It was a nice piece in the puzzle of Bill Murray's excellence- where Nicolas Cage's excellence in Matchstick Men was almost depressing given that he is so frequently doing awful movies.  Suffice it to say it's time for me to go, and both movies were well worth the time and the thought. I thoroughly enjoyed going to see all three movies- even the Mexico didn't enter the film nerd forum I just laid forth par excellence. Movies are fun. ""They"" finally gave us some decent stuff to watch. God bless you all, and God Bless the Wienstiens."

N5H7URL,male,23,"IN THE JUNGLE BABY   We hae been shooting our jungle scene in my parents backyard. Wednesday I trucked, along with karen, a ton of shit from Orachard supply hardware to the backyard. We created our jungle, and it looked pretty good. We weere most concerned that it wouldn't look right, and it did. Then the mag jammed and we had to cancel our shoot. Acrtors all ready to go, set in place.  Thursday we had a new mag, and we perfected the jungle. Including the addition of a barrell Ryan bought online for 40 dollars. The barrel was a huge point of contention. For one, it ha to be picked up at my apartment in hollywood. 2, it was broken and needed to be reassembled. And four nobody seemed to understand why we needed to spend all this time on the barrell. Nobody but me and ryan. But mostly ryan. Being that I'm the director, I'm given to appealing to the needs of others. And the many were ready to get going and fuck the barrell. But ryan wanted it, and I made it possible for ryan to get it and defended it by saying, ""One barrell may be meaningless, but if you let 5 or 6 barrells go then you ruin your movie"" In making moves it is important to sweat the small stuff.  This is one of the few things I have learned of which I am certain about movies. Because they small things add up to make a movie, a barrell here, a barrell there... thats what makes the difference. A glitch in the sound track, and frame with a scratch on it. It'll ruin everything. Any straw will brealk this camel's back. You cannot allow for imperfections. And we are lucky to have a bunch of very vocal perfectionists on crew, and even luckier to have an obsessive compulsive director.  But in the end we didn't shooto thrusday either. Neighboirs had a huge party. Neighboring teens. Terrrible sound. I even confronted the drunk neighbor mother. She was pissed off. But I did my best.  Cancelled the other shoot, shot alll MOS. Last night, frioday, we finally go to it, and covered the two days worth of shooting leaving us one day behind. I kept them until 5. Their nerves were frayed- they were having a hard time.  Gotta go for call. More later"
N5H7URL,male,23,"High and Low and Last Picture Show are both very special films to me.   And instead of talking about why they are great I will talk about why they are particularly special. I saw them both on the big screen. And they came out more than 30 years ago.  But I saw them at a little piece of heaven that is called the New Beverly theater. It's on Beverly right near La Cieneaga, about a block north from where i live. But If I could life at the new beverly instead, I probably would.  The seats are shitty, the sound system terrible, the screen smallish by today's Pacific Theater standards, and the rell to reel is pretty humerous when you get right down to it. But the movies are the best ever.   In a given year the new bev will show about 10-20 of the best movies you'll ever see. And the rest of the cities theaters will show maybe 2 or 3 really great movies, and maybe 5 total good ones. But probably not even that.  Anyway, seeing these movies the way they were meant to be seen,  for the first time, can never be replaced. Just llike seeing a movie at the new bev that I'd seeen on video millions of times(Chinatown) was a whole new expeience and made me appreciate the movie in a way I never had before.  Movies are about 100 years old. There are not to many 'art forms' that are that young. One can watch all the great movies, and all the near great movies, and all the not great movies, and then decided for themselves how to break up the list in a fairly short priod of time. But if you want to be able to doo that and be trult film literate, there is no better thing that a new bev. IT's a godsend. It's a filmschool in an of itself. But probably better than any film school that really exists.   Thats said they show some pretty shitty sutff every once in a while. But I'm not judging. Seeing Last Picture show and High and Low was huge- I went out after each and bought the respective DVDs, and sure the quality is better, but the experience of watching them at home, even on a largish screen, will never compare to the first time in the theater. Which is an experience I never would have had if the New Beverly hadn';t exists.  I once compared movie theaters to chruches, claiming that the arclight, or the Grove theater are akin to the great cathedrals of all time. This may be true. They are perfect places for the experience of movie/religion. And the new beverly is, to continue with this comparison, not a big beautiful church with amazing paintings on the cieling- primed and ready to bring you enlightenment. Rather the new beverly is a small ramshackle little place of worship, hardly held together by it's one minister/rabbbi/priest/monk. But it's the only place where you can definitely talk to God.   Anyway, I probalby won't go there for a few more weeks. I don't go everyday or all the time. I try to limit it to moviees I really want to see again, and movies I haven't seen at all. Everyone I know is disgusted with the chairs, and the sound, and the whole building. But it seems a small price to pay. SPEAKING OF SMALL PRICE the tickets are half price of any other ticket in LA, and it's a double bill. But since I'm not really plugging the place since nobdoy will read this, in all liklihood, I simply reccomend that if anybody does go, they offer to pay full price, or find a way to pay for both movies, and total to the same price of one shitty charlies angles 2, or bad boys 2, or whatever shit you go see. Because the new beverly is perenially down and out, and scraping to stay a live. So it might not always be with us."

N5H7URL,male,23,"I wrote a poem. And I'd really like to share it with everyone. Don't be quick to judge. I used to be into making movies, and... well I guess I sort of realized that all the good ideas have been taken. Like Pieces of April, for example. I heard about it, and thought ""Shit. There goes my thanksgiving-family-drama-but-heartwarmingly-funny-and-touching story."" So I went home and shredded that screenplay.  Then I saw a trailer for ""In the cut"" and I lost all hope in the future of my 'detective-thriller-sex-mystery-suspense' screenplay. I shelved my horror movie comedy franchise with the opening of Scary Movie 3, and I burned all the exisisting notes for my foray into the cyber-space-phiosophy-action-adventure-saga with the Matrix films.   Because the thing is, In Hollywood, if you're ideas aren't brand new, then get the fuck out. You know what I'm saying? I guess it's all been one big old reality check. Being a sutdent of film, as well as a lover of cinema, I've realized that I don't have anything to say that isn't about movies. And we all know nobody likes movies that are at all referential to other movies, or to the movie medium. I like movies so much I've been have sex with a 35mm reel o the bicycle theif, which I've never even seen, but I know it's supposed to be pretty fucking good.  Suffice it to say, I've come to see my life as a meanigless excercise in cinematic form, and since I can't string togehter two thoughts without quoting a movie, I bascially think I need to move in another direction ENTIRELY.  So... that said... and thank you for bearing with me... Here is goes...  A Poem By Orson Weldon 'Rising' Speilcock  The kitchen smells the kitchen smells Indiana Jones The kitchen smells.  So? I know, I know. It has a movie reference in it. But You hae to write what you know? right? Thats what the people say. So I wrote what I know. what I really really really KNOW. And I was sitting in my room, Seven Samurai paused on my melted television, and I thought to myself, ""George... what do you know?""  And I had a thought. I know that the kitchen smells. And I know Indiana Jones. Like every line practically. So I put pen to paper, and magic happened.  The first draft was about 30 pages, but I winnowed it down, because, less is more, right? And So eventually I got to the bare essentials. Repetition of major themes, and maybe the inroduction of a twist near the act II denoument, and finally a nice resolution that seems somewhat inevitable given the nature of the tale I was unwinding before you."
N5H7URL,male,23,"FREE REVIEWS  I've seen some movies recently. And I'm gonna write some FREE REVIEWS.  GODS AND MONSTERS is a movie about a man who made movies. And it Stars Ian McKellan as the guy himself, James Whale. Maker of Frankenstien and Bride of Frankenstien. He falls for a guy who cuts his lawn and has a eerie resemblance to the monster(Brendan Fraser- sorry if I spelled his name wrong). I heard somebody(I think it was my mom) describe this movie as Sunset Boulevarde with a gay man. But this is not entirely fair- though it is a 'good call' as we say in the vernacular.   Where Sunset Boulevarde is a big ole' heaping microcosm(what a contradiction), Gods and Monsters is a very localized idea. Susnet Boulevrade is about the way in which Hollywood does what it does to the people inside and out. And G&M is about one guy who had this happen to him.  Well, ths was going to get interesting- but My girlfriend is here, and I have to go to a bar. The problem is I should drink. But I don't think I will because I'll also drive. And even one drink makes me uncomfortable to drive- even thoug I'd be fine and under the legal limit. I end up pounding glasses of water after glasses of water and them my mouth goes numb from all the cold water and then I feel like I'm slurring my words and maybe I am drunk- it's a bad twaysh.  Plus which I feel wierd right now because I just do and I want to take my medicine. But I should wait until after the bar.  P.S.- I have been working at the story boards of the movie that is a carrot on a string dangled in front of me but always out of reach. In a week or more I've no finished the first scene. Is this part of being obsessive compulsive. Probably. But I have a motto when it comes to making movies. SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF. I'll explain this idea at as later date- but it's a good thing to remember at all times- but especiall when makin a movie. And as lon as we're on the topic of sweat- I am sweating like a pig due to this heat.   -Captain Anthony Lewis"
N5H7URL,male,23,"Hey folks,  So tommorow is Halloween. I was never a huge fan. Never big on candy. Never big on things that are scary. Most of my Halloweens have been speant in odd, unorthodox, and downright lame ways.  I've been told that as a young child the 31rst was spent hiding from trick or treaters in terror.  After that period which last through high school, my halloweens were devoted to figuring out which group of friends to be with- and which to betray. I also devoted a few good halloween nights to playing video games in doors with friends, as if the night wasn't even happening. Suere there were a few that had to do with causing trouble, and running from police. And, come to think of it, there were a few that combined all of the above. One thing has remained constant: not my favorite holiday.  But then what is my favorite one? I'm not one of those anti-thanksgiving people who tells horror stories of family dinners, or dreads them. I know most of my family has some 'tension' during the fated meal, but I've always found the whole thing to be a great time. But I don't eat turkey. Which is odd to most people. I'll eat it in a sadwich, but not with bread stufffed up it's gaping ass hole. Save that for the pilgrims. Besides, once I saw a wierd movie about Thanksgiving.   I like a christmas. But that's always been an issue since I'm supposed to be Jewish. Even though noen of my extended family was ever into the chanuka thing. I guess three or four generations back(cue godfather II music- sweeeping shot of tenements in NY) we spent lots of time trying to assimilate. The irony is that my parents moved to west LA and enrolled me at places like crossroads where there were more Jewish kids baffled at my christmas celebrations than there were christian kids celebrating my seemless assimilation.   Valentines day is odd, if alone you feel that slight jerk towards finding somebody to be with. Even if you're happy single, you feel like maybe you should start waking up before nooon, shaving everyday, washing your clothes, or getting a job. And if you're attached it's the  'show how much you care' test. So either way you're fucked.  I think fourth off July is the best one. I can remember a bunch of good 4rths. It's a day when everybody(in this country- and thats everybody who counts) gets together and gets drunk, eats meat, and blows things up illeagally.   What more do you want from a holiday? Oh yeah- it's dead middle of summer so you're about as far removed from giving two shits about anything as you could be, and you're probably about to go see an overhyped and destined to suck movie, but you're still just a little bit excited.  I've had a few good fourths. Some involved the bottle, some involved the lord, and some involved just some quality time between me and the good ole' US of A. Once there was this thing on AMC called ""Indy-pendance Day"" and it was an Indiana Jones Marathon on fourth of july. That day rocked. What a great country.  -Robert Paulson"
N5H7URL,male,23,"How did Scarface(1983) get to be such a big deal?  I saw it last night, in it's extended re-realease run at the Arclight, and the theater was packed.   As far as remakes go, though, it's one of the more acceptable cases in my mind. partly because the guys who made Scarface seemed to have loved the original, and also seem to know that the original is and always will be the superior movie, even if the mobs of fans at the arclight will never think so because it's in black and white, and nobody gets a chainsaw to the head.  One of the cool things about Scarface is called Grand Theft Auto - Vice City. Which is, incidentally, much cooler than Scarface.  Recently I said something about sizzle, and the bullet effect, and I'd like to take the time now to add to the complicated theory, that Scarface, though it is mostly sizzle and very little steak, is not getting dated. Rather it seems to have latched into the eternal sizzle. I think it's through the character. I've always had a soft spot for guys like Tony Montana. Characters that almost seem to big for the world, and eventually they must self destruct as a result. What I see in the original scarface was a movie that benefited, almost, from censorship. It became suggestive, and it's fascinating implications story wise and character wise led to flocks of film nerds, including Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone, who read into Scarface things like the incest thing.  What I see in the remake is a movie that could have used a little censorship. Not just the gore, because gore is fun, and anybody who says otherwise needs to get with the times and get a little de-sensitized to cartoon violence. In general Scarface is a movie of excess. Sure, that's the whole point you want to say, but it's not just excess in the money the guy has, but the was the movie re-iterates it's points over and over and over. And it also gets so caught up in inner workings of Tony's rise without paying much attention to the natural laws of our universe. Like when people get gunned down in the street in front of mobs of people there tends to be a problem with the police. Eventually...  Regardless, if you live in LA, check out scarface at the Arclight simply because it's a great theater, and all movies, great and small, deserve to been seen in a place of worship. And as far as Theaters go, the Dome at the arclight might be the Sistine."
N5H7URL,male,23,"MAXWELL  Ever listened to Abbey Road all the way though, no stops, no interuptions etc. etc.? Well you should. It is, in my opinion, the best beatles albumn. I only believed this once I heard it astraight thru. It's kinda like one song, repeating themes, and choruss throughout. It's great.  AND I also have to say that it might be my faorite albumn of all time-- my vote for best of all time. I am a big fan of the rolling stones-- but the beatles have always been my number one band of all time. it's just not okay to say the beatles are your favorite band. You need tyo have something else that isn't so great to be your favorite, and then you go ahead and list the beatles as 'the best'. THats how I feel about it.  Look, there are a lot of 'best' movies out there. BUt I don't think much of the people who pick them as their favorite. Like ""Citizen Kane"". Or ""Battleship Potemkin"" or ""The Bicycle Theif"". You can't say those, maybe you can say the bicycle theif. But you can't say Kane because we all know KAn is great- revolutionary- unbelieveable- etc. So don't say it. Pikc something thats you- for your favorite. That you know is falwed and you know isn't perfect and you know not everybody else is totally in love with it. MAYBE the stones are too mainstream for a favorite by this rationale.  But they aren't like the beatles. Their like, right under them. Way under them really, but you know what I'm tryin' ta say.  I try to think of, for my favorite, very imperfect movies that moved me. Like my favorite Kurosawa movie. Most would say Rashomon or Seven Sammys. Well, I think both are incredible. And as much as I love the 7 sams, I can't say it's my favorite of his. Even if, in some ways, it is. Because it's known- it's very established. I'd like to pick a movie of his thats a little less seen, a litttle less attention is given to, buit is still deserving of best titles, and really really hit me hard. etc. etc. And thus I say, ""High and Low"".  When I think of John Ford movies I shy away from 'man who shot liberty valance' and 'the seachers' even though I dearly love and admire them both. I might say Stagecoach, or The Quiet man. SImply because their less highly touted- though still highly touted, and their not 'a given'. So if somebody asks me my favorite ________, I try to say, ""Well, ______ is the BEST- in my opinion"" ""But my favorite- the one that touched me that is special TO ME and not really the BEST per se, well that'd be ___________""  Sure, The searchers toouched me a lot more than stagecoach. But... everyone says the searches, it doesn't need my vote, and there are othes that are just as special in different ways.  It's all about Beans my friuends. Eat them a plenty."
N5H7URL,male,23,"See Master and Commander. It's a fine movie. If you want someone to see it with gimme a call cause I'll gladly see it again. It was great.  Jessica Lynch.  Just wanted to put that out there.   But in the meantime I want to tell you all a thing.  Josh Scheer slept in my bed.  Maybe you don't know who that is. But I do. And he stayed the week here in my home while I was in New York. I friend of mine, he is. But I had no clue he was coming. And he slept in my bed.  And that's fine. It's fine because, hey, he's a good guy, and he can sleep in my bed anytime if he wants. But I'd like to be asked first.  I'd like to be asked first, so I know that we're cool. That there is a respect, and honor invovled. That we can trust, and we can love. With no trust, we can have no union. Josh and I.  But that aside, the whole being asked thing, I would have also liked, even if my input and privacy and space were not respected enough to warrant a request, I would have also liked to be TOLD when Josh slept in my bed.  This- this my friends is the truer, and much deeper transgression. Though not being asked was a transgression of sorts, this one runs to the bone.  I wasn't told, for it was thought better that I not know. More than this, it wasn't until a loose lipped aquiantance named Daniel hartley told me, that I ever knew the truth. And my roomates, my brothers in arms, my comrades, my countrymen, my squires, my other muskateers, my friends... they didn't tell me... and worse than this... they never would have...  This my friends, is the true blow to the system. For while I would have gladly given dear Joshua my bed, and all my belongings upon a request from the brother of so dear a friend, I was not asked, more than this, I was not told. And was never to be told. And only discovered by accident. Respect? Honor? Loyalty? Not in this house. Not anymore. And thus tonight I mourn and shed a tear or two for the union that once was... the holy trinity that is now... broken...  Maybe Brando can lift my spirits. New Bev 4 eva."
N5H7URL,male,23,"THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOKS  At the ripe old age of 23 I think I may have begun to learn, or begun to learn how to learn that there are things more important than looks. By looks I mean surfaces, and surface appeal. It is the kind of thing I have know, or understood when people talked about knowing it- but I have never known it to be true for myself- and now I think I'm about done with reading the experiential preface of the instruction manual describing how this phenomenon works.  Last night I had dinner with friends, among them a woman who has a high ranking job in a major studio. I did not know what she did at the time of the dinner- only learned later- but I knew she was involved with movie making. We talked about how she got started- she asked me about my movie- I tried my best to give the pitch. She said it sounded incredibly ambitious, and interesting. I guess that's a start. Regardless, I wasn't too concerned with the pitch, or what she could do for me or the movie. One must learn to take these things with the tiniest grain of salt. What I did gather from the experience was that many of the things I have believed to be true, but only based on instict, and impression, were in fact the case.   She confirmed for me, firstly, that the times when she worked for nothing, and was penniless, were the best times. The most fun, the most exciting, and the most pure. I always intimated such a thing about these times for myself- but it's hard to see it as true when you're trying to get the drunk sound guy his ADR, the demanding star his veggie sandwich, your roomates a new fuse replacing the one you blew, and the stunt guy a location for the next shot. These are moments of complete overload. You are one person, and you must do the jobs of many. But I always knew this was the good stufff and these were one day gonna be the good times.   She also confirmed for me that it was all about starting out with passion for it, and starting out with quality work, so as not to kill a career with work on Agent Cody Banks 2 before you even get your career going. Would I love to be offered Agent Cody Banks 2? Fuck yeah. But I'd turn it down. I am very fortunate to be able to. So in this sense, among others, it's the love of the thing, not the thing itself, and it's quality, or it's pay check, or it's promised fame and attention, but the love itself you must strive for.  Ahh, therein lies the moral of this twisted tale of filmmaking we are trying to spin. Yesterday we shot the most takes of any one shot we have done. 13 takes. 13 takes of brother Alex as older Glenn Kahan reflecting on the meaning of his very famous trilogy of adventure films. I shut my eyes each time I called action and tried to impart to him the way to do it. I tried to talk to him about it in every way I knew- to try and tell him not the effect I wanted, but the way to get thee. i tried experiences I knew he had. I tried stories about my experience. I tried references to other media- interviews etc. I tried changing inflections on certain words, or taking certain pauses. It didn't ever quite hit every note in one take. Each take had ups and downs. It wasn't ever perfect though.  I even tried to use the force a few times. I shut my eyes and focused on the way the words should come out- the feelings he would have- the thoughts he would have while he said each word- etc. etc. It did work sometimes, but then sometimes it didn't. Suppose I need more jedi training. At one point I stopped and realized, here I was sitting on this floor, running through my mind memories of the methods of great directors I read about- Kazan, Huston, Speilberg, Ford... the list goes on of those I've obsessed over, the notes I've taken. But none of it was working out just right. Was it Alex? No. Alex was great. Was it me? Maybe. I did my best. Regardless, I had a thought on top of all these others in this moment- I thought 'wow. This is it. This is what it's all about. And this is fun'.   And the following thought was the hieght of coincidence(not irony graham) that there we were shooting the scene where Kahan literally says the the audience, ""Watch the movies again, maybe they didn't find the bird- but you'll have fun watching them try- and then maybe you'll agree with me"" and I learned that very thing- I saw myself experience it. Fascinating. As my trainer would say, it was movies about movies in the movies for the movies making movies. And it goes on.  So why the whole thing about love and appearances? There are many things in life that deal with this issue. To claim i really know, or am ready to act on being a process over product kind of guy would be absurd. It's hard not to care about making money. And one shouldn't. We need money. It's hard not to care about sucess- social, romantic, relational etc. etc. But sometimes perhaps we can glimpse the bigger truth beyond ourselves and our ends and our goals. We can just see that it was all about the doing, and it wasn't about the prize we won or lost. It was an honor just to be nominated. And before that, I suppose, it should be an honor just to get the chance to try."

N5H7URL,male,23,"Hey Gang,  I saw another movie today. It's called Cabin Fever. If you see it, I'm sorry I couldn't warn you sooner.   After the movie I ran into some people I knew from high school. Their names were Jessica and Joanna- for the record. At first we stared at eachother for a good 10 minutes from about 2 feet away, both contemplating whether or not it was too late to ignore and thus be counted as rude. Then finally Jessica said something.  ""George Edelman""  And I had to respond.  ""Yeah. hey. I knew I recognized you- but I wasn't sure....""  This bullshit went on for a few more minutes and it was abundantly clear we wanted nothing to do with each other. Eventually where I lived came up and I said,  'I live in hollywood'.  This, for whatever reason, really bothered Joanna. She made reference to it frequently over the next few minutes, almost as if to suggest that I was lying somehow. I don't remember all the comments but I remember a few.  ""Hollywood. Really?""  ""Hollywood... Don't you live with peter and peter? I thought they lived in park labrea?""  ""Where is Park labrea? is that hollywood?""  ""Yeah- what a weird area- what do they call that area? Fairfax district?""  This bullshit went on for a while- the whole time I would respond with things like   ""Yeah.""   ""Sorta""   ""West hollywood really""   ""People get confused easily about locations""   And then finally I said,   ""I just say hollywood because it makes me feel cool.""  Which is entirely true. And at this point things took a turn for the more alkward. My friend peter scheer arrive- they all exchanged renewed awkwardness, and then they left.  I guess the point is that Joanna thought I was lying. And this really bothered her. Sure, maybe was exaggerating, but I do feel like I live in Hollywood. Because Hollywood is a state of mind, man.  That's not entirely true. Hollywood is also a place that I don't live. But Joanna didn't feel I should get away with lying. And she's right. Why should I? So I told her that I was lying because I pretty much have a low self esteem, and then she shut up.   Joanna was also kind of bookish in high school. Which is not to say there is anything wrong with her, but I don't really remember ever seeing her or talking to her. I was vaguely aware of her presence. Maybe she's angry about that. Maybe she just likes Hollywood and wishes she could live there and doesn't think anybody should lie about such a thing.  Regardless, even If I don't live in Hollywood, I breath the same shit air as Hollywood, and I figure if they can give me cancer, they can lend me some of their coolness as well.  But the bigger truth is that living in Hollywood really wouldn't be all that cool. It's kind of a lame place. It'sd a good place to live near because you don't have to see tourists all the time, taking pictures next to their favorite hand in the cement. But you want to be able to tell people that you live in Hollywood, and you want to be a quick drive away from Canters or Mels, and especially the new Beverly theater.   Also, I may not live in Hollywood, but I live about a block away from Simon, and if that doesn't make me cool than nothing ever will.  Alright- time to go. Wish me luck. I'm going to make a movie soon, and I hope that it will be really good.   -Wilhelm Von Gesas"
N5H7URL,male,23,"THE LITTLE THINGS  When you try to make films, and I imagine this is much the same with poems, paintings, novels, or even brochures, you try to capture a moment, essentially, of undiluted reality and convey it to others to let them experience somethingmaybe you experienced, or to remind them of the universal experience we all share.  Today, when hunting for jewlery for the Hank Masters character as playe by Richard Gleason, Richard and I had some experiences. The best was watching the married richard try to convine a young armenina slaes girl in the jewlery department of macys that he was an expert on Eygyptian mythology. That was a moment I captured. But then later in the day, with bret, the sound man, howling about elcetrical noises in the walls, and Graham the Dp trying to frame up a shot tighter than I wanted it, and Ryan building a box that could fit the lovely kelly mcpheters in so she could beak out and suprise everyone in the jungle campsite scene, I tried to cpature different moments. Moments from movies, or tv shows, moments from media, momnets real from one side and artificial from another. But moments were captured.   Another moment I saw was Peter Scheer, beloved roomate, climbing into the fountain in the park at park la Brea. I watchewd him tumble, half naked, COMPLETELY drunk into the bottom of the fountain and emergh, in only his boxer briefs, with a blood soaked arm, walking in a jagged line. It was something to behold. I watched Peter K patch up his wounds, and I watched as then mr. sheer tried desparately to put a drawrer he knocked onto the floor back into the dresser, but he was tring to put it in sideways, all the while screaming, 'Why doesn't this fit i the wall"" band-aids on every surface of his right hand, and blood dripping donw his elbow.  It was a moment. So was last night with Kim when I pulled her into her shower and made out with her, only to see her pull away, and futher confuse my already confused mind. This was real. Getting a good shot of Randy Ross as Frank Austin on his couch was not real. But it becomes real eventually if we do our jobs, and it becomes a mold thru which other expereinces will be viewed and understood. Twice removed as they may be, they are experiences and they are universal.  The edit, or the cut in film is a powerful thing. And we cut in our eyes, we cut in our minds, and we constantly jockey for final edit with variopus parts of our psyche. ""This is the version where I failed"" , and ""This is the re-edit where I suceeded"" eitherway it is true, and eitherway it is false. What remains consistent is something ineffable and beyond our language of understanding. But the best part is that we try to communicate something and we somehow, get something across. Just because we understand that our symbols and sounds are essentially arbitrary, we also must understand that they frequently hold a kind of meaning we can't help but agree on. from time to time...   For the two women who will have their day and soon make me a one lonely man."
N5H7URL,male,23,"TUCMCARI, NEW MEXICO  On my long drive across the continental united states I had many thoughts. They ranged from earth shattering, to profound, to simple, to silly, to absurd and to stupid. I wanted to write many of them down in this blog. But I never really had the time.  I learned some good thigs. And I forgot some of the good things I learned. That seeems to happen far to often. I have taken to writing everything down, but usually I lose stuff like that or it just piles up and I never look at it anyway.  The point is, while enjoying the Oklahoma sunset, I realized that all of these profund thoughts could be stored, recorded, turned into screenplays, or chapters in my novel, or 'blog' entries. I could have said them to my brother while he drove and feighned interest. I could tell them to people when they ask me 'how was your trip', but I realized that all of this was unnecessary. I had those thoughts. Some would be forgotten and lost. And no matter how important or valuable, they wouldn't amount to hill of beans because one day we die, and nobody counts up how many great thoughts you stored. They all go as quick as they came.  And with that I decided not to attempt to communicate the thoughts. I had them. They are over. Perhaps they will work their way into my work and my being. And perhaps not."
N5H7URL,male,23,"This will be the last blog for a couple days now. Something about this blog is frustrating me. When I posted my series of misspelling jokes last time they came up in sequential order, so if you read from the top down, as we all do, it makes no sense. Kind of like the movie memento.  While we're on the subject of that movie, I know everyone really loved it- but it kind of frustrated me. I think it was entirely too gimmicky. Imagine if you saw that movie in proper order. It would be one of the stupider movies you'd ever see. So then, what makes this movie so great. The fact that the guy decided it should be backwards.  Today is the anniversary of 9/11, and I thought I might as well mention that. I'm not a big fan of 9/11. Not just the event, but also everything it led to. It really changed our world for the worse, but then again maybe it just made us aware of things we had an easy time ignoring. I'm not going to start getting political, partly because I'm not in the mood, and partly because I don't have the time.  And partly because Johnny Depp got really political recently and had to take things back.  I have a question.  Why should anybody care, let alone print, what Johnny Depp thinks about America?  He doesn't even live here anymore. But even more than that, he's just an actor. Now, I'm not saying actors are stupid... and I'm not saying that people out of politics don't have the right to an opinion. But it really doesn't matter enough what old J.D. thinks to have him taking things back. At least it shouldn't.   Which brings me to the other inevitable issue of current world affairs. Actors running for Governor.

N5H7URL,male,23,"These walls can't talk  In the spirit of semi-zen like blogs I had another zen-like thought recently.   My living room has been uprooted and destroyed. it's not really my living room. It's my parents. And it's really just a lot of rubble and dirt now. It's not really sad- maybe psychologically distruvbing, but I am already fairly psychologically distrubed right now so it's hard for me to say what is the real culprit. Could it be the living room? Maybe. It might be a lot of things that I'll keep from this blog.  Regardless, the roomis more or less gone. It strikes me, in the spirit off wathced pots boiling, that the room no longer exists and that the room saw me grow up. It saw many events in my life. It saw a bunch of thanksgiving pictures taken. It saw us sad when family died. It saw me fall in love once. It saw my mom preganant with my sister. It saw my ssiters whole ife to date. It saw christmas a bunch of times. It saw some fights, and it saw some laughs. It saw a lot of this kind of stuff. It never blinked. It never feekaed out. It never got sad. it never got angry, it never changed. it was just sitting there the whole time, like time lapse photography.  And to think I've only mentioned the big things you can see. It's been there when everyone who lived in that house was in psychological unrest, or joy, or internal suffering or pain, or happpiness, or suprise- feeling you don't show or maybe you doon't even know you have or thoughts that fly through your head and freak you out or get you excitied. All the while the room just sat there and it never blinked.  Sure it never blinked, it doesn't have eyes. And as long as I'm making that pointl, I'll also mention that it can't 'see' any of these things at all given the no eyes thing. But I think you get the underlying point. I mean not jjust to mourn the loss of the atoms that made up the walls and foundtion on whicht he room stood. I mean simply to state the thought I had about those atoms, which was that they saw it all; an observer and participant for all their days. There is a kind of enlightenment to that.   I guess that why people say 'if these walls could talk...' but I'm not really thinking about what the wall would say, because the wall would say nothing. It can't talk and thats the point. It was just there. And we should all be so lucky.  Sorry if this blog is like the last one in i's oddness. Just sharing my thoughts I guess. I hope they are interesting."
N5H7URL,male,23,"I suppose it's important to try and post something here for nobody to read on a regular basis.  I would like to take a moment of your time to issue statement on a growing dilemma. It has become somewhat taboo in my very small world to be in awe of, or find any great value in movies that were made more than 30 years ago.  Case in point might be Charlie Chaplin's silent movie ""The Gold Rush"". Being that my interests lie in the field of movies I am particualry open to mockery for liking such a movie. But contrary to any such belief, this is not the kind of film anybody shows in Film school. And it's really not a movie just for film people(though anybody who takes the history of film at all seriously should certainly see it at some point for purely referential reasons). The Gold Rush is for anybody and everybody. It'll be entertaining to anybody and everybody. Thats the nature of the movie.  Furthermore, the notion that an old thing can't be as good, is just as absurd as thinking that an old thing must be better. Many a great movie today stands on the shoulders of Chaplin and the Gold Rush. If you care about the art form, you should go out and see the movies that helped form it along the way. Not so you can get in a 'A' in a class, or show up some other film nerd, but because you care about the art form.   Sure there are some things that date the Gold Rush. Like the lack of on-set recorded sound. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth it to put yourself in the mindset of the person at the time, and appreciate the film on it's own level. Surely if you can't get into The Gold Rush, why should you bother trying to read Shakespeare? Just because something is rough around the edges and requires some thinking, and some stretching, doesn't mean it has no contribution.  Also- there is a reason things are called ""classics"". They've endured- they've perservered, and people and continually found reason to appreciate them, and try to understand them. It's important to pay attention to why something is considered classic, before you decide to be your own man and disagree. The only person you cheat in that instance is yourself. Citizen Kane  is a fabulous movie. So is Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Are they different? Sure. But that doesn't mean you have to hate one and love the other. The ability to appreciate both on their own level is something worth striving for in any field, but most certainly in one you care about.  So if you do bother to watch the Gold Rush, you'll be pleasently suprised. It's only about 90 minutes, and it passes quickly. The best part comes towards the middle- so stick it out even if at first it seems silly and inacessible. It's not all comedy.  That said I have to go finish watching ""The Searchers"" now. I've already seen it, but it's a really great movie and anybody who likes movies should give it a chance. On top of being one of John Ford's best movies(in my opinion), and one of John Wayne's best performances(in my opinion), it's a clear influence on Lucas and Speilberg in a variety of ways. The influence is clear as recent as in episode 2, oddly enough. There is one sequence he lifted right out of it- and not to his discredit. It's a great sequence in ""The Searchers"", and Lucas uses it cleverly, so it becomes a great sequence in Attack of the Clones. Except for the acting. Say what you will about John Wayne, he was much better than The Haydze."
N5H7URL,male,23,"Hello friends.  I am growing a beard. Why? Why not? It seems perfectly appropriate. I may shave my head too. We'll see.  When did drinking become so important? When I watch a western I see guys guzzle liquor and it's cool. Like in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" when John Wayne storms into the bar and guzzles shot after shot of whiskey, then just takes the bottle and leaves. Thats cool. But thats also a movie. And in real life John Wayne wasn't so cool.  And in real life when I find myself sitting at my office(Cafe Balcony on Rochester adjacent to the intersection of santa monica boulevard and Centinela- stop in anytime) I often overhear young people, my age or younger or older perhaps, discussing the amount they drink, what they drink and how often they drink it. This isn't cool. It's not uncool though- because it's dangerous. It's just sad.  It's sad because drinking in and of itself isn't much of a thing to do. Drinking is okay when you got laid off. It's okay when you won the lottery. It's okay when you got dumped, or stood up. It's okay if it's the office christmas party. It's okay if you just shot liberty valance but Jimmy Stewart's gonna take the credit AND get the girl. And it's even okay if you're out some night having a good time. But it's not okay every night. It's not okay most nights. It's not okay every time you wanna have fun. Or most times. Or even half the times.  Because there is a lot more to life and being alive than liquor. I ain't no preacher, and I ain't getttin on no high horse. What you do with your liver is your buisness. All I'm tryin' to say is that drinking, in an of itself, is no particular achievment. It's nothng to be proud of. Anybody can do it-- and most peeps do. And anybody can do it A LOT. and, again sadly, most peeps do.   So to wrap this up for ya, don't go wandering around talking abnout how you drank a bottle of malibu last night at Jimmy's house. Or how in your prime you could do century club five nights in a row. And don't go braggin' about spending nights shooting tequila and writing down how many shots you took because you watched a Hugh Jackman flick.   I'm sure every being has something, one special thing, that they can do. And while there is, according to this world view, somebody who got the 'drinking' skill as their one special thing, it's probably not you, and it's probably not a skill you want for your one special thing anyway. Whoever is the guy who has the one special thing of drinking is probably not even reading this and probably doesn't talk about how cool he is for drinking so much. He's a very sad guy, in all liklihood, and he's probably somwhere drinking right now. As I write this, and as you read it and at all times.   Point is folks, drinking is fun. But it's no special achievement by any means. I don't care who does it and how much, but I just get down when i hear people talking about how good they are at or how much they can drink. I want to grab that person and shake them and say, 'SNAP OUT OF IT DAMNIT! YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS!'  If you can't tell already I find this blog to be very psychologically revealing of myself. Now that it's all written and done with. Perhaps I'll go rewatch ""Tapestry"" on Season 6.  Godspeed to you all.  -Gfunk"
N5H7URL,male,23,"WHOA WHOA WHOA  Read a few things, B's, and I have something to say.  Birth of a Nation. Just because it's about racists doesn't mean it's overrated. Sure it's in my character to defend the first cinematic epic- because that's how I do- but let's be reasonable here. Birth of a Nation is a classic xample of _______. So please... don't fuck around.  Also- Terminator movies are wonderful. They aren't overrated because nobdoy sees them as anything more than really nicely ut together pulp fun. Which is the deal with James Cameron, and the problem with Titanic.   I digress.  Two related problems. Cinema is not art. New York is better than any other city in the world.  I can relate them easily. Because, I think both parties representing said views are more a case for sympathy than anthing else. Oddly enough I'll bet those parties could be the same party more often than not. LA is new, and so is cinema.   I think people who say movies cannot be an art and that New York is far superior to LA are hanging on to something- unwilling to see other sides of the coin that is life. But more than anything else, you can tell a lot by the passsion with which people espouse these views. What does mr. James Joyce have against movies? Why does he hate them so? SO much that he is determined to prove their inferiority. Doesn't it say more about him than about movies themselves? And what does Alex have against Titanic, or James Cameron? Or birth of a nation- doesn't that aggression speak volumes about Alex and his perspective, more than it does prove anything definitive about any of the movies he mentions?  And what about Peter Scheer? Though he caught himself, doesn';t his rampant anti-new york pro-la attitude suggest that he has something to hide- or something to defend?   I mean, who really cares what city is bettter? And who would really ever think they could prove one is over the other once and for all, and more than that, who would even care?  I don't like Titanic, but I'm open to having a discush on the movie. What I'm not opne to is people blindly slamming things just for the sake of slamming them. Cities, movies, books whatever. it's all part of the same wierd inferiority complex, and very unbecoming of a jedi.   All this has led me to believe that Alex and Peter are not yet ready for the trials."

N5H7URL,male,23,"GOOD NEWS!!!!  So the poem was seen by a movie producer and he's optioned a screenplay of it.  The rough part is he demanded that I write two sentences that really introduce each character before they enter the story- like one or two sentences that define the character in a nutshell.   When he first asked me to do this I was really excited, and thought it all kind of ironic considering that the mov was meant to signal my detachment from the industry of dreams, but when in Rome...  In the preliminary meetings I told them I was a little worried that the plot might be spread thin over 120 pages but they maintained that it wouldn't and in fact, it was almost too dense for a mainstream hollywood piece, and I might hqave to find something to cut. Which is also gooing to be difficult given how strongly I feel about the whole thing.

N5H7URL,male,23,"I saw the Seven Samurai on the big screen last night. I'm still reeling. each time I see it it's better. At this point not a moment of the 3+ hour long epic seems unnecesasary to me. It is the tightest movie, and thats amazing since it's so long. It is truly a masterpiece. I could go on, shot by shot, moment by moment. If uyou really want to hear it ask me in person. I' ll be glad to talk about it endlessly. To think it's a masterpeice and the guy still had a bunch of kick ass amazong movies left to make. A true master of cinema. I know everybody says so, but I must agree.  The whole thing reminded me that there are only a few moments ina any and all of movies that make me cry. One is in Seven Samurai. I'll mention the few.  FUCKED UP WORLD WE LIVE IN  This is the seven samurai one. It's when Kikuchiyo(Toshiro Mifune) runs into the Samurai planning house and throws down the armour the Farmers they have sworn to protect have stripped of dead samurai they had once hunted and killed. Kikuchiyo, being born a farmer but in allegiance with the Samurai, sees clearly this cycle. He screams. How could the farmers be so petty and so evil, but then who can blame them when the Samurai frequently raid their villages, raping and pillaging. The cycle is endless and awful. And after he lets it all out so eloquently, a shot of the group in solemn silence. Heads down. Close up of Kambei(Takeshi Shimura) his eyes well up. Mine too.  DEBBIE!!!  He swoops in on horseback, chases her up a hill. Over the hill in the distance runs Jeffrey Hunter, hoping to stop Uncle Ethan(john Wayne) before he does his worst to poor Debbie, captured by Chief Scar. Ethan cocks his gun, catches up with her, the horse bucks, dust flies, all shot from the dark inside frame of a cave. And then he lifts her up in his arms, as he did nearly 2 hours ago when she was a little girl and their search had yet to begin, ""Lets go home Debbie."" Always brings a tear to my eye.  ""Look how they've messed with my boy...""  It's either this line, when Sonny(James Caan) is shown to Bonesera the undertaker, or the moment when He sighs almost uncontrollably when Tom(Robert Duvall) tells him that Sonny was shot in the causeway. It wasn't until I saw it in the theater that the moment worked for me. Until then it was just Brando as the Godfather-- which always seemed a good but funny perofmrance to me. It worked one day in the theater. And now it always does.  Rosebud. But that almost goes without saying for a film nerd like myself. Not at the beginning. At the end. Chills and sometimes tears.  TATOO 1 and TATOO 2  Up and out of the sunken Lars kitchen. Out onto the homestead. The music starts low, the wind blows strong. He looks off to the suset and orange light basks his face. The greatest advbenture any of us would ever go on sits on his doorstep, and he loooks out like we all do, hoping that it will be so. Hoping he'll find his place. The music swells. gets me EVERY time.  A GAME OF CATCH  He takes a second, after building the field, to play catch with his Dad. Alone. What can I say? I'm a baseball fan and even my hatred of Costner couldn't ruin this moment for me. It's tough to sit through it without some crying.  There are more. And I'll mention them later. But it's poker time. Go watch a good movie and cry.   Godspeed"
N5H7URL,male,23,"There is a song. ""Wish you were here..."" by pink floyd. The first time I really listened to it was on a raod trip to Santa Cruz. We were already there and driving around on a gorgeous spring day. It was a few years ago. I had a short in a local film festival. We drove around, trying to get the lay of the land. I remember riusing up over a hill in the road and coming down it to see a giant pier like place. An amusement park, without many people. The giant ferris wheel- the one that stands up like a wheel and spins people high then brings them down. If thats a ferris wheel. I guess the ocean/bay was beyond it. But I remember the sky more. It was beautiful.  And I remember playing in Molly Malones on the juke box while having a few drinks(during a time when I was more likely to) and seeing my brother after he came back for the first time to visit from his New York College Sarah Lawrence. The bar was not crowded. My friend and I had both selected the song with our money without knowing it.  Once I was driving late at night with my two friends, one of whom was from Switzerland and I only see him every few years or so. We had a great time while he was here. And as they passed a smoke between them on the overpass between the 10 westbound and the 405 soouthbound to LAX, i heard those familiar soft tune, and the lone guitar plucks that begin 'Wish you were here...' and I raised the volume. How appropriate, I thought, as we sped down the freeway, saying our silent goodbyes.  Last night it came on my brothers ipod as we drove home to pacific palisades after a night at the Dive we and friends frequent. I hadn't heard the song in a while. My brother was back again from school not wanting to go back. I was getting over and through a very stange post collegiate time in my life- I still am.   And today on the way to doctor in Bev. Hills while driving on sunset through Bretnwoood. I sought it out on the ipod Alex had left in my car the night before. I blasted it and it sounded pretty good. Still a nice day. The song was short, but sweet. I thought about it, and you can't hand on to any line or moment in it, it just kind of passes by, a few choruses a few verses. The long intro- waiting for it to get started. But it seems to be over before you know, and it leaves you wanting more. But you can always play it again."

I looked through an old photo albumn and saw my entire  College experience flash before me in a series of hair cuts.  A series of three haircuts. It was odd. I also thought of all the places the stuff in her room had been in previous rooms. The Sorority house. The dorms. Etc. Same stereo. Same nightstand, or book shelf. New room.  And then I thought, well isn't that kind of like life. I've seen this person, her, or even myself, in all these strange places. Same person. New place. And then in looking at the pictures from say, spring break in Cabo, and I would think, 'Oh yeah. I was there, wasn't I.' Then the more I thought about it the more it seemed like Annie Hall in a wierd sort of way.  You know annie hall was originally a murder mystery. But it didn't work so they made it a love story. Something like that. Check imdb for more details.  I also went with a roommate to a commercial agent today. He said, as we walked into the building, ""This is the kind of building that you never notice until you have to go in for some reason."" It was true.  Then there was this guy at the coffee place later who heard me ranting about what kinds of movies people should be in, and he said, 'You like movies, eh?' and I said, 'sure.'   ""Are ya in the business"" I lauged, ""Are you"" The guy looks at me and then he says, ""I was. I was around it. My parents, a few girlfriends, my grandma owned a studio"" some more horseshit like that. He dropped some names I've never heard of, which i think made him feel old or wierd. And he was both.  ""So what do you think of the business after all this exposure"" I asked him. ""It changed. It's not like the good old days.""  I smiled. But what the fuck does that mean? I mean, I'm sure he's right. But it's still a silly thing to say. The good old days for this guy was hanging out with television stars in the 60's like the guy who played Dennis the Menace. I'm sure to a great many people these were not the good old days.   I often look forward to when I'll refer to right now as the good old days. Probably won't take long considering my flash of nostalgia when I looked through a two year old picture book.   Well, thats all for now. Give me feed back if this isn't working for you.

N5H7URL,male,23,"MOVIES ABOUT MOVIE WITH MOVIES ABOUT MOVIES  I alwaysd cop out when people ask me what my film is about.  ""It's about film""  Thats the best way for me to answer the question.  I could say, 'It's about doing what you love... It's about how life is different from and similar to fantasy- or about how fact and fiction become intertwined, or how media changes the nature of things and information and truth. I could write aq few papers on it. I could make another movie about it.  My trainer(yes, I have a trainer, laugh, groan, smirk, vomit, or whatever you feel is best to do- I am terribly spoiled but I always did gag on that silver spoon)  My trainer aslked me what my movie was about while I was mid crunch and I said, 'Movies"" he laughed, because he';d asked before. Imagine him, in his thick Czech accent ""George makes movies about movies. What kind of movies do you make george, oh - movies about movies, and what are the movies about, hmovies. They are movies about movies about movies. Go to da movies, make the movies, movies and movies in movies about movies..."" Now whatever I do, lunge, squat, press, lift, grunt, and sweat, he's got a chorus going of movies movies movies movies. And even though he knows nothing about the movie, he couldn't be more dead on as to the nature of the project.  And what more do you want from a guy who lives and loves movies? When I was young my father told me that too many filmmakers just only new about film and made their movies about that. I have become what he warned against, and nobody thinks very highly of it. But I have intellectualized it a bit further. Whether that comes across or not, here's how I see it.  It's all about medium and the transfer of information. And the movies are amazing because they alllow us to all experience universal thoughts and feelings- they indicate our true experience, and we mimic them, but do we mimic them, or do they mimic us, and what part of the mimicry is good, and what part is bad.   Plato said there could be no Homer, beautiful as his words were, because it lied to humanity and gave them flase dreams and aspirations to be things they could not be rather than focus on the nature of their lives- of the truth. Aristotle disagreed a great deal with his teacher, claiming that it is thru fiction that we reach a kind of catharsis- not just a release- but an opportunity to see things play out as they may if one was more like character X, or Y. They allow us to meditate on the ways of being human. To see ho w we want to be, or how we don't want to be. For example, on a ride home to a wife you may be annoyed with, you might here a bad country song about how a guy misses his dead wife and wishes he never lost his temper with her. This is cathartic for the listener- for now he may rethink his actions- he has seeen a scenario that played out his thoughts and feelings.  Fiction takes humanity for a test drive. Imitation and mimicry can be dangerous. Thus the struggle of my hero Calvin Doerner. Calvin mimics all the wrong things of the fiction he was a part of- he misses what it is to be a part of it- what it was the thing could truly impart to him- he missed the point, and to quote a great film ""Billy, we blew it."" an opportunity to leanr how to focus on experience and process rather than the ends and the riches, or the failures and the sucesses. The movies he did had that message. But all he got from them was how cool the costumes were, and how much ghe was obsessed with the lead actress. he saw the dougnut and not the hole, and he should have focused more on the hole. Or the whole, depending on how you want to see it.  In the nmeantime, production is on halt. I medidtate on the meanigns and long term goals of the project, and struggle to find a chinese restaurant, a dungeon, and a few diners. Soon I'm off to the gym again, and then to re-write the schedual with rpoducer Ryan Nagata. Last night we took a night off and did some Kareoke at a place called peppermint. What a time. Lots of singing. I did ""My Way"" and then ""Always on my mind"" among others. My vooice is god awful. Only Graham among us could sing well. We drank too much. The Kareoke room was odd. I picked a fight with some old shlub who was holding Kelly in a way I felt was inapropriate. kelly did her best all night to make me jealous and push my buttons. Which wasn't hard considering I had drank scotch whisky- which always has only the most awful agressive effects on me. Why is whisky like that? It just makes you want to punch somebody.  But today, when I finally arose nearing 2 o clock, I was reinvigorated. I needed time away from the film in my mind, and I needed to blow off some steam. To the tune of 90 dollarts, but we'll take it out of the budget... I wish... In reality it was a good night to let go, and now I';m ready to take on whatever comes up next. personal life wise, as well as professionally. There are so many more tales to tell of the making of the film. But it seems now we are poised to get back into it and keep up the good work.  Of course I am still terrified at the film development process. This could be a big hurdle, and I try to prepare my self for the possibility that everything comes out like shit. I just don't know how I'll cope. I know I will because I always have and I always do find a way- but it's gonna be a pretty big fucking blow. Of course my mind is already thorwing around some contingency plans... not happily, but you gotta be prepared. In the meantime I'll try to watch some movies I love, go out to a movie, a relax for the next two days. This is recharge time, and my only hope is that the film comes out well and the project gets a chance to be even a fraction of what I know it can be for people. Something fun, something insightful, and hopefully somethnig useful when it comes to approaching the fictions and fantasys we love. We shouldn' let them go, we just need to find a better way to relate to them. Star Wars isn't about ewok toys. Or opening weekends. It's about a timeless message that could let us all lead better lives. I hope to be able to illustrate something along those lines- it's about the message. the message in independant of the medium- and never to be captured by it. The medium is another message itself entirely- and at that no message at all.  A final quote. ""The only kinda sucess is failure and failure ain't no kinda sucess at all."" If only I could learn to believe this."
N5H7URL,male,23,"QUITE SOMETIME  Welcome dear reader, to the longest two weeks of my life. The longest, and perhaps the strangest. What can I say? I'll say litttle more than that a best friend of mine told me today, and I'm paraphrasing- but here it goes, that I was single-mindedly obsessing over an ill fated ill concieved movie that had me in way over my head, which I could only afford to make because I was essentialy spoiled,and incredibly selfish.   This is the classsic form of kicking a man when he is down. I haven't ever been kicked when I was down before. It was really something. But I didn't get mad. I got a little upset about it. It was interesting to hear about yourself from the outside to such a degree of detail. I'm not mad at the friend. Thats just the kind of guy he is. We don't get to choose things like who our best friends are. Somet9imes they're just complete assholes. Everybody is an asshole sometimes. Even me.   So as this, first day of shooting, passes and we do nothing but try desparately to lock things down for the shoot this weekend, I think only that I should just try to focus and have a good time. Do my job and have some fun. It's just an experience. I very well may be single minded, spoiled, foolish, crazy, selfish, and self destructive- my brother told me a few days ago that I was on a quest to destroy everythiung good about my life. But regardless of if these things are true about me, I am doing what I wanted to try and do.   I wory because sometimes things like this get me riled up enough to go above and beyond. But right now it's just making me tired. Will I rise to the occaision, or keep on struggling and failing to get things doe the way I dreamed they might be done. regadlress, I'm going to stick it out just to see, and I ain't goin down like a punk."

S8EVJFK,male,23,"Women Say Dentist Made Them Swallow Semen  1 hour, 13 minutes ago Add  urlLink Strange News - AP  to My Yahoo! CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Former employees of a dentist claim the man made female patients unwittingly swallow his semen during visits to his office. Dr. John Hall is accused by the state dental board of violating dentistry's standard of care, engaging in immoral conduct, and committing sexual assault or battery.   Six former patients say he tricked them into swallowing his semen. A seventh claims he jumped on top of her in the dental chair and ""began to gyrate against her lower body in a sexual manner.""  The dental board suspended Hall's license Nov. 5, after police began investigating allegations by two former employees. In February, it conditionally restored his license, barring him from being alone with female patients.  Hall's lawyers say the dentist has been falsely accused by disgruntled former employees. He was collecting his semen because he was taking Propecia, a drug to promote hair growth, and was concerned about potential side effects that include low sperm count and diminished semen, his lawyer, Emerson Thompson, said.  The dental board heard testimony Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The hearing is to continue next weekend.  The five-member panel will decide whether Hall can keep his license. The case is still being investigated by authorities in Charlotte, Cornelius and Mecklenburg County.  Hall's former assistant Cheryl Lynn MacLeod testified Saturday that she found it odd that Hall began asking her to leave a patient's side to retrieve items that he never used.  She also became suspicious when she overheard him tell patients to ""swallow"" something, and when she saw him take a syringe out of his lab coat pocket while working beside a patient.  In May 2003, she and former office administrator Susie Hillman took the five syringes from office waste containers and Hall's lab coat pockets and gave them to police.  Hall's lawyer, Thompson, suggested the substance Hall asked patients to swallow could have been a dental product.  But in a sworn deposition read aloud Saturday, Hall's former dental assistant Rhonda Hamilton described several dental products used in Hall's office and none matched the patients' descriptions of what was put in their mouths.  When Cornelius police searched Hall's office Nov. 5, they confiscated five more syringes with Hall's semen from his desk, according to the board and hearing testimony.  Five of the six patients testified Friday. The first, a 40-year-old woman, said she objected when Hall began to put a substance from a syringe into her mouth during a procedure on Sept. 4, telling him: ""That smells like sperm.""  She said Hall drew back and said, ""You're crazy."" She said she couldn't taste the substance because her mouth was numb.  Another witness, a 33-year-old woman, said Hall asked his assistant to retrieve something from another room during her appointment in May 2003. While the assistant was gone, she said Hall told her to lie back, open her mouth and swallow.  ""When I swallowed I tasted it, and it was semen. ... He told me it was cleaning solution."" She said she drove directly to her husband's office nearby and told him what happened, but he and a colleague dismissed the idea. She said she tried to convince herself she was wrong, and contacted police only after hearing about the investigation on the news."

S8EVJFK,male,23,"Alright everyone, I have a new library patron to tell you about.  An African woman comes into Northwest from time to time to get books, and her name is Princess Bempong.  Yes that's right, the system has her listed as Princess Bempong (not sure if that's a title or a name, but either way...).  She often comes in with her deaf servant who makes extremely loud, yet indiscernable, noises constantly.  Sometimes grunts and sometimes groans, and sometimes just hollering.  Here is the usual scenario:  Princess Bempong will come up to the counter and will make her servant ask for the books (which of course means just a lot of loud and embarrassing noises).  Since no one can discern this fellow's gestures or sounds, she gets frustrated and signs with him for a minute or two (while he's still grunting and groaning) and then finally writes down what she wants, and makes him hand it to us.  At this point we can usually help them, since what she writes down is an easy enough request.  But what I don't understand is why Princess Bempong doesn't just tell us what she wants...you see I know that she can speak because I've spoken to her on the phone and in person on more than one occassion!

S8EVJFK,male,23,"John has been imploring me to tell the story of the night I almost blacked out on his toilet. I don't know that there's too much to explore here, but I'll give it to you.   A couple of weeks ago I was hanging out one night at John's place. A natural urge came upon me so I went to the bathroom. Something was wrong though. As I sat there, allowing the natural course of events to occur, I suffered from what felt like an intense head rush. My vision narrowed down and I began to lose feeling in my body. I thought perhaps it was normal, but no! I could only see a small patch of wallpaper with my tunnel vision, but I knew this was no ordinary bm. I had to stop it or it might kill me. So I grabbed the rim and tried to slow the process down, but I felt like a truck was driving through me. I realized that strategy wouldn't work, so I accelerated the process. The effort it cost me was immense, and I was shaking and sweating. I only survived because I went empty before I totally blacked out. Still, at the end I was shaken by a violent convulsion and I fell back against the tank of the toilet, sending a candle holder to meet its doom on the floor. For a few moments, I had to sit there just resting. That was the most effort I've ever had to put into an evacuation.   I still don't know why I had that one particularly bad episode, but all I can say is I hope it never happens again."

Last week I was in my library one night after we'd closed (having returned to use the phone). It was rather dark but I noticed what appeared to be a huge roach crawling up the wall over the Spanish books. I got the flashlight and indeed, it was a huge roach. I decided the only thing to do was use it for target practice and shoot at it with rubber bands. I had shot off several and was on the verge of giving up, but I decided to go for one more. I got the biggest rubber band out of the box that I could find (and I'm talking an 8"" diameter here). Amazingly enough, I hit the thing! Unfortunately, I discovered that the rubber band wouldn't do a significant amount of damage. The roach got away. Perhaps I need larger rubber bands."

SK2QH96,male,13,"urlLink    (fifth day) Since only residents are allowed to have cars, we did a lot of bus (and ferry) riding. This is what all of the bus stops look like."
SK2QH96,male,13,"Below are a bunch of photos from my family's trip to Bermuda. We went from the 19th to the 25th of June. The pictures are in reverse chronological order, so scroll down to the picture from the airport to start from the beginning. Since I didn't want to overwelm you all with pictures, I only chose a few. In total we got about 75 pictures from the trip. Enjoy!  -Tristan"

SK2QH96,male,13,"urlLink    As my dad and I were picking strawberries, this sneaky chipmunk tried to get into the small patch, but rightfully got stuck in the netting."
SK2QH96,male,13,"I've posted two photos today (not quite a la  Your Waitress Photos ...). They are linked in a way, one, a photos up the stalk to the flower (not blooming at the moment) of a lotus. It shows it being supported by a small, twisty-tied  tube. The second, a small vine of some sort growing up, twisting and bending, without any support at all. Right into mid air...      urlLink    simple support      urlLink    climb"

SK2QH96,male,13,urlLink    (second day) another picture from the porch. This picture shows the color of the water well. It really was that blue.
SK2QH96,male,13,"Well, I'm back at it! To make up a bit for all the days I missed, I decided to post  three  pictures today. I hope you enjoy them.   A note about the photography class :  I thoroughly enjoy it. I was pleased with most of the prints I made and I learned a lot. I was correct in predicting that going back to the Kodak point-and-shoot camera would be painful. There were pictures I really wanted to take, but just couldn't because of limitations of the camera. I hope that soon I'll have a digital camera with which I can take all the pictures that I would like to.  [Shameful begging starts now] If you would like to help me get a camera with which I can take pictures with real creativity, a donation would be  wonderful . From one dollar to  five hundred, they all would be greatly accepted. If you would like to donate, click the donate button on the right column below the copyright text. [/Shameful begging]  Anyway, it's changed my view of photography. I enjoyed doing black and white and I think I might start doing more black and white or de-saturated photos. We'll see. I hope you enjoy these three pictures.  -Tristan"

SK2QH96,male,13,urlLink    This was so easy to make and turned out pretty cool. It kinda looks like it could be one of those  ambigram things . It's not though. I love the 'S'.
SK2QH96,male,13,"urlLink    I'm not sure if this is a butterfly or a moth. If it's a moth, it's a pretty nice-lookin' moth"
