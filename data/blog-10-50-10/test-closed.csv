ROAO66H,male,25,"Dear Smarty Jones,  Welcome to the Pantheon of Philadelphia Almosts.  By the bar you'll find John Kruk and Eric Lindros discussing might-have-beens.  Near the television are Ron Hextall and Allen Iverson discussing individual greatness in the face of team collapse.  And perusing our vast library of periodicals from championship losing days are Richie Ashburn, Donovan McNabb, Pelle Lindbergh, Ron Jaworski, and Mitch Williams.  I'm sure you'll feel right at home.  Sincerely, Philadelphia"
ROAO66H,male,25,"The past few days I have sat and pondered new things to place up on the blog, but came up with nothing.  Today I think I have realized why, I am just not that interesting of a person.  Now don't confuse yourself by saying ""Well I am reading this post so maybe he is semi-interesting"" we all know this is just not the case, I just intrigued you with a strange title and you had to find out what the hell I meant.  Looking at the blogs recent activity, or lack there of, it seems obvious that the rest of you aren't very interesting either, or at least not on paper.  Perhaps we should all talk to the DAU about setting up some sort of class to remedy this."
ROAO66H,male,25,"When you are a little kid, you always have some dream about being something when you grow up. Some of us wanted to be baseball players, bakers, president, GI Joe, or something exciting. I always wanted to be a Ghostbuster. Nobody when they are a little kid dreams about being an engineer and sitting in front of a desk all day doing nothing. And if there is a little kid like that, it is probably because he read to much Stephen King that night and had a nightmare. But that doesn't matter because here we are. Almost everyone reading this is some type of engineer or related field and probably reading this post because they are bored, a very common theme with these jobs. I mean why would you want this job anywho?? The most exciting portion of my day is either checking cnn.com for the 25th time, making sure no new deals have been posted on slickdeals.net, or making sure that some life altering email hasn't arrived in any of the three email accounts I have found ways of accessing despite my company's best efforts. This is a sad thing, because obviously if I have the time today to write this post, it means that none of these things have happened yet. And probably never will. Someone here told me, maybe engineering just isn't the thing for me then. Well how could it be for anyone? If you have a desk job as an engineer, that means that you correct mistakes and oversee other engineers who are actually building things, and not sitting at desks. We watch people do fun things, and do none of it for ourselves. This job has actually given me so much time for boredom, that I have contemplated so many other jobs so many times, that there is no way I will come back again. And that is why I invite you to join my quest to build Skiz's Glenside Lanes. Open invite right now to invest in company sure to boom. I know that older skiz has lured many of you to his place of worship on multiple occasions this year, and that you have learned the gods of this sport can be very confusing at times. But imagine owning a temple of your own to worship at. Those gods would have to be more forgiving at that point... right? So, who wants in? I'll send out more plans later perhaps, but right now I just got busy. The front page of CNN just changed, I got an email, and lunch is closing in. Busiest time of the day."
ROAO66H,male,25,"I have come to the realization today that there is not only 1 bowling god, but 2.  There is a more sinister bowling god then any of us have ever dealt with.  His name is Gooter.  Gooter doesn't show his nasty little face all that often, but when he does, watch out, because there is nothing you can do but walk back to your seat and get ready for your next meeting."
ROAO66H,male,25,"Today was another fine day in never ever land.  There was bowling, eating, spamming, and oh yeah I did do about 20 minutes of actual work (excluding time spent reading the attention grabber ""Introduction to Algorithms"").    It is really amazing that the blog is still alive and that people from beyond our realm have joined in the fun (albeit to launch an assault, but I'm not pointing fingers).  Now the question I have been pondering is was this person (let's call them anonymous to protect the innocent) a random web junkie who happened to stumble into this mess, or was this a profile browser who decided to click on the site?  I am hoping for the first since that would mean our influence is far more wide spread than I had originally thought.  And a final note Yankees have the best record in baseball and KonTee and I have the best record in bowling, coincidence?  I think not!"

The article is about the recent debate between Andrew Sullivan and Richard Goldstein at the New School.  Paglia's choice to be published in a hysterically conservative magazine is an odd one, but the good thing is that it will alert conservative readers to the fact that they need to choose between the libertarian and the authoritarian wings of conservativism. Paglia's explicit support of ""the transgendered"", as she puts it, should show readers the difference between her civil libertarianism and FrontPage's typically regressive authoritarian politics."

But the lyrics are often explicitly non-Christian.  Everybody wants to taste A little something carbon-based. Sex is proof the Holy Ghost Crawls around in stuff that's gross.

From a google search, it appears that this is not the common usage that I thought it was. People seem to call them the monotheistic religions, or the Western religions, if anything. One might be tempted to call them religions of the book, but I think that this would be misleading when one considers the enormity of the Hindu scriptures.   Come to think of it, Islam didn't originate in Mesopatamia or Palestine, so my usage really doesn't make sense. I'm going to have to ask some of my historian friends what the collective term for these three religions is."

MFUZWD0,female,17,so this kid is walking down the sidewalk and i'm driving down the road - i look up and he falls down - total face plant. i think he saw me laughing.
MFUZWD0,female,17,je m'appelle ... qui?
MFUZWD0,female,17,"Water+Slide+German Child=M A D N E S S  We tend to get a lot of germans (and also french come to think of it...) come to stay at the Ramada. I am not sure why, they are just there. Most of the time, at least one parent speaks English, so they can then translate to their children the waterslide rules, however, the kids almost never speak English. As I discovered last night...  We were busy to begin with, our limit is 42 people max, and we had been at about 37 since noon. (""Why can't we sit here in the hot tub again? There's only 20 of us in here..."" ""Yes. That is exactly it. There are 20 of you in there. There is supposed to be 8!"" - How is that even ccomfortable? Don't get me started. lol)  It is now 5:30. You have a nervous German kid, unsure of what to do... What will you do??  So we finally come to the conclusion that his father will catch him at the bottom of the slide, and after using a wide variety of hand gestures I got him to sit down on his bum and go down the slide. (No, you do not want to know the hand gestures I used! lol)  Well, I guess his bathing suit was sticking to the slide (This happens with some synthetic materials.. lol that was very technical.. thank you! lol *bows* -lol that was for you Mark.. lol) and I think he got scared, because he stood up (IN THE SLIDE!) and started grabbing the side of the slide, and kept looking down the middle, preparing to jump or something..and proceeded to WALK DOWN the slide (because apparently that was the answer...)  By this time, Adam is also at the bottom using a wide variety of hand gestures, trying to get the kid to sit back down on his bum to go down the slide. This didn't pan out so well.. (You think??) because there's water shooting down the slide.. when you add a kid walking down all that, it's not good.. so I had to shut off the slide and Adam had to climb in and get him. I was so worried he was going to jump.  Why are all these Germans here anyway?"
MFUZWD0,female,17,I miss SW. She's back in a few weeks. I can't wait. It was good to see JP today. I missed her. I hadn't realized how long it had been until I saw her. She's amazing. You never know when you're making a memory.

MFUZWD0,female,17,"agggghhhhh! Why. That's my question. Why do I work my butt off when there's no one there to back me up. Why... I don;t know. Why do I manage to hurt myself every game? I fell down toay. Total face plant on the stairs. It's a tough day. I hate the grade 9s. Stop complaining, you're so small. Sooo young frosh..  I didn't get to pitch. Even though I practiced. SS pitched well, CS wasn't as good, she is really inexperienced. Needs to lose the windmill so she can get her accuracy I think. If she's lucky she'll get a strike if the ball drops but after walking 5 for 2 innings, she still got put back in. So frustrating? I mean, if you're not going to let me pitch, fine. Put SS back in then, but that is just plain ridiculous. AGGGGHHHH. I think I pulled a muscle. That really isn't good. I hope it's okay. Ack. I want back up. Back Up! Back Up! ....nothing."

THWVU51,male,25,"I don't know where to start.  Not that anything of major interest is going on.  Rather, it is simply because I am at a loss as to what to talk about.    Tonight was the 3rd Speed Dating event I have gone to.  It is also the 3rd Speed Dating event I have gone to that did not happen.  It's starting to piss me off.  I'm trying to put myself out there at least.  Apparently the all women event was full and was a big success.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Gay men suck, and not just 'that' way you dirty dirty people.  It's not like I am expecting to find 'the one' at these events.  Hopefully I could meet someone I would at least be willing to hang out with now and then.  It has been a long time since I have had a friend of the same persuasion to hang out with.  I miss Zack a lot.  And yet I make very little effort to spend any time with him.  There are others who have offered, and although I am interested I seem to resist.  I don't know why.  Maybe I'm afraid of gay people or something.  The one thing that does piss me off about the speed dating is as follows; It take a great deal of effort to make myself look presentable.  But it ends up that there was no reason to put forth the effort.  And whoever says that it's not important how you look on the outside, it's the kind of person you are on the inside, was obviously not a gay man.  I know it sounds cynical.  It is cynical, but this also applies to me.  I have met some very nice people, who would probably be good to date, you know...if I actually found them attractive at all.  I truly believe that most people are inherently superficial.  Unless of course they are completely ugly, in which case they don't feel the need to judge others, those lucky ducks.  That paragraph makes me sound like a bad person.  If you know me, that means you know that I often am attracted to men who are not conventionally good looking.  This is where the ""geek quotient"" applies.  That being an equation that measures the appeal of a man or woman based on their geeky attributes.  Geekiness is totally sexy.  Nerdiness on the otherhand is highly unfortunate.  And dweebiness....puhleeze.  As for spaz...well they usually have big dicks but otherwise not attractive.  Somewhere along my way I have lost my train of thought.  Maybe my train of thought was big dicks all along.  That would be rather odd, as I am certainly not a size queen.  I have a feeling I'll be editing some stuff out of this post tomorrow.  But until then.......See what a big freak I am ;)"
THWVU51,male,25,"It's funny that I am so afraid to talk to my parents.  Indeed I just don't want to disappoint them, although I invariably do things to that affect.  Even though they would never say they were disappointed in me.  They just want consultation.  I think the time has come to confess everything, and to let them into what my life is like, starting from way back and coming up to the present.  And I thought coming out of the closet was going to be hard.  Imagine having to tell your parents that 90% of your waking thought has been devoted to wanting to kill yourself, and that said thoughts have existed for almost 20 years.  And imagine even more having to explain that the only reason you haven't followed through on said thoughts is that you would never want to hurt them, and thusly you stay alive for them.  It's not likely to go over well.  And I'm not going to do it to soften the blow of decisions I have made recently.  But rather, I think that everyone has been kept in the dark long enough.  I make allusions to certain things, but I rarely blatantly speak of my thoughts or feelings.  And even to those people who are reading this thinking that I have opened up...well...I still keep quite a bit to myself, actually almost everything to myself.  The glimpses I give don't tell the whole story.  Anyhow I needed to type something because I have been trying to sleep and failing miserably...as usual my thoughts are eating me alive.  Lousy carnivorous negative thoughts...curse you and the horse you rode in on.  To the sky I look, The distance and the awe, But rather is seems to me,  that the sky is close at hand, hanging above, falling perhaps, graying clouds, thunder strikes, I cry crimson tears, and then the sun rises, and all is calm and innocent once more.

THWVU51,male,25,"I would like to start this blog by pointing out that my friend Laura is not nearly as bad a speller as she appeared to be in the comment she left after my last entry.  In fact she is intelligent, beautiful, and all other nice things you could ever say about one person.  Having said that however, let me add this special note to her: ""Seriously were you drunk or something when you wrote that???  I think we need to have an intervention.""  Ahem...so yes...I have invented a few terms in my day.  Wait, did I talk about ""Queek"" already???  I can't remember if I did.  That is the term referring to a queer geek of course.  Which thusly is a term I can use to refer to myself.    So it was just Sunday, and I'm not in an utterly terrible mood.  Although I was a while ago, and there's no telling how I'll feel when I go to bed and the sound of my brain kicks in.  Damn brain.  I believe that my own thoughts drive me nuts, but if I tried to share these thoughts, or if someone were reading my mind all they would hear is ""AFLAC!!"" I'm not actually sure what that joke implies or if it's even funny.  Well I tried at least.  I think it's about time I went to bed.  It's another week.  More potential for change.  More likelihood things will stay very much the same."
THWVU51,male,25,"Is it wrong to enjoy a movie that is thoroughly awful??  Well although that's a rhetorical question, if it did have an answer it is certainly no.  If it were wrong to be entertained by bad movies, I would have a very small movie collection.  Actually I do have a small movie collection but that's beside the point.   So yes, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, terrible.  It is based on a graphic novel.  Which, for those of you who are unaware, is like a big comic book.  Anyway the graphic novel is actually British in origin.  But as we all know, American audiences tend not to understand anything British, either by choice or by genetics.  So in they bring the allegedly attractive Shane West as Tom Sawyer.  And aside from one good joke at the expense of the American character, it just takes away from the dynamic of the GC.  In fact the GC is actually incredibly light on action.  But I don't consider it worth writing a review of, you can go see it or not.  I think it has something to offer, whether it's a good or bad thing would be up to the viewer.  Just keep your expectations low.  Bottom line, Sean Connery still rocks, even though he hasn't made a good movie in 20 years."
THWVU51,male,25,"Well tonight was speed dating.  As you may recall that was supposed to happen back in April but didn't due to lack of interested parties.  This time around there were enough people signed up, but very few came.  Five to be precise.  So needless to say it didn't go ahead, but I did sit with these people and talked for a few hours.  I had a good time.  Plus the goal was accomplished; That being the going out and meeting strangers in a public setting.  Take that social anxiety!!  Although my somewhat lack of social skill did allow me to make a fool of myself a couple times.  Or so I believe.  I didn't mean to talk as much, or as openly about myself as I did.  Oh well I can't take it back so there's no point dwelling on that.  I also won a coupon for a free brunch at Vortex.  I believe I will enjoy that.  There is a display of art there by Trevor VanDen...ummm....spelling this wrong but here goes....VanDeneiyden...I don't think I'm even close.  Very interesting pictures, some including hot boys, and one including  ""fellow"" as he is referred to in this blog.  For those who don't know ""fellow"" is the last person I dated for any amount of time, and I am still left with some unresolved feelings over the whole situation.  The picture makes me smile.  I wish it didn't but it does.  I was always smiling when I looked at him.  Oh well.  So now I end up dating yet another nice guy who doesn't seem to give a shit about me.  But not in a bad way.  More of just an impartial way, as though, it's good that I'm there.  But it wouldn't make a lot of difference if I weren't.  My priorities are all wrong I know.  I don't know why I feel this need to be in a relationship.  Or why I seem to think it is the link in the chain of my life that is keeping everything from coming together.  Wow that metaphor was terrible.  The one thing I have always wanted is to stay up all night talking to someone...just talking...perhaps walking on the waterfront when it's later, and quiet.  I've never really done that with anyone.  Well I walked along the waterfront with that professor from SMU that time, but there was no relationship like intent there.  But i have definately never stayed up all night talking to a guy about life, or even generic things like music or movies or what have you.  I don't want to work tomorrow.  And I have this rather strange pain in my right pectoral area...I'm not sure what's causing it.  Perhaps it will flare up and I'll have to go home early.  I'm not sure why I'm hoping for such a selfish thing.  I suppose because it's much more likely that I will be injured and sent home from work then something more selfless, like world peace.  World peace???  Talk about pipe dreams.  Alright enough rambling for now.  I guess I am trying to make up for a lack of updates with a long entry.  Well if you read it, then good for you.  Your attention span is much higher than mine."
THWVU51,male,25,"What can you do with a day?  What will you wake up and see?  The farther you get the closer to me.  -Dar Williams ""Closer to Me ""  I am not sure what the point of putting those lyrics there is.  It would make more sense to put something that I wrote there.  But to be honest, most of the poetry I write is so dark it frightens even me.  Therefore it remains locked away.  Today has been a day like any other really.  Working in the morning, and a long nap became necessary.  And so after drueling plenty and leaving my throat dry enough to sing Bonny Tyler songs I am now awake trying to figure out what to do with my evening.  Packing should be on the agenda, as it's basically 2 weeks til the big day and the more prepared the better.  Ah, screw that being prepared is a boy scouts thing.  And I ain't no f*cking boyscout.  The unfortunate thing about napping in the afternoon is that I am now going to be groggy for the next 5 hours.  So anyone who is on MSN with me right now keep in mind that my brain no work good now.  I'll write something else later...because I don't have anything to say at the moment.

THWVU51,male,25,"I have have taken that right turn at Albequerque    I can't spell that word for the life of me, and I don't care.  I was thinking tonight about how I got here.  I mean to this time in my life.  I wonder if in some alternate universe I made all the right decisions and am living happily, without despair.  And hopefully with Elijah Wood.  If indeed the theory is true that all things that can happen do happen.  Which if you really put some though into that means that in some other realities I am probably dead, in others I am living and happy, maybe in others I'm still closeted and engaged to a woman.  Well you never know I suppose.  Bah, nothing else to say."
THWVU51,male,25,"Why is it that sleep resets everything.  When I go to bed at night I resolve to do better, to get my shit together.  And I know that I can.  But then when I wake up in the morning it's all gone, and I can barely resolve to move my flabby ass out of from under the quilt.  And then I go to foolish things such as get taken in by sweet words from someone who has about as much relevant things to say as Colin Powell.  Why oh why???  I should know better than that, I can see right through the language and I knew what he wanted.  He just wanted company, and he still does.  Not relationship company he just wants someone to cuddle with.  Which is fine, everyone wants companionship and everyone expresses that in there own way.  Now personally, I like to be able to have a conversation with the other person.  That's just me.  And then my weakness kicked in...because I am lonely...and so long story short (pardon the pun) I have officially seen an 8.5 inch penis.  Please tell me Signa that you did not give this URL to Mom and Dad.  That would be quite traumatising.  So as usual, I am now who knows how far behind in school.  And I don't seem to care much.  There is so much red tape and politics going on with the school paper that I just want to let it die.  It's not really worth it, I'm not even sure what I am going to writing in it this year.  The co-editor has suggested that maybe I should do something about depression...write what you know as it were.  And that's probably not a bad idea.  If I can write about it on the net, why not in a student paper.  Oh well something to think about."
THWVU51,male,25,"Another day, another failure.  Does it matter what the failure was?  At this stage of my life I doubt it matters much.  Just add it to the pile.  Anyhow, on an entirely different note...I caught a very odd thing tonight.  On the Family Channel starting at 11:50pm was a program I have not seen in years.  In fact I am the only person I know who even remembers it.  It's called Earth Star Voyager, it was made around 1987 or so and doesn't really star anyone you may have heard of.  I am certain it was the pilot for a show that never got picked up, and was just released as cheap network filler material.  As I recall it had aired on ABC and/or CBC during the Wonderful World of Disney.  Is it cheap??  Oh yes.  Is it cheesy??  Beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Does it remind me of good memories??  Indeed.  I pretty much was raised by TV.  That was more of a voluntary thing.  Trust me my parents certainly tried to get me away from it.  And for many years succeeded.  I only had vague recollections of this thing.  I knew if I ever saw it again it would be horribly lame, which it is.  Although it does have some redeeming qualities.  But oh, how I wanted to the child genious character....and oh how cute I thought he was.  And for the record at the time this show originally aired that actor was probably older than I was.  Oh how I wanted to travel the galaxy to find a new home for our civilization.  I guess that's feeling that was brought out later on again by other space epics, like Star Trek and Star Wars.  I called my friends Adam and Laura as soon as I discovered it was on.  They were off watching Kill Bill 2 so I left a silly message as I am apt to do.  Here's hoping they watched a little of it.  Just so someone knows what the hell I am talking about.  Incidentally Kill Bill 2...excellent...I could say more but it seems moot.  Chances are if you're someone that knows me or finds me at all interesting then you already know how good it is and don't need me to give a more detailed opinion.  That's all for now.  Let's see what this week brings."

No.  Comtemplative would probably be the best description.  I'm like a little boy, cowering in a corner.  Partly fearing my imminant failure, and slightly fearing any possible success.  OOoohhh rhetorical nonsense...anyhow don't misunderstand this brief entry, it's just a couple of sentences with no real meaning.  I want to add more but I should go to bed, and I ain't not making the sense anyways."

Cosy and beautiful, this is def a place for honeymooners. i made friends with some crazy journalists - we had tons of beer and wine to drink for dinner. Many were hung over the next day when we had to catch the early morning flight.   I'm glad to be back!  Calcutta is my next destination for a work assignment. It's to explore prostitution there - a 5 day gruelling trip where i've to secure interviews with prostitutes (that other media are not interviewing). how am i going to do that? i don't know..but wish me luck. i'm super excited cos it's not just a product launch, but some real investigation!  the other reality that i'm facing is i'm seriously considering moving to OZ. I so want to do this but i'm scared shitless. i wouldn't say it's 100% confirmed but it looks that way. Had the BIG TALK with D...it's a lot more serious than the other times. Many things are swirling in my mind about this...let's just say it'll be the craziest thing i'll be doing ever...  bloop: would it be really hard to find a job there?   boo:  sorry i didn't call you. i really didn't receive your email on thurs. what did you end up doing?  sounds like bloop and ber had a great weekend partying.   looking forward to hearing from all of you =)"

With blurberber's recommendations, i'm picking up some melantonin from the drug store and will cross my fingers for a good night's sleep tonight.   For tommorow, i'll be visiting a relative of mine - somehow she's related to my Grandmother and she owns a pottery shop.  I'll be getting my hands dirty and will try to learn the art from her.  That will probably take up my entire day....  hmmm.. drinks tommor evening anyone?   Sunday...*drifting away*   Could be interesting day.  An ex-neighbour of mine had invited me out for a boat trip with his friends.  He mentioned that the group will consist of people whom I've met at the pub beside my place.  I'm crossing my fingers for a particular guy to turn up.  *butterflies*   Well, in any case, even without his presence, I'm sure i'll have a blast.   I'll just cross my fingers for some other hot bods!!! hehehe...  I'm definitely looking forward for some salty sea breeze on my face....ahhhh  astro : you just have to start going out on little adventures!  Take up projects to participate together. I'm sure there are many things that can be done, cheaply! picnic at botanic gardens, take a bukit timah reserves hiking trip, take a little junk boat out, visit some of our offshore islands...just to name a few.

4GG3WMN,male,26,"Going to T-town today for my last meeting before we fly out to Honduras next weekend.  Didn't go as soon as I had originally planned.  I hope to get there early in the afternoon so I can still see some people I haven't seen in a while.  I still don't know it I'll come back tonight or Monday morning.  So, I'll bring a change of clothes just in case (for those of you reading this down there who may convince me to stay).  I've been waiting on a phone call for a week.  grr.  Becoming impatient.  I still don't know what all I'm going to pack for Hondras, but I'm sure I'll have that figured out by Wednesday... 'cause I'm leaving town Thursday.  So, it might be a good idea.  ...  Wow.  I'm going to Honduras in six days.  I'm excited about seeing the children.  Still not sure if I'm going to be bringing my classical.  I've been asked to bring it (epecially to play Latin music for the kids), but that requires purchasing a hardcase for it before then and finding out how it'll work on the plane: will it take up my carry-on, will it take up my one extra  bag , or can I bring it at all?  I'm definitely not going to take a chance of it getting damaged if I can't carry on my person.  We'll see.  ...  (Pondering the uncertainty of life and how we live it.)  ...  End."
4GG3WMN,male,26,"Tonight I feel horrible.  In my observations at one of the places I have been  studying   I've discovered things I wish I hadn't, and unable to do anything about it because of my displacement, I am forced to just sit and think about it.  I knew I would become aware of things I would otherwise never know in my  studies , but I guess I hadn't really prepared myself for it.  Tomorrow may be the last night I go there.  I was visiting my friends at the pharmacy I used to work at, and they really want me back.  I used to say I'd never go back to that company, but they assure me things have gotten much better.  I was even told they could start me out making a lot more than I was before if only I would come back.  Since I don't have anything I'm doing during the day, I may work occasionally for a little extra money.  However, I've been thinking about spending my early part of the days at the library or trying to get into some more vounteer stuff.  (I just got my library card here a few days ago.)  For a few years I've been wanting to do a children's reading at a library or somewhere.  I think I may try that.  I'd also like to just get some more volunteer work under my belt before I apply for the Peace Corps.  I do a lot of volunteer work, but it may not be the kind of ""official"" volunteer work the Corps would like me to have experience in.  Times are changing, and I'm feeling it."

I finish up this week, take a week to go to Honduras, and then work the following week.  However, if things progressively get worse this week, I won't go back at all.  I'll still have given them two weeks notice.  I'll just be out of the country on the second week.  Going a little crazy.  I need to find some stability in my head.  I'm sure that makes sense.  Honduras in five days.  Going to go iron and pack.  Over eight days and no call.  Three more days before I give up."

4GG3WMN,male,26,"As of late I have been doing a lot of pondering on the things I feel are affecting people of the world as a whole and the reasons behind many of their problems.  I have often said that if everyone had love at the center of their being, thoughts, and actions then many problems would not exist.  However, I have since seen further into the matters and tried to think of why this has not and, I believe, cannot come to fruition at the present.  Greed.  Not just that of money, but the grand greed of the world.  Read carefully, and ponder what I have to say.  Take a look at all of nature, save the human race.  There is a careful balance.  It takes what it needs, leaves the rest for other purposes, recycles itself, replenishes itself, mends itself, and lives on without our help.  Now, those who are believers know that God has set all this in motion and these things have no selfish desires against all else.  Those who have accepted the notion of evolution cannot explain this with science, or at least I have yet to hear or read a convincing theory.  Thus, at the source we must have God, which is the love I have been preaching ever long, for God is love and love is of God.  However, there is a part inside many that wish to obtain an abundance of worldly treasures.  I have witnessed this all over the world, and I will now tell you the problem that lies therein.  Humans tend to hoard treasures without regard to others.  What’s wrong with doing well for yourself, you ask?  I will tell you that nothing is wrong with doing well for yourself, and I have often heard this preached from a pulpit.  However, what I have not heard is what I am about to say.  When we take it upon ourselves to increase our treasures while disregarding others we have left that love behind.  It’s not enough to simply help our fellow man with the things we have as long as we are well off.  We must now, more than ever, take into account how we obtain our possessions; where they come from, who made them, why were they made, and at what costs?  When we use the word “cost” we cannot convince ourselves that our only costs are monetary.  With world economics, trade, transportation, and technology as they are today, it is possible for most anyone to obtain virtually anything from any point man has traveled here on Earth and elsewhere, including information and knowledge.  In this, there is an underlying conflict of supply and demand.  Now the supply of every human being’s needs is at a surplus, as are many luxuries we may now consider to be a simple part of life.  These needs may not be available in the immediate vicinity, but can be easily transported from elsewhere.  However, herein lies one of our biggest problems.  At what cost will it take to bring these necessities to those who need them?  At present, there is no cost other than the will for it to happen.  If the love I have preached is instilled within those who harvest these necessities and those who transport them, then there should be no problem.  However, there is a burning desire within most of us for something in return.  When this desire is brought into action throughout a great mass, the desire to give freely dissipates dramatically.  Then the love is lost.  “So, tell me again why it isn’t good to do well for myself and expect others to try to do the same?  They should have to work for their own things just as I have.”  As true as this is, it is unfortunate that this is the mindset we have come to.  It is not enough to do well for ourselves and demand that others do the same.  We must help each other in this process, not enforce it, as it were.  Unfortunately, there are those who will refuse to do their part, but as a whole, we can manage without them.  In this process it is not necessary to take advantage of others, suppressing them while others become better of than they.  As much as it pains me to say it, this is how much of the world functions and a large part of the reason we Americans have these “part of life” luxuries we have come to take for granted.  If the world functioned off of love rather than greed, everyone would be able to lead a “good life,” as defined by the majority’s standard of living.  Some that work harder than others would have more “things” with which to please themselves, and those who work less will not have them.  “Why should I work for someone I don’t even know or pay for someone else’s way when I can barely make my own?”  Because you love them and have disrobed your garment of greed, and if everyone did so, then you would have plenty instead of “barely making it” on your own.  Of course, until that happens there will have to be those who  are  willing to work harder for others, and for them the world gives thanks.  Therein lies a greater love than a gift from friends.  Alas, apathy sets in and the hood of greed is donned as we hide beneath it trying to disguise ourselves as we give a few pence every now and then to make ourselves feel better.  I want to weep for the men, women, and especially the children who made my clothes, my various possessions, left their land, and freely gave to me as I make the sweat for more as I sit idle!  I want to throw down my purple cloak and take up my earthen plow.  I want to right the wrongs I have lived and no longer contribute to the oppression.  I am a teacher, and so shall I teach freely to those who wish to learn.  I will strive to never again complain for a penny more I should have made or if I should have ever made anything at all for none of it is mine.  I will with all my being sow seeds of love and never leave the field.  These words and thoughts I will continue to dwell upon, investigate, and expound upon in order to write a complete—if that is possible—lesson for all to learn and apply, myself first and foremost.  May God continue to bless us all in spite of ourselves."

I've heard it's made people sick to their stomch, brought tears, brought hatred, brought joy, the best movie ever, a bad movie in respect to its attempt to retell an old ""story,"" and many other things from both christians, those who calim to be christians, and the masses of non-christians.

N5H7URL,male,23,"Wnat to read my lastest short story? Okay. but first let me tell you about last night...  If you had to become a brand of sugar what would you choose? C&H? Cause island boys just love that cane?  Back to last night...  My roomates called me into one of their rooms one night. I had heard a lot of laughing and they called me in. So I went to see what was so funny. They were both lying on the ground mostly naked, but each hadm some thick fluffy brown substance coming out of their mouths and dripping all over the floor. I was a little wierded out as you can imagine, so I started to speak..  ""Guys... Wh-""  Then one of them cut me off. Hence the ""-"". The one who cut me off was named peter. Beyond that I can't help you.  He said,   ""We're playing Dinosaur. Come play a round.""  ""Whats that?""  ""I said we're playing Dinosuar. Don't you want next game?""  I rubbed my eyes and saw they were actually sitting on the edge of their bed and they were playing video games. I leeft the room, reached into my lamp and tossed my bottle of Whiskey out the window.  with no further postponement.  My recent Short story:  ""IF YA TRY SOMETIMES"" or ""CHI-NEEE BEER BEFORE BEDTIME""  A very nice young man was going to a studio at night to see if he could talk to a woman he knew in accounting. He was hoping she could help him out. The guards wouldn't let him in. And his budddy Simon came by and talked to him on a bench.  Then they tried to get in again but they couldn't. Finally they remember the friends anmed and the young man was allowed to see her. He handed her his scrreenplay and told her all about his project. She was very excited because the young man was so nice. But then, one of his peers arrrived and told the nice accountant lady that she would have to hear the beginning of this story before she commited to help the man.  ""It will shock you, dear madame, and whilst I know it seems this young man is a wonderful person of purest intentions, you must read the first part of this story before you help him. It is of the utmost importance.""  The nice accountant lady was a little taken aback. But obliged and took the paperback copy of this very story you read right now, becuase in the context of this story the story itself has been printed and published.  REgardless, the lady begins to read the book and sees that it all started one night at a party. The nice young man was having a little 'get together' with some mates of his. Three ladies came to join them. They were all sittting in various places on a counter in a kitchen. It was a kitchen in a school or some kind of institution.  They listedn to some music.  The three friends, nice young man included, talked of which of the three they preferred among the lady folk. The three ladyfolk were very different. One was a brunette with short straight hair. One was a Brunette with longer curly hair. And the last of the three was a blonde with a large bust but was otherwise somewhat plain. The nice young man preferred the brunette with short straight hair. They did not diuscuss the matter much more.  Later in the evening the blonde girl was quite intoxicated and she sat on the couch with the nice young man. They talked and giggled and the nice yooung man knew he had to be with her if was going to be with any of the lady folk since this was the once who took an interest in him.   The lights went out and the Nice young man convinced the hesitant young girl to take their innocent and playful flirting to the next level and have sexual intercourse. The young girl was hesistant, as previously stated, but eventually she agreed. They had intercourse for sometime, against her own better judgement. She began to cry. The nice young man lifted his hands to his face, and suddenly saw there was blood all over them, dripping down them, loud dramatic music played, and the camera spinned around the man as he lifted his hands and we see the young girl dead, white, lying before him. But now she was no longer the blone, but the brunette with long curly hair. The nice young man screamed.   The nice accountant lady closed the book and spoke.  ""Yes. I understand now why the nice young man musn't receive my help on his project. It is a shame though.""  The pain of the truth and the realization left the many to disperse into few and eventually none. The nice young man went home slowly. Now he remembered it all, like it was from a past life, and he could say nothing in his defense. Even he had forgotten how the story began."

But, alas, it is MOVIE TIME, and it hasn't been for quite a while. We always had a saying aboout how each one of the movies was significantly improved over the last one.

Also mind your p's and q's.   Audtions are right around the korner and they are always a strange experience. I always feel bad. I wish I could give all the people parts, and then make the world a stage. Then buy the world a coke. Then get a video camera and give a bum a plain cake doughnut to make him fight another bum and we'll call it bumfights. It'll be grand.  Movies are hard to make, but mark my words, if we achieve what we have set out to achieve we will have done something quite special. Most people would read our script and think you'd need milllions of dollars and hence major studio backing to do it. If we can do it, and not lose too much in quality, we will have done something very special. It'll be the pinnacle of a good 5 years now primarily devoted to guerilla style filmmaking. So- beyond just pulling it off the key will be to pull it off well and try not to sacrifice when it comes to substance. I'm happ to roll the dice, and in a few yers from now I may still be hacking away at this thing, trying to finish it, trying to get a few more dollars, or to get the whole thing assembled and done with. It won't be easy. But I imagine it will be fun. I know what I'm getting into this time. And I'm very excited."

N5H7URL,male,23,"THE PASSION OF MEL GIBSON    I won't see this movie.     It's not because it's antisemetic. If it even is. Maybe it is and maybe it's not. It's because it's disgusting, and bizarre, and kinda creepy.    I'll admit some curiosity, but I'll also admit little interest in a historically inaccurate, unbelievable graphic depiction of Jesus getting cruzified. First of all, how can there be 2 hours worth(or more- I think it's a little more than 2 hours) of Jesus being cruzified. Is it real time? I guess there are some flashbacks along the way. Assuming one can stomach, and maybe even get off a little on the violence(I'll get back to this real quick) doesn't it seem that if you're going to make a movie about Jesus you'd have something more to say about it than just ""This is how he was killed and, let me tell you pal, it was pretty fucking disgusting.""    I don't find jesus movies to be much of a draw for me, but obviously jesus is an interesting topic. He's been a pretty important guy- lot's of art center aroound him,great art and creepy loking art,(incidentally all the creepy looking stuff has to do with the cruxifiction). But regardless, I can't think of a better way to limit the impact of the man, the religion, and the culture- no THE HISTORY- it spawned than to limit the story to just how the guy was killed. Even with flashbacks, I don't think Jesus would say- and this might be overstepping a line to assume what jesus would say, but I'm just going on a hunch- I don't think jesus would say ""Yes Mel, yes... make the movie about the [part where they killed me, because that was really the defining thing in my life, my teachings, my goal. It was all about the killing part. That was fucking great.""    Jesus wouldn't swear. And he might not say that. And I know that in a lot of ways it really is about the fact that he died, for our sins. And the movie is trying to say, ""Look what he went through FOR ALL HUMANITY!!!"" This very well could be a beautiful idea... watching him suffer for us... the pain, the adrenaline, the gore- it'll be cathartic, it'll be moving, profoundly distrubing, and a deeply religious experience.    But, hold on a second. I had another thought a while back. The killing part, the catharsis of watching his death. You know what Roman people liked? They liked to watch people getting eaten by lions. Or cruxified. They cheered and it was a kind of entertainment. And, in a way, aren't movies for entertainment. And if they are... isn't it kin of weird... kind of ironic... that the horrifying death of Jesus would be given back to us, no commerical breaks, in widescreen for 9 bucks and 7:50 if your a student? Not the teachings. That shits boring and you can go to church for that. Not the love- the idea of compassion, or turning the other cheek. No, rather than being about turning the other cheek much of the hoopla around this movie has been about placing some blame. And making some money it would seem. This movie isn't being screened out of the goodnesss of mels heart in churches everywhere. And he didn't give 25 million dollars to catholic church-he made a movie to touch people. Everywhere.     And lets be honest, had the movie been titled 'the compassion of christ' it wouldn't be nearly as exciting, it wouldn't have nearly the same uproar of media attention, and it wouldn't perform as well at the box office for certain. It would have been like the cartoons on that christian channel. And nobody would have watched it. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED! A great actor once roared to the roman people. Recent polls showed that the american people, by majority, would like to see Saddam and Osama be exectued on TV, perhaps pay per view. Maybe they should be cruxified, thats what George Carlin proposed a while ago. It woudl certainly get high ratings.    So I won't go see this movie. I have an interest in the life and times of christ, but not in the manner in which he was killed. I know it already, and I don't need to watch it to get my rocks off. I'll admit though, there is a very human part of me that is intrigued at the idea of watching what has been described over and over again as an agonizing realization of a truly barberic execution- and feeling something at the sight of it- the power of the sacrifice- but I don't want to give in to that lowest common denomenator. I would like to aspire to something more, to ascend beyond the twisted horror/pleasure of watching a man have his body slowly torn apart. I'll get my horror/pleasure from watching Psycho. Or flipping by Jerry Springer and lingering for a few minutes to see what people will do to get on TV.    Still, I have not seen the movie, And ultimately I pass no judgeement on it's merits as an artistic piece. I didn't go see ""Drumline"" or ""XXX"" or ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton"" and I find this movie, ""The Passion of the Christ"" to be in a similar category. Curiosity aside(I was curious about 'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' for similalry morbid reasons) It's just not something I want to see."
N5H7URL,male,23,"It's that time of morning again sports fans, and here we are, wondring if anybody is out there...  I thought hit me earlier today. What If I write some really great stuff on this blog? Then what happens? There probably isn't a copyright, which means one of you schmucks could copy it down and I might find myself- my 'voice' if you will- in a book someplace down the line.  Well that's just the risk you run with this whole information super highway age. Maybe, from a certain disilusioned perspective, anything I think or write will inevitably end up in somebody's book someplace because we may have been influenced by the same things, ate the same cereal, watched the same cartoons, had sex with the same she-male hooker in Tiajuana.   And the ultimate irony is that if and when I read myself in this book I may come across in the future, I'll probably like it, and give the book credit because it captured some deep truth to my existence and my experience that I thought only I had. When in reality it was just something someone ripped off my blog.  We live in a fucked up world my friends. A fucked up world.  Speaking of fucked up worlds... this next part is a real winner...  Let's have a moment for the guy who died on Thunder Mountain railroad. We all(me) get scared on these rides and then have to tell ourselves, ""No, No, don't worry. Nobody ever dies on these things. They're safe. They test them out, they wouldn't ever let us get on them, etc. etc. and even when somebody does die, it's like once for every millions of times people go on them."" I even have a book that outlines the 10 times anybosy ever died at Disneyland. It just never happens. Not to me- we all say. Well, somebody did die, and not only did he WAY lower the odds for the rest of us, but he also made sure that all of our paranoid fears are realized, and he was, in a sense, a speaker of mathmatical truth.  1 out of every some number of people will die on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. It's fucked up, but it's true.  I also think we owe him thanks because his unfortunate death will make certain that the people at all amusment parks bust their asses to make sure everything is working well- why? Because people are probably less likely to go now or something.   I do wonder if they'll try to claim the ride warns you because it is, 'The wildest ride in the west'  Come to think of it, it was my first roller coaster. So we go way back. I was terrified then, and I guess I had a bad sense about that ride. I knew some shit was gonna go down.  More than anything this guy, and this incident, represents that none of us are safe. There's a cancer cell out there with your name on it, or maybe instead of a caner cell it's  a loose track on a roller coaster. Either way, enjoy it while it lasts I guess. And because I know nobody is reading this(I hope at least cause I've made a total ass of myself) I feel it's okay to get all preachy like this.  Here's the the people on thundermountain railroad. We can only hope they were having a good time.  Goodnight, and Godspeed."
N5H7URL,male,23,"I should start by making quick reference to a good friends fair argument against my purchasing ""The Gold Rush"" on DVD.  Firstly, if you didn't already check out the blog I wrote days back on old movies and their merits, please do. But eitherway, you can check out my friends response. It's also a few days back, and it's linked to from this site. Just go to 'Peter Scheer'.  I bought the movie because- unlike The Big Lebowski(a must for any collection), The Gold Rush won't always be available- this is to say, owning a classic, a nice crisp transfer of a classic never shown on t.v., well... that's a real treat in my eyes. Everyone I know owns the Big Lebowski. In fact, my roomate owns it n VHS. I can quote every scene, and so can every schmuck this side of the 10 freeway. And well they should. But I have only seen the Gold Rush three times, if you count the recent viewing as per all this discussion, and each viewing was a great experience. So that's why I bought it. And I once again, will plug it shamelessly- while some movies do suffer the passage of time, some manage to hold onto key themes of our very existence- things that never change. The Gold Rush, certainly hits on a few things eveybody is familiar with, and everyone can understand. And no, this does not include houses hanging on the side of a cliff, or making potatos dance with your forks(though we should all try this sometime-- see Benny and Joon starring the increasingly popular Johnny Depp) But not everyone will like The Gold Rush...  Hey-- here's a funny problem. I think some movies are great, and some people think the same movies are shit. Ever encountered this one before? Maybe not with movies, but probably books or pasta sauces. Yeah, funny thing about subjectivity, you can't ever make it objective. Well, you could have in the late 30's around Germany, or if you live across the hall from me, but otherwise it's a tough sell.  What is the point of this comment? Well, I like to claim that a movie is bad sometimes. Well shit, not just sometimes. Lots of times. And I usually have a bunch of reasons. Like I'll say, ""The photography is bad"" or ""I don't buy that that character would ever do that"" or ""I think this scene sucks"" or ""I hate any movie with Collin Farell on principle"" but, oddly enough, often times people disagree with me. And they have their own odd reasons. And somtimes they love the very things I cite as being the cause of a movies overall shittiness. Like I think John Wayne's stiff acting works nicely, and Peter Scheer (and my Dad) think it's garbage.  The answer? Well, argue until you're blue in the face, but the bottom line is we have to accept that there is no measuring stick. There is no universal standard. There are norms, and standards, we come to agree on, but pretty much a movie, or anything ""artistic"" has to be judged independantly, and subjectively. It's fun to cite why, and how. And it's fun to disagree. But let's accept and deal with the fact that there is a deep, intrinsic, inherent, subjectivity to what makes a movie good for each person. The cool thing is when we develop similar standards, and we see them all at work consistently. But movies let everyone have their own experience. Good or bad. That's part of why we like them so much, and part of why it's so cool when our standards and tastes line up, and we all agree about certain things, because then we can say, ""Hey, ya know what- maybe it's not all so subjective after all.""  But that moment only ever lasts so long- a hint at a deeper truth we are not ready to realize and I'm not awake enough to pitch.   And thus as a maker of movies I've come to understand that you can't please all of the people all of the time; It's damn nice when you please any of them at all.  Also- a quick thought I had. John Wayne versus Clint Eastwood.   I've considered it, and I go Eastwood, because, as tough as he is, Wayne is a man, he always plays a man with flaws and man who can die. Part of a lyricism of John Ford's westerns that star Wayne(possibly the only Wanye movies worth watching in my limited experience). But Eastwood-- he's a demon straight from hell. He's somekind of god of death sent as a hitman for the devil himself. He doesn't always like it- but he seems cursed to walk the world a cold blooded killer. Ain't no man gonna stand in his way. I don't care how tough he is. I only mentioned it because I thought it'd make one hell of a fight.  keep the faith."
N5H7URL,male,23,"We caught Sadam. Something I thought upon hearing the news was the scene that took place when he was found.  I imagined nighttime in Iraq, some soldiers in all that camo shit wandering around, looking for him, as I imagine many have been for sometime now. One of them sees a hole and looks in.  ""WHOA! HEY! HOLY SHIT MAN!!!!""  How else could it have happened?  (over walkie talkie)""Dude, Smith, get over here man, I think I found something- don't get all excited and jinzx it- but man... this could be big...""  Regardless, they found the guy living in a hole. And I saw some pics of him when get came out and he looked kind of like my brother. Our mom agrees.  I saw the Godfather today, looking for a little inspiraysh, and just always ready to watch one of the best movies ever. It was eeire.One of my favorite moments is when Brando lifts the sheet over Sonny and says, 'look how they messed with my boy' and the camera holds on him and he- in typical Brando form- seems in every second of his sadness like he is really experiencing every second of the sadness and it's completely real. God bless marlon brando.  Anyway- the moment, I thought was eerily similar to Saddam and his kids- even though it never happened. I remember the images of his sons. It was distrubing. Yes they were very bad people. Some would say they were asking for it. And Sonny was a bad guy too. But the godfather humanizes him. It makes us see the family, and the humanity behind a person who might otherwise seem a monster, and when he father looks on him and says that- all you can think is that once Sonny was a little kid, like the rest of us.  Sympathy for the devil? I don't know what I'm trying to say. But think of how in the end of Casino, when they kill Pesci and his brother so brutally- it's one of the most AWFUL things to watch- to me at least. And yet it fascinates me. How coudl this guy- who over the grueling 3 hours of Casino comes to seem so evil- I have such compassion for him in that moment. It's kind of amazing. Scorsese said it best when he described the moment like this(paraphraase) 'At the end of the day, he's still human like the rest of us, and it really happpened to him- to the real guy.""  Amazing.   One more little anecdote. Watched the Last Picture show making of recently, and at the VERY end of it was  aquick little moment with Bogdanovich worth repeating. He says that he and Orson Welles once were talking about Greta Garbo and her talent, and Bogdanovich said to Welles,   ""Yeah, but she was only in  two or three good movies""   to this Welles leans in and replies,   ""You only need one.""  -Martin Orson Speilucascockhitch Wilder Ford Coppola Bogdonovich Kurosawa III"
N5H7URL,male,23,"Can I just say... having finished young Alex's 'Devil went down to Georgia"" epic tale, that I have a few thoughts. Mostly for you, Dear Alex, if you ever read this. For who else will, or does, and do you even?  Firstly, did the devil really go down to Georgia? Or was he already there?   Was liquer the devil? Maybe america? Racism perhaps? Arabs?  Title aside, I enjoyed this tale. No, not as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but we can't all be perfect, okay.  I liked that one of the guys was a metro-sexual. I'm thinking Tom Cruise could play that part, maybe Woody Harrelson for the racist brother. And how about Peter Boyle as the deaf father- because he played a racist recently. Shit- fuck Peter Boyle- get James Woods on the horn NOW. I smell an oscar, baby.  Alright, casting aside, let's shoot it in Topanga. Cheaper than flying people out to Georgia, and Georgia wasn't really a big part of the story. In fact, let's change the title to the devil went east of the PCH- something people can relate to.  For the chicks, I'm thinking Jennifer Garner and one of the Olson twins, but we'll wait till she's eighteen and we can show some skin. And the knife part- let's have the sister fall on the knife, then BAM green hornet TV theme plays and Woody Harrelson pulls out a samurai sword and chops the shit out of everyone except for Alex, who I'm thinking either Paul Giamatti or Richard Dryfuss. Maybe Orson Welles, from beyond the grave.  NO - from the grave- we'll make a puppet from his bones. And the cover will be Black, with the white bones of Orson Welles danging from strings and a white drawing of a hand controlling them. Then... the tag line, ""Every father's daughter is a virgin"" Something like that- with a shadow of Tom Cruise's eyes superimposed over an image of Mary Kate, or Ashely.   This flick is gonna be great. Talk about overseas appeal? Harrelson vrs. Cruise? They'll never know what hit 'em. Play it to the Bone meets The Last Samurai meets Cheers(not the first season) meets Jerry Maguire.  But the crtitics will shit their pants over it. Why? Because its about drama. Human drama. It's about characters. And it's about what happens at a time in you life when... well... when things are confusing. I'm getting an American Grafitti vibe- fuck it- let's make it the fifties- civil rights were big back then, right? Maybe even end on a slow fade of Dr King's speech. Shit, they'll show this one in sunday school.  I've had fun being silly. But honestly I did enjoy the story, Alex. It was long on character descirpiton, and I coulda done with more of the Mom/nurse. Maybe Sally Field? huh?  And what about Pedro? What about Pedro, he asks. I'll tell ya what, kid. two words. Mehki Pfiefer. Thats what. If ya don't like it then your in the wrong buisness.  Harrleson might be too bald- as long as we're running with the mehki thing, then maybe we can get Eminem to appear as the racist brother. Think- it'll be fascinating because he'll be playing himself- or a version of himself- or what people think of him. That'll show 'em, eh?   the only serious thoughts I have on the story, and maybe in some wierd universe this is what my post has been about, is does this story really signify the end of your dark sense of humor alex? Did this venture into the heart of America let you know that it's not funny after all? Almost as if I speant a week with roy in the intensive care unit? Hopefully you can still laugh at such things- though I can understand where the trouble started.  Alll I can say is that it's a fucked up world we live in, my friends, a fucked up world. But, in the words of Ernest Hemmingway via Morgan Freedman(who should play the homeless mugger at the end, by the way) 'and worth fighting for'.  Subesquently, anybody who thinks that line doesn't belong at the end of Se7en(like how I recreated the title- the magic of keyboards-) is flat out wrong. And this means you Peter Klausner."
N5H7URL,male,23,"I move to strike the Godafather Part III from the record.  Moving to further business, I had a stomach ache today. But now it's mostly gone.  Once I saw a movie a movie about bugs, and the best part was the segment on the dung beetle.  This was the only segment with a three act structure.   Meet the Dung Beetle. He rolls a ball of shit around.  The Ball of shit get's caught on a thorn. The Dung Beetle Struggles to remove it.  The Dung Beetle removes the ball of shit, eventually.  One could also note many other qualities the segment had. For example, early on it was clear that the beetle had a hard time getting a grip on the soil when he rolled the shit ball. This became a much bigger problem when confronted with the thorn episode.  Also, when the ball hits the thorn, the beetle is unaware of what exactly his obstacle is. The audience, however, is in the joke because we saw the thorn go in because of the clever camera position: A directorial move Hitchcock would be proud of.  Once the beetle has finally removed the shit ball from the thorn, the camera zooms out nicely to reveal how small this beetle and his shit ball are, and how huge the road he is trying to cross is, implying a life of hardship before him.  One can only admire the dung beetle in all his excellence. He never gave up, no matter how long it took, or how hopeless it seemed. He also managed to stay totally focused on the goal, never wavering for a second. He never walked away and threw up his hands saying, ""What the fuck. Jesus fucking christ. I give up"" like lots of people I know would. He stuck it out, and this time he prevailed. Will he prevail next time? I don't know. Maybe not. But that's not the point. The kid's got heart, and that's what really matters. He's a model for us all.  But what was it all for? A ball of shit. Ah irony! Even the noble dung beetle cannot escape your wicked grasp."
