G04W97J,female,34,"...enough in the day to make a difference, no? I've recently decided that I really, REALLY want to move on from this job.  I just don't have any passion for what I am doing in my full-time employment.  I worked my way into this position, and I have been working toward making a transition.   My place of employment... is very secure.  The people here all have huge cushiony benefit packages and everyone wants to retire.  Retirement is death. So is the stagnant air in here. It isn't challenging.  I feel at least with creative work even if you are not challenged there is a difference in the momentum with the work being done as opposed to, say, doing research, pulling files, writing technical jargon in an area I feel no passion toward... property.  *yawns* ...makes me wonder what ""security"" is anyway.  I was thinking about ""faith"" the other day, and wondering in what ways do I live having faith in my existance and in what ways do I not? Are my actions based on having faith, or not? and, what is it to have faith?  Main Entry: 1faith  Pronunciation: 'fAth Function: noun Inflected Form(s): plural faiths  /'fAths, sometimes 'fA[th]z/ Etymology: Middle English feith, from Old French feid, foi, from Latin fides; akin to Latin fidere  to trust  -- more at BIDE 1 a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b (1) : fidelity to one's promises (2) : sincerity of intentions 2 a (1) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2) : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b (1) :  firm belief in something for which there is no proof  (2) : complete trust 3 : something that is believed especially with strong conviction; especially : a system of religious beliefs synonym see BELIEF - in faith : without doubt or question : VERILY   I think people are more probable to end up in the direction they're inclined whether it's negative or positive just by how much meditation they put on those ideas.  It's a part of our creativeness in our nature.  Doubt will hinder you... I remember reading a book on successful people in history and what made them different.  I recall that one man said NO MATTER WHAT, he did what he believed in and ignored everyone else.  Any decisions he decided to make he committed to and refused to listen or be affected by others.  As a result he was very successful in property investments.  On the other hand, it's difficult to stand alone if you do things that aren't what other people ARE doing or have done.  Somewhat like swimming up stream."
G04W97J,female,34,"... choice tea for this evening - mixing Mango Ceylon with Green in my diffuser.  Just when I thought I was feeling good... my muscles are again aching like a MF'ker.  Maybe it's from my iron deficiency and my strange unwillingness to take iron supplement tablets.  I bought iron supplement tablets... bought 2 bottles of them.  I keep one in my office, I keep one at home.  Haven't taken even one.  Ouch, my muscles ache.  Hot baths help. Otherwise, I just don't care to move beyond that with it.   Reminds me of Tolstoy's ""The Death of Ivan Ilych,"" where Ivan keeps feeling pain but he ignores it and continues forward... prompting the reader to at least SORT OF question why he'd ignore his pain.   eh... it's (the story) really just a beautiful still-life-with-words of existance... and a good portion of it is 'survival of the fittest' - if you're fit enough to survive and excel, it really shows where you land on the ladder of life.   As for me, it's probably some chick-hormonal-growth-age issue I don't pay any attention to. I tend to be in a decent system of check with myself so I know when I should step up for something unbearable.  Nothing's ever really bad, it just may form you in a way you're uncertain.  OKAY enough ambiguities.  I had fun last night. I was so happy to see my friends.  And I was very happy to see that Agent -0- and his band have grown a LOT, they're really getting better and better.  Awh. One of the sweetest most sincere and caring persons I have EVER met.  He's funny, he's super kind and nice and sensitive but he acts tough around most people, but he treats me nice.  Who knows what he's thinking.  I just get a sense that some day soon he's going to flourish in amazing ways he may not even be certain of yet.  I really want to see him do well.   Choice drink of the evening:  Stella Artois. The place was actually crowded.  Hard to see the stage. Boys walking around smelling like bar soap, it's really nice.  Either that or it's cologne that smells like bar soap.  People all clean and shiney and cute and happy.    I don't drink much these days.  Drinking forces you to loosen up whether you THINK you want to or not. So, in that sense, I think in mod. it's good for any adult really.  I wish my pal Josh wouldn't have been so sXe and he refused to drink at all.  I mean, for the most part I respect being clean but it seems to do one good to just let go here and there.  He was overwound with control to a point where it wasn't even good for him, and his negative qualities then had too much control over parts of him.  Ya, he'd have done better with a few beers.  I stopped keeping in touch with him around the same time J & I broke up.  Just a gut feeling.  I let go of a few people, actually.  I don't know why but I just knew.  So ya, everyone clean happy smelling pretty shiney etc.  Once I got into a zone after a couple drinks I started paying attention to people beyond just the general - everyone smells nice and looks nice.  I never realize that guys watch me! I think that's funny.  I don't feel that the realization that it happens should or could lead to anything for me to consider because - #1, most of my life I've already had a boyfriend so what would have been the point of paying attention, and #2, people just do stare at other people, doesn't really mean anything in particular.   I also don't really think much about how many people really know who I am socially.  I always think I'm in my own world in my head, but then I see people trying to edge near me and that sort of hesitant struggle with talking to me.  Some do approach me, some don't.  One girl came up and reintro'd herself.  I'd met her when she was younger in her teens.  So she mentioned people I know and then asked me to come to her club.  She's a nice gurl.  Dunno.  What other drivvel can I get rid of on this sheet of monotony? I can write for HOURS about all kinds of thoughts, meaningful and meaningless.  I am cleaning out my closet ...s ... Like really.  Funny. I guess emotionally I have done some cleaning out too but my bigger closet in my apartment is where I keep things I love collecting... I have BOXES of books, vintage clothing and handbags, and other memorabilia.  Most of it is really valuable.  I usually buy stuff with a good knack that gains value.  Odd and interesting stuff. But anyways... I was going through some old books, looking for a couple exist. pieces and I found a book I hadn't seen in awhile... with a note from an old boyfriend... I think he put it in there and I never saw it! BECAUSE he used to leave me little messages on corner scraps of paper and I'd collect them and put them in a folder.  They weren't just messages though...  Matt. I met him in Adv. poetry class in college.  He was one of the most talented writers that I had met.  Instructors on campus deemed him a genius.  Oh he was alright.  He'd cracked when he was 16, had to be institutionalized. But he healed up I think.  He was fine.  He was just creatively profound.  SO talented.  And he'd write me poems all the time and draw little pictures, his own art characters.  Stuff like that. That was what was cool about having a talented writer bf, all the poems and art and songs he wrote about me and us, it makes for a great memory.  SO I found a note in a book I know I haven't looked at in many years... I may have never seen the note. It says...   (T),   The roll of movements ... still ours ... Like still-time photographs Each trapped, Losing a little of it's life Due to gravity The heavy lines of the Picture slip into Stasis, ...time to become. True, the times we've  Wanted to slip Into have been Waiting for us.  - in us -     Ironically, the same day I'd found this note was the same day my brother went with his girlfriend and her band to play with this other band... whose drummer was a mutual friend of mine and Matt's AND Matt and his twin were at the show.  My brother mentioned it to me the next day.  Small world, eh.  Getting smaller all the time ;)  I think life was better not just for me but everyone when people struggle more, work harder, write manually.  But nothing's ever so horrible because something comes of everything.  See? I can write about anything over and over, so I'll stop for now on a high. wink wink!"
G04W97J,female,34,"About a boy. From my archives. Written in the heat of our post exit interview...   PROS AND CONS    PROS:  *I like the fact that he’s Mexican.  There are good things about Mexican men I like, and there are also things I don’t care for; but it was easy to sieve out things in pieces because they’re so clear cut. 	I.e.  Good: strong values, strong sense of pledge to family & family values, strong communication skills, strong, strong, strong, masculine, passionate…etc.  *He smelled good all the time even when he thought he smelled dirty, he smelled good to me  *Even when his hair looked a mess, it looked nice to me, like something I wanted to touch  *He was workable (except when afraid of something I didn’t know he was afraid of) - most things he listened to and thought through and came up with alternatives or conclusions, workable solutions…this is rare in men, sadly.  *His eyes were truthful *His smile was connected to his soul. *His loudness was direct and honest *His enthusiasm felt sincere *High energy *Driven *Passionate in every way *Warm *Very affectionate and physical *Very outspoken and for the most part appropriately outgoing *I woke up next to him happy and very comfortable except for one night: *The one night we went to bed tense, when he woke up he put his arms around me and we were fine again, and he admitted that he had uncomfortable sleep ‘cause we argued… I felt the same about my sleep.  *His sense of intuition is very sharp, so it seems *SMART *Wants to learn many things *He felt like me! We were that comfortable.  I couldn’t feel a difference that made me significantly uncomfortable. *AMAZING focus! Like I’ve rarely seen if ever… *Sharp *Chemistry - major thumbs up! Good connection from the start *He worked hard to win me over, not an easy task, even though he didn’t have to… *Friendly even though he’s somewhat a loner *Amazing hand holder, hugger… any touch. *Animalistic …rawr - eats marrow, eats with his hands, looks for the core, the root, driven, digging, tearing, powerful…  *And he cooks too!   CONS   *OOOH suspicions! *WAAY too flirty and aggressive with women to the point of disrespecting everyone, not good ‘cause he ultimately didn’t care about anyone’s feelings if they were hurt or not  *There were times when I suspected that he took this double dealing too far and I tried not to see it that way but it clearly won in the end.  *He wanted me to be part of what he called a “triangle” with 2 other girls that he said were his “best friends” - I don’t believe that structure works at ALL.  In my book the S.O. is #1 and everyone else is a generous #2.  *He betrayed me in the end with one of the “best friends/ex-girlfriends"".  He was physical with her but to what extent I do not know, and I don’t care to know.  So, he lost me.  *EGO - barf! He got a big ego in the end, likely got inflamed due to his discomfort with the quick pace and his inability to adjust/readjust …but that comes with age and experience."
G04W97J,female,34,"An excerpt from my travel journal  January 2004  LAX to LHR  ""... I don't half mind writing my trip diary manual style.  I don't write manually much anymore.  I sort of miss it a little. So I've been in London almost 24 hours ! Not bad considering I am still a bit jet lagged.  AND I've done, I think, quite a bit in such a short period of time. My flight out of LAX was Wednesday night.  D took me to the airport.  Traffic was just about standstill for the whole way over.  We got there and it took 2.25 hours leaving from home! My ticket said the gate for my flight closed at 8pm... but it was delayed a half an hour anyway. On the flight over I thought the accomodations on BA were really nice.  The seats were a bit jammed together but otherwise it was good.  I was squished between 2 men - one was BIG and drunk, so needless to say I was having to be patient.  BA is nice.  I had asked for vegan meals and they were really good.  They'll even prep lacto-ovo on request.  My dinner was like eggplant & couscous.  All the free alcohol you want - at least up until you're 'dancing in the aisles' as the attendant put it.  So I had a (small) bottle of Bordeaux wine from France.  And each seat had its own tv/radio with movies.  And guess what was on... Moulin Rouge.  I missed maybe the first 20 minutes, it was good.  Could have been better but still good.  It's all about love.  Sigh.  (A) had said it was one of his favorite movies... I tried to fall asleep after the movie.  I think I did alright I got about 4 hours of sleep on an uncomfortable seat.  Turbulence was ok.  No wonder people try to get drunk, the turbulence is disturbing but eh, it wasn't all that bad.  Woke up at 5:45am, close to normal as I'd go to work.  I thought they'd give breakfast but since we were in the UK zone they gave us lunch.  A light one.  By the time we got off the plane it was 4pm Thurs UK time.  The now very drunk and large man to my right wanted to talk.  He drank alcohol the whole way over, even up until they told him that they didn't serve liquor with the morning meals.  Then he started asking for orange juice, went up into the overhead bin, got a large bottle of vodka out of his travel bag and opened up his own bar.  He offered me a screwdriver, I passed.  Very friendly, he offered to share a cab.  I figured since it cut the cost, why not? Especially since I was so TIRED.  Eh! too expensive, even though he paid for a 1/3rd of my ride! Avoid the blakc cabs, too costly.  Drunk.  Kept trying to offer me things.  He kept associating himself with Prince Charles.  Drunk.  I didn't care, I felt sorry for him especially since he couldn't handle himself very well.  The ride total was 59#'s! He gave 25#'s, I put up 40#'s.  Both the taxi driver and the drunk said the area I was staying in was seedy with lots of junkies and prostitutes! (however, once I got there it was far more relaxed and simple than LA! Nothing alarming).  Oh goodie.  To digress a moment, the drunk said the funniest thing.  He said that although his father is Irish and he is 1/2 Irish he claims to be English since he was born in England.  If he were to claim to be Irish, he'd be accused of being a ""plastic paddy""!""  I had no idea I was being a plastic paddy! Ah! :)"
G04W97J,female,34,"Well, I suppose I could say, “ This window is now closed. Please wait in line for the next available… whatever.”   I was just starting to enjoy my blog-rhythm… I was creating a relationship with this and now that relationship must end. At least in the way I knew it. Either that or find a way to not care enough take the risk that I will be under greater scrutiny than I likely was before.  I was jotting in this at random in between tasks  at work  but now that is likely to end.   New AD in the office. His background is largely in “private investigation,” and it appears he hasn’t let that go. He’s only been here a week but managed to drop in my office like the po-lice first thing this morning. Not only was he checking up on me (I haven’t dealt with that since OH, high school) he took it out a few steps further than necessary, which is to me more intensified than any micromanagement I’d experienced first hand… that wasn‘t intended to be hostile anyway.  “So… T…what are you working on?” I told him the name of the assignment.  “Oh, what exactly are you doing?” … etc.   I thought:  I’m sorry… is there a reason you’re not asking this of my supervisor? or my supervisor’s supervisor? Or my supervisor’s supervisor’s chief?! (for real, it’s a long ladder).  His interrogation made about as much sense as showing up to Leisure World and frisking an old lady. Absolute nonsense.  Pretty tacky head start for your first week, mister.   Paradise to think at will has now ended. Big Brother has arrived. NICE. I was enjoying learning to juggle between my assignments and my self. AS… I am capable of easily doing the work of 3 people… doing the work of one puts me to sleep, and less than one? I then have to seduce myself into a trance. Oh fun. Maybe I need to go out and find a more demanding job. My supervisor’s supervisor said I work too fast… oh well.   Next time the AD questions me like that I think I’ll plea the 5th.  All these sparkly thoughts I get… no more fuel by daylight. How sad. Will I take the risk knowing he will likely look into my computer log, or will I find a better way to juggle in a relatively juggle-free environment?  Hmm. Much to think about.   Though I did take a walk about the area on a break this afternoon to let my mind expand a little.  One of the ladies at my work is adorable. Lately I’ve noticed that she takes her break with another older man at the office. And, just as soon as they step out of the building, they hold hands and walk really close and slow next to each other. Awh. At first when I was walking up and they were walking out and she saw me checking them out, she looked a little on the defense. I smiled. I wouldn’t begrudge something like that. I found out there’s an even better story behind it all.  I guess in the recent past and when she used to work at a different location of our office she used to be really outgoing and funny and she would flirt with all the men, but I am told she came off too aggressive and built a reputation. She’d say things like “I need love. I need a man. I want a boyfriend.” and her coworker told her not to seem so desperate, not to say those things. “But I do!” She’d say. Still…  So she’d take the risk of looking silly and she kept flirting and flirting… of one man in particular she kept asking him to spend time with her. He flatly said no. He told her that even though he was a widow he only ever loved his wife and no other woman.  But still the woman kept trying. And eventually he said he would give it a chance. I suppose that was just a few months ago…  Awh.  The coworker who told me about this said, “Could you imagine finding a man like that?! How lucky she is!”  “I know…” I said."
G04W97J,female,34,"What am I going to do.  Nothing I suppose. There really isn't anything TO do.  What I am going on over is contemplating my shakes seminar performance night next month. HMMMM. In addition to my scene & monologue, I will also be reciting a sonnet. Number NINETY-ONE. Hmm. OF course, in last night's course the instructor Special K was being strange once again. I will be moving on to a new group maybe sooner than later. Although for the fall theatre play it would be workable to get a role I'd like - 4 female roles, staged by the director I worked with last.  We got along well so I imagine that he would be inclined to work with me as I don't play the primadonna card.  Primadonna. Hmm. That reminds me. Sunday morning at about 330am or a little later I got a call, I am glad I slept through it.  It was from another guy who wanted to date me.  He was slurring into voicemail and his Cyrano-friend was telling him what to say.  Telling me to call him.  He's not my type, what do you WANT then?! I'm not going to lead someone on. That is wrong to him and me.  Why would someone bait someone else they don't want to truly invest in?  Just so weird... Primadonna.  Because he called me a primadonna once I had told him I was busy doing rehearsals.  Oh right, I am soooooo primadonna.  Those who know how hard I have had to work for everything in life would laugh to have heard that.  Back to the tracks.  Special K suggested that I sit on the said director's lap and recite my sonnet to him.  I said at that rate why don't I read to the head of the department? OR at that rate why don't I perform this Tom Jones style? Get me a mic, would you? I'll serenade every man in the audience, hand out roses, leave them feeling special.  I must have raked in some compliments or SOMETHING that I am unaware of for her to hand me so many slanted comments.  Nothing worse than having to filter conversation coming from your own instructor.  NOW back to the station, my starting point.  Sonnet No. Ninety-one.  How can I read this to a stranger? It's too beautiful and too real, too magical to read to a stranger! All sonnets addressing ""thy"" must be read personal, not impersonal.  SO I have to memorize and recite this to ...  no one as I have no one THAT SUCKS.  It seems so weird to focus on someone and read a deep sonnet and not have it be real, so now here's another thing I have to grapple with.  Love all over ... and over... and over....   SONNET No. NINETY-ONE  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill, Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force, Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill, Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse; And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, Where in it finds a joy above the rest: But these particulars are not my measure; All these I better in one general best. Thy love is better than high birth to me, Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost, Of more delight than hawks or horses be; And having thee, of all men's pride I boast: Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take All this away and me most wretched make.  IT'S WAY TOO TRUE TO MY HEART to read this in err. hmm. What will I do? Only TIME can show me.  I know nothing. What is to be known of something that hasn't yet happened? Nothing, that is why it hasn't happened yet. A beautiful blank canvas, for love.  *     *    *     *   Love Song For No One   *   *   *   *   For Love    Miki Berenyi is a sparkly star."
G04W97J,female,34,"I don't know WHY I feel I get so much out of listening to   The Postal Service  lately, but I do. And when I hear ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,"" I always focus in on the clearest part, at the end, where he keeps repeating ""I am finally seeing, that I was the one worth leaving.""  So I looked up the lyrics to get what the rest of the story was... NICE. Right on. Two thumbs up. Suppose much can be said of perspective and THE PRESENTATION given by those leaving and who's worth what...    THE DISTRICT SLEEPS ALONE TONIGHT   smeared black ink: your palms are sweaty and I'm barely listening to last demands i'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath where i am  i'll wear my badge: a vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest that tells your new friends i am a visitor here: i am not permanent and the only thing keeping me dry is where i am  you seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex a stranger with a door key explaining that i am just visiting and i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving  d.c. sleeps alone tonight  you seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex a stranger with a door key explaining that i am just visiting and i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving the district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights and send the autos swerving into the loneliest evening and i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving  *     *     *     *  This is beautiful.  There is something to be said about being with someone... a post realization that they could say they're leaving when they never really HAD you there with them as it was - if you were treated as a visitor, and they're acting the part of the stranger.  ""The only thing keeping me dry is where I am"" - what an interesting way to say how sad someone's behavior could make you feel.  As if, had they not been there with the new friends, there'd be crying.  Hmm.  ""You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex"" - is this because the person out of context is acting higher... than... thou?  People can be so strange and so blind.  And rarely do they REALLY treat others the way they want to be treated.  People can be so quick to exemplify what they don't like, they can thoughtlessly regurgitate the things they don't like that they've taken in, but can they make enough of a  sacrifice  not to?  Can they?  Is it fear? Some sort of defense mechanism? Or, are people just too different? It seems that younger people can flex and mold easier.  Maybe it's because as you gain experience the probabilities in your mind change.  I never put the words clearly to the song.  I just like listening to the melody when I'm driving along.   Then when he's hooking ""I was the one worth leaving"" so loud over everything else, I thought is this was some sort of dejected statement he was making. But no.  Sometimes when standards don't suit they break.  Why do people tend to take that break as negative?  Isn't the Chinese symbol for disaster the same as opportunity?  Is it all in how  you  view it?  The person here being 'left' is WORTH MORE than the one doing the leaving. Excellent. Everytime situations form poorly around me they break, but then I find myself in a higher and better place afterwards.  It's only when I try to believe I should be somewhere else that others think I should be that I get confused.   I should just shut up and ride more silently along on the wave of life...  Kind of like this:   Good Riddance  / Greenday, of course  Another turning point A fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist Directs you where to go So make the best of this test And don't ask why It's not a question but a Lesson learned in time It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life  So take the photographs  And still frames in your mind And hang it on a shelf In good health and good time Tattoos of memories  And dead skin on trial For what it's worth It was worth all the while It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life   *    *     *     *  I'm off in a bit with Amelia to the east side.

My new soliloquy (in modern text / I am memorizing 1st folio, so not these words verbatim) as Hamlet:  (1.2.131-61)  O, that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!  How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, (135)  Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! ah fie!

Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, (145)  As if increase of appetite had grown  By what it fed on: and yet, within a month --  Let me not think on't -- Frailty, thy name is woman! -- A little month, or ere those shoes were old  With which she follow'd my poor father's body, (150)  Like Niobe, all tears: -- why she, even she -- O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,  Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,  My father's brother, but no more like my father  Than I to Hercules: within a month: (155)  Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!  It is not nor it cannot come to good: (160)  But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.   * * * *  All that's really going on here is Hamlet recognizes his mother's inability to function as she should have.  And why is this? Simply, she's an addict. Wombsickness.  Apply generously and repeat as needed.    ""...why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on""  If the reader can't see that Billy is feeding you the answer here directly then you just can't see.  He's not leaving any question, it's not just an increase of appetite, (as if - to lead the reader into the thought)  it HAD grown by WHAT it fed on .  Addiction. Those damn chemicals. It shapes everyones thoughts and has been so throughout the ages... which brings me back to TWO and the simplistic nature of life. My friend L thinks life is ""8"".  I said the play on the upright symbol for eternity is cute, but I think life is TWO ""2"".   ""Behind every great man there's a great woman."" old prov.  ""Frailty, thy name is woman"" - would ANYONE have said anything if a man remarried as quick? Would it be  that  horrible? As if a woman should carry all the romance and love in her display? Chemicals are on both ends, it's symbiotic. She just happened to be the one left alive. Frailty, thy name is humanity."
G04W97J,female,34,"or...f'ck ya!   I keep seeing this idea pop up in various places and in different ways, but the basis is the same:    The more you curb or numb the force that compels you toward something, the lesser the energy to get there.     Good point.  Girls at lunch were talking about 'bags of tricks and toys' and one girl said see why I don't have a boyfriend... I was like ya you're right, she doesn't need one... hmm...   Why find an alternate way to pacify or numb yourself when you should take that energy and pour it into what you  really  want?  Moderation...? Control...? We're so controlled by our own selves, we own our selves and are locking others out, maybe.   It's like I told one of the girls in theatre... she said she felt nervous and was worried about that when she was on stage.  I told her everyone on stage is nervous, it's an energy and you need to put that energy into your performance...  That sort of thing.  If you make yourself numb or lessen your desire, it lessens the impact.  That's no fun.  I'd rather take it full and complete.  How passionless people are when they're anesthetized, either that or their focus for their passion gets skewed and misplaced.    I know that given the choice I prefer the intensity.  I guess I'm building up momentum. Waiting for impact..."

G04W97J,female,34,"Just a speck of cathartic venting here.  Just a speck of dirt.    The person heading this seminar I am in, I'll call her K, well, she's difficult.  She's wired so strangely.  She's of an old-school-director-dictator-mentality.  So, as far as education and discourse and literature (Shakes was known moreso as a poet than a playwright in the past, so I am told) - it's been a rough ride in this seminar.  She certainly has NOTHING to do with what I've known of education in lit in the past.  She's been super hyper about imposing her opinion, heavily, both over the material and ME. More specifically, that I should be more focused toward the age of 40 (!) and focusing on older woman roles.  Last February she'd given me an interesting role for this seminar, the role of a young girl, but took it away after certain gossip broke out that I dated someone younger! That is why she wants me to focus on older roles, on playing the role of the queen. AND my scene work is with an older guy and conveniently the scene is me persuading him to marry me. Everything reeeeeaks of her opinions, SHE reaks of her opinions.  I have to listen to all this muck about how she's so secure with her age (if she were there'd be no mention of it) and blah blah blah and after being bombarded with her opinion directed right at me over and over - now I question what I am paying for.  I don't WANT to do the scene work. The scene is retarded, and my scene partner's girlfriend is the secretary here at my work.  I am sure she'll love to find out I am rehearsing seducing her boyfriend and that I have to kiss him.  And, why isn't HE saying anything about it? It's weird.  I guess they must have an understanding.  I don't want her to freak since she KNOWS me, which throws a kink into the whole illusion of what is on the stage.     Well now this becomes an opportunity to prove her tactics weak.  I should then thrive off of handling the situation most effectively instead of turning away.     I wanted to say, ""I'll tell you what, when you stop sleeping with your dog whose the size of a small person, then I might consider listening.""  But instead I just smiled."

I made the mistake of showing up to performance night in a 'tailored' black dress shirt that sent SK into a rampage.  She claimed to be pissed off because the whole stage is black and I wasn't to wear all black.  I reminded her that for my first monologue I was performing as ham1et in mourning and he is in  all black  but from there on out I had a colored blouse underneath and a character skirt for the rest of the evening.  NOT good enough. She cussed me out for any and every turn she could find.  Please.  TOTALLY inappropriate.  I love being attacked for doing the right thing, really. So she sent me and a fist full of men in black to the costume room to find bright colored mens dress shirts...  I found a 70's hot pink mens dress shirt a la butterflyish collar to mourn in... and I tied on my black cape... black pants... performed ham1et... then changed into 'feminine' clothing. It went very well.  The reactions told me so.   I feel like I am in such an odd place suddenly.

Léonard Lipp opened his brasserie in the 1870's after fleeing Alsace during the Franco-Prussian War. As such, it's menu is typical of that region including beer, sausage, sauerkraut and so forth. It stayed in the family until 1920 when Marcellin Cazas bought it in 1920. In 1958 Cazes was given the Legion of Honor for running the best literary salon in Paris. No wonder the publishers Grasset, Gallimard, and Hachette are nearby. But it has also been a meeting place for television personalities, ministers (it is halfway between the French Senate, and National Assembly), and actors, among others.   Ernest Hemingway also frequented Brasserie Lipp, and in his book A Moveable Feast wrote:   The beer was very cold and wonderful to drink. The pommes à l'huile were firm and marinated and the olive oil delicious. I ground black peper over the potatoes and moistened the bread in the olive oil. After the first heavy draft of beer I drank and ate very slowly. When the pommes à l'huile were gone I ordered another serving of cervelas.

It's Tuesday the first of June! The year almost half over. Saturday night was the final run of the play.  Everyone told me I did well.  I am being hard on myself because I want people to feel MOVED.  Well isn't good enough.  I like that lifted sensation you get when you're really in that moment of being entertained.  That's what I am striving for.   GODDAMN I am hungry right now... Said adieu & thank you to my stage husband of 2 months.  It was fun/funny kissing someone so much who was your friend, then pretending you're really married.  Especially when this friend is 19 looking 17. To me anyway! My brother said we were believable and that he said our characters just looked 20-something.  So it worked.  I was worried that people would figure me out and realize I am not 20.  Nothing worse than watching people act and NOT believing their characters...  PHO noodles sound so good right now, and it's only 10:20am... hmm... The after-party went fine until a loser bully showed up. Mental.  Everyone was happy and getting along fine and the vibe was fine, then you'd think this guy was a 6-year-old getting ready to ravage a pack of kindergarteners surrounding a milk cart at recess, yes that bad.   My post-guess was that he was on something like PCP 'cause even speed freaks aren't that freaky.  His rage and blind hatred toward people he didn't even know was so insane I decided to leave, took a couple people home.  That's when I decided he was on drugs and just irrational.  What's worse is he was fixated on me in a ""romantic"" (there's got to be a better word since nothing about it is romantic) sense and scarily will be in my Shakespeare seminar group.  Lunatic.  I like nice people, boo! Bully go home...  I laugh because I am writing this to myself. I've only told one person about my blog, so it's just an open tool right now...  I lost about 5"" off my waistline.  I changed my diet for the play and I am pretty happy with the results! It was one of my new year's resolutions to seriously convert to a healthy diet and I am on the right path. I've changed almost everything I eat.  AND one of my many summer projects is to experiment with Macrobiotics, which leans heavy on Chinese foods... we shall see...  And now... for a CHOCOLOVE moment. One of the food changes is not eating foods you get in regular markets. I'm leaning heavy on organics & whole foods.  I don't even take in regular chocolate because your average chocolate bar has milk/lactose and so I buy the import chocolate bars that are mostly cocoa. i.e. cocoa liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, lecithin, vanilla were the ingredients in my last chocolove experience.  Costs a little bit more but after 2 months of this change I feel awesomer!  CHOCOLOVE is one of these dairy free bars, and to boot it comes with a love poem emblazoned inside... well not emblazoned but it comes in the wrapper.  I gotta admit I felt a bit like Charlie in Willy Wonka's movie... opening the bar carefully so as not to possibly rip a ticket... seeing the gold metal foil... peeking inside... it said: *** from DON JUAN  A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love, And beauty, all concentrating like rays Into one focus, kindled from above; Such kisses as belong to early days, Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move, And the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,  Each kiss a heart-quake, - for a kiss's strength, I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.  By length I mean duration; theirs endured Heaven knows how long - no doubt they never reckon'd; And if they had, they could not have secured The sum of their sensations to a second: They had not spoken; but they felt allured, As if their souls and lips each other beckond'd, Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung -  Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.  George Gordon, Lord Byron ***  At the end of Scene 16 in this play I just finished, my husband and I engage in a passionate kiss... my red lipstick all around his mouth.  He said he didn't want to wipe it away because he thought that action would look like disgust.  I used expensive smear-proof lipstick but every time the area around his lips looked like the rim of a coffee cup covered in red smear... I don't think the kisses smeared so bad on the other ones, just scene 16. The General in scene 17 said it was funny to try to keep serious while giving orders to a man with red lipstick mouth.  to be con't from the Hazelnut and Cherry Almond wrappers..."

G04W97J,female,34,"My last relationship ended just this past spring...in case the title above was at all misleading ;)  Part 1: Planets and Aspects  Sun Semisquare Saturn  This aspect is an indication that by being together you will share very powerful learning experiences which should not be taken lightly. Yours may very well be a fated and unavoidable relationship as well. Your relationship may be short-termed or long, but understand that Sun/Saturn bonds are not easily broken and they tend to bind you together for good or ill.  Your relationship together will expose facets of your personalities that you were unaware of and that you may not want to face. If you can take this opportunity to learn and grow, then you will discover a great deal about your faults and weaknesses. And the only way to overcome your weaknesses is to squarely face them and resolve to correct what needs correcting.  If you are looking for a foot-loose and fancy-free relationship, then don't enter into this one because you are likely to feel like a dog on a leash, and a short one at that. Limitations and confinement surround this aspect and unless you are looking for a little discipline, then it would be better to leave that to the boot camp drill instructor. Make no mistake, with this aspect there will be times when you feel you are restrained and confined just like in prison.   On a positive note, if you have been irresponsible and immature, then this relationship will show you the error of your ways and how you can improve. There is nothing like a little maturity to help us be better people. If your experience together is needed as part of a master plan, then you may very well have a long association. If not, then your relationship may be short-lived.  You may very well blame each other for all of the difficulties within your relationship. Each of you may see the other as the controller, the manipulator, the disapproving authority figure, the judge and jury, the stick in the mud who has no sense of humor at all. Constant duties, obligations and responsibilities may sap all the life out of your being together, yet you may continue to do them as though you were driven by some slave driver. This aspect does give a sense of security and that sense should not be taken lightly.  Personal one-on-one attachment, affection, fondness and tenderness will be lost to responsibility and hard work. This might be good in a working business partnership, but in a close personal relationship feelings will probably suffer.  You can expect a great deal of struggle, hardship and having to overcome adversity at every turn. One of you may very well become a great burden to the other in some way, thus helping them or yourself to mature and become more self-reliant.  Financial hardships, possible chronic health, oppression, obligations, and restrictions sum up the balance of this configuration. Yet this aspect does give you the power to endure and to overcome.  ...YIKES! haa haa haaa."

He also said it wasn't his place to reinstruct after another teacher already directed everything - like, it'd be an inadvertent criticism on the Director. Ya ok agreed.  Good's not good enough, I want to MOVE people.  Otherwise, what's the point?  One of my friends gave some decent feedback.

G04W97J,female,34,"Quote from narrative in Truffaut's  Jules et Jim:    Burning love letters scene:        “…here is a scene that some people, critics, have pointed out as having a certain kind of symbolic significance in terms of Catherine’s character. She dumps out these old love letters and sets them on fire and the fire gets a little out of control, and scorches the hem of her nightgown and Jim puts it out. Later on in the film she’ll throw herself in the Seine …Water…Fire… and then she’ll be seen putting Vitriol down the drain of the sink. And there’s a reference to Vitriol as liquid fire. So these are images, the fire, the water, burning, drowning, and yes they do serve a symbolic function by the thing about them that is interesting is the fact that they don’t play like symbols, there’s no portent involved. They’re not hitting you over the head and even if you don’t necessarily ‘get them’ they’re there and the function they serve within the narrative is just as compelling as any symbolic function. That’s a kind of naturalism…in a film that is not naturalistic. As I’ve said, the style of the film has a heightened kind of Romanticism to it and its very lively and alive and it sets you into the consciousness of watching a film. It reminds you quite a bit of time, that you’re watching a film and yet these characters are beautifully played and feel extremely real…”   *~*   I didn’t think I would like this film and I almost chose not to watch it. I understood the first half and liked it somewhat and the second half seemed to be exceptionally for entertainment - one extreme postulated against another. While watching the film I felt that in each moment, within the frame, there was more and more to look into. Not so much depth as immediate details. Nice though, I’d give it a second shot.   I saw myself in the first portion of this - that balancing of energy - but once the mid point of the film came up Catherine kept overstepping into areas with Jules and Jim like a child making demands and by the end you can see no matter what is said by these men (and MERELY said), none of that matters because she is in a situation where she resorts to having to overstep to them. Just messy.   Reminded me quite a bit of the summer of ‘97. I just broke up with my college sweetheart. I HAD to. I realized after 2 years I was the relationship and he was on auto-pilot the whole time. It was as simple as me walking away and he letting me because it was so much so my work. When I walked away he was powerless and he let it be that way, he didn’t have to but on the other hand I don’t know that he knew anything else. One of 4 brothers and NONE of them seemed to know much of serious relationships but what girlfriends brought to the table. Or, as his mother used to apologize on occasion to me, “I am so sorry T, that I spoiled him so badly…” Ya tell me about it. Though I don’t doubt for a moment that had I not influenced him so strongly that he would not be married today. The other 3 older brothers are not married, they don’t know how to move…what a waste.   Back to square one. What exactly reminded me of the summer of ‘97 was after I left M, I ran into another college pal of mine soon after, C. I think it was just a couple weeks later. He suggested we hang out. So, then he introduced me to his 2 male best friends, R & S. C tried to make a move on me fairly quickly. But something inside of me said no. So I held off from his advances. As the summer rolled out, it was … beautiful. C, R & S were all very beautiful. They were all still in college and somewhere between 21 and 23 in age. C was a computer engineer, R was in art school, S was in school too but totally uncertain as to what he wanted to focus on but he worked as a model as well. They all looked like models… and they dressed perfectly… I was in an aesthetic paradise in the very least, but everything was…succulent? I don‘t know what word to use. We 4 would go out every weekend to clubs, bars, parties, art galleries… etc. Anywhere we went was paradise. Sitting in the car was paradise. Breathing was paradise. Seriously… I was in paradise. Smart, beautiful, attractive, everything was there. I would look at them and say how could I pick one over another!? No way. I couldn’t. So, I just went along for the ride. And what a ride… Always and at one point or another one of them would start to make an advance to get somewhere with me, to pull me in, but with the offset of the others it wasn’t going to happen. You could feel it. In a way, if R or S would have actually made a significant move, they would have stepped over C who ‘found me first’ and C was my friend longer, so the whole thing was peculiarly balanced. We went out a LOT. I was always snug between these 3 guys. If we were at a party and I was walking around people would ask me, where are your boys? Oh, my boys… hee hee. I liked that. But yes, I’d look at them and think HOW could I pick one over another, I couldn’t. C was Spanish and was immaculately handsome as were the other 2. R was I believe completely Scottish in ethnicity. And S was my then favorite ethnic combination - half Asian, half Caucasian. I’d say about half of my boyfriends or love interests since high school were always ¼ or ½ Asian and the rest just Caucasian. I think I liked that back then because they looked more like me… but I am not Asian at all.   We weren’t physical, me and the boys. Nothing beyond what children would do if at all. One time C was driving my car and R was in the passenger seat, ironically I was in the back seat with S and somehow… well… I remember one of us had one of those twisty ties you use for garbage bags? The paper over a metal twisty tie… and one of us was trying to bite it out of the other’s mouth… like I think S must have bit down on it and waved it at me and I bit down on the other end of this little tie piece and our lips were like an inch or 2 away, engaged in a sort of tug-of-war with teeth. And C and R were REALLY not happy with this. C got angry and R was sulking. So, that little game didn’t last very long.   Unusual! The balance didn't allow for an action, it just was.  I love it and it was so unique.  I remember toward the end of the summer I just sensed that S and I would never go all the way.  I don't know why but it was something underneath it all.  So I gave him something unique of myself.  I never once tried to smoke a cigarette and he smoked like a choo-choo train.  One night I took one of his Dunhills and he lit it for me.  I remember this guy with a camera took pics of it all, it was like a HUGE ordeal.  I thought, well, we're not going to get  there  so I'll give him my smoking virginity! Haa haa... I wasn't designed to smoke.  I don't look right with a cigarette in my mouth.  People laugh.  eh! After that I tried to smoke more but it just didn't take it didn't feel natural, so it never was a habit, just a failed attempt.  BUT... smoking S's Dunhill, that was something I gave him that no one else would.   I have sharp, tight memories of C and R too...   By the end of summer, after months of frustration, C met a girl and began to date her. She was really unhappy with my… existence. Regardless of the fact that I was respectful and would never ever do anything to disrespect one of my boys, she was really uncomfortable and asked C to let me go, and he did. It sounds awful, but I understood… because the truth of what was there was much stronger than anything anyone could physically enact. It doesn’t make sense on the surface, but I respect him so I let him go.  And our happy 4-some summer came to a fade. Sigh.   Then a few months later in January I started getting romantically involved with this popular bay area musician, B …yes, bay area, as in 350+ miles north. It’s called Southwest Airlines! Yah. He traveled down here to perform gigs and see me, and I’d fly up there and stay weekends…  But as that got rolling that January ‘98 both C and R were getting involved with girls but S was still single. One night at one of the musician’s shows S noticed there was something between me and B,and then he got aggressive and tried to speak. Regardless, things were still awkward. Part of me was really happy that this amazing, popular musician wanted me to himself, and part of me was upset that S let me get away but I also understood things weren’t so clear cut. So then what do you do? You just deal. B and I were just starting to entangle in January. It was so new with B I didn’t even see him on Valentines. And yet I ended up at a party with friends on Valentines day. And S was there, but I don’t recall C or R being there. It was one of my most favorite Valentines day memories. All my Valentines are great - how can it not be, someone’s giving you some love! So at this party at this friend’s apartment S and I were sitting close on the couch. We had this game we made up, just between us, where one of us would start quoting lyrics from a PW song, and the other would complete them. And we’d try to get more and more obscure to test each other. And other people usually couldn’t understand us though they’d listen in and try to figure it out.   I remember as S and I were sitting there, this other girl who was fairly popular was single and sitting across the room. She started shouting at S to talk to him, and divert attention. One thing I loved about him is he never seemed to make another girl important in my presence. I am not sure why. Even much later on when he got a girlfriend if I walked in the room it was like she was not there and he’d panic…   So there we were on the couch and E, across the room was shouting at S, and he would give her short answers and he kept playing games with me. There was a bowl of candy hearts on the coffee table. I picked it up. I dug around for things I’d want to say but didn’t. Then I’d pick one like “KISS ME” and I would have rather it said “kiss me damn it, how long do I have to wait“?! but all that wouldn’t fit on a little heart. So I’d pick a heart then turn it upside down on his leg or hand and then he’d get a message back for me. It was … SUPER. Ha ahaa. Amazing. We did this over and over it was so much fun. After awhile at this party… I remember at one point I was going through this guy’s photo albums and whatever and people were watching something on TV. Finally I noticed S was missing, and I just left. How else could you end the evening? I thought I had what seemed to me a more solid chance with B because he was more direct and there wasn’t any complication beyond the mere 350+ miles between us… yikes.   So I left… and as I walked outside I heard this “Bye T” and I looked around, but I didn’t see anyone… then I heard, “up here!” And there was S all alone, out on the balcony of this apartment upstairs, just him and the stars above. I think in that very moment I saw him standing up there, alone, by himself, in the stars, in his cloud of thinking that there was more beauty in that than in anything I’d seen in so long. I waved. I said something, I don’t recall…   Enough memoir writing! Too many stories to tell… this was supposed to be about Jules et Jim. Oh funny, I think today is S’s birthday! If not today right about now like tomorrow or yesterday…"

G04W97J,female,34,"Do you remember the 24th night of November? Love was changing the minds of pretenders While chasing the clouds away  Our hearts were ringing In the key that our souls were singing. As we danced in the night, Remember how the stars stole the night away… (E,W,F)  About a boy From my archives Written in between interviewing...     Monday November 24, 2003   I am BEAT from rehearsals.  Well rehearsals weren’t as rigorous as all the behind the scenes tension.  It is SO weird.  It’s so... WEIRD.  I really think (A) and I fell in love! Like for real!? He is now with that girl who has been on him like white on rice, he goes through motions with her BUT is unique with me.  He doesn’t move off of her like he does me.  He gravitates to me, not her. He gazes at me, not her. He invests in me not her.  BUT is supposedly working things out with her.  So I now direct my attention on everyone else and he seems sad.  I am trying to pay as little attention as possible to this.  She copies what happens around me.  Whatever guy comes up to me, she tries to imitate the scenario, I don‘t understand it.  No matter how many times you try to walk through someone else’s steps you can’t be them, no one can.  As for me, no one has walked my life walk. I know he and I couldn’t be together, but strangely something was there, something strong.  I have now decided that if the focus, the love, the drive are present so will I be.  If not, I will not.   Even the lead said if you weren’t here I wouldn’t be here, that’s the only reason I am here.   I doubt I will work with this group anymore, there is no passion, I feel like (she)’s doing a job, going through motions.  At least I met (A). We were talking in the lobby and he said call me on my cell so I did and we talked 5 minutes and he told me about her and then he asked me how should he get her?   Then he said I want to settle down, get married, have a family, with YOU.  What the hell?! This is going to make me wacko if I keep talking to people like that.  I can’t be with him! Well, the play is over in 3 weeks time.    I remember when we first met at the first rehearsal.  I wrote a compliment on his sheet in this exercise, he asked me to show him which one and I showed him.  He said that’s all?! I said I can write more, and he handed the sheet back and I also wrote you have sparkly eyes and a very nice smile... something like that.    SO strange. (y) posted a bulletin, so weird.  I guess they had a record label party Saturday night.  The whole post was creative ?! Like rhymes and attempts at being... creative... being a creative writer... eh.   He f’cked up.  I noticed that last week he left a note for that poor, poor girl.  It was mean, that made me think he’s an asshole.  She seems to just adore him by what she writes, he didn’t have to be so mean.  Wow funny how things change.  I gotta rest and reassess my life.  No more games, only serious team players..."

It's not bad to be lacking in smarts, but it's irritable for others who have to pick up and clean up after their shortcomings.  I question racism.  Being someone of at least 2 major nationalities and backgrounds mixed into one body, I don't claim one over the other.  I have met a couple other people of the same mix, but I don't search to create a clan with them, as if they could understand our newer mixture of cultures.   I can't understand WHY people look down on the racist marks of the past but then turn around and contradict this by investing with bias just for their lineage, shopping at stores owned by people of their specific race, so on and so forth.   If people are people and we're just a mixed country, why aren't people respecting that more. I don't believe GOD to be a racist God.  I think of the idea of God as more on a plain of a mindset and not one nation over another.  Why one race or one religion over another? Why do people think like that..."

And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells.

G04W97J,female,34,"Something that drives me CRAZY.  Most musicians today are not creative...! They're more often than not more dry and technical than the accountants I used to work with, BLLLLLEAAAAH!  I see it all the time, ALL the time.  I'd say it's about a 75/25 ratio, tech over creative.  Basically they're just following a structure with little sense of the flex or the new of what they make, imitating other statistically popular sounds...  That's... yuck.

G04W97J,female,34,"Rehearsing for my scene work as the duchess has vacillated a LOT.  Luckily, the immediate instructor agrees with my interpretation.  I think it should be smooth sailing from here on out.  Though last Wednesday I had to grapple with SK and her unique view… as it was her opinion that my exuding “sexuality” is my weakness and that I should work on that for performance on stage.  She wanted me to VAMP up the duchess. She suggested that my partner and I roll around on top of each other on a desk, initiate a strip tease... OH PLEASE.  If I wanted to put on a sexual performance, you should offer to pay me like others would.  I have no interest in putting on a sexual performance on a stage.   Things are back on track, and I get to perform a sort of tongue-tied love as opposed to the stripper whore vamp. Yay. And I am paying for this.  Counting the days…  (something borrowed:) The Duchess comes across to the audience as the epitome of stoicism and strength of soul and character. At the beginning of the play, she is portrayed as a a woman of great integrity and honor, such that Antonio speaks of 'her days are practiced in such noble virtue that sure her nights, nay more her very sleeps are more in heaven than other lady's shrifts'. Indeed, we see her as a noble woman of much childlike innocence and naivety. Even her secret marriage to Antonio is not seen as something of lust and sexual desire, but of a woman's need for companionship and love 'tis not a figure cut in alabaster to kneel at my husband's tomb' , something she obviously cannot derive from her villainous brothers. Even at this point, she comes across as a strong character of intense emotion and longing for affection and love that she must resort to a secret marriage. In contrast, her marriage to Antonio seems cleaner than the Cardinal's adulterous relationship with Julia, his mistress. That the Duchess solemnizes their vows shows that she does have moral standards to uphold. Even her 'feigned pilgrimage' to Ancona was something that she and her family did as a real pilgrimage to pay their respect to our Lady of Loretto.  The childlike innocence of the Duchess is seen from the way that she tells Antonio that 'time will easily scatter the tempest' when Antonio brings up the threat of her ARAGONIAN BROTHERS. Yet, it is because of them that she is made to endure 'the worst torture, pain and fear'. One certainly pities her and feels that she should not be made to suffer so much for following her heart. Indeed, Ferdinand's obsession to 'purge infected blood' seems less a move to right a wrong than out of jealousy 'my imagination carries me to see her in the shameful act of sin'. The Duchess in nobly enduring all his cruel torments becomes a 'reverend monument whose ruins are even pitied'. Yet to a certain extent, while we pity the Duchess, one cannot deny that one feels a great admiration for her strength of character. She accepts suffering as her 'fate' and is 'acquainted with sad misery as the tanned slave is with his oar'. Even Bosola is able to realize the dignity in which she bears herself up to the suffering that her brothers make her endure 'as majesty gives to adversity; you may discern the shape of loveliness more perfectly in her tears than in her smiles'. One admires her for being so ready to accept her fate, the suffering she endures a mere consequence of her loving Antonio and marrying him. It is also through her suffering that she derives a new found wisdom 'your kiss is colder than i have seen a holy anchorite give to a dead man's skull'. Indeed, she realises the extent of her brother's tyranny and knows that she an Antonio must part. Their last moments together are certainly touching, and one truly pities her for being denied of true love. To lose the love of her life drains her very soul, and she is left empty and without meaning in life 'my laurel is all withered'. The Duchess accepts her death with humility, 'heaven's gates are not so highly arched as prince's palaces; they that enter there must go on their knees'. Yet to the end, she is dignified 'I am the Duchess of Malfi still'. Indeed, her 'violent death' seems more of a journey to liberation rather than an end in itself. Throughout the play, the Duchess is portrayed as the victim of entrapment, Ferdinand the predator that toys with his prey, the Duchess before killing her. (see THEME OF ENTRAPMENT).  The Duchess is hence a character to be admired and respected. That she is a historical figure shows that Webster was indeed perceptive in the plight of the Duchess at such a time when her behavior to marry Antonio outside the social status of her family would have been dealt with death, no question to the reasoning behind it. Webster's play hence is a statement against this convention, and the Duchess comes across as a real person of human emotion that each and every individual can relate to."
G04W97J,female,34,"I found out last night that a hunch of mine was right. My scene partner and his girlfriend have a great divide between them.  They don't really talk... I asked him how long they've been seeing each other, he said 3 years.  AH! I couldn't imagine 3 months passing without having enough of a bond to communicate by. She's really guarded.  I told him to step up and take the lead. He didn't have a response for that. He did say that she's down about relationships.  I think her pessimistic languange is her way of trying to coerce him to encourage her, indirectly.  He said yeah though she is older... 6 years older... I said that's no big deal.  Actually I thought they were the same age.   I am glad that our scene was cut before the kiss. HE even said it would have made him uncomfortable because I work with her and she's likely to get mad.    WHY DON'T THEY TALK? IT'S A NOVEL CONCEPT, I KNOW...   Ironically another woman who was given the role I was initially given before I was told to ""focus on forty"" also chose to cut all her partner-related scene work and decided she needed another monologue... and she cut from immediately following my scene...  and she wants to seamlessly enter behind me after my scene in the same role????? ...  OKAY could we be a little more tacky? Or as my partner said last night... it's like those shots in soap operas where suddenly one actor is immediately replaced by another actor and you hear a voiceover announce that the role will now be played by another person.  HMM.   AND she made a choice to end it at the KISS part of the scene because she didn't want to end it early on. NICE. Well... I suppose the secretary here can get pissy at her instead, oh well.

G04W97J,female,34,"Roberts, Katherine. “The Wandering Womb: Classical Medical Theory and the Formation of Female Characters in Hamlet.” Classical and Modern Literature: A Quarterly 15 (1995): 223-32.   FEMINISM / GERTRUDE / NEW HISTORICISM / OPHELIA  This essay approaches wombsickness (a.k.a. hysteria) as a “condition, described early in patriarchal Western culture, [which] has been a literary motif from classical to modern literature” (223). Evidence spanning from Greek medical theories to the doctrines of sixteenth-century physicians testifies to the belief that the female womb has physiological needs (e.g., sexual intercourse); left unmet, these demands result in hysteria. Simultaneously, stringent social codes of the Renaissance restricted female sexuality. A patriarchal culture defined women—socially and medically—by their relationships to men. Ophelia and Gertrude suffer classic symptoms of wombsickness. As a young girl of marriageable age and emotional instability, Ophelia is a prime candidate for wombsickness. She has been mentally and physically preparing herself for marriage/sex with Hamlet; but in the loss of all male figures to guide and support her, Ophelia becomes “completely vulnerable to her own femaleness” (229). Gertrude also suffers symptoms of hysteria, according to Hamlet’s account of “a woman whose physiology apparently required frequent intercourse” (230). In the absence of her original husband to sate and govern her sexual energies, Gertrude is easily seduced, and her disorderly behavior damages the society. As “her natural guardian,” Hamlet must intervene to “constrain her”—hence the closet scene (231). While Gertrude properly responds to his chastising by transferring her allegiance from Claudius to Hamlet, and in a sense recovering from her wombsickness, it is too late to prevent the destruction of the throne’s inhabitants. This article makes no definitive claims about Shakespeare’s intentions but notes that Renaissance literature “reflects and reinforces” previously developed concepts of women, bringing “those concepts into the twentieth century” (232)."
G04W97J,female,34,"Ah, Monday. Well, theatre went well this past weekend.  I was incredibly nervous opening night, Friday. I thought it was funny Saturday night though... because when the playwright came out to mention a few things, we actors only heard about 6 or 7 people clapping.  Someone whispered to me before we went on, ""It sounds like there are 5 people out there. I doubt it's a big crowd."" But I walked out to see a LOT of people there, most of the room full, actually. Performing was scary, exciting and fun.  My poor stage husband! Haa haa. I am 34 acting opposite a 19 y.o.  He's a great actor but he seems awfully confused with everything going on.  I think this play was a big growth experience for him.  We met as friends last year but now that we're acting out all this romantic stuff, he freezes up a lot and doesn't talk much... I know he's the lead and carrying a lot... eh it's probably just my head skewed from all this work.  I'm awfully happy lately and I don't know why really.  Maybe I'm doing something right. I'll write again when I have something more to say... I'm still feeling this system out."

This is why so many film critics feel an affinity for Truffaut, I think, because, they probably had that problem growing up too..."""

What was it we talked about? So...  Just remind me  Of why I'm wasting so much  Time pretending  That there is something more than  Only this  Only  This pointless accusation  Tell me again,  Why are we here?   I'm not offended by the things that you say  'Cause it's such a predictable way to behave  Talk and insult me  'til you're blue in the face  You were right, I was wrong  Now does that make you happy ?  I'm quite aware of all the bad things I did  You don't have to remind me of why you dislike me  There's no solution  To the mess that we're in,  It's so sad and so boring  I wish you'd just leave me alone   But I understand the games you play  I'm ashamed of all the things I did to you   (Author: M.

G04W97J,female,34,"After spending a LOT of time in heavy meditation and contemplation yesterday, I woke up twice in the night, sharp and jarringly, with answers to my questions from my sleep! AND I FORGOT THEM!!!  The first moment of awakening was something REALLY positive and optimistic in total contrast to where I am... it's so faint.  Was I in this relationship I want? I remember when I woke, and this happens on rare occasion, it's like a HUGE gust coming at me, telling me what I need to know, the words hit me quick just as I wake up.  And the words were there, I don't remember them now though! Although I think it had to do with being in love.  The second one I don't recall I just remember I woke twice with that same gust of information, as if there was only a moment to blurt out what I needed to know just before jumping from dreamtime to waketime.  I find things like this fascinating.  Dreaming and sleep..."
G04W97J,female,34,"Not a lot!   An optimist is a person who sees only the lights in the picture, whereas a pessimist sees only the shadows. An idealist, however, is one who sees the light and the shadows, but in addition sees something else: the possibility of changing the picture, of making the lights prevail over the shadows.   - Felix Adler  I pride myself on moments of feeling greatly vacant, yay! AAALLLLL these past days I worried about hurting my scene partner's girlfriend's feelings, not wanting for her to be uncomfortable with my acting romantic with her boyfriend... then the tables turn?! Perception is absurd.  I, THAT'S ME, I imagined she'd feel bad because of how anxious she became once she found out that her boyfriend and I were acting together in a romantic scene. SO both he and I dragged our feet not to get to that part, to avoid possibly hurting her feelings.  Her discomfort was very clear.  But funny... I never really noticed that she does NOT discuss him openly in the workplace, only one on one with certain people... and she has pictures of people on her desk, but not him! But, they've been in a relationship for 3 years?! Uh... call me stupid but why then? Why bother...  (let's call my scene partner's girlfriend/my secretary ""Y"") I was at Y's desk and I started to mention to one of the other secretaries standing next to her that Y's boyfriend and I were rehearsing and Y stopped me.  Behind the other secretary's back, Y waved at me to say nothing. Wha...  Then later she came by my office and said she'd never told me not to tell anyone because she didn't think it would ever come to that - that I might mention she has a boyfriend... Wha...  Ok, I am dumb!  I said I don't understand.  You two have been together 3 years, but you want it to stay a secret?! Why?  She said oh you know how people talk. I said talk about what? He works at another office, there's nothing to talk about.  I couldn't imagine calling someone my boyfriend and hiding them for years.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Yikes. Cornered. Her counter was, ""well, you know.""  No, I don't.  I don't understand making that kind of investment for nothing, not 3 years.  I know Y and I don't have that much in common but... I still don't get it.  Next, she was telling one of the new girls that they should go to a male strip club during lunch & the new girl asked me if I wanted to come along...?!  Okay... overbuff, oiled men are GAY whether they know it or not.  Those calendars? Are bought by gay men... or women of unique taste in my opinion.   I was at a loss...   Y & the new girl were smiling in agreement over these oily men... ""oh, and it's full touch dancing,"" whatever the hell that means, haa haa haa... and I wanted to say but that's for gay men! Instead I just sat there with my mouth open and I tried not to catch any flies...  Wha...  I don't know anything.  Then she sent me an email this morning ""FYI"" :       For all those men who say,       ""Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free.""       Here's an update for you.....       Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage.        Why?        Because women realize its not worth buying an entire Pig....       Just to get a little sausage.    If I had this sort of attitude I'd have to shoot myself.  Wha...  If you attack the person you're with, you attack yourself.  If you don't know yourself, you'll NEVER know the person you're with.  You never really 'know' but with certain understanding you do...  Of course, I know nothing, what do I know?  WTF! Can I leave now?! haa haa... No but really... if you allow circumstance to mold and change you in a negative way, like this, you miss out.  I am guessing that she seriously considered some men of bad taste/behavior in her past.  I don't believe in that.  I am firm in what I believe in I guess that's why I don't understand why she'd do what she's done, she's wasting one of the most enjoyable aspects of an individual's life:  LOVE.  I don't know anything."

And Paulish W. says, ""...and it’s written in the stars meant for us / soaked into the sand made by time taken by the hand from above / I really do feel that we work for love...""  As for me, I speculate.   IF (T) + (secret name here) =   Part 1: Planets and Aspects  Sun Trine Pluto  This aspect is sure to give a very strong and powerful bond. The energy present here will change both of you at very deep levels. In time you will know every aspect of each other's personality and you will reveal secrets to each other that others will never know. A passionate and emotional nature is a powerful part of this configuration and this will help make you even closer.  You will make a very dynamic and powerful team and you can make major differences and changes not only in your own lives, but in the lives of the people around you as well. Should you decide to serve others in some way, then you will have a very positive effect on their lives. Any difficulties that you experience in this relationship will be transformed by this aspect. This relationship will be a very serious one and it is likely to involve more of you than any relationship you have had before it.  Because of the transforming and probing energies in this aspect, normal patterns of existence and behavior will be changed by your relationship and new insight into your lives will be revealed. Together you will have an unlimited faith that will see you through any situation and thus transform you in the process.  Investigating the unknown, delving into unchartered territories, achieving great accomplishments and creatively constructing something from virtually nothing are all possible for the two of you working together as a team. Scientific, business and financial endeavors may be your strong suit. You can be excellent bargain hunters together and you can work with and profit from taxes, insurance, wills or things connected with the dead. There are strong and potent clairvoyant and intuitive abilities at work here as well.  You can expect fate and unexpected events to play a role in bringing this relationship together and keeping it on course.   Oh really?    And,  SECTION I:  How (T) Relates to Other People   Mars Conjunct Saturn with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  Your emotional needs were not met when you were growing up and there was nothing you could do about it. Even today, you tend not to express anger or pain or resentment except when you are in an infrequent rage. This is a problem in close relationships.   Sun Opposition Pluto with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  Power struggles plague your relationships. Either you become the dominant partner out of a fear of being controlled or you become very passive, controlling indirectly through guilt or manipulation. Your father may have been emotionally abusive to you.   Venus Opposition Uranus with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  You need to be close and you need to be free. This is a major life conflict which has always created complications for you in close personal relationships. One manifestation of this may be a tendency to pursue the unavailable or the unreliable.   Mercury SemiSquare Mars with an orb of less than 1 degree  Since you tend to be rather irritable and sharp-tongued at times you require a partner with a sense of humor who is not too thin-skinned. You are bright, curious and restless and enjoy the company of those who are equally high-spirited and enterprising.   Mercury SemiSquare Saturn with an orb of less than 1 degree  You are a serious person and inclined to be somewhat inflexible in your thinking. Since you tend to be rather judgmental, you could only be happy with someone who is in philosophical agreement with you and conceptualizes the world as you do. Sometimes you are rather taciturn.   Mercury Opposition Pluto with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  You're not awfully good at being disagreed with. You delve into matters, think them through thoroughly and expect your conclusions to be universally shared (t-hee!). Flexibility is not your strong suit. No one should try to lie to you or keep things from you. Somehow you ferret out others' secrets although you keep your own.   Sun Trine Neptune with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  One of your great strengths is your sensitivity. You tune in easily to the psyches of other people and, while you may not notice the color of their eyes, have an almost eerie understanding of their private inner worlds. Your close ties are very private.      SECTION II:  How _______ Relates to Other People   Venus Square Uranus with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  You need to be close and you need to be free. This is a major life conflict which has always created complications for you in close personal relationships. One manifestation of this may be a tendency to pursue the unavailable or the unreliable.   Mars Square Saturn with an orb between 1 and 3 degrees  Your emotional needs were not met when you were growing up and there was nothing you could do about it. Even today, you tend not to express anger or pain or resentment except when you are in an infrequent rage. This is a problem in close relationships.   Mercury Quintile Jupiter with an orb of less than 1 degree  You have a quality people trust and you are often sought after as a confidante or an advisor. You have high moral and ethical standards and it is imperative that anyone you're close to is a person of the highest integrity. You prefer well-educated people.   Venus Square Jupiter with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  You may be overly self-indulgent and inclined toward excesses of eating, drinking, sex or anything which gives you pleasure. You would not be comfortable with someone who was too reserved. You can be quite extravagant both emotionally and financially.   Sun Trine Neptune with an orb between 3 and 5 degrees  One of your great strengths is your sensitivity. You tune in easily to the psyches of other people and, while you may not notice the color of their eyes, have an almost eerie understanding of their private inner worlds. Your close ties are very private.   Sun Sextile Pluto with an orb between 1 and 5 degrees  You regenerate yourself through periodic transformations of your life situation. Your relationships can only endure if your partners grow and change with you so that you wind up still pointed in the same direction. Otherwise you will leave them behind.   (T's) Sun Square _______'s Neptune:  You must guard against mutual deception and misunderstandings. T tends to have an unrealistic view of _______, and _______ has a tendency to unconsciously capitalize on T's imaginative and often simply erroneous perceptions. The tendency to be dishonest, hide things from each other, exaggerate, and spur each other to unrealistic hopes and dreams is very strong. Both of you must be able to distinguish fantasy from fact, and utilize the increased sensitivity and heightened imagination that you inspire in each other, without letting it cloud your ability to clearly and realistically see other and understand each other."

Thanks to all you letters and calls, the Assembly Health Committee passed both SB 1566 (School Nutrition Standards) and SJR 29 (Resolution on Marketing to Children) yesterday afternoon.   SB 1566, Senator Escutia's nutrition standards bill, passed on a 10-5 vote.  SB 1566 builds on SB 19 (Escutia - 2001) and SB 677 (Ortiz - 2003) by  establishing comprehensive nutrition standards for all foods K-12) and beverages (K-8) sold outside of the federal meal programs in all California public schools.   These standards would be implemented without an additional budget expenditure.   The food standards bill had to be compromised to eliminate the beverage standards in high school , but in return the soda and restaurant industries removed their opposition so that we could get the votes we needed to maintain the food standards for all schools K-12.  Next: SB 1566 now goes to the Assembly Education Committee next Wednesday June 23.  SJR 29, Senator Kuehl's marketing resolution also passed on a 12-5 vote.  SJR 29 is a resolution that calls on the federal government to put  reasonable limits on the marketing of foods and beverages to children and calls for the food, marketing, and media industries operating in California to voluntarily adhere to a code of practice for responsible food / beverage marketing to children.   Next: SJR 29 will go to the Assembly Floor after the summer recess.  More information on both the bill and the resolution can be found on our website at:   http://www.publichealthadvocacy.org/legislation/.  We will be back in touch with more information on next steps and important actions needed to help gain passage of SB 1566 and SJR 29. Thanks for all your continued support!   YAY...!"

G04W97J,female,34,"So immediately following trippingly in the dark on the blind heels of SHAX, I am now about done reading through the play ""A Lovely Sunday ..."" and now it has me thinking ... if I am just being an ass in life...  A glimpse, borrowed from another's eyes:  A great writer cannot turn out a masterpiece (that overloaded term) each time, and no one reading or seeing  A Lovely Sunday...  will mistake it for Williams's best work. Nevertheless, it has a touch of his genius, and enacts in miniature what he does so well in his greatest plays. Several mismatched people living in a boarding house in St. Louis become entangled in each other's lives. Prominent among them is an aging woman now basing her hope for a ""real"" life on the proposal of a man hardly worth her attention, and who learns she will have to make a life for herself or remain unfulfilled. The message of the play is to appreciate what you have, rather than striving for what you cannot achieve. It's a lesson Blanche DuBois might have heeded. As always, the poetic quality of the author's dialogue and stage directions enhances the play. This nicely printed New Directions ""paperbook"" is recommended to those who already know the author's best work, and who would like to get a fuller sense of his different moods and subjects.  Depressing, non? Oui.  Yesterday while trying to do research I found a woman's blog... and she had this disclaimer I thought was kind of witty... and it went into detail about respecting people's online journals and if you stumble onto someone's journal and you know them and you read their info how to be proper... and that you shouldn't read an ex-lover's journal... and I have been... and I have been stupid enough to think that maybe he was thinking of me by his watery insinuations but I can't see how now... for some reason I look at it all and it looks like he's got so many loose-knit variations of girlfriends scattered about the place.  A person like that has no trust because they create this net and each strand of the net is a lover so if one strand breaks, well... the saftey net as a whole is still in tact... so if they f'ck up oh well, next...  That's F'cking WEAK.  Oh, I can't handle myself or anyone else so I'll keep scattered women about so if I f'ck up I'll just discard LOVE like it didn't exist ... Mf'cker... PLEASE.  THAT'S NOT LOVE... that's f'cking pathetic.  WHAT the f'ck kind of modern love is THAT?!  It somewhat resembles the mass of dating I scrambled through last year and that was  beyond  retarded. What makes  your  fear and pain so special from anyone elses?! How is it you pretend monogamy when you can't deal monogamy?  Not fair. ""Sufferance is the badge of all our tribe."" Wm Shax - f'cking hello. If you can't trust the person you are with (saftey net  =  no trust) then you can't trust yourself and if you can't trust yourself you're NOT READY.

G04W97J,female,34,"Sugar and alcohol basic food groups for many adults - Kim Severson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, June 2, 2004  http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/06/02/MNG0U6V4S436.DTL     Junk food, sugary drinks and beer make up nearly one-third of the calories adult Americans consume daily, according to a UC Berkeley study released Tuesday.   ""We knew it was bad, but we didn't know it was this bad,"" said Gladys Block, a professor of epidemiology and public health nutrition at the university. ""It's no wonder there's an obesity epidemic in this country.""   Her findings, the most recent and comprehensive look at what the nation eats based on caloric intake, show that three types of foods -- sweets and desserts; soft drinks; and alcoholic beverages -- make up almost 25 percent of all calories.   Salty snacks and fruit-flavored drinks make up an additional 5 percent, bringing the energy contributed by nutritionally deficient foods to about 30 percent of the calories adults eat every day, the study shows.   By comparison, healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables make up only 10 percent of the caloric intake in the U.S. diet. Depending on body size and exercise level, women should consume an average of about 2,000 calories a day and men 2,500 calories.   Soft drinks and pastries led the top 10 foods contributing the most calories to the American diet. Sodas alone contributed 7.1 percent of the total calories in the U.S. population. Foods such as hamburgers, pizza and potato chips rounded out the top five food items. Beer came in ninth on the list, just ahead of french fries and fried potatoes.   The study, published in the June issue of the Journal of Food Chemistry and Analysis, comes as the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reworking the food guide pyramid. This fall, the federal government will issue a new set of dietary guidelines intended to limit fat, salt, alcohol and soda consumption and urging Americans to eat a healthier mix of foods based on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat milk products and lean meats, fish or meat alternatives.   Most Americans' diets are far from those recommendations, said Block, who based her study on the eating habits of 4,760 adults who took part in one of the nation's largest health studies, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.   Participants were asked to report all the foods they ate in a 24-hour period. The study, based on diets from 1999 to 2000, doesn't include people younger than 18, who have even worse diets than adults, according to Block and other nutritionists.   ""If I was to look separately at teenagers and young adults, it would be much worse,"" she said. ""I really shudder to think what our national health situation is going to be 20 or 30 years from now when the young generation who is really living on this diet gets older.""   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which used data from the same comprehensive survey, an estimated 64 percent of U.S. adults are either overweight or obese. About 15 percent of children are overweight, and 40 percent more are considered unfit.   Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy in Sacramento, said the fact that Americans consume so much junk food, soda and beer was alarming but not a surprise.   ""Those are exactly the products the food industry advertises the most. My hope is this kind of information will not only change individual behavior but inform public policy. The obesity epidemic isn't only about personal choices, it's about all the advertising the food industry aims at our children.""   The UC Berkeley study highlights another disturbing undercurrent to the nation's obesity crisis: Although two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, many of them are malnourished, Block said.   ""Obviously, we need to worry about weight, but we also need to realize that people are eating a huge amount of food that has no useful micronutrients like vitamins and minerals,"" Block said. ""The message isn't to eat less, but to eat differently.""   E-mail Kim Severson at kseverson@sfchronicle.com.

G04W97J,female,34,"I love it when I run into clusters of ideas.  They seem to bombard me all at once, and especially when I am nowhere near a piece of paper, or a computer.   VEGAN FLAG   When I was 21 (1991 for those without calculators), I changed my diet to vegetarian.   Being somewhat aware of how dramatic changes aren't always the most successful, I cut out red meat first... then chicken... then fish... and so on. Why did I do it? The truth? Because I had an enormous crush on PW and he was a vegetarian.  He was an enormous influence on me.  And over the past oh, what's it been now, 13 years (?!), I've been mostly vegetarian.  If not vegetarian I'd then ok fish & chicken in stints.  But I left out red meat because in the least it's too tough for digestive systems, I think.  There have been very few times - I am sure I could count them on my fingers - that I've consumed red meat since '91.  I always noticed a curiosity in me toward VEGANS... you know those types.  They don't eat any animal products, and the hardcore ones go as far as to avoid buying anything that uses any animal product - no leather, no... jello, marshmallows, honey... pretty hard core.  I always fascinate over hardcore.  People who delve into extremes.  From the tender-footed VEGAN whose cautious not to step on insects when they're walking, to the animalistic types who not only eat meat but then crack open the bones and suck on the marrow.  What does it all mean? Does it mean anything? Nothing at all?  My opinion, which is only that, is that they both have their place.  Dunno, either/or.   I was leaning toward veganism.   BUT every single, and I MEAN EVERY SINGLE vegan I have met is not who they seem to be. It's strange.  As I'd get to know them I found the same story every time: A person who is above average in sensitivity, but the more they'd talk about what they do and their views, it turned out to be more of a projection of their self on the animals rather than animal rights for the animals.  When you TRULY do something for  others , for society for whatever it is, it is action for its cause.  It isn't about wearing a badge on your sleeve like a brand name, or a hot topic to discuss, you don't brag or flaunt it.  It isn't about  co-branding yourself  by association.  And though clearly vegans adhere to their actions (and usually quite religiously), each time I found the same story underneath:  a sensitive person who couldn't fight back.  As if they displace their experience onto the animals who can't fight back.  I found it in their words every time.  This really translates to imbalanced ego, as if they're so overly concerned with their own personal failures to maintain that they need to further show this  of themselves  to other people by giving society the consideration of those who can't fight on even footing (animals).    Vegans, in the immediacy of weakness.  BUT, Each vegan I met had benefits as well.  Some sort of relative zen that's very nice.  They are, though inadvertently, doing something right.  What that is I am not sure but I can feel it.  It's like a *toy surprise inside* sort of situation.    Over the past several months I noticed my allergies increasing... dairy, nuts, etc.  And I've found that I've reduced myself to only eating OH just about dirt and rocks.  I hope not to speak the vegan speech, but I am walking the walk...today anyway  Don't listen to me, it's all speculation.  And don't believe anyone who says they've got it down. XX"

G04W97J,female,34,"a la Ren & Stimpy.     I must be losing my mind... I remembered seeing an interview on TV looong ago, maybe pre-election of George ""HW"" Bush, with Babs and then I looked up a couple sources to compare to the interview in my memory.  The past story and the current story totally contradict... I am scratching my head and thinking maybe I have brain damage...     I remember her being interviewed maybe even before GHWB went into office and she went on about how much older she was than GHWB and how she kept holding out and she didn't marry young, she married later and was glad she waited so long because ""look how it turned out!"" she said...     I am SO confused.  A couple sources I found just now say she's a year younger than he is and they met when they were 16?!  I saw a picture of them with kids, they look 20-something... but even as of the past decade she looks like she's got quite a stretch ahead of him.      So confused.  If it wasn't her who was it?! I'm about 90% sure it was her that's why I feel lost. Oh well."
G04W97J,female,34,"Section 1: The Sun   Sun in Pisces:   The flowering of compassion, through your ability to merge on a feeling level and to empathize with all, is a key theme for you in this lifetime. This propensity to share others' emotional experience has both its blessings and its deficits. At your finest, T, you have a deeply-felt understanding of human nature which goes beyond words or intellect, and which enables you to forgive others' misdeeds and make allowances for their weaknesses. You are acutely aware of others' pain, including the emotional wounds and brokenness they carry within, and your ability to listen with an understanding heart and to unconditionally accept people as they are can be a healing influence in their lives. You are inclined to exclude nobody. At a deep level you feel and know your oneness with all creatures, and thus every snail in the garden or stray cat is part of your ""heart's family"".   However, this same all-embracing emotional/psychic openness and receptivity can be the source of some of your greatest challenges in life. It is easy for you to become overwhelmed by the world and its sorrows, and to seek some form of escape from it and from your own extreme sensitivity; for instance, over using drugs or alcohol or even food to alter your mood, or retreating from life into the unreal world of television or other diversions. You may simply withdrawing into your own private fantasies to avoid confronting the challenges in the physical world. At its worst this tendency can devolve into evasiveness and playing ostrich ""about important issues in your life"". While your imagination and your sensitivity are the well spring of some of your richest experiences and gifts, if over indulged you may become passive, ineffectual, lost or confused. Especially when young, T, you may lack a strong sense of self, of definition and identity, because on a feeling level you identify with others so easily. It can be difficult for you to separate yourself, to know what your boundaries are, when to say no or how to stand up for your own personal interests. Since you are not narrowly focused on self, others may take advantage of your natural generosity and sympathy. Learning and incorporating the concepts of discrimination and clear judgment will enable you to give of yourself in ways that are healthy for you and the ones you are giving to."

G04W97J,female,34,"At the crux of the beautiful Sonnet No. Ninety-One, I have found a solution. I can read it to anyone as I can read it to no one. Temporary reason being that I am ultimately wrong... hee hee.  It's like this.  The point of this sonnet is that the reader is as the final couplet reads:  "" wretched  in this ALONE that THOU mayst take  ALL this away and me most  wretched  make.""   True? You are warned by the writer.  To live this way is wretched.  To put all your eggs into one proverbial basket is crazy.  What will you fall back on if the basket drops? You lose all (but you gain all at the same time).  Considering that I know this is wrong (but I do it over and over anyway, ha!), it is a form of temporary bastardization to my own romantic view of this sonnet.  Is it really fair to put THAT much of an onus on my love interest?! Am I, by the weight of such a circumstance, being overbearing and ridiculous... it is apparently imbalanced. Dunno.  Never seemed to stop the men of my past!  That's good news.  Carrying so much of my love and expectations must have been so heavy for them, or not, I don't know.  They seemed to do it gladly. So, it belongs to everyone as it would no one.  The show can go on... Nice, huh? ;)  Main Entry: wretch·ed  Pronunciation: 're-ch&d Function: adjective Etymology: Middle English, irregular from wretch 1 : deeply afflicted, dejected, or distressed in body or mind 2 : extremely or deplorably bad or distressing     3 a : being or appearing mean, miserable, or contemptible   b : very poor in quality or ability : INFERIOR     *~*  by memory - No. NINETY-ONE: *~* Some glory in their birth, some in their skill, Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force.

Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth, prouder than garments cost Of more delight than hawks or horses be. And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.

G04W97J,female,34,"Or, I just feel no impetus for reading my scenework homework re. Amalfi. I am a bad girl-woman.  I haven't read it yet and I should have made major headway by now.  BUT, I am a good girl-woman. I stepped up to it and I began taking iron supplements as of yesterday. *curtsies*  I blame my skewed self specifically on my feminineAHEMbiology.   I suffer a few days out of the month.  A small price to pay to be me.   All the other miseries I gladly accept with minor whining side affects.  I fell in love with a picture in the LA Weekly. It was a newsprint ad for an indie film called,  THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL.  That camel face, so beautiful. I want to see this movie because the camel has a beautiful face. BUT, it sounds like a super sad movie.   With a happy ending. I need a proper shoulder to accompany me to such a movie. I have 2, but leaning on them isn't quite the same.  It's supposed to be a documentary on a white baby camel that was rejected  by its mother at birth and the white baby camel wouldn't stop crying.  So the people in this town (argh I forgot which one) search for these certain musicians in hopes that the music can lull the 2 back together. Supposedly it DOES work and when the momma camel sees her baby and realizes what is going on, She cries camel tears.  FOR REAL.  I am  not  joking.  Maybe I should see it alone because I will probably cry... That's TOO touching.  There is ONE movie that I know of that EVERY time I see it, doesn't matter what year or when or any circumstances, when I see the ending I CRY MY FREAKING HEAD OFF. Tired of guessing? (as I write this to myself, hoo hoo hooooo)  A Little Romance.  When Lauren and ... the little French boy say good-bye and she has to go and they're playing that Georges Delerue (sp?) music and he's running after her in the car... I turn into a little white baby camel!  Yes.  No fail.  Need to see tears, show me that clip. Hey next time I need to get in touch with sadness for scenework I should get that video out.  *  *  *  *  I was reading this piece a young girl wrote on dating and her experience on meeting men.  She's the pursuer.  It was interesting.  I can barely handle dealing with what comes to me much less considering pursuing someone and going through all that work.   DAMN I AM CRAVING A GARDENBURGER something fierce! anyways, I was reading about how witty and cute she is, yes charming, but even in her story I could see the inherent lack of strategy men thrive on when they've got the situation geared and calculated.  I'd much rather focus on dealing with men based on their approaches effectively. I find that I often have to be discouraging or they get too up in my business then I get crowded.  But even then that approach sometimes poses as a lure to some men so, it's work just trying to create alone space. AND, in conclusion, I am who I have always been. Despite my deep curiosity as to if there was something out there that I may be missing out on, no.  I am and always will be a thorough monogamous, tunnel-vision-impared, loyal-till-I-vomit-not-a-sucker-nor-willing-to-engage-with-someone-who-plays-me-for-the-sucker-either, kind of significant other girlfriend who aspires to be something more now that I am in the 30's pool.  I remember YEARS ago, maybe even a decade ago, when that tv show ""Thirty-Somethings"" came out it made me feel gross.  I thought 30 was so old, especially because the representation of 30 as it were is relatively lifeless.  I don't like the way people who stagnate think, their energy is flat.  And to totally contradict myself, I want to settle so bad!! But it's different.  I want to lock-in and build with the right guy so that I can focus on all the other aspects of life that shift.    Here's a test for whoever reads this.  Try shopping ONLY in health/whole/natural foods stores only for awhile, like a month or 2, like me.  THEN go into any major chain store.  Look around you.  Then tell me what you see.  I went to a major chain store earlier. And I have been committed to my organics/health kick for about 2 months now and I've avoided the major shops, and YIKES people eat a looooooot of scary stuff.  People are  suffering  and they can't see.  Because it's easy to package and make convenient low quality foods for masses to eat.  What they make seem high quality in comparison isn't even CLOSE.  If the people in power know to avoid what the masses have, the masses become sluggish and weak while the people who avoid this, if handled correctly, can thrive.  When will people learn.  Just because you can't see things within 1 to 2 degrees doesn't mean the ripple effect isn't coming back toward you in the pool. It is, you're just not within view of the math.  Give like - get like.  EVERYONE is affected, you cannot hide in a panic room, you cannot hide anywhere, it's called life."

G04W97J,female,34,"So SK the immutable Shakes seminar director has continued her tension.  The seminar ends in 2 weeks = I will survive.  I was alleviated when I found she can be easily be thrown off of her usual overbearing track by the mention of any of the Beatles... and from this come some interesting Beatle tales...which is a nice thing.  But again she continued with her age-orientation prattling... that is now bothering me because I hear it from her so much.  I am sure this should fade once I am out of range of her influence in a couple weeks.  Last night when she was lecturing me about age, she said, ""DON'T YOU KNOW, 60 IS THE NEW 40!""

G04W97J,female,34,"The first time I’d heard Elliott Smith was going along in a car ride with someone.  This guy was singing along to “Between the Bars”. I said, “WHO is this?!”   “Oh, Elliott Smith.  He does music work for soundtracks, and indie stuff.” He said.  Hmm.  It rang spiritual.  I caught on to ES late in the game.  I didn’t start buying his music until 2000.   I saw him perform for free at the local junction street fair they put on every year, I think this was 2001, I don‘t think it was 2002 but I don‘t recall immediately.  By then Elliott was struggling on a down slope, seemed to be less in his favor.   I remember… I brought my boyfriend at the time, we walked to the street fair.  I wanted for him to hear Elliott live.  Before the show began people were pushing and shoving to get close to the stage, very much the clichéd imaged of packed sardines.  Elliott came out in his Willie Nelson (?!) homage, wearing a hat & 2 braids.  He was drunk.  He turned to his girlfriend constantly for support.  Once he began singing, it was like a chemical blanket of peace and happiness covered everyone.  Suddenly everyone was concerned for the other people around them, that they were ok and comfortable, instead of pushing and shoving as they were before he began.  People were offering their spaces to people who had a lesser view.  My boyfriend …even he squeezed my hand and looked at me with this sort of surprise, emotional blush at how strong the sensation was.   As Elliott played, he’d drop off and forget what was going on, forget the words, forget…forget… drunken slurring, messy… and everyone would sing the words really loudly for him and he’d carry right along on what was being fed to him.   After that night, some people wrote reviews and bitched about it.   I thought he did fine.  I'm biased when there's love in my heart, eyes and mind, for the things that I find.  Everything's mint.  The last time I saw Elliott Smith alive was on the evening of August 3rd, 2003 before his death on October 21st, 2003 (RIP - August 6, 1969 - October 21, 2003).  He played with this band called “The Physical Plants” at a Kinks Tribute.  I brought my camera (YAY) and I got video clips!  Sadly, I mistakenly deleted one of the clips of a solo he did.  But I still have other footage.  I was really impressed with the band KENNEDY, they really got into the movement of the Kinks’ sound.   Elliott… was with his girlfriend.  I remember his thin t-shirt and how his skin looked beneath it.  I remember the smell of his body mixed with the smell of beer, because he was standing right next to me before he performed, and I was standing front and center.  I remember his eyes.  His expressions.  At times he’d curl up his hand and rub at his face like a small child, that sort of reaction.  His girlfriend seemed really kind to him.   He allowed himself to be easily distracted.  His focus for his performance just wasn't there.    I don’t believe it was suicide, his death by fatal stab wound.  I think someone did it.  I think it’s unlikely that the story will ever unfold and it will remain untold because I don’t think it’s something people will focus on.  I  don't want to  think someone would do that though that's where the probability lies, in my own opinion.  After standing next to both he and his girlfriend just less than 3 months prior, and feeling things out, I don’t believe either of them did it.  I don’t believe she would.  Their faces were very much like… mother and child of the sweetest nurturing kind.  She was attentive and he was slipping into this sort of regression.  I don’t believe he killed himself.  His energy was like jelly.  Just wobbly and awkward, I can’t see how he’d be in the vein of energy to stab his own heart.  He was more in a latent state of energy like burn out rather than self-destruction by infliction.  I think someone else did it.  Mystery.  The news of Elliott’s death spread the next morning, Wednesday Oct 22nd.  I was really sad for days following.  I wasn’t able to get over to his memorial at the Solutions shop wall until Friday.  And I took pictures.  And I was late to my theatre rehearsal that night.  I cried on my way over to rehearsal, but I went anyway.  I felt funny.  Just that one night Friday the vibe was strong, I didn’t want to leave. Actually… come to think of it… that following Sunday I went back and I went alone at 6am ‘cause I wanted to feel what all that energy at his memorial felt like with no one else there.  Sunday wasn’t so sad.  I have pictures… of the sun coming up in the east amidst lots of blackness from a local fire.  And the palm trees standing patient.  And the wall at Solutions as the increase of written good-byes accumulated.  Flowers coming and going.  Candles. Pictures. Presents…  lots of hand-made gifts…   between the bars   drink up baby, stay up all night with the things you could do, you won’t but you might the potential you’ll be that you’ll never see the promises you’ll only make drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days do what I say and I’ll make you ok and drive them away the images stuck in your head people you’ve been before that you don’t want around anymore that push and shove and won’t bend to your will I’ll keep them still drink up baby, look at the stars, I’ll kiss you again between the bars where I’m seeing you there with your hands in the air waiting to finally be caught drink up one more time and I’ll make you mine keep you apart deep in my heart separate from the rest where I like you the best and keep the things you forgot the people you’ve been before that you don’t want around anymore that push and shove and won’t bend to your will I’ll keep them still"
G04W97J,female,34,"What's Shakin'... I often fascinate over perception.  For as much as people would like to think they'd all have a most unanimous agreement, on some of the most conventional thoughts there is no such thing.  One weekend more for the Shakes conundrum to close.  That is, THIS particular conundrum. I must be a prickly pear in this woman's garden, this SK. At the last session and before it even began, my scene partner and I were out front of the theatre and as this woman was driving in to the parking lot she rolled down the window and began verbal attack.  She didn't wait for the car to stop to park, or to get out.  The car was still in drive and the window went down and out flew her arrows. ""DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PRACTICE BEFORE A PERFORMANCE ON THAT SAME DAY, HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU!"" and, specifically directed at my partner,  ""HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO PERFORM ON THE DAY OF A PERFORMANCE!"" That was just the beginning...  Not much later my partner leaned toward me and said, ""It seems that for some reason, whenever I am near you and SK is there, she says a lot of sharp, horrible things at you.""  AH! See dear reader, it wasn't just me.   So I explained to him that I think she had a hang-up regarding a certain age issue, in the least.  Before, her anger and attacks were irritating to me.  A bit discouraging even.   I am sadly disappointed to now find that since her anger toward me has not subsided, its almost flattering and I am almost disappointed in myself that I find it funny.   Her pain should NOT be my humor. How could I be so important to her, why would she want to waste THAT attention on me?  Negative or not, that has to be exhaustive for her.  A friend of mine mentioned a Chinese herb that should help her balance out her menopause, and it only takes a year to transform someone. I'll have to ask her what it's called again 'cause I don't recall.  All I know is if I lose control like that in my future years to come, I'm heading for the local Chinese herbalist.  My theatre news is not all sour, dear reader! Because I took a risk.  A little one, but I did it!!   As I had rehearsed one of my male monologues, I decided the character needed a heavy dark blanket over his shoulders.  I envisioned something of an army blanket, the old dark green wool ones, or maybe a dark gray one.  I remember that because when I was little and my family would go to the beach, that was one of the blankets we'd use to lie on .. I don't own an army blanket.  So to the seminar I brought my couch throw blanket - it's a soft flannel in red and brown/beige checkers.   Before I stood up to show my monologue work, I kept thinking in my head that I should explain what I was going to do in my performance to the instructor.  But I recall in my independent studies that you are supposed to just show your work and explain afterwards, not in advance. So once my turn came I went to off stage right.  I put my throw over my shoulders... I was fighting that feeling, that I needed to explain myself or I wouldn't be understood.  I kept telling myself what mattered was what I was doing, not its explanation.  It didn't help either that it felt all too reminiscent of an image as to what it would be like as a 5-year-old boy playing Superman, this blanket draped over my shoulders as a make shift cape, preparing to jump off the edge of the couch.  I did my monologue.  It went well.  The instructor gently put his hands together and brought them to his lips and said, ""May I ask, what's ... this?"" and then he indicated to his shoulders like why did I put that around my neck.  I said, ""Well in reading this monologue I feel that in his mourning he does have something heavy on his shoulders, and he needs a blanket, that's why I have a blanket over my shoulders.""   He did mention that my character is seen wearing a black cloak of mourning. BINGO that is good too.  Army blanket, black mourning cloak, either way I have to shop for this costume prop!  Oh! Oh! and another good thought.  One of the students from the beginning seminar stopped by for assistance and SK asked me to help her since this girl was rehearsing the soliloquy I had performed the summer before. I remembered it all! I only stumbled over remembering one word but I recalled the whole soliloquy! And helping this girl felt like an infinitesimal second!  I think I would enjoy that... to know this creative work so well that when I show other people, that it feels the same way! There was no sense of time.  Haven't had that feeling in awhile ..."

So Instead of working on the song I'd chosen for free choice, I went with this one.  On something of a whim too.  And when I was done I grabbed my bag to run off to put on my costume for theatre rehearsals and there was this couple making out next to the doorway.  I was wondering why they chose to stop there and had they heard the song? Seems romantic... I'd like to think so."
G04W97J,female,34,"So glad... I just realized but within the hour that I am turning into a workaholic machine lately.  I think I've become this because of my disillusionment with recent past romances... the last couple of attempts were just wrong for me and yet I want things to work so I find myself in an odd place.  So, to keep my mind elsewhere I work, work, work.  I read, I study... on an average day 15 or 16 hours.  Then a pal wrote me and said she'd been slacking... her friend ate her blue eyeliner and in a drunken blur she wrote MOMMY on his forehead in sharpie marker... and I realized  that's  what's missing.  Some good old fashioned debauchery with trusted company! I hope to lose myself soon if even for a little while.  That's how things usually are with my trusty boyfriend but the position is currently available, nothing suitable in sight.  Not to mention I am too burned out to make any decisions as well. Hmm.  I was listening to one of my Billy CHILDISH demo cds yesterday (not to be confused with the other Billy!) and it made me nostalgic for company... you know, people you can get happily stupid with, not stupid like burn the house down but dumb happy... yes that's it, the dumb happy folks...

I like her demeanor, she's very laid back but something about her is solid.  French people are like this. She's moving shop in a few months, she plans on getting her own salon.   I think that's cool.   I said what, are you going to name it after yourself?  She said NO! That is cheesy.   I said there's nothing cheesy about your name!  She said well everywhere you go every shop has someone's name on a corner,  I don't like it.  My shop will be called ""Cheveux du Soie"" meaning ""Hair of Silk"".   oooh laa laa!   No joking though... when I met her I bleached out my black hair to go deep brown and I fried it, and over the past year and a half she helped me do these intense conditioning treatments and she'd cut as much away as she could without making me shave my head or something drastic like that.  But when I hear 'silk' and 'french' together, I think of the Matrix Reloaded:   I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favorite.

G04W97J,female,34,"As I invest deeper into Ham1et to understand the Queen and her Willow speech, I have learned SO much... I feel almost overwhelmed at the thought of attempting to write it all down.  I can write some of it.  Supposedly dating way back into the times of the (ancient) Greeks, they determined if a woman is ""not satisfied"" that she suffers from what was then called ""wombsickness"", also known as hysteria?! An unsatisfied woman thoughout history has been found to be perceived as physiologically affected to the point of hysteria... or as a modern male might refer to it as, she's crazy. Well then, you're  lacking  .  Simple as that.   Crazy women = a sign of insufficient men. Sad.  I should reprint what I found but I don't have it with me at the moment. There was an article written in regards to this ""wombsickess"" as it relates to the behaviors of both Queen Gertrude and Ophelia.    I didn't agree with half of what I'd read in critial readings of the Willow speech.  Some information was interesting, some I thought lacked sufficient thought. I noticed independently in my own critical view of the speech some interesting points.  One thing being, why does she digress to mention that ""long purples"" are that which ""liberall shepheards give a grosser name, but our cold maids doe Dead Men's Fingers call them"".  Why bother this mention? Notice she isn't using a term that either a liberall shepheard would use NOR a cold maid.  I take that to read she is neither liberall nor cold...  she is neither guilty nor innocent...!   I would like to find that someone else has recognized this parallel. While Ophelia was floating she was chaunting snatches of old tunes - again the Queen  digresses to say Ophelia was ""as one incapable of her own distress, or like a creature Native and indued unto that element."" Is this the Queen's opinion of Ophelia's position? That Ophelia was incapable of her own distress, all the trauma she was overwhelmed with? and how is that much different than being a creature native and indue unto any element? If you are so a part of an element, how can you see differently? As in, the element around her was so chaotic, she too became chaos?  Hmm.     ENTER QUEEN One woe doth tred upon another heele, So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes.  LAERTES:  Drown'd! O where?  2.2.2351-2368  QUEEN: There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke, That shewes his hore leaves in the glassie streame: There with fantasticke Garlands did she come, Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples, That liberall Shepheards give a grosser name; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them: There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang; an envious sliver broke, when downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe, Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide, And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her up, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her owne distresse, Or like a creature Native, and indued Unto that Element: but long it could not be, Till that her garments, heavy with her drinke, Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious (buoy), To muddy death."
G04W97J,female,34,"I just looked up Miki Berenyi and found that we were born 3 years apart  to the exact day ... And she's under my skin! It's so weird...  I should say *spooky* hee hee...  Miki is amazing. When I was going through my closet the other day, I found some memorabilia. One of the things I found was a post card with her photo on it.  It had been folded and run over by a car - It had that ground-in asphalt damage to it. I scanned it and posted it up elsewhere.  Memories. A friend back then, what '94? ten years ago, took me to an ""eat and greet"" with her band, LUSH. She's pretty cool.  What's scary is I felt like I could relate to her energy I was listening to  Split  a couple days ago when I found the post card.  We're from different countries (London to LA), we've had different lives but I feel like she can feel me it's weird! Then to see we're born on the same day is just WEIRD.   LIGHT FROM A DEAD STAR   He lives his life in a world full of women  And he takes what he wants from their love  And he throws the rest away  I cling to him and pray  But still he slips away  And now it's just too late  To wish him back again  She won't put up with this life so she leaves him  And she finds someone else, falls in love  And she travels far away  I say that it's ok  And swallow all my pain  And now it's just too late  To wish her back again   They left me here on my own in a nightmare  And I just can't forgive any more  So I smile and turn away  Don't listen when they say  They wish that I could stay  And now it's just too late  To wish me back again   (Author: M. Berenyi)   *     *     *     *  The ""eat and greet"" was at Prince's LUNA PARK.  I'm fairly sure it belong(ed)s to Prince.  We were outside on this patio area and she saw my shoes and whispered to a friend of hers that she liked my shoes.  I'd bought them the summer before in London, ironically.  Made by a Brit designer... at Shelley's... Oh Katherine Hamnett. They look like Barbie's shoes, the doll.  That classic 50's pin up thing, but exactly like Barbie's shoes in black leather. I remember seeing what appeared to be track marks on her arm.  She just had this thing about her... I've been wanting to write about her all week ever since I found the post card and started pouring over the CDs...   I mean, she had GUTS, serious guts.  Not so much because of how scarce women musician still were back then and for how she'd step out and be different in her style but for other reasons too.  Her lyrics for her are deep dark and painful stuff and I'd read them and hear them and think how could she  show  this to people? She's got this song about being molested when she was 8 and it's like, kind of like weirdly shameful but then it's like she's giving her parents a slap in the face at the same time, what's stronger?  By the way she stands up there on stage and performs you can see in her face she just didn't give a f'ck what people might think.   They weren't exactly the tightest band to play live either BUT what is also so awesome about this is her having the guts to bare the criticism and pressure of f'cking up repeatedly in front of an audience and still moving forward.  That left a note in me, I recall when I see her CD's and whatever that she pushes forward no matter what's really going on, it helped and helps give me encouragement where otherwise there'd be none but my own I suppose.  I remember that particular night she was wearing a tank dress and she didn't shave her armpits (she's British who cares) and some guy said ""show us your pits"" and she thought he said ... you know... and he said it a few times. She finally said if you say that one more time I'm out of here!  mmmm.  I have pictures of that night when they played, I was just looking them over the other day...

Is it fit?"" I think at *thus* she puts it on him, and then asks if the ring fit ok.

AXNX7FB,male,44,"My sponser, and I got the grill. It is pretty decent, it will serve the purpose anyway.   Greg set out to paint the kitchen last night, never got it finished. We haven't seen him all day. Any idea where he is? Mark, and I want to put the kitchen back together, yet do not want to cause a commotion.  Looking for feed back.  P.s. There were comments about not sure if he/ Mark had a sponser. I just wanted to let every one know that he is looking. He does not want to pick up just anyone."
AXNX7FB,male,44,I just wanted to say that im glad to have been invited to the blog. And when I feel the need to share or just to comment on and issue that has arose in the recovery houses(I will).I also would like to express my gratitude for being welcomed into the womans recovery house.
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Chase,  Greg informed me that a friend from work gave him a puppy. I guess that it is a full blood Rot. It is supposed to be a cute little thing. He says that he plans to keep it in his room. He thought that you should know. I asked him if he asked you, he said that he didn't think that he had to. I am not cleaning up no dog poop, and I better not step in it! That dog would look awful funny with my foot hanging out of his ass.  I also talked to bonnie, and told her what you had posted. I didn't have a copy to give her. She said that she gave a completed application to Jim. She wants to get a hold of you because she wants in now, or as soon as possable. She said that she is more than willing to clean the place up, just supply the supplies. She is staying at the Salvation Army, and is going crazy. You should expect her call.   I have not been able to get a hold of Sherese yet, but I am still trying."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Friday night has been the regular bowling night for Beewolf for quite some time.   We bowl at around 9 p.m. at Town and Country Bowl.  Lets try to get a contingency together and have the recovery house well represented.  I have guests that may be here from Mexico this weekend, but I may still attempt to be there.  Call me if you need a ride there.  253-4092   If none of the Beewolfers show up - we'll still have a good time.  The first time I went bowling with these guys, I had a blast.  I used to be in leagues and get pasted beyond recognition.  Here I was having a better time sober than I ever did wasted.  I think the first time Matt gets up there.....we turn him the wrong way and see how many other bowlers he can knock over.  Now that's bowling!!!!!!  Just kidding Matt.  Let the good times roll.......................   Hey, by the way.......the entertainment committee dropped the ball on the cookout.     I am ready to do this thing - lets elect a couple of co-chairpeople.  I decline on grounds it was my idea, but I will be ready to help.  Chase - anyone you think needs a special project on their plate?   This may be a good thing for a couple of guys to focus on.  I am sure whoever volunteers will do a great job.  Lets remember to invite Bonnie and the other residents of the women's recovery house."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"A.Irrational: If a job is worth doing it must be done right.   B. Rational: If a job is worth doing its worth doing the best I can at that time.     This irrational belief has been my philosophy for many years and has placed a lot of pressure on me as a human being I thought that I had to do a job well to be accepted and to live up to my self imposed standards. When I didn’t meet these self imposed standards I became very angry with my self. I felt stupid and frustrated when things didn't go as I expected they would. I even propagated this irrational belief to my students as a workable job ethic. I couldn’t tolerate mistakes or criticism constructive or not  Several times in my working carrier I quit a job because of my frustration with myself for not performing up to my expectations.  I couldn’t except my  mistakes and made excuses which further complicating my life. I felt I should be thoroughly competent, intelligent, and achieving in all possible respects. When I had trouble performing I retaliated with anger at my self and others and this defeated my confidence in my self and deflated my self esteem     Today I  must work on doing the best I can at the time. I think I always tried to do things perfect, but I put unnecessary pressure on my self-doing so. I can't do it right all the time due to factors, which may be out of my control.  I can't control the behavior or actions of others nor do I have the right too. I can't fix everything all the time and I must develop a belief that is more rational. With this more rational belief I can make mistakes and accept failure.  I have to realize that I am a fallible human being going through life trying to get better  I must not place undo pressure on my self to perform with perfection. I should try and do the best I can on the job and accept myself as a quite imperfect creature, who has general human limitations and specific fallibilities. Developing this more rational belief will make it possible to pursue other skills that were not available to me because of my irrational belief that anything I do must be done well.     ."
AXNX7FB,male,44,".. I've got more facts, more resources, more perspective, more recovery, and more self-discipline......and I am taking my ball and going home.  I have never heard anyone with quality recovery say anything like this. Show me in the Big Book or any other piece of recovery literature where it says that how much I have and how much I do for others by saying so is the means by which you should measure my recovery.  I am grateful and I realize the level of effort you put into helping others. All  am saying is Live and Let Live. Maybe you have seen that little slogan hanging around at Beewolf. Don't take yourself so seriously, it's ok. We love you for the person you are, and I mean that sincerely."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Thank you Matt for your constructive criticism.  There has been alot of things happening and I truly have mixed emotions and thoughts about this person and they are affecting my emotions and recovery.  As far as people, places, and things, there is one thing I have to keep up front is that I am powerless, but sometimes I want to be in power and want the best for this addict and all addicts.  Although things have been calm and peaceful when I first came in, I still have my character defects and am actively working on them.  As far as me and Jim's altercation I think there is a deeper issue with Jim besides this person being in or at the house and he would be open minded and willing to face his fears regarding this type of addict he could stop running from his own sick thoughts and ask God to help him remove these character defects. And maybe some of this turmoil could have been avoided.  If a person is truly working a 12 step program with the help of his higher power then this person can accept and deal with on a spiritual basis someone in active addiction."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"This is interesting, because I was informed that this person had a problem with money, but that can mean a lot of things.  My understanding was that the substance addiction had more to do with Alcohol than crack.  Clearly we are dealing with a severe crack addiction.  The policy is quite simple.  This is a Recovery House, not a Relapse House. Recovery House is not Beewolf where you can return to meetings still half drunk, and an hour after you have run out of money for crack.  A program participant who relapses must leave immediately.  If they wish to reapply for the Recovery House Program, they must go to the Peoria Rescue Mission for one week, let us know where they are at during the day, and check in daily with a Board member for a week, prior to being readmitted.   This was the long-standing policy from last year, and we saw it work.  If the person goes to the Rescue Mission, a board member can go down there after hours, to see the person.  Abviously when someone relapses it is a hard thing on those living in the House.  But what we found, is that it is a good thing for the addict to put on the shoes of the people  who were in their lives when the addict was still being irresponsible and relapsing.  Now the addict can feel what it is like to be worried about the relapser showing up.  The addict can worry about HIS stuff being stolen and sold for crack.  The addict can worry about the relapser getting violent.  The thing that I like about relapses is that what I may have been trying to get through to a person, and what they would not shut up and listen to, or accept, before they relapsed, after they relapse, they tend to have less to argue with what I had to say about their attitudes and their program.  We can run an easy program and try and keep people from relapsing, but often when we have pointed out something that someone needs to work on and they refuse to acknowledge that, it makes no sense for us to act as a crutch for that area of their life.  It is better to be hard on their foolishness and refuse to support that liability in their program, because the sooner that liability causes them to relapse, the sooner they can face the reality of it and accept the need and the actions required to change it.  I would also like to point out that this person, was the person who was most vocal about privacy and confidentiality.  Time and time again it has been proven to me that those who are focused on that, are focused on it because they have something to hide, and are concerned that when they do something embarrassingly inappropriate, their deeds will be made known to people.  Honest recovery requires TRANSPARENCY in all aspects of our lives.  Time and time again, I have seen the addict in early recovery exhibit a hypervigilance in regards to honesty.  Interestingly thought, the examples of those people that I can think of, were in a Recovery Mode and my impression is that they did not relapse.  For the record, I have been through precisely what you are experiencing, having someone living with you who has relapsed.  At least the relapser did not take YOUR vehicle 40 miles away to buy heroin, right after they had talked a lot of crap about you.  for the record, though, that person has been clean for a year now.  Another observation, would you say that compared to how I was on Matt, that I was easy on this person or hard on them?   I would suspect that you would say that I was easy.  Contrary to what many might think, the harder that I am (read bigger asshole that I am) to someone, the more likely they are going to deal with the problematic behavior.  It is easy for me to be nice.  It takes a lot more energy to defend your actions after you have been tough on someone, which is one reason that I do not like to go there.     But obviously with this person, tough is the only way out.  A final note, if you are in a meeting, or hear of people complaining about Recovery House, you should challenge that with the following fact: people who lived with or worked with Chase, who complained about Chase to other people, in and out of meetings - were on their way to relapsing, if someone did not challenge that person's attitude and that person did not accept that challenge and change their attitude.  Obviously this required people in meetings being tough on them and the person taking the right step from there.    Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,".............. Recovery is not having everything organized and  having your life so strait jacketed that you cannot put aside what you are  doing and reprioritize your schedule so that whatever task does the most people  the greatest good is the one that you drop everything to do. Recovery is about  being able to react to those daily surprises and adapt your resorces to help  the most, regardless of all the addicts around you who scream WHAT ABOUT ME!  WHAT ABOUT ME! YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO WARM MY MILK!!! LET THAT GUY STAND  OUT IN THE COLD FOR ANOTHER HOUR. YOU SAID YOU WOULD WARM MY MILK. I WANT WARM  MILK NOW!!!!-----excerpt from TGIF.      This was what happened when other jobs had to be taken on to make ends  meet, since the paymaster was calling the shots. And, this was exactly  your reaction, the warm milk, that is. Funny how we can't see when we  are describing our own behaviors while looking at others. They say that  the behaviors we are most intolerant of are the ones we, ourselves own.  Interesting........."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"When it is mentioned that someone is still clinging to their own will, it reminds me of how I made zero progress; in fact, I made regress, until I finally decided that I didn't know anything, especially what was best for me.   It was only after surrendering as best I could, that I could even begin to see what was really important to me and how unbelievably better my life could be. It started for me by not having the burden of past recovery failures to extract ""knowledge"" from and explain how ""I have been clean before, I know what to do already"" at every turn. It's funny how good things happen and people are not all ""against me"" when I listen and take suggestions.   I was talking to another addict today, who was excited about a new job that pays $10.00 per hour. Enough to ""pay all my bills, save money and get a computer and....."" I said that was great, but $10.00 doesn't go as far as you might think, and, more importantly, if you don't work on yourself, you might as well make $1.00 an hour, for all the good it will do you. He seemed to think I was downing his job, or maybe he was pushing the whole ""working on me"" thing away.   It takes me to all the jobs, relationships, and material stuff I needed to be ""ok"". That never worked. What did work was realizing and becoming willing to look at ME, and my need for change. Today, I don't make a lot of money, have a hot girlfriend, or a place of my own. But what I have in the fellowship I belong to and the love and support of my higher power, is far more than I could have planned myself. I have learned some valuable lessons in recovery, one of the most important being ""giving it away to keep it""; I give what I have to keep my life."

AXNX7FB,male,44,"Scott:   I've been watching this stuff for 13 years, and sorry, but if I had to bet on a horse here, Jimmys perspective is right at the finish line, while your pony is being left in the dust.   You keep responding to Jimmy, and some internal issue or trigger that he may have in regards to the situation that you brought into the house.  But while Jimmy may have an emotional reaction to this situation that surpases my reaction.  As to his analysis, and Matts, and Marks, I think they are leaving you in the dust.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE THAT IS LYING TO YOU.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE THAT IS USING. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE THAT IS SELFISHLY INTERFERING WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE AND PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU HAD NO WHERE TO GO.  The question is:  why would you repay the people who only two weeks before, helped you when no-one else would, by bringing an actively using woman into their home. You are essetially telling them that they have no right to have a place to go that is free of people that are using drugs, and that you have a right to use the house to help people in any way that you judge to be appropriate under the circumstances.  It would be easy for them to say that you are disrespecting them......specifically disrespecting their needs and their right and the treatment that they have EARNED having been their in the house and having not violated the rules in the way that you have.   It is particullary insulting to them that your having allowed someone to violate the rules, you are now adding insult to injury by suggesting that they look at their program.  Admit you are wrong.  Stop trying to get in the last word as to how someone else was also at least a bit wrong, and don't allow any women or men who are still using or drinking to set foot inside the house.  And that may also have to include your ex wife.  I have now met five women in this house as a result of you, which is more than all of the other men combined.  NONE. NONE. NONE.  Were working any kind of a program and all are playing some sort of a game.  You are still attracted to these sort of women.  It is not because you are now St. Francis and want to help them.  It is because you are still looking at things in old ways.   My guess is that you were ""trying to help""  these same sort of women, even while you were getting high.  Jimmy:  exceptional comments about the Big Book, rather than the Hotel room.  Scott:  God brought Jimmy into your life, because no-one in the house has a more parallel experience to yours with these kind of women, than Jimmy.   Jimmy has done exactly what you are trying to do and he is right about the results that can be expected and what is the right way to handle it.  You can continue to argue with him.  But my suggestion would be for you to learn from him.  That is just one reason that you ended up here.  Chase     choatic woman into a home, where the people there"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"The less you say, the more room you give for others to defend you. I'm not going to leave Matt's defense of me, on the table as his opinion and allow the rest of you to respond directly too it, without my comment.....for a while.  I am hoping that you will do likewise in the house meetings when someone criticizes you.  Also:  I can certainly understand mark's predicament with lunch, as that was the problem that my wife had with dinner.  The solution is probably going to be found in MARKING FOOD, but particularly in our gewtting involved in the SHARE FOOD program, so that people who have not, are covered.     Small point - I'm sure the person who has been eating Mark's food, has not done so because they are intending to express the CONTEMPT or DISRESPECT for Mark, but rather that they are simply hungry and without, and are relying on their old way of just taking what they want or need, rather than commmunicating that need to others and accepting what others will help them with and what the other's expectations will be for that help.  I think that specifically what we are going to have to do as a board, is organize our participation in the SHARE FOOD and the have the expectation that everyone will participat.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"You all have been very honest with Scott about your thoughts and past experiences with this sort of situation.  But honesty without love is brutality, so I would suggest that you all having been so honest, now step up to the plate and each get with him and find out from him, what you can do to help him make it through the rest of the week and past any looming payday.  I would like to see you all getting together Wednesday and Thursday and planning to do something together on Friday night like bowling, or a movie so as to give those who are struggling a boost through payday and the weekend.

AXNX7FB,male,44,"bloggers  NOT  blockers  Blog is for web log.  Actually, Matt, how can you be sure that Board Member Putz wasn't there?  He may have been there, sitting quietly, putzing himself in the corner.  Hmmmmmmm?  Chase"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Yes, I am hurt about what was said, but it goes much further than that.  I was not joking when I said that I like Jim. I seriously do. I think that he is a valuable asset to the recovery house, and I appreciate his wisdom. I am more concerned aabout his safety , than his room being clean.   Even Jim F., a prosperous man employed by I.D.O.C. for 16 years, a successful father, husband, and member of A.A. enjoyijng 14 years of sobriety. Obviously a rational thinker. Even he said that if what was said to him what was said to me by Jim G. out on our front porch, would have led to a fight, no a beat down. I am refering to the accusation of sucking dick for rock.  What Jim needs to realize is that life is a two way street. If you respect, you get respected. If you disrespect, then you get disrespected, and so on. New members in this house are not going to respect what he says, but what he does. Respect, the basis of which all positive relationships are built.   he also needs to realize that because he is 64, house manager, educated, none of that is going to save him when he makes remarks like he did to me, to someone who just doesn't care.   It seems like Jims clenliness issues are a big deal, but living by example is the bigger issue for a person living here with his title. I want Jim to own up for what he said, and did to me. Then I want him to work on his own issues which led up to these actions. I feel like if I just let this go, I am enableing these situations arise once again, if not with me, then with someone else. That someone else may not deal with all of this as well as I have. They just might hurt Jim.   I admit that wanting Jim to own his shit that he pulled on me is personal, but wanting to address these issues, and then work on thim is purelyy for the good of Jim, and the residents currently residing, and the ones yet to come to the recovery house."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Thank you, Jim for your input. I, too , wrestle with many irrational  ideas, causing me to consistently feel like a failure. When I don't  meet these unrealistic expectations, I have a lifetime of  self-preservation maneuvers to draw from.       My program teaches me that today, I must look at my role, honestly, and  try to evaluate as best I can, with the help of others, the solution.  The solution for me today is to look at me, what I can do differently,  admit when I am wrong or unrealistic, operating in character defects.       Thankfully, I can acknowledge this much fater, what's it been,  3  days?, rather than having to use these self defeating actions as a  foundation because I am too full of false pride to admit my error.       I would like to sincerely apologize for dragging what started as a one  on one battle of wills to this forum. It was very unnecessary to behave  as adolescents on what is supposed to be a positive format.       I am learning, as I go, that I need to constantly focus on not only me,  but the solution instead of the problem. I hope noone was drawn into  this as seeing it as what recovery is about, because it truly is not.  Defending our positions may have worked well in court for us, but, in  life in recovery, not so effective."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Anyone who is serious about recovery is compasionate.   Anyone who has ever relapsed can be understanding. It is a good thing that Jim and Mark are compassionate and understanding.  But there is a thing that is higher than compassion and understanding, and that is responsibility and holding people accountable.    In order for someone to stay clean and sober, they must absolutely learn comapssion and understanding. That is they must learn to be compassionate and understanding of how others will feel when they relapse.  Obviously this person is still focused on how ""...he feels..."" and it was never more appropriate for me to say last Thursday that I don't give a damn how they feel and that what I care about is how they think and what they do.  Life is not going to improve for us if we think and behave according ot how we feel.  If we learn to think correctly and do right life will improve.  It is on one level compassionate to allow the relapser to stay. BUt that is a low enough level of compassion to possibly co-mingle itself with enabling. A higher level of compassion is to allow the person to experience the consequences of thinking and acting according to their feelings, feelings which we know to be irrational. The consequences of going to the Peoria Rescue Mission are as most of you could descibe: 1.  Rather than having your own room, you get to share a room with 80 other homeless men in all states of insanity and dysfunction; 2.  Rather than getting to go to a meeting, you are required to go to chapel; 3.  You will not select your menu - you will eat what is set before you; 4.  I doubt that there is a 30 inch television with Dish Network and a DVD player. 5.  There is a 5:00 am wakeup call.  Also, it is not appropriate for one guy in the house to be directly financially providing or loaning to another.  This changes the dynamic of the relationships.  How can the borrower hold the lender or giver accountable, without risking the loss of the favor?    It is good to be in a possition to help people, but that is precisely when we must be more responsible and think longer and harder about the sort of help that we give them.    The Rules of Recovery House are in black and white on the application.  Relapsers must remove themselves.  If we were to fail to remove this person, we will undermine our ability to hold anyone in the program accountable for not only this rule, but for any rule.  This is not a decision for the Board - the Board made this decision a long time ago.  Now it is just a matter of sticking to the agreement that we make to each and every participant, the community and ourselves.  The person must go.    You are welcome to be compassionate and undertanding of the relapser, and may see him, and spend time with him throughout the week.  But the relapser is not allowed in the house.  If the relapser checks in throughout the week, or is available for a board member to do a face to face each day,  the relapser may re-apply on Friday.  If at that time they wish to return and are ready to be responsible, they may be readmitted.  I would suggested that you get Rob's first hand observation of two guys that relapsed at the first recovery house.  They both were taken to detox and from there were deposited at the Rescue Mission.  One continued to drink while at the mission, while the other went back to work and was restored to the house after a week.  There was never any problem with him.  Keep in mind that the person who returns from the Rescue Mission experience will not be the same person that relapsed.  They will be a new and improved edition.  And they will absolutely enforce the relapse rule on others, because they will from first hand experience know that the application of fair and just consequences is in fact the height of compassion, understanding and responsibility.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Appropriately we call this place ""The Recovery House""  Every treatment center, halfway house, and any other counseling center that deals with recovery.....stress the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment.  What is safe and secure?   The lack of fear  of physical or mental intimidation for a start.  This is absolutely the biggest issue and the issue that needs to be resolved without question.  Yet it seems to me we all want to concentrate on the female and her selling her wares.  This problem will take care of itself.  K-9  Katy is already aware of the problem and will likely keep a closer eye on what happens around the house.  This young lady will likely get to spend a little time reflecting and maybe she will pick up and read a copy of the big book in the pokey.     Back to the intimidation - this makes me angry and I don't like feeling this way.  The message we are sending is that this is an  OK  behavior.  WRONG!!  I don't feel that anyone needs to tolerate it. So, I ask, where do we go from here?  Good question.  The ball is in your court Scott.  Unacceptable behavior has occured.  According to the steps, we promptly admit it and clean our side of the fence.  I have seen neither.   It's time to put up - not shut up."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"In reading Scott's post, I would like perspective on whether Scott is:  1.  Legitimately 12 Stepping;  or  2.  13 Stepping with a Biblical Twist.  Rather than make up my mind right now, I think it would be much more interesting and entertaining, to hear from you and Scott again.  And for reference, the Bible actually judges conduct and calls upon it readers to judge their own conduct and the conduct of others according to the same standards as the Bible.    I mean Scott, if we are not to judge anyone or anything, then it is kind of stupid for us as a Recovery House to have any rules...........if we can't then judge someone as having violated them, or as being appropriate or inappropriate for the Recovery House program.  The only people who use ""judgment"" the way you have, are at that place, where they are ironically conflicted between saying, ""...you don't have a right to judge...""  and ""...I don't care what you think anyway...""  What is obvious to everyone is that we ABSOLUTELY have a right to judge what is right and wrong and judge how it affects us, and what we are willing to put up with or not put up with.   It is also obvious that you are deeply conflicted, in that you know that people are exercising their God given RESPONSIBILITY to judge appropriately and that you and the people that you are still associating with.....are not measuring up........  You obviously do care very much what people think about you, so much in fact that you take a physically aggressive posture and body language when YOU JUDGE someones expressions as something that you do not want to hear.  We all have an emotional and a rational side.  The emotional side desires to be right even when we are wrong and is threatened by others' contrary emotions, but is even more threatened by others contrary logic - rational.     Clearly from the last few days, it is not possible for Scott to be rational in regards to someone with whom he has had an emotional connection.   Any AA sponsor is going to tell you that someone with whom you are on such an emotional level with - at this point in your recovery, you need to stay as far away from them as posibily, until you can deal with them 100% rationally and cannot be manipulated into enabling them and being unfair to the people that live around you.  Yes, Matt has in the past received the ""Butthead of the Week"" award.    I really cannot see how you [Scott] are going to avoid nomination for that award, this coming Friday.   The one thing that I have noticed about Recovery House, is that when one participant is putting forth such effort to achieve this award, the others in the house, seem more than happy to let the guy have it and in fact seem to treat the rest of each other exceptionally well.  So in that sense Scott, I and the others owe you a debt of our gratitude.  Chase"

He has a frend that has two webbers that are just sitting. He believes that we could get one for free. There's one for the house. He is planning on picking it up either tomorrow, or Sunday. ""Go MATT""."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Thanks for the support Doug. As for Mark, I second that motion. I am not sure what Miss Bonnie has planned for Labor day, but maybe we could plan the cook out for that week end? Sounds like a kick ass plan to me.  As for security? Are you serious. It's a shame that someone is to lazy to lock the door when they leav. I wonder who did that?"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I find that when people don't have a leg to stand on in regards to facts or logic,  they generally play it one of the two following ways:  1.  They try and change the subject to a different issue, as in this case, where they still have to address the issue as to how Vulgar Rap music is consistent with the recovery atmosphere.  I'm still waiting:  HOW IS RAP MUSIC CONSISTENT WITH THE IMAGE THE RECOVERY HOUSE IMAGE?  2.  They just call you an asshole, even when if they bothered to ask any of the people who they live with, they would find that there is pretty much a consensus that THEY are the most inconsiderate person in the house.  3.  Specific to the Recovery community, they like to make out that they have never seen anyone with that degree of recovery take sucha position or behave such a way.    What is clear, is that one person here has a higher sense of responsibility, while the other two have a higher sense of entitlement to do whatever they feel like doing regardless of how that activity might affect others.   And you still don't want to discuss your choices negative affects on specific individuals and the house as a whole.  Grow up kids!  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"The difficulty with addicts is that there are multiple issues wrapped up in the addiction and post active addiction behavior.   Just because someone is having all of the issues, does not mean that they are going to use, it is just evidence of all the areas in their life that are unresolved.    Here is a list for Matt of factors that I have observed that are by no means unique to him:    1. Age:  in the early 20's we were all doing things that people in their 30's, 40's and 50's knew to be goofy;    2:  Blindness:  that is just a whole nother stresser and factor that is going to have a person reacting and behaving differently than we.........because their situation is different;    3.  Recovery:  I just really doubt that the prison recovery experience is as good as it could be.  Prison is not there to accomodate good recovery choices.  It is just consequences, that may sort of in a way FORCE recovery on people.  Matt has really only been out there in Recovery circles on a daily basis for a couple of months.  Allow him the time to do 90 and 90 and then evaluate;    4.  Prison:  I have had people come to stay with me, out of prison (AND THE MILITARY!) for a number of years.  I know my family was freaked by me when I got out of the Marine Corps.  There is just a restlessness and unease that a person carries once freed from the restrictiveness of an institution.  The human psyche can cope so well to the un-naturalness of such institutions, but then it takes the brain a while to re-wire itself and adjust to normalcy.  There is also the problem that within the insitution, military or prison, we spend so much time thinking about what it was like when we were back on the street and what it will be like again when we get out, and then we get out, and our expectations of how it will feel do not line up with reality.  So there is a post institutionalization depression.    5.  Marriage:  anyone ever been married at a young age?  Married to another addict?  Having one child and expecting another?  Spouse not actually living with you?  A real tough gig to say the least and in this case, expecially precarious.      If I thought about it, I could probably think of more particularities.      Challenge him on his behavior.  He will continue to go to meetings and deal with things, and I think that the one thing that we can say in regards to Matt and everyone committed to the program is that over the long run, we will see improvement.    Don't forget that those of you who have to put up with someone in the rough times.........your reward is the friendship, mutual respect and trust of some0ne upon whom you can rely on when times are tough for you.    I believe that Matt has the capacity to be that for you and others in the long run and that despite what he may do to pain us in the present, let's remember the ""promises"" that are received by those who stay in recovery.

AXNX7FB,male,44,"Tonight my wife called me, and we started talking about how we missed each other. With that came her telling me about my son going from room to room calling for his daddy. When I heard this it brought me to tears immediately. Then my wife started crying. my first reaction was to leave the area, and with that I brought the phone to my room while my wife and I talked. A few moments later I heard a knock on the door. I answered, and Jim informed me that there were to be no phones in the room. I admit that I got a little heated because of the reason that I was in there, but I knew that he had no idea what was going on so I complied with his request, and came out to the stairs. So what's the problem?     Here's my issue with the phone: First and fore most, when there is a situation with the phone where emotions are running wild because there is a situation with a spouse, or family member, I think that we should have a little privacy. I understand that there is to be no ananimity through out this house, but at the same time, I think that family issues outside of this house should be shared at the discretion of the resident.     How was I able to bring the phone in my room? I boughtht with my own money, a cord to make the phone a little bit more easier to get to because of my visual impairment. The reason is because when the phone rings, I sometimes have difficulty getting to it before the voice mail picks up. Yes, the caller may leave a message, but on several occasions, i have had people tell me that they have left me a message, and asked why I have not returned the call. Obviously, it was because I did not recieve the message. To attempt to keep this from happening, I have told jim that I sometimes had a hard time getting to the phone before the voice mail picked it up. He advised me that he would adjust the amount of rings, but that was a couple of weeks ago, and nothing has been done. Naturally I didn't want to accuse Jim of not giving me the messages so I kept that to my self. Then here lately, I have been told that i was left messages by a couple of different people including my wife, and I have not been told about them. I reckonise that the proper thing to do about this situation is to bring it up at the house meeting, which I did today. Jim said something along the lines of Chase was putting a phone in and Jim was dropping his personal line. I also brought up the issue of the answering machine made available to all of the residents, and again that was pushed off on Chase's ordeal with the new line. So I got an answer on this issue, but I feel like we all got spun.     My main issue, and the sole reason for writing this up is because when Jim returned from where ever, I informed him of the reason for me conversating with my wife in the privacy of my room. He replied "" there are to be no phones in the room and you know that"". After expressing the need for privacy, and adding a few more personal details he showed no comprimise and I honestly admit that I was getting more angry at his lack of understanding. I told him that me using the phone for the reason that I did tonight in my room I had no problem with someone using the privacy  of there room so to keep themselves from showing that level of humility especially when there were guest that were not residing in this house, which there were 2 at that moment in time. I said that I would not honor that rule in that much of an emotional situation. He responded by saying that he would disconnect the phone, and I could take that up with the other residents.  I took this like this was a threat of punishment like I was a teenager again. He followed up by saying that phones were not allowed in the room, and I asked if that was true, why does he. His reply was that he was the  board member. and that was the way that it was. ""Life sucks"". He also remarked about me buying the extra long cord, and not taking it up with him before I bought it. I am sorry, but I didn't know that I was to inform him and ask his permission to buy something for the house that everyone uses and is quite thankful that I bought that item. Again I got more angry about him then walking off and mouthing ""acceptance, acceptance"". By him doing, and mocking this little childish phrase, I admit that he pulled my chain. Thank God for this program, and what it has taught me because at that moment with my emotions running like they were, it was extremely difficult to control my temper. 2 months ago, I would have been in jail right now. Now would have reacting in that mannor be rational, no. I am truly grateful for the change in my life that I owe to A.A. 2 nonths ago, rational, or irrational behavior would have never crossed my mind.      I hope that was not taken as a threat, that was not how I intended to put it out there. The problem is not so much the phone, but Jims obvious power struggle. I feel like Jim is taking it upon himself to be the daddy of the house, or at least with me.The way he put it was because he says. If he discussed this situation with the board on how he handle this situation with the board, and this was what was suggested, I find myself wondering what kind of farce is this becoming? There is nothing in the rules thatt I have that says anything about the phone. I think that in some circumstances a little bit of compassion is not to much to askk. I have never attempted to bring the phone to my room for any other reason. At no time have I refused anyone the phone while I was using it. When they commented that they needed it, I got off of it promptly. There is not an issue of respect because we all have been respectful when it comes to the phone. Well almost all of us, Jim seems to have some issue that he may need to take up with his sponser.    Asn for the rule with no phones in the room, Jim installed one in my room when I first got here. When I changed rooms, then the phone became an issue along with the DSL. I understand the new found rule and support it all the way so that no one is hogging the phone, but at the same time some compremise should be made in situations like this. The greater issue at hand is Jims approach to this issue. From my understanding, Jims duty here is to observe.. Not to act the way that he did. His action could set someone up to react in an unhealthy manor, not only bring chaos to that persons life, but to everyone in the house.   I am asking that the board review this issue and together make some what of a comprimising decision. I am also asking DougK. to discuss rational, and irrational reactions with his sponsee."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Maybe your stuff got stolen because you were a putz. Is that rational or irrational? Maybe we could do less with the RET 101, and look at individuals with our senses and feelings. Have you ever seen socks and underwear at a garage sale that wasnt in a trailer park? No, because the general population doesnt dig used undergarments. Maybe the person who stole yours was rational, with a sense of humor."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Jim, I never said that you were a bad guy. I did, and still do appreciate you with helping my family, and I  out. If you think that I don't, you're wrong. I like you, I really do, but I will not sugar coat, or enable your behavior.   I am very angry that you went to that meeting yesterday, and yelled out your suspicions to every one. I am much more angry that you said that I stayed gone for 48 hours to cast your suspicions of me getting high on every one else. No one told me that stuf to break your ananimaty, but to find out what is going on with me. When I was asked what was happening, I told them. Not to make you look bad, but to assure them that I was not using. Then they went from pointing a finger at me, to pointing them back at you. Something too remember, When anyone is pointing a finger at anyone, at least three are pointing back at them...  You do not have to apoligize to me to begin making things right, you might want to consider making an apology to the group for lying. I am not going to sit back and let these people think that I relapsed to protect you from what most of these people now feel about you. You must know that you in the position that you are in with being the recovery house's house manager, and doing that, not only made you look bad, but the house as well.This whole conflict is now the talk of B' Wolff.   I was wrong for staying out late like that, and not being totally informative like I should have. You were the only one that made a mess out of it. So to correct that problem, I am not going to stay out like that anymore.   As for the phone cord. I am not the only one who appreciates that item. We all do. Well those of us who don't have a cordless phone in their room. I did not buy that for just me.   As for the respect issue with the phone, whenever someone calls for someone, I get off it. Thank God for call waiting. When anyone needs to use it, I say my good byes, and get off promptly. As for the conflict between us residents, we have that settled, and we did that without accusing each other of nonsence, or broad casting those issues at a meeting.   Speaking of broad casting at a meeting. People are coming up to me and telling me that they are tired of hearing about this place within a meeting. I agree with these people, The issues of this house should not be brought to the meeting, but to a sponser.   Asn for the immaturity, You getting mad and taking your radio back was immature. What you were saying on the porch, was immature. There were two other people that heard these words of yours, and only God knows who else. One of them lives here, the other just visits. Not even a resident.   I am sorry Jim, but I am not going to kiss your ass. It doesn't matter what you did before your addiction, like wise with mine. The point is that we are both addicts, and have to live under the same roof. Either we are, or we aren't. If we are, we have to respect each other. You have to give it to get it. I am not talking about staying out all night, but by living by example.   Further, you are the house manager/ observer. Every one knows that you report to Chase. Every one is fine with that. What we do not agree with is you preaching recovery, but not living it. Change is an important part of recovery. That means every thing. From the smallest, to the largest issues. If you never made your bed with in your addiction, you need to make it every day. Start small. We didn't become addicted in one day, so remember, easy does it. (Taken from the N.A. How it works). I am not trying to bash you Jim, but you have a few issues that you need to work on before you try to point out other peoples  shit. All that rational, or irrational bullshit is not going to make your bed, clean your room, cook you food, or clean up after you.   You are 64, and you have 40 years on me. I know that, but at the same time, I know about some shit. I have been through a lot to Jim. I am not claiming to have all of the answers. I have a lot of shit that is kicking my ass, but I am working on them. I am able to do that because I am accepting the thoughts, and suggestions of others. I do not want to fight with you. I won't.   Awaiting a response...."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"It's interesting that I have been there, Matt, while you were present, with you not having a clue. So much for your sixth sense. Seems like your Spidey sense would have alerted you to someone grabbing your unmentionables.  I remember when I was in early recovery, and thoght those who didn't see things the way I did were idiots. I was merely stating my opinion on several issues, not personally attacking anyone. If anyone was offended, maybe they should take it up with the resident RET guru. I actually believe Jim to be quite competent as resident rat.   I also remember being in a recovery house, always cosigning my roomates' stuff, as it was a family type atmosphere. It's nice to see you guys sticking together. You may not agree wth me, nor I you, but the beauty of this program allows me the freedom to be ok enough with myself to express my thoughts and opinions. Keep coming back, it gets different.   I would like to apologize for not being present more at the house, could someone please let me know when the house meetings are?"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Matt,     I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to you with respect to the verbal abuse.  One of my old character defects when someone gets under my skin I verbally attack then in the way I did to you the other day. If after you read this response and you want to discuss other issues face to face I am agreeable to that possibility.  As you know we all are fallible human beings and make mistakes.  You and I can go on and on with this or we can reach a compromise in feelings and the behavior with respect to them.     I would like to comment on you post what is really going on     When you first entered the house I tried my best to support your needs. If you remember I drove you out to pick up your family and also supplied transportation to the airport when your wife left.  The reason I did this was to support a fellow house member and I still the same way about everyone here. There are certain time constraints that I have for such activity.  We in this house are a family and must be sensitive about what goes on here day to day.  It may appear to be a very minor thing about the phone but before changes are made in anyway they should be discussed with all house members and then an equable solution is arrived at with the approval of all members of the house.  It started when you bought a long cord and attached it without discussing it with me.  I live here also and when things are moved around or modifications made it would be nice to know about it in advance. Having a cord on the stairs is a hazard and I tripped on it my self and almost fell.  You also spend a lot of time on the phone while others are expecting calls or want to make them.     Well Matt nothing is going on but people have feelings and different opinions on many issues.  What I can do it help rectify and calm this situation is too install a phone in your room in addition to the house phone. There is justification for this because of your disability. The only problem I see is the where is the phone and who is going to pay for it.  I purchased the house phone at the dollar store for $10.00.       In your post in addition to many other things you mentioned a change in your missing in action behavior.  I would congratulate you for being so perceptive and not continuing to bring suspicion on yourself with incongruous actions on your part."
AXNX7FB,male,44,I don't know why that posted 3 times. Sorry.
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Email Board meeting called by Chase Ingersoll.  Business on the table Matt Y.  Matt is not regularly attending 12 Step meetings.  He has been requested to do so by Board members.  He feels it is not necessary.       I've got 13 years, and I still attend a home group each week and am involved in any number of recovery activities thoroughout the day.   I don't think that it is unreasonable to require someone with as many outstanding issues as Matt, with a lot of time on his hands - to attend a meeting a day.   I have instructed Jim and informed Matt that there is nothing left for Jim or I to say to Matt, until he begins attending meetings.  If he cannot do that, we are not helping, but rather enabling Matt, and the brunt of that enabling is faced by Jim, our board member in residence.   The motion on the floor is:  Matt must agree to begin attending a meeting a day, or he must leave immediately.  He must then attend a meeting a day, for as long as he stays at the Recovery House, or until the board says otherwise.  I need to know if you are in favor of this, or otherwise......IMMEDIATELY.  If we are in favor of this, I will present Matt with a written statement and contact his social worker/counselor.   -Chase   I don't think a meeting a day is too much to suggest, especially for some one who has recently rotated back into society. I don't think anyone is telling him he must share or anything. This should be the guideline for anyone living in the house until there is evidence of a solid foundation in recovery.   I support this motion to expect daily meeting attendance.   -Rob B.   The name of the house is not RECOVERED HOUSE!  The fact that it is RECOVERY HOUSE, means we must be in recovery.....not just stopping usage.   My vote is at least 4 meetings each and every week.....documented and checked at the Sunday night meeting.     -Doug K.    I vote YES   -Jim G   I see two votes for a meeting a day.  I see one vote for four meetings a week.  The Chair Rules that a meeting a day is a requirement, until such time as ones life is filled with the various responsibilities that a person working a serious program will acquire.  At that point we as a Board can be flexible.  Accordingly, I will deliver to Matthew the determination of this board that he must begin daily meetings today, or he will have to remove himself from the premises today.  I’m sorry Matt, but……..  THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN   Chase"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Chase,              I wasn’t calling the lack of performance disrespect. I was saying that when Mark comes home from work, and goes to prepare his lunch for the next day, and finds that someone has been maxing his shit all that day. Now Mark and I have been using each other to get through our grocery dilemma, so he ask if I ate this shit. Obviously my answer is “No”, and this leaves the burden of being labeled a thief. Mark has got a heart of gold, and all they had to do was ask, but that was not the case. By asking that could have offered him an opportunity to go to the store to get more lunch meat. Could you imagine the shock when he went to make a sandwich, and someone had robbed him blind? This is an act of total disrespect.  Let’s use an example that everyone can see, and has to acknowledge. Wow. This site for instance. Here is Chase, offering stories, and past experiences. No matter what they may be, here comes Rob firing shots at him.  Look at Robs cake comment. Ouch!!! It had to have been hard, but Chase went on dodging the missile, and offered his perspective even further. Then Robb again, asking for no extended, fluffy dialog to over take his opinion.  It is clear that Rob has a personal issue with Chase. Who know how long ago this took place, but Rob seems to be holding a resentment. That is what is happening in this home. When stuff is taking place over this site, you can shut your computer off and come back to it when you are ready to. Here you have to live with the cocksucker while he refuses to give you your messages, and eats your food.  As for the cleanliness issue, to hell with them. I clean up after myself. That is all that is expected from me, by myself. That is all that matters to me because I have learned that worrying about others has gotten me no where. As long as I hold myself responsible for my actions, and not worry about theirs, I am not creating an unneeded high stress level.  All that I am getting at is that I don’t have to live like that today because of what this program has taught me. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to post my opinion. Thanks."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Scott,  I tried to talk to you about this earlier, but no. You don't give a fuck what anyone thinks. Now for a second it will feel like everyone is going to gang up on you, but you will thank us for it later. Trust me because I know from experience. Now I have to bust ylou out.  You talk a good program, but walk straight bullshit. Why? You are not honest. You told us (Chase included), that you had around 30 days clean when you first came tpo this house. Then yesterday you said in front of all uf us that you had near 90 days. You have been here a mere three weeks. So which is it? Then a broad named Pam came here talking about that you wanted her to come here to be your woman. She claimed that she had around two and a half years clean, and boasted that you told her that you hat two years and a couple of months. I find myself wondering if this is working an honest program. We all have carachter defects myself included so I am going to leave yours, and your program alone. But...  Let's leave what that broad said alone, and go just on what you have said about your clean time. Weather  you have 30, 60, or 90 days, have you worked all of the steps, and now on 12? Do you really have a sponser? If so did you talk to him about you having this ""S"" on your chest, and wanting to save the world? If this wanting to help out a fellow addict is truly valid, why are they only female? No men? After all this is a Mens Recovery House.  You post this program shit, but seeing your behaviors and what has been going on the past few days, it sounds like another plan to manipulate the situation to camoflauge your bull shit. Nice try. Better luck next time. I of all people understand the need for some pussy, but you are going about it the wrong way homie. Be honest. Let everyone know that you are trying to get some gut. Fuck it. By trying to hide behind the program of recovery, and the program of this house, it makes you look like a liar, cheat, and a complete ass hole. Espicially when you acted the way that you did to Jim yesterday, and today.Don't get mad because I threw this out on the table. Everyone was talking about this this agfternoon just as this broad left, and walked over to the crack house.   You're not looking at all of this clearly dogg. There is alot of wisdom around this house, and program. Maybe you should open your eyes, and mind a little. Make a few changes before you get ran through the wringer, again. Can you really afford to learn this lesson the hard way? Maybe you need to think about that for a while."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I have found that when I have spoken my peace and someone still does not understand, the best thing for me to do is shut up and stop the verbal communication.    Silence is a Loud Speaker.    Just move on.  If someone continues to beat the dead cat, it is obviously still bugging them and they should continually obsess about it until they are tired of it.  You need not continue to obsess about their obsessing.   You really do not have time, as there are three other very interesting, albeit less animated young fellows there, whom you can be a blessing to regardless of whether or not someone thinks that staying out all night, or not cleaning your room is a serious character defect.    Likewise, the other fellow has people whom he can be of benefit, so I will continue to assist them in that in any way that I can.  You all may be imperfect chipped cups, but I see all of you are able to hold water (and piss and vinegar) and all of you are able, and I believe are, contributing positively to the recovery community if in no other way than by showing how despite our faults and the faults of others around us......we can stay clean and sober.    Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,Matt needs in my opinion to grow up and become a man.  One attribute of a man is a human being who has learned to be responsible and sensitive to others around him.  Matt has not learned these life skills yet.  The evidence that brings me to this conclusion is his behavior time and time again in this house.  When he left and stayed gone until 1:30 pm the following day only substantiates my opinion.  I personally do not want to live with anyone that I suspect is using drugs.  I don’t have any solid evidence but his behavior and his lack of candor leads me to this possibility. This is the second time that incidences of this type have occurred.  He did call and left a message early in the evening that he was going fishing but that is all he said and Chase told me that this was a lie.  At the house meeting Sunday all members of the house brought this incident to him and his response was negative.  What next Matt?????
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Last night I tried to get on and tell my side of the story. When i tried to publish,  I found that the server could not be found. Maybe it was irrational to believe that Jim disconnected my line, but with the accusations that were made about me using, I believed that he could have unplugged the line to keep me from finding out what he had posted. As for the immaturity, there were a couple of witnesses to what Jim had to say to me. Along with those words, I was accused of going out and sucking cock for rock.  Ha, ha....       I could sit here an embarrase the hell out of our fearless leader, but I will let that dog sit. I am ok with the way King jim feels today. I owe that to the program. However, if there are any more shots fired by Jim, I will retaliate, and do the best that I can to make Jim look like a fool, not just on this blog, but in the entire public. Why? Because he did me by accusing me of sucking dick for dope in the wide open on the front porch. I will publiclly humiliate him if he wants to act that way in the open. This is a warning for future references. You must know that what you see, and what we have seen, are two different things. I could sit here and put our house manager on blast on the internet, but I feel like I am above that today, but I will not be the next time that he wants to attempt to make a fool out of me.        Jim feels like I should be drug tested. For the record, Let's go. When ever anyone wants to go have it done. gas up the truck. If for any reason that person feels like I passed this test by the skin of my teeth,, I agree to a hair folical test. Just pull the bus up out front, and I will go. It is not a problem. So Jim, Shove your suspicion up your old ass.       Upon the conversation that I had with the rat today, I was informed that I was to go screw myself. I was told that I was not to ask him for anything, and that is fine with me. I feel as if all of this is because of the phone. In my opinion, this is pathetic. Chase, the reason that I called you after Jim and I's conversation was because Jim threatened that if I was gon for hours at a time, I was going to be kicked out, and I would not be allowed to return. I was trying to ask if I needed to leave. From here on out, I will not discuss any issue that I have with the rat. I would appreciate it if you, or the board talked to me before I am forced to leave. I sincerely hope that Jim will get over this petty issue, and quit reacting by making false accusations. I believe that he knows that drug use on my behalf is his ace in the hole. I know that Jim wants me gone. I hope that this is reckonized by everyone and kept in the back of their mind when he makes these fruitless allegations. I would also hope that Jim would do a complete fourth step, if he has not already, to attempt to figure out these carachter deefects. Once that has been complete, I hope that he would attempt to gain a grasp on these, and make a few changes in his life. If you would like an outside opinion Jim, I would gladly be of assistance. It would seem as if I am taking a shot at Jim, but sometimes it is easier to have these things pointed out rather than looking at them from your own perspective. I am speaking from experience. Some times I need some one to tell me that I need some improvement in a few areas. Right Chase????"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I was at the tail end of the 6 p.m. meeting at Beewolf and noticed that Matt, his wife and child were there.  Seems there was a public apology by Matt before I got there.  This was done by Matt without mentioning any names. It seems to me to be a step in the right direction.  The first step on the road to humility.  I believe Matt can become a very positive force at the recovery house, but he needs to be pointed in the right direction.  He is a charter member and it seems we have been working some of the bugs out ""on the fly"".  The fact that he is handicapped does  not  mean we need to feel sorry for him, nor do we have to bend over backwards for this guy. On the other hand, we do need to realize that he does have some special needs.  I believe we need to reconcile with Matt and start over.  This is the next right thing to do.  Lets start over with this guy.  Lets give Matt a date he can expect to get the DSL hook up in his room and let him know that it is contingent on him continuing to work a program and get along well with the rest of the inhabitants in the house.  I see I was outvoted on the number of meetings he needs to attend each week. I think with the transportation issue, each of the board members should offer to transport him to and from the meeting 1 day a week. I think Matt can ask his sponsor or other members on the remaining days.  Lets hear everyone's respones.  Doug"
AXNX7FB,male,44,I have several observations to share with you as the resident board member.  Per your email I agree with your analyses of Matt's lack of a recovery program.  I asked him today if he would like to go to meetings at 6pm or at 8pm. His response was I am waiting for a phone call.  It is my opinion and belief that he is taking advantage of recovery house and its generosity in providing him with housing.  He is continually on the phone with friends at all hours on the night.    Matt is going to have to show us that he is serious about recovery and at this time there is no evidence of this possibility.   My suggestion on the house phone is that it be located downstairs and no phones be allowed in the rooms.  As we discussed before that Internet access be on the recovery house computer not on private computers in rooms.  The house phone should have a time limit per call so that others can use it when needed.    John and his dad were over tonight and john is very satisfied with his room.  He seems very dictated to sobriety and is the kind of person recovery house can be successful with because of his attitude.  I feel very comfortable to be in a mentoring position with him.   All indications are that he will move in Monday or Tuesday.   Your comments please   Jim
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Here is an example of a well known rap artist that is often played on BET and MTV.   Obviously some of you have just never bothered to consider what is actually being said.    Since Matt stuck his neck out on the issue, regardless of how smart he is, I think it is going to take all of your brains together to explain how you would share the downstairs of 1016 NE Madison with guests, women, children and prospective residents, and 12 Step supporters, with the following ""music"" coming from the stero speakers on the television.  I am perfectly open to being persuaded, as to how the message of this music is congruent with the morals and values of anyone's 12 Step program.   I'll be waiting to see who besides Matt is willing to make a fool of themselves on this issue.

AXNX7FB,male,44,"Have you ever came here, and heard that type of music on the stereo with the people present that you mentioned below? No, you have not. Nor will you ever. I understand your concerns with that type of music playing in the company of guest of that nature, but why does it matter what is being played when no one is around?  It's entertainment. That is all. No one is going to listen to a LiL' Kim song then run to the kitchen to attempt to make a Sprite can disappear in their mouth, nor will they listen to Brooks and Dunn then get up and attempt to do the ""Boot Scoot Boogie"" right there in the living room.  It's just not going to happen.  So what's the big deal. Some what of a comprimise should be made. This type of unruly power struggle is nothing more than another brick in the wall of reasons why people don't want to spread positive messages about this place.  Rob,  Thanks for the helpful advise. Yes, I did get the web adress, but Jim took it upon his self to make a copy of it (The Big Book) and put it on disc for me. Thanks Jim.  Did you receive my e- mail about the lady that needed some work done? You never got back to me on that."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Has anyone talked to the folks at the work release to see what kind of situation they found with Matt? He doen't seem very grateful, to say the least, for a guy who has some semblance of freedom. Maybe it could be suggested that he try different meetings, to mix it up a bit. You never know where you will hear what you need. Maybe he will find a place where the group puts him in check, tells him poor me, poor me, pour me another, I think it goes. Most guys tend not to like the homeless shelters once they get there, maybe he would see that DSL in his room is a far better obstacle than being homeless. How is his speaking thing going? Still doing that?   I can't help but feel that his wife, who I believe was estranged, is a lot to put on his plate fresh out of state custody. I realize he has a child, and he needs to develop that bond, but he won't be developing any bonds if he can't focus on himself for a while. I can't think of one recovering person who benefited from immediately reestablishing a relationship before they established themselves. Maybe some sort of time frame could be put in place to expire before guys start working step 9 and assimilating into old relationships again."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Maybe the guy left his tools hanging on his clothesline, which would be irrational. Besides, the tools that were allegedly bought were returned, which is rational. That depends on how you define ""bought""."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I am sore. I don't understand what brought all of this on. All i wanted to do was use the phone in privacy to talk to my wife. Maybe this has been coming to a head for a while. I am not sure. I do know that I am very disappointed in what I heard when i went to the six o' clock meeting. I understand that there is no ananimity within this house. I understand why. What i don't understand is why Jim went to the noon meeting and told everyone that he had suspicions of a person living in the recovery house was using. He also said that this person had a disability. He set his false aligations out on me in the rooms. I feel like he had no right to do that. Thank God that there are people within those rooms that care enough about me to ask me what is really going on. While talking to these people, I was told that Jim said that I stayed away from this house for 48 hours. He was quoted saying that and that when he stayed gone for 2 days, he knew what he was doing. I was not gone like that. This is a lie. I can't understand why Jim would say this.    I give up. I can't do this. I have more important things to worry about than the he said shit. I am sick over this. I don't want to fight or argue. That is  why I got sober because I couldn't live like this anymore. If the issue is really about me going and hanging out, I have made a commitment to myself, to my wife, and now I am making a commitment to you. I will not go hang out in the late hours. I have been locked up for the last two years, and I just want a little freedom. I didn't mean to disrespect anyone. For some reason, I dont think that this is what this is entirely about. I don't have a clue. I am not using drugs, if you think that I am, drug test me. I am more than willing.       What it all boils down to is this: Jim, do what you're going to do, say what you feel that you need to say. I am done with defending myself, I no longer care what you, or anyone else has to say about me. I know what is true, and what isn't. I am worrying about me, and my program. I am going to do what it takes to change my life, and if I can, help others. I from now on, refuse to get involved with this crap.        I am done...."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Interesting observations:  1.  Nice to see you co-signing Matt's bullshit;  2.  I see that you both feel that it is perfectly okay to bite the hand that feeds you;  Most interesting in regards to the television in that both of you did not contribute a dime to its being there, but none-the-less feel completely entiled to use in in any, offensive or obnoxious way that you desire.  Try growing up a little, actually putting YOUR money where your mouth is, and see if your are not just a little resentful at people who can be absolutely oblivious to the fact that other people live, work and volunteer their time in the same place and find your particular form of entertainment to be disgusting, unhealthy and contrary to the healthy atmosphere that you are trying to create and make comfortable for as many people as possible.  By all means, keep posting your heart felt ingratitude, so that others might perhaps appropriately guard themselves and apply a more protective boundary in their relationships with you.  I'll be waiting on pins and needles to see who else is interested in cosigning your bullshit.  Some of us are actually serious about the common areas of the house being a pleasant and wholesome environment for every person that might come through the door, rather than bringing in behaviors and thoughts that we said we were going to leave out in the street.  But my guess is that both of you probably treated your own families far worse and would have had no compunction, blasting that sort of music in your grandmothers house in the middle of the day, regardless of how it would make her or her neighbors feel.   So can we really expect you to treat myself or anyone else any better?  Here is the deal.    You want to argue with Chase, you better be right.   I will not back off on a principal, especially when people are willing to make such entertaining fools of themselves trying to support an untenable position.   And in this argument, I've got more facts, more  perspective, more support, more recovery and more self discipline in my little finger than both your bodies combined.  So until you can defend the Lil Kim lyrics as somehow unoffensive to Blacks, Women and not something you would want your child to hear, please don't blast that sort of crap in the common area of the house.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I don't see the point of reconciling.  I've told Matt, that when I have to be a 2x4 over his head and chew him out, that in 30 seconds, I will not be angry.  The point is to counter his stupid anger, with appropriate anger and let him get even angrier and possibly to the breaking point of relapse over that anger.  I know that the other night, I calmly drove home and hopefully left Matt so angry that he could not sleep a wink that night.  That is good.  If he is going to be a little jerk and gourse about what other people have not done, I want him to be up all night plotting about what he would like to do to Chase, or what he is going to say about Chase when he goes to a meeting.  In fact I hope he was just dying to go to a meeting to tell everyone what an asshole Chase is.  But like they use to tell us in the USMC ""...girls, this is just how it is going to be....it doesn't have to be this way, but if you want to play games......we are going to show you how....""   And in the Corps, we didn't ""reconcile"" or apologize.  As men, we just admited our error and determined to work to not make that mistake again.    If matt wants to apologize, I can't stop him.  But apologies are cheap, and are frequently given as a manipulation, just to get the immediate trouble we've caused over with, and to sweep something away without actually doing something about it.   The better the liar someone is........the better they are at apologizing with words, and especially, sincere sounding, tearful words.  Let Matt apologize behaviorally speaking - with behavior like going to meetings.  I say be as fair to Matt as we would be to anyone else, but also require just as much accountability and meetings as would be required of anyone else.  I have no problem and no fear of someone going out and relapsing.  I have seen time and time again, the guy whining about other people, until the guy goes out and relapses, and that is what it takes for him to see that he needs to stop the whining and start working with other people on their terms, rather than just his own selfish terms.     Specifically on his DSL, I think that he needs it in his room for his blind stuff.  I think that is a special need that can be accomodated.  But I think that at this point, it would be better for Jim to deal with that issue only when Matt's couselor or aide from the department of rehabilitation is present.  Again - Jim should only deal with the DSL and computer issue when there is that third party aide to facilitate the communication and moderate anything.  Oh - Matt was threatening to go down to the South Side Mission, when his wife leaves.  I call that the Blind Man's Bluff.  Let him do that.  Nothing would further him toward that ""attitude of gratitude"" than a couple of days there.  Let him see what they do for him, when he screams about DSL"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Per the Board Meeting last night:  1.  Rob:  you need to drop by the house more often.   2.  Guys coming in, need to be immediately notified that observations about them, will be posted on the Blog, and it may not be things that they like, but that they are entitled to respond.  Recovery House must be consistent with the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights;  3.  However, being that there are felons on the premises, the 2nd Amendment does not apply at recovery house, and in keeping with that philosophy, we do not take each other on mano-a-mano, but rather blogger-to-blogger;  4.  Further, as the Recovery House is a family unit there is in reality NO PRIVACY, so it is now explicitly stated that there shall be no effort to provide or expectation of privacy.  And I feel no sympathy for anyone on that, because I have taken goofballs out of treatment, to come and stay with me, and they do lots of talking in meetings and elsewhere about me and my family, and there is nothing I can do about it.  And actually, I think the more they talk the better.  And we all know how the song goes - ""I WANNA TALK ABOUT ME""   Actually, I don't have to talk about me, BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS....  5.  The role of the Recovery House Board Member must also be clearly stated and repeated to the new participants.  Guys coming out of Prison seem to feel that Jim is there to rat to the board about the residents.  I have consistently maintained that he is there to let us know what is going on and to act as a stabilizing influence for someone who might be struggling.  He is not there to babysit.  But since guys coming out of prison, sometimes just feel the way they feel.  I suggest that we accomodate them and henceforth, Jim shall be known to the program participants as...........JIMMY THE RAT.   I think that if we lowball their expectations, with such a label, it will be easier on them, than to let them think that Jim is just there to be their friend and listen to their beefs.  Jim may be those things, but let's just make it clear that his #1 function, may in fact to be to rat out someone that is using.    6.  Guys are obviously not reading the program contract and are not clear that the reason for removal from the house, is for relapse, financial irresponsibility, and any criminal activity.  The other stuff is just the normal stupid crap you see in families and see with recovering addicts.  The difficulty in the house will be that there is new people, changes and problems and feelings, but these goofballs are now having to actually deal with the issues, rather than walking away and isolating and going back to drinking or drugging.  And that really is a HUGE change for them.  So don't expect any of them to handle it perfectly.  7.  Also it was pointed out that the guy who is the most troublesome today and stuggling the most today, may in fact be the fellow best equipped to assist a similar fellow - tomorrow.  The effort we invest in the people struggling the most, may in fact have the greatest reward and benefit to us and everyone else.  So keep this in mind when someone seems to be trying to win the STUPID ADDICT OF THE WEEK award.  8.  Mark my words, the greatest slight is going to be not what is said on this blog, but rather it will be for the poor fellow who is never mentioned at all.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"For a second I thought my computer was fucked up again, but taking a closer look, I discovered that it wasn’t my computer at all. It was just typos. I had never heard my computer stutter like that before. It sounded like it had a bad case of the hic- ups.  In response to “Open your eyes”.  Let me see…. The last time I checked, everyone in this house has had more bad times than we could count, along with ups, and downs. It is obvious that we all have made bad choices, or we wouldn’t be in the situation that we all are in.  I remember when I first got here, and everything didn’t go my way, I thought that these people were playing with my life too. Especially when I thought that should be ran like this, and this should be ran like that. My major dilemma was that I had more clean and sober time than Jim, our house manager. Who was he to tell, or make suggestions as far as my recovery was concerned. I was so ignorant of the wisdom around this house, and I was the only resident at that time. I have been through so much, and now I am so grateful. What happened? I opened my eyes…, and in turn, opened my mind. I learned that God gave me two ears, and one mouth for a reason.... I shared that hoping that you would open your eyes, ears, and shut your mouth.  Forgive me for being so brutal, but I took major offense to you calling this house, and program of this house a farce. (In case you don’t know what a farce is, it is a much more sophisticated word for joke than joke.) Why, do you ask? I have been here from the beginning. I have done, and been through all of this shit so you didn’t have to. I have been challenged, verbally abused, and the reason for the boundaries that have been set. It sounds very self- centered, but everyone has to acknowledge that it is the truth. What I have learned is: The rules and boundaries that have been set are for a couple of reasons. Because the decisions that I made in the past, landed me in the shoes that I wear today. Because I live in an environment where I must share the space in which I inhabit with other people who have not made the best decisions in their lives. Therefore, I need to be protected, and my fellow residents need to be protected.   With omniscience of the reason of these rules, and even further, of the people ramming these guidelines up my ass, I have learned to appreciate them, instead of smiling while I was force fed. Which is what you are doing.  It’s okay Scott. You are not the first, and you will not be the last. I just hope that you learn from this experience. I did. Honestly, when I first got here I hated Jim, now I can honestly say that I love the rat. As for Chase, it goes without saying that I wouldn’t have pissed on fire to put him out. Now I whole heartedly appreciate him like never before. You may hate us at first, but when your mind clears, and this dust settles you will be able to look back and think “What the hell was I thinking”. That is the beauty of this program. Don’t give up. I am sure that you won’t, I like that trait you possess the most.  I can totally relate  As for the bowling, to late. I have already been. You should come once in a while, and get your ass kicked. Ha ha ha...  Bonnie, Welcom aboard. You should know that your wisdom is valued, and appreciated."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I don't specifically recall, but generally I do remember a lot of issue with the guys in the house wanting to run something some way or structure something in some way that Craig and I absolutely knew from experience, was just flat wrong and going to cause problems.  The difficulty is that on some things we could step back and let guys learn from their own mistakes, but on other things, we had to draw the line and just say no pre-emptively, and no you can't even try that.  The reason for that was that we are responsible for the whole and for how that whole of the house affects each other and affects the outside community.  As a whole we cannot allow choas and will try to pre-empt it.  Individually, we can advise and guys can make their own choices.  But where that choice crosses boundaries into some other guys territory, that is where we have the obligation to that fellow to pre-empt that if possible and most certainly address the issue once it has happened.    This is an issue that you see in families, prison and in neighborhoods.  And it has been especially interesting of my observations of prisoners and former prisoners.  The number one thing that they want from supervisors is JUSTICE. And they want it fast, they want it fair and they want it pre-emptively if possible.   I also recall that desire in my own family growing up.  And I particularly recall its absence.    In my family the youngest child was always right. And I was the eldest child.  The exception was the one girl.  She was the trump cards and would always be right over the six brothers.  So by the age of 15 - I was no longer living in that house.  But 20 years later, I see the effects when my siblings and I are together.  Some of them still feel ""enititled"" to be right and have the upper hand or last word in everything that they do towards me.  One brother in particular is still completely without perspective and understanding in how he demands that his thoughts and ideas be the best and greatest and that most suredyly his lowly eldest brother, acknowledge the youngers superiority in all of these areas.  The irony in my life is that no other person had more of an effect on me to quit drinking.  His drinking insantiy was 100 times mine, but the danger and potential for loss that I saw in his behavior, left such a bad taste in my mouth that I initially quit drinking more for what I saw it doing in his life, than for what I saw it doing in mine.  That catalyst was enough to cause me to quit drinking for six months, and in that time experience situations and make observations that then caused me to leave alcohol behind completely for the last 13 years.  But rather than resenting the imbalance and injustice in the relationship between us, last year I simply chose to walk away from its toxicity and let him reflect on my lengthy silence and perhaps as he ponders it, he will come up with the truth about the situation and himself, of which I was never able to persuade him.  So I have sidetracked here, but the point is that we all want justice and we want it now.  The problem is however, that for many, justice will not be reeived in this lifetime.  Earth being the earthly place that it is, the evil man will die peacefully in his bed and be lauded at the finest funeral home in the city, while the champion of justice may die from a blow in the street and have his corps donated to science.  But  I will not leave you guys hanging, the way my father left me when I was 13, with the question: Was there a sign over your crib in the hospital that said.....life is fair?     22 years later, I know that my response should have been.....the question dad, is not whether life is being fair to me, but rather are you fair to me and are you doing everything you can, to see that I am fairly treated.  The biblical precept for that is that we are comanded to ""...do justice...and walk rightly...toward all men...""  And that is the concept regarding accountability and taking others inventory, if we are to expect justice from others, we must first do justice.  Likewise with mercy.  And particulaly in the case of this Recovery House, I am not asking any of you to do anything, or make any sacrifices that I have not been making for the last 13 years.  If I appear short, to the point and very adamant about certain things, it is because I and others have been doing them for a very long period of time and I know that they work.  Despite that, one of the most difficult things for anyone and especially addicts, is to trust and in many cases, you will have to trust what you cannot see, by having to go and look for evidence to support what I may tell you. The most direct evidence that you have of what I tell you, is the fact that you are at 1016 Madison tonight and not somewhere else.  If at any time you doubt what I say, wander your mind through all of the many circumstances it took to place you there and consider that I was preparing that place for you, long before I ever met you.   If I can believe and make that effort for an unseen and unknown person.  So can you.  That is what I expect from all of you.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I like Beewolf. It is proof that you can sit in a smoke filled room........ where at any moment someone still smelling of booze, but suffering from the DT's can stumble in, or a three hundred lbs crack whore sneaks in to hide from her pimp that pulled into the gas station across the street, only to see her pimp from a year ago, accepting a 1 year clean and sober coin.......and experience a serene view of the breadth and color of recovery.      Beeolf is where the recovery rubber meets the road, for the good, the bad and the ugly, and Beewolf has them all, in every shape, size, color and sexual orientation.      It it also, the best evidence that no matter how bad the dysfunctional behaviors around you, there are always roses amongst the thorns and nutrients in the cesspool of life and that each day, our free will is blessed with both good and bad examples to follow.      Yes, Beewolf needs more people with positive perspectives, but I kind of like the fact that people who want to dump their garbage, have a place to go and do it, where they also have to sit there and listen to others who are interested in dumping their garbage.      I personally have heard much wisdom, insight and have often observed much kindness, humility and truthfulness at Beewolf.      Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Matt, if you are not using, you need to recite the short version of the serenity prayer--""F@#k  em"". Everyone is not going to like you, nor you everyone else. Al l this struggle does is keep you from looking at you, which is the most important thing. While you can learn how you handle yourself in various relationships, the exercise is fruitless when it comes to trying to determine who's wrong or right, good or evil.     Some people will invariably refuse to look at their own shit, ourselves included at times. You can't change that, except how you look at your stuff. These things you are going through might bring up some real issues in time for you to learn from. Good to read that you see that a little. Stay open minded , honest, and willing. Someone will be happy to talk smack about you long after Jim is done, so be flattered, and don't be like the person you are butting   h eads with, whoever it is now or in the future. Aspire to be YOU, not who you've always believed you were, but, rather, who you know you can become as a recovering addict.    Not as peotic as the previous blogs, but then, that was too much info for this addict to sort through to find the meat. It doesn't matter why you are the way you are, what is important is how you change that."
AXNX7FB,male,44,Hey whats up? About time I got in this. I finally feel a part of something. Looks as if I got the bus driver position in East Peoria. Thiings are looking up for me.      Welcome Chris to are lovely home. Its always good to have new young hot men around. Just joking about the hot men in the recovery house. Have to watch what I say you all might think Im a ho! ho!     Im planning to prepare a nice meal for Labor Day at 1016 madison.  Invite friends and relatives in recovery. NO USERS ALLOWED!!!!!!!!!
AXNX7FB,male,44,"It's not just the minimal time in Recovery, but also the particular personalities, that are going to constantly perster whomever they can, with their ""cares"".  I recall my homeless shelter days, and there were those type of characters and then there were those who attempted to sense what you had going and what you had time for, and took great pains to not interupt your other tasks, chains of thought and conversations with others that you might be having.  Others, were just totally oblivious to what anyone else was doing, and it became more and more difficult to be patient with them.  I think that using email might actually be at least part of the answer.  I would get a kick out of Matt Y putting his beefs on this Blog, where everyone could see and where I could respond at my leisure, for everyone to see.  There is something about a written, rather than spoken word, which causes people to remember the idea that was communicated.  Additionally, it can be far more accurate, espcially when we are otherwise looking at a ""he said, he said that so and so had said that......""  which is a complete waste of time for those at the end of the communication.  The basic issue that Matt Y is dealing with is that he is blind, so he has less to do and fewer ways of receiving stimulous or knowing what is going on.  His compensating mechanism, is to go verbal and try and increase his auditory stimulous.  But I don't think he knows how, or is willing to yet do that in a constructive way, so what he does is try to get people who have sight, fretting over everything that Matt cannot see.    As long as Jim is going to listen to Matt and pass it onto Chase or Doug, etc....Matt being the Pavovian Dog that he is, is  going to continue to attempt to drag actors into his drama by going to Jim with stuff that Matt needs to first work out in his own mind.   As Matt finds more to do, and Jim refuse to ""bite"" and listen to every little gripe, the problem will take care of itself.  Chase Ingersoll - chaseingersoll@yahoo.com"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"First and foremost, I would like to make it aware that I appreciate the advocacy. My defense is as follows. Last week I was in my room sick, and sleeping. I was informed of what took place, and what was said about my where about. Someone said that they saw me leave. This was obviously a lie. Here I am beating a horse that no one cares about seeing how this issue is a week old. This week I left, and went to River Side, and then tucked away at a very good friend’s house in the program. The meeting there was a very good one, and lasted an hour, and a half. This story could almost be impossible to back up, but guess who was there? Yep… Rob!!!  I kind of like the idea of rewarding those who show up next week with a cook out, but I am still strongly considering taking a rain check...  Chase, you said it all when you posted your last post. Even though this is house is supposed to be family oriented, it is not, nor will it ever be. Everyone in this house is cut from a different type of fabric. You said that we were just going to have to deal with it if someone is a slob, and you are right…, but nobodies mother lives here, and it seems as if some people think that she does. Sorry, but I am blind, and I have a hard enough time taking care of, and cleaning up after myself, let alone someone else, or a bunch of others for that matter. My solution to this problem. I make a mess, and clean it up. I dirty a dish, I wash them right away. I use, and reuse the same glasses. This alleviates any responsibility of the immediate area of being a mess on me. I do not expect anyone to clean up after me, nor will I clean up after anyone else.  From what I understand, the house meeting is being declared a battle field. It seems that once the issues of what the house’s need with respect to furniture, and repairs, is an all out war between residents. People taking shots at one another, and complaining about one another’s conduct. If one person tells another that he needs to do this, or that, then a tic for tack now takes place. Anger flares, and resentments build. In front of Chase, the situation may look resolved, but when he is gone the house returns to the same mind set creating havoc within our home.  What kind of chaos? When people start disliking one another like this, they start to not have any respect for them, or their property. Chase, I know that you don’t like the respect thing, but let’s get real. You have to respect each other. Disrespect falls into different categories. The two main ones is: Taking (without permission) others food. Someone has been just helping themselves to Marks lunch materials. Not leaving messages when people call, and when they come in, and you ask them if anyone called, and you say “No.” because your mad at them because they busted you out.  I used to do the dishes for every body until I seen that it was being taken advantage of. When I was on the phone, I used to get off when someone else called for somebody else; until I found out they weren’t doing it for me. I have had police call me for speaking engagements, and to give me quotes. My aunt who lives in Wisconsin, my wife who lives 300 miles away to tell me what she found out at the doctors today. I am here alone with no family. I can’t just get up and go visit people. I use the phone a lot. When other people are on it, they should at least give me the message that whosoever called. Who knows what is going on? After that has been happening for 2 weeks now, I just don’t care anymore. It seems as if these resentments against me would disappear after a couple of days, but I guess not... Now someone else is cosigning that same bull shit… Nevertheless, all’s well.  So I am not sure if I want to be a part of this war. I am not getting involved in any more nonsense. Someone else is not that serious because I don’t have to live their life. They know what it is going to take to change, and if they refuse…  Hey, Welcome colleen. Glad to know that you are aboard. I am looking forward to hearing from you."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"........and get to the meat.  Shakespeare said, "" All the world's a stage, all the men and women are merely players."" He forgot to mention that I was the chief critic. I was always able to see the flaw in every person, every situation. And I was always glad to point it out, because I knew you wanted perfection, just as I did. AA and acceptance have taught me that there is a bit of good in the worst of us, and a bit of bad in the best of us; that we are all children of God, and we all have a right to be here. When I complain about me or you, I am complaining about God's handiwork. I am saying that I know better than God.  For years, I was sure that the worst thing that could happento a nice guy like me wouldbe that I would turn out to be an alcoholic. Today, I find that it is the best thing to ever happen to me. This proves I don't know what's good for me. And if I don't know what's good for me, then I don't know what's good or bad for anyone.  So I am better off if I don't give advice, don't figure I know what's best, and just accept life on life's terms, as it is today--especially my own life, as it actually is. Before AA,  I judged myself by my intentions, while the world was judging me by my actions.--Big Book, 3rd ed. ppg 449-450.  When I am disturbed, it is  because I find some person, place, thing, or situation-some fact of my life- unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. ........I need to concentrate not so much much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and in my attitudes. --Big Book 3rd ed. p 449.  You will be most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any pasion for crusade or reform. Never talk down to an alcoholic from a moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out the kit kit of spiritual tools for his inspection. Show him how they worked for you. Offer him friendship and fellowship. Tell him that if he wants to get well, you will do anyting to help. Big Book 3rd ed. p 95  This says to me, that I must accept life on life's terms, making changes in ME first, strive for humility, and a spirit of love for others.  For example, if I am not where you are, it is not your job to make sure I want to be you, or for you to take hostages on a trip to BELIKEME. I have many friends who (including myself) have many character defects. What works best for us is to love each other until we can love ourselves, despite our flaws. We can point them out to each other, when we can, in a way that is not condascending or based on our personal opinions.  This BET issue is a perfect example of the struggle to be right, when we forget that things work out the way they are supposed to, when we are open minded and accepting."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"These are my thoughts on the issue at 1016 Madison. While in my active addiction I manipulated men and yes I was very good at it. Because of this behavior is why I am starting over in my recovery? Today I have 40 days clean an its the honest truth. I have lots of concerns about what has happened last week with the girl being in the Men’s Recovery House First of all a lot of sobriety was threatened with a using addict in the Men’s Recovery House This particular girl had numerous options but was not willing to follow through. When I was beaten I became willing.  You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink. That’s my view on this issue.  I am sure I will have more views about issues in the future, but for now why keep beating a dead horse.  Just for your all information I am as happy as a pig in shit at the Woman’s Recovery House. Thanks for allowing me to participate in the Peoria Recovery House program for I am truly appreciative.  Respectively Yours   Bonnie"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"What is the common denominator in a multi human living environment? Cleanliness and order. A mess here, a mess there, speaks to the mess in our heads. If we are sloppy and cluttered, often our lives are that way too. Sometimes doing things like making the bed, doing a dish, etc., are the small tasks many of us never did, and are the easiest place to start caring enough about ourselves to do.  Just my experience: please no extended, fluffy dialogue to overtake my opinion. It takes up space and is really not productive for any of us. If it does not fit you, put it back and pick up the next one. At least that is what open-mindedness means to me."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"The recover house is now full and enjoying some stability.   Today we had an informal house meeting and discussed several issues including cleaning supplies, and other necessary housekeeping items. At the house meeting I did remind everyone about the basic requirement for a meeting a day.  This met with a favorable response but Greg remarked I would rather want to then have to.  My response was that it is a house rule and must be adhered to for residence in recovery house.    Mark moved in yesterday and has been confined to the premises due to a requirement of his situation. He has employment and plans to return to work Tuesday after completing the necessary requirements of his situation.  John has employment and appears to be very strongly committed to his recovery program  Matt has calmed down somewhat and is adjusting to the program.  I connected his laptop to the recoverhouse router and he is now surfing.  Greg is also working and going to meetings but he has very little sobriety and seems to be going through some internal problems.  I am not sure if he has a sponsor but has never said anything about one to me.  He will be getting a paycheck next week and hopefully will use it for a good purpose."

AXNX7FB,male,44,Matt asked for a ride to a meeting yesterday - 8:00 am.  He advised that he was going to try to make two meetings a day.    Nice job everyone.  Let's see if he can be that consistent.  Chase
AXNX7FB,male,44,Matt appears to be adjusting to his program for he is going too both the 8am and the 6pm Beewolf meeting. This is a signicifient improvement in his recovery attitude.  I go to the 6pm Beewolf meetings every evening and he rides with me in the recovery mobile. Matt is short on money to buy the necessities but he did receive his medical card today.   I informed him today that he would have Internet access on or before this Saturday at 5PM

AXNX7FB,male,44,Matt lost the boot sector on his hard drive so he will not be on the internet for a few days. This will afford all equal opportunity to continue this discussion. I am repairing his laptop and he has agreed to supply me with seven home cooked meals for my efforts.
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I found this service more than a year ago.   urlLink http://www.k7.net/index.htm   The faxes and voicemail come into your email box, as a sound file or graphic file.  You click on the email attachment and it plays the message.  I think that it also identifies the number from which the call was made.  The one thing is that the phone numbers that they assign you are a 206 area code.   But I don't think that is too much of a problem for somone who wants something for free.   The other thing is that you can check your email at the library and elsewhere and see who has called you, so that has obvious advantages over having an answering machine on the house phone, or having to come home and check the message board.  My suggestion is that everyone get a voicemail number, and if someone is not home, we have the list right there so that we can give the person their voicemail/fax and tell them to leave a message there.  That seems fair.  THe other huge benefit is that when a person moves on, or even to another recovery house - their number stays the same.  Please try this out as soon as possible and enter your phone number into your blog profile if possible.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"A Heart felt thanks to both Matts and Matt's friend (the one that donated the grill).  Let's move ahead with plans for a cookout - slash house warming party. This could be lots of fun.  That's what it's all about anyway - having fun and ""trudging the road to happy destiny"".  I heard through the grapevine that Mark has solved the sponsor issue by ""hiring"" a temporary sponsor.  The payment plan has yet to be revealed, but it may be an interesting one if I know Mark.  You know he has a special gift don't you? Ask him aboout it sometime - especially if you have about 25 minutes with nothing to do but listen to Mark ramble on and on.  I do hope he reads this with a smile on his face.   John has been advised by several people not to attend Beewolf. If I were him I would definately hit a bunch of meetings there just to see what goes on there if nothing else. Maybe instead he a pretty good group of recovering folks if he looks with an open mind.  Either way, we definately need to hit lots more meetings John. Here is an assignment for everone who sees or speaks to Jim Fagan. Lets all hit him up to get on the BLOG. I value his thoughts and I know others on here do as well.  If we all ask him to get on here, he may try it.  Ifanyone tried to send me an email directly, I was having trouble recieving for a minute - I was unable to get 10 messages. I believe I am back in good shape now though.    Keep in touch."
AXNX7FB,male,44,Many times when attempting to help an active user we enable them.  As an example giving them a place to stay while there using. It is admirable that Scott was welling to put is sobriety on the line for this girl.  The program has taught me that women must help women not the other way around.  When you’re new into recovery your highest priority must be yourself.  I don’t understand having sex with a using female ever helped her in recovery.   Scott is attempting to be a roster in a hen house and really the past few days have been a futile attempt on his part too helps someone else when indeed he needs to help himself.  If you want to help someone in recovery purchase the Big Book for her rather then a motel room. Talk to her about socializing with other women with long term recovery not with an over sexed male. Suggest to her to seek consoling to determine what is involved in a healthy relationship between a man and a woman.  Being honest with this person as to your real motives may be a good start in your recovery program.  You had another young lady looking for you this afternoon She begin asking questions about you and all of us had a great conversation.  She mentioned that you told her you had two years clean.  This we though was kind of strange because you told members of this house that you had 30 Days. Others have heard you say 90 days.  Gee Scott how many days do you really have clean????
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Sorry to have to get out the 2x4.  Matt knows how it  feels.    But at a certain point I get tired of stuff  that I see in the way of not just your success, but in you having more  people around you and your leading them to higher levels of sobriety.      One commonality with addicts is that they all have so much incredible  potential, but are so often distracted by pointless things, or they  come up with excuses not to do the things that are going to pay off  incredibly in the long run.      One of the biggest problems that I see in the program is that the long  timers move on, and they are not willing to take on the job of engaing  the the more recent people and constantly challenging them, to the  point of making the more recent people uncomfortable, if that is what  it takes to get them to improve faster and to greater levels.      It is like the Army.  Going into boot camp, you really have no  concept of what you can achieve, much less how to actually do it, or  the discipline when shown how, to actually do it every day until those  things become second nature.      Sobriety is a mariaculous gift, but if we are to appreciate it to its  fullest, we have to use that gift to its fullest, rather than just  limping along in life, content that we are no longer sick and tired.      People get to choose the direction that they will go.  My method,  is that when I see a person who has chosen the right path, is to lean  on them and push them to get where they are going faster and to get  much further down the road than they might have thought possible, if  for no other reason than, the further they get down that road and deal  with their issues, the further they are from ever going back, and the  more they will be able ot help others.      Chase"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I agree Matt should have another opportunity, but let's not dry our eyes every time someone cries wolf. It should not be the board's responsibility to transport, that's what the fellowship is for. It becomes too incestual. The more the board does for these guys, the less they will have to work, ........ENABLING. Why does Matt need DSL in his room, anyway?"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Irrational thoughts of our feelings play a major role in this behavior. We as human beings need to feel good all the time, but this is an irrational thought process. Irrational thought process leads to relapse and continued use of drugs.  The four main feelings are Comfort,  Fairness, Approval and Success. We as human beings all have these feelings.  Some of us have irrational thoughts with respect to these feelings. Failure to satisfy these feelings  promotes anger and frustration that may lead to alcohol or drug use. The problem here is to rationally deal in a positive way with these thoughts with respect to these feelings. One-way to deal with this problem is to develop rational ways of thinking about these feelings. As an example If we feel discomfort we can learn to deal with it in the short term, realizing that it would be better to feel a little discomfort for a short term rather then to experience pain and suffering in the long term. We can tolerate discomfort because of the consequences that would occur in the long term as a result of using drugs. We can tolerate this discomfort because it’s not horrible or terrible. Sobriety is in our long term best interest because of the pain we will experience by using. It is irrational that we must have comfort, fairness, approval and success all the time. We must realize the world we live is not fair and we don’t need approval to be happy. It is also irrational to believe  that we always need success to function as a well-adjusted human being. For people like us think that when we are uncomfortable we need relief right now  We must stop and think what the consequences are if we act on these feelings in an irrational way. Acting on these irrational feelings will not be in our best long-term interest."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Yesterday the house members assembled to discuss house activity and resolve issues. The group agreed on house cleanup, notification of absence behavior and other general issues.  The group felt that a 5pm meeting would be best allowing residents to attend the 6pm AA meeting. Hopefully next Sundays meeting at 5pm will result with continued positive solutions for issues that occur in the Men’s Recover House."
AXNX7FB,male,44,Greg relapsed yesterday and spent all his money but he is still alive!.  I believe that relapse is a part of the recovery process for some people.  Now the Recover House Board must make a decision on Gregs future.  Mark has offered to support Greg with the rent and my support is in the form of compassion and understanding.  In my opinion Greg should be given another opportunity in Recovery house.  It would serve no useful purpose to discharge him but offering compassion and help is the right approach in this case.
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Does Matt have an income? Could he perhaps get a cell phone, or pay for an additional line at the house?     Getting a second line would not necessarily set a precedent for everyone, due to his special needs.    Someone already having a cell and only 1 contract can get an additional line that he could pay for, usually requiring a deposit to activate the second line. I have 2 lines on my service, but they are both being used right now."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I am not so above myself that I can't admit when I am wrong. You totally missed the point. You do not know me, and have never met my wife, or child. You have no idea what I am capeable of as far as my disability is concerned, and I know that you had no idea what was going on with me as far as your comments that you made in the past three weeks. All I was saying was: investigate a little before you comment. Weather you know it or not, your comments are taken into consideration. Therefore, affecting the decision of the board. Sorry, Rob, your ignorance about the situation left you open, and looking clueless. I took offense to the fact that you do not know me, and made your decisions based entirely on the comments of others. What I am suggesting now is, come see for yourself. Don't go making decisions solely on the remarks of others. There are bits of pieces of information left out. I understand now, more than ever, that it is important to gather all of the facts before making a decision, especially when the life of another is, or could be affected.  I also made a claim that you were not present at any of the board meetings that I was. The remark that Sir Chase made was that you may have been present at the meeting that took place yesterday. I can guarantee that you werent. A room full of people attending an A.A.  meeting, and a board meeting is a hell of a difference. Nice try though, I will give you that. Better luck next time."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"1.  You are both talking rather than beating each other, and unpleasant as some of your sentiments may be for you and the person who is the brunt of your sentiments, honest expression is a necessary step along the road to accurate expression and appropriate expression.    2.  What you are both dealing with is developing appropriate boundaries for your own actions, and where to draw the lines with other people.  Your reactions and ramblings are all too familiar to what I experienced more than a decade ago, and then have observed in other people in the recovery process.  Right now you are both at a place where you are just ""...getting it all out....""     and it is sort of like vomit.  You need to get it all out.  It makes you feel better.  But it is a nasty smelly mess for anyone around, and it is particulary nasty for the person standing in front of you.   That is why I prefer to stay at my house and comment on the blog.  Also, I cannot stand the smell of hamburger.    3.  The Divine author of life has place you in front of Jim, and Jim in front of you.   I truly believe that for some reason, you deserve and need Jim's vomit and that for some reason, Jim needs and deserves yours.    I would suggest that the two of you sit down with each other and discuss your past experiences and behaviors, (...ones before you ever moved into the house...) and see if you can each identify what it is in you and your pasts that has contributed to the way that you look at and react to each other.      Again, it is becoming more and more obvious to all of us out here, that the two of you are precisely what the other needs.   Specifically, you might ask yourselves, why it is so hard for you to let go when you beleive someone has made a false statement about you.  I think that would be an appropriate starting point for your ""...sharing and caring..."" dialouge with each other.    Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Program Participant Rules  NO VIOLENCE OR THREATS:  I will not behave in a threatening or violent manner on the premises, or to any participant.     A member of our house newly into recover took it upon him self to invite a girl into this house without consulting the board or more importantly the house members as a group. At the previous weekly house meeting this procedure was discussed and agreed upon.   This young lady left several times during the evening dressed very indecently and finally returned early the next morning and was allowed by Mr. Scott to sleep on the floor inside the recover house residence.  She admitted to using crack cocaine and was associating with dubious people.  It is the responsibility of the house member to properly supervise his guest while at the recovery house.  He did not consider the other people in this house with respect to their feelings and the safe sobriety environment that we enjoy at recovery house.  He by allowing someone who was using drugs to stay or even be on the house grounds is inconsiderate and unacceptable.   I personally find it strange that so much thought has been given this young lady who is a active user and not Scott who has violated house procedures and rules.  Previously Scott allegedly spent a night with his friend outside this house and did not inform anyone that he wouldn’t be coming home, which is another violation of home procedures.  I also in my opinion think that there is much more to this story about Scott’s association with this girl that he is not telling us.  Some may say this is his personal life and it is his not our business but I contend that when his inappropriate behavior affects members of this house it becomes our business.  When a recovering person associates with an active drug user he or she places themselves in a dangerous position and possibility losing focus with respect to their own sobriety.  When one of our house members reacts in this way it is our responsibility to bring this issue to the surface and confront the individual in question about being honest and sympathetic."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"The Board has long discussed the issue of a house computer and porn. In the first Recovery House, the porn really got out of hand, especially when we had a heterosexually challenged member who persisted, despite our admonishments, to stop wasting all of the ink in the printer, downloading and printing out pictures of men.    It started out with pictures of WWF men, but like any addict the poor fellow spiralled into fully naked men doing nasty things to each other, and when we caught the fellow, naked with the door open, on top of his partially nude ""sponsor"" that was the last straw.    The last we heard, he was back in prison on a parole violation, which is really quite ironic, because considering the way prisons are, he will have an endless supply of drugs, as there is an endless supply of men who will compensate him gladly in exchange for his ""release services"".    Of course in having to ""address"" the issue at the house with him, he resorted to calling me a homophobe to which I responded that I would not accept that label coming from a sex addict.    But presumably our issue is this time around would be with those with an  oversupply of heterosexual libido.    I have proposed to the board the following methods of restraining the ever present, ever tempting pornography beast:    1.  we will install a block  2.  the computer will be located downstairs, near the front door for all to see  3.  the women's recovery house participants will have access to the first floor of the house  4.  if porn becomes a problem for someone, we will delete their logon password to the computer, for a period of time;  5.  we will have a lot of funny blogging commentary and in depth pyscoanalysis of anyone suspected of using the computer  to view porn    Shhhhhhwinnnggggg!    Chase"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"The basis of the rule was:    1. to get guys accustomed to sharing a phone;  2.  not have anyone running off with the phone to call 900 numbers;  3.  being able to find the phone - not having it locked in someones room.    The problem here is that we someone who is married and a parent, and I for one would rather they not expose the entire house to the dramatic moments of their relationship with their wife and children.  The house will always have more than enough drama.  We are also dealing with someone with a physical disability who is simply going to need more use of a telephone and contact with others via that telephone if he is going to develop the ties that normally bind us to the community.    Certainly something here can be negotiated so that we don't ""clog  our blog""  by having a recurrence of this issue?    Obviously many guys are going to go cellular, but the house phone is s necessary tool for the house and especially for guys coming into the house, until they stabilize financially and find themselves in need of a cellphone.    Certainly something here can be negotiated so that we don't ""clog  our blog""  by having a recurrence of this issue?       Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"You will now see the following slogan posted on the website.  I think it is appropriate.  If anyone wants a t-shirt, I can get the iron on paper to Jimmy and you can print them out and iron them on to any shirt.         RECOVERY HOUSE"
AXNX7FB,male,44,I just received a voice mail from John your youngest Recover House Member.  He called at 11:15 PM to inform us the he won’t be coming home tonight.  He informed me where is going to be tonight and everything is well.  Johns consideration and integrity is an example for all of us to consider following.      Thank You  John
AXNX7FB,male,44,"To whom this may concern-maybe my outlook on recovery or helping another suffering addict-male or female is different.  What this program has taught and FREELY given me is to reach out and help someone that has lost hope in a world that has people that clearly feel ""LITTLE you and BIG I"". No matter what the situation may be or what your addiction was i.e. the lady selling her body for drugs to the men that are called tricks that drive up and down the street that support their addiction, or the person who eats too much, the person who gambles too much, it's all addiction, sick behavior and wrong. And most of us live with these dark secrets that fester, but with God's Grace you've been able to obstain and realize that there is a better way of life. You have asked your Higher Power for help and work the 12 steps of recovery. You've changed your life and help other suffering people. You don't judge. You don't judge by the color of skin, how many times incarcerated, how many times molested when a child, or how short my skirt is.  You don't jusdge what is appropriate or not appropriate for me.  To accept people, places and things for what they are and no matter what that person does, as long as I've done the best of my ability and resources to help.  To do God's Will to help save someone's life and maybe make a difference, and after that the rest is up to them. Then I can sleep at night knowing I did my part."
AXNX7FB,male,44,Sorry I couldn't make the meeting. I took my kids home this afternoon and helped another addict with some personal things.  Was there any new business? Any resolutions for old business?  Why is noone posting on here? Does everyone have access?
AXNX7FB,male,44,In the AA program the term stinking thinking is often used.  This type of thinking can be thought of as irrational.  Irrational thinking can be a threat to continued recovery and therefore it should be brought to the attention of the individual.  As an example we have an individual who lives here and only has a few weeks of sobriety.  I noticed he doesn’t keep his door locked when he is not in the house.  I casually mentioned it to him and his response was why should I have nothing of value. I remember my first duty station in the service. When I arrived I needed to wash my socks and underwear. I then hung them in my room (didn’t have a key} to dry while I went to a movie. When I arrived back to my room someone made off with all my socks and underwear. The moral to this story is we all have things of value.  All other residents in Recovery House keep their room doors locked for palpable reasons.  His thinking is irrational because a rational thinking person would be concerned about this possibility and the other feelings of other residents if they were accused of theft.
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Indoor furniture cannot be outside on a porch.  It is ghetto and it is against code.  You might be able to get away with chairs, but with couches, someone will eventually file a complaint and Recovery House will get a big red sticker NOTICE TO ABATE and just like any crack house in the neighborhood.  We cannot go there.  We also have got to remove the grill from the front porch.  It can go on the back porch, but should be used only when off the porch, so as to not start a fire.  The back yard is closer to the kitchen anyway, so that is the place to grill.  Security:  the best security is having enough people so that someone is always around.    But you leave doors open often enough and you are eventually going to have a ""bird"" fly in.  It very well could have been me yesterday as Matt and I left at 11:00 am.  But I do not know that for a fact.  My intent is to shut the door always when I leave, but it is easy for a couple of people to get that responsibility mixed up when they are together.  We are now having too many people for anyone to be crashing on the couch.  As much time as I have spent there (and I am always DOING something when I am there) others of you have had a lot of down time there and more than enough time to finish a space, get your furniture moved downstairs and put together a real bed.   I did not go to all of the trouble to secure mattresses and lumber for beds, only to hear about a guys sleeping in a chair.  No more directory assistance or *69 calls.    I recall a circumstance in Springfield, where an Oxford House got on line, and did not realize with their business line at the house, they were being charged by the minute. They had a $1000.00 phone bill the next month.  That is a big hit for a house of six guys.  More on the Porch:  keep an eye out for suitable porch furniture.  Since the neighbor did their porch, we are going to have to do ours, so in the near future, you are going to be asked to scrape an paint, while you are on the porch to talk.  Chase"
AXNX7FB,male,44,I would like this opportunity to welcome Matt to this Recovery House information board and encourage him to post. In my opinion this is a place for productive information as well as constructive criticism.  We are fallible human beings and require input that will help us all to become better human beings.  I for one believe that this is serious business and I try my best to be constructive in my opinions.   Jimmy The Rat
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I hear everyone talking about the Big Book, and know what they are talking about. I feel as if my ignorance of the contents of this book leaves me feeling as if I am missing something. The glimpses of what is read in meetings is not enough. I need one of these books, especially now that I chair meetings at the wolff. What I am saying is that I need one of these books on tape, and the 12, and12 as well. Can anyone help, or at least give some ideas?"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"1.    Guests:   if you want to have a guest - plan ahead and bring it up at the Sunday meeting so that everyone can be given your polite consideration.  To spring a ""guest"" on your roommates - can be just plain inconsiderate and can create a lot of chaos in the house and in your life, that you and no-one else needs.   There is the easy way to do things and the hard way.  The way this was done this weekend, was the hard way.  Also:  the women's house is up and running.  Obviously, thzt is where femaile guests should go.   2. Fighting and Biting:    People will cause problems, be jerks and relapse.  So why are the people who stayed sober, at such odds against each other.  Your loyalty to and unity with, must be to the person who is remaining sober and that loyalty must be greater than any to any past friend or family member who is either not an appropriate person for you to live with, or who believes that you are not good enough to live with them.     Your ""real"" family is those people who live around you and who are showing you in daily interaction that despite all of their abnoxious character defects and insulting ways of treating you........that despite that, there is no excuse for their not remaining clean and sober, and that accordingly there is absolutely no reason that a far better person such as yourself (and each of you can assume that I am talking about you) cannot remain clean and sober also.   3.  Two on one can have some fun ........One on one is no fun at all.  THe prinicipal here is that you do not go out 12th Stepping alone.  Recovery is no good alone and helping other has a lot of hazzards when you do it alone.  Get a buddy, and/or the whole house involved and you will have a better outcome and a lot more fun.  Chaos is not fun to be involved in, but from a safe distance it can be fun to watch.   Kind of like a NASCAR wreck, or a Hockey Fight.   4.  Provisions:   get it set up to plug the new people into the food pantries, Share Food and link card if necessary.  It is on one hand, commendable that you all have been helping each and every knew person in every way that you can.  But we need to be showing them how to help themselves, as you all have other responsibilities and commitments may have a first claim on your limited time and resources.  Provisions also applies to the other than food basics that a person coming in from the mission might need.  I will be trying to get people more organized as far as helping the new guys to hit the ground running in regards to improvements around the house and preparing a room for themselves and the next guy.  I am just developing this, so it is a work in progress.   5.  Jobs:    you are all especially helping each other with transportation and this also deserves commendation.  It looks like all of the men are going to be working come Monday.  I know that the hardest situation for a man, is when he does not have a job and every day is a Saturday.  It is commendable that those of you who have been in this situtation have been patient, albeit obviously frustrated, but that you did not relapse or get pn other people about anything.  Good job  and this person is an excellent example of how to get through such frustrations.   For the addict, frustrations will often be a marathon where the goal is just to finish, rather than to set a world record as far as what we were able to accomplish on our down time.   6.  Heart in the right place  - mind still learning discretion is the better part of caring.   7.  Meetings:   get to more than one meeting a week.  90 in 90 is a suggested application of your commitment to the program and people in it.  Yes, that may be hard, but you need to do more than one meeting a week.  It will accelerate your recovery, make it easier for the people around you, and enable you to learn much wisdom which you may depart to your dysfunctional, controling parents.  Not that I know that anyone has controlling or dysfunctional parents.  Actually many of you are/were dysfunctional, controling parents yourselves and you exhibit those characteristic in the house all too frequently.   8.  Dining room table:   obviously a work in progress, but this week we made some progress.  Start beging for chairs.   9.  Officer Handing  is very aware of the two recovery houses in the neighborhood and is telling people that are out there about it.  She is especially concerned about the people who are strings of clean and sober days and weeks, while still being on the street or in other unfortunate situation, and she will be letting them know that we are available and interested in making a place for people who are willing to get on board.  Please stress to anyone that comes over to the house, that we are on a first name basis with K9 Katie and that she drops by frequently.   10. If you are going to be out after midnight , please call - or put in on the board, when we get one up.   11.  BENDING THE RULES:   The Recovery House Rules are there to protect you and enable you to get along with each other.  If we need flexibility or a bending of the rules, get a hold of me and let me make that call.   If you do it, you are going to be accountable to the people that live across the hall from you, and that SUCKS...for you!!    If I bend a rule for some reason, I take the heat, not you, so you can be having good times with the guy across the hall from you.   12.  Disrespect:    Disrespect is a nebulous, overused term.   Everyone of us as addicts and alcoholics is guilty of disrespect if not out and out dishonor to our families, friends, communities and most importantly, Disrespect to GOD, each and every time that we gave Him the finger and went our own way.   Keep that in perspective when someone is rude to you, or criticizes you.  If they are rude, it is not because they intended to ""dis"" you, it is probably just that they are self absorbed, or ignorant as to how their behavior looks to other people.  If they criticize you, it is because they respect you enough to think that you are a wise person who will listen to another person's opinion and strong enough to take it for what it is worth.  I'm sure that I have left something off here......Jim?  Oh yes.........as I have mentioned to a couple of you, Jim is going to be moving up to some digs that will better suit his Ham Radio reception and a new business venture.  Having been in Jim's situation before with several, just out of treatment recovery guys in my house at one time, I completely understand the stress of on one hand being responsible for what happens with the guys, but on the other hand trying to keep your hands off, even while guys are dragging you into their little chaotic dramas.   As in most cases like this, you will not know how much you will miss him, until he no longer there every morning and every night.   His departure with necessitate more involvement on my part and more structure and organization.   You will all have to step up, lead by example and learn how to tactfully confront people.      Jim:  Please print and post this on the refrigerator.  I need everyone to read it and discuss it until they are ready to move on to other topics.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"1.  Serious concern expressed by participants who showed up at meeting about those who did not.  Jim and I played devil's advocate on behalf of those who were not there, and I think that we did a better job of defending you than you would have done yourselves.   Hopefully you WILL attend the next House Meeting, WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM 5:00 PM  on Sunday evenings to HIGH NOON on SUNDAYS.   The change was made to better accomodate those who could not make it and thereby free up the rest of your sunday for various meetings and family activities.  Obviously there were parties at the 5:00 pm who were offended in that despite their inconvinience they respected everyone enough to show up.   CHASE's philosophy on the way to handle this is rather than seeking compliance/attendance at meetings with a stick (i.e. consequences) we might have a much better time of things if we simply rewarded those who do show up.   The method of doing that, will be to have a Sunday grill, right after the meeting.    It was also mentioned that if there is beef and brats on the barbeque, people are going to want to baste their beef, rather than beef and bitch at the meeting.    Said another way, people are less likely to want to waste time complaining about other people in the house and arguing when they are hungry and food is available.  2. Still some beefing about messes and garbage.   Also about hte sawdust.  The party responsible for the sawdust was ""Norm"" from this old house.  Please just take care of the dust and any mess that is ""Norms"" as ""Norm"" is a very busy person this last week designing bed frames.  3.  We will get an IN and OUT board.  THe idea is that you will mark the out as to when you will be back, so that people feel better knowing and that they can tell someone who calls or stops by the house without having to search the house and knock on all of the bathroom doors.  4.  We have a couple of guys that are interested in the house, so we need to finish up the floor and bath in the basement.  Stan did a good job Saturday and I will try to get the trailer there ASAP to load up the stuff that was cleaned out.  5.  I will check on the SHARE FOOD program and food pantries so that people who move in can stock up right away and get going on their job search.  6.  Remind me to order the Journal Star for the house - so as to help people look for jobs.  7.  THe computer table is in and the computer will be up shortly.  8.  The dryer needs a switch.  Jim may be able to test that, and the refrigerator thermostat at the gals house.  9.  The girls have RECOVERY HOUSE iron ons and T-shirts, so get with them and have a party.   Please wear the shirts as often as you can.  It lets people know we are there and what we are about.  10.  One last thing - sometimes people are just going to be slobs and we are going to have to accept that.  I had a guy (some of you know him) that came to stay with my wife and I when he got out of White Oaks.  He had a habit of eating for lunch, what my wife was readying for dinner, and then for dinner he would grill horrible smelling meat and leave the mess.  Of course he would then disappear (to meetings in the evening) before we could remind him to clean up his meaty mess.   Either we would have to smell that greasy mess all night, or we could clean it up. And of course there was the cups, plates and silverware that would disappear and be found in his room.....full of mold.      He stayed with us for the better part of 8 months, and I kid you not, we had a party the evening that he was to be on the bus and on his way to San Francisco.    Funny thing was, he missed his bus and was sitting in our kitchen, as I returned from the store with ice cream and a cake that said...........HE IS GONE!  Boy was he pissed........he stormed out of the house after taking 30 minutes to yell at me and he stayed down at 905 Madison that night.   Oh well, we had a good laugh, and I knew his little alcoholic mind would get quite a workout fuming on that 72 hour bus ride to San Francisco.  And yes - this guy has still periodically called to see how we are doing.  The point of all of this, is that it is a good thing to be like Stanley and just tolerate people for a while.  Don't worry about you setting them strait, as life will do that for you.  The Highest Power, says that Vengence is His, not ours, and that He will repay.   And believe me........He always does and in a far fairer and funnier manner than we could ever imagine.  Chase Ingersoll  and has done a lot for the h0use."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Rob,  The more that you write, the more that you prove that your an idiot. You offering your unprofessional psycho analysis based on the comments of others without researching the issue at hand, proves my theory entirely. Please forgive using the fact that I am using your attack on Jim to launch my own retaliation for the comments that you made against me in your previous post. What I am getting at is: Do a little bit of digging, talk to the person, or people that the issue is about. By doing so, you will be able to make some what of an educated decision. Therefore, making yourself look less like an ass.  To the rest of the blockers:  Please forgive me for coming aboard, and jumping right into an insult. I have been to at least two meetings as a resident of Peoria Recovery House. All known board members (except for Rob) were present, and all of these issues were discussed. I just thought that he needed to be checked and let him know that not only I, but the rest of all people who logs on the recovery house's website, knows that he does not have a clue."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I went today to pick up the vacuum and was 8 minutes late - the shop had closed.  I will stay on this and get it picked up and take it to 1016 at that time.       Jimmy G. says we are going to have a showing of the recovery movie called  ""MY NAME IS BILL W.""   This is set to happen over the 4th of July weekend.  Stay tuned to this fine channel for the exact day and time.  I will rent the movie from Blockbuster and make an attempt to be there. I'm not sure if I will be going up to Chicago over the weekend or not.    Matt and I have had a couple of conversations and he seems to be open minded and willing to learn.  I am impressed by his ability to at least mention that he can see the errors in his thinking in the recent past.    Jimmy G. seems to be doing an admirable job in the early going, even with some curve balls along the way.  He made a very nice analogy the other day.  He said that he sees the house as kind of a fraternity house without the alcohol / drugs.  I really look forward to seeing the comraderie develop as one can develop with fraternal brothers. This is truely working the 12th step and shows that this type of spirituality is the very backbone of our organization.  Nice job Jim - keep up the good work....and thanks for posting the thing on anger.   No one commented about the possibility of a cookout in the near future......does this mean - lack of interest, or is everone too busy? Check your social calendars and let's put one together!!   Side bar note to Chase - My former relative that you recently spoke with may need to get some help with a ""nose candy"" problem. I hated to hear that - seriously - I really respect him as a person.  Doug"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"You are looking at what you are doing and perhaps contrasting to the past.    I am looking at the possibilities and contrasting it to the ideal.       Being a smoker, absolutely undermines the moral authority that you have with kids and they will get to an age that if they do not throw that in your face, they will at least be thinking it.    Pornography:  your definition of porn and mine are two different things.  I am trying to get to a point in my life, where my sensitivity is that of my wife's, because she is much healthier and appropriate in that area than I am ........my wife will not allow even a underwear catalog in the house, much less a men's magazine like MAXUM.    It may be a loving atmosphere, but it is physically unhealthy and sends a mixed message.    Don't feel bad - my father was the same way.  He said that same thing that you are, and compared to our abusive mother, his messed up pit was better than being around her.  But now he is in recovery and is apologizing to his kids, for not getting that stuff out of his life sooner and having set a better example for them.    Online poker - there are people in the world who need help, there are motivational books that need to be read, there is a front porch to be cleaned up.  If a person had a father, he would come in and say, stop playing games until you have cleaned up your room.      It is just evidence that the person did not have appropriate structure and guidance as a child and is stuck in an adolescent lifestyle.    It is a step up from using, but it is not capitalizing on recovery and it does not allow him to challenge other people to go beyond the level and lifestyle that Bruce has achieved.    It is not okay with you if you do not attract a health concious woman.  THat is something that God wants all of his men to have, but God also wants His women and His Kids to have health concious guys who can provide for them.  And God allows us to face the consequences of the sort of dysfunctional people and relationships that we get into, if we are not constantly challengiung ourselves and others to improve.    ...MY life happens....That is an old attitude.      New attitude:  my life is going to happen and I am going to put in maximum effort to be an example and blessing to everyone in my life.  I am going to shed all bad habits and unhealthy characteristics by working on them daily and getting help when available so that I can be the most positive role model that I can be.    My wife and child get more time than most.  But they get that because I invested in hard work for many years, before I even knew them.  I began working on these issues many years ago before I knew them.    Interesting: while I was still engaged to another woman, there was this good recovery friend who was totally in love with the woman who is now my wife.  I told him point blank that it was just not going ot happen unless he quit smoking.  He tried anyway, but didn't even get to first base.  He thought he loved her, but he was not willing to give up a negative behavior in order to be able to spend more time with her.   THat was probably not the only potential relationship that he lost out on because he would not work on that addiction.    There were also some other addictive behaviors that were not so visible that he was not working on, and I have not seen him for more than 7 years.    IF you love your kids, you will not only want them to not have to go through the worst things that you went through, but you will also want them to look back and look at you as the prime example and motivator of everything that is good and healthy.      You cannot risk lung cancer 15 years from now and having to watch your little ones smoke cigarettes or anything else.   The socially acceptable (in some circles) behaviors of being around people who are smoking, drinking, gambling or oversexualizing, are the gateways to the harder drugs and more addictive forms of these behaviors.      A great guy is also a great guy for his wife and kids.  That's part of the definition.  THere is a balance of priorities in being there both in the family sense and in the professioanl and recovery sense.  There is a constance battle between my wife and time for 12 step calls which continually throw my schedule out of whack.  But she knows that the depth to which I can emotionally be there for her, was as a direct result of skills I developed in AA and helping other people and that she cannot isolate me in her world.    I don't expect you to agree with me in the next ten minutes.  The pattern I have observed is that you have to think about thinks for a day, sleep on it.  And that you will probably agree with me tomorrow.  Like the saying he who laughs last, laughs best, he who is right in the long run is the most right.  The point is that as a person in recovery it is always a good thing to practice delayed gratification, and having practiced that for many years, I am ready to wait a lot longer than tomorrow for you to agree with me.    Take as long as you like to agree with me.   Unitl you do, I will just allow myself to be amused by your contradictions.    HAHAHAHAHAHA  (evil laugh)    Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Better? Peoria Recovery House. Because being drunk, high, and disfunctional is no way to live life.  You must have been in your poop stained briefs again. Ha, ha.  Yes, Thanks to Jim, I am back on line, and better than ever....  I apoligize for my absense yesterday at the house meeting. Though it was thought that I was not at the house, I assure that I was here. I was sick in my room sleeping. I didn't go to church, or boating with my sponser as I origianally had planned.  I find myself wondering what the hell is going on around here. Last week it was the Matt, and Jim show. This week Scott? In the past I found that Jim often got carried away with his assumptions, and with the way he reacted, but is that the case this time?  Coming to the defense of the rat... What happened yesterday morning with the presence of physical aggression, I did not see obviously. However I heard it. No matter what the circumstances at no time is physical aggression understood, or tolerated. This is a major violation of the house rules, and should be taken seriously with respects in the current residency of the aggressor. One of the main goals of the recovery house is to provide a safe, clean, and sobor environment to all who resides here. Has this been violated? I guess that this is up to Jim who in this case was the one who was the intimidatee. Now, I do not know if this so called ""beef"" was quarshed yesterday or not, maybe you could answer that Chase, but from what I heard today, it has not been. It seems as if Scott keeps pushing the issue.  I totally understand wanting to help out a fellow addict despite the gender of that addict, but one thing needs to be taken into consideration. The addict that Scott is wanting to ""help"" is still using. I was told that Chase distributed a hard copy of the New, and improved rules yesterday in the house meeting. If they are the same rules that I was sent via e- mail then Scott violated these rules not even 24 hours after they were handed out, and posted. At no point in time is a person activly usingg allowed to be in this house, or on this property. Guess who was here today?  This is blatent disregard for the rules of the house. What Scott is not seeing is that he is not just enableing his friend, but possibly setting himself, and other house members up for relapse, and a possible much deeper consequenses.  I like Scott, but I wonder what is really going on between his ears. THe Scott that we knew, and the Scott that has been the last couple of days is not the same guy."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Welcome aboard Matt!!!  I knew you would really jump into it with both feet so to speak!  I think I have to agree with Jimmy the Rat when he said we need to keep things on a positive note though.  This means you too Chase / Rob etcetera.  I think we can learn a few things from the late Dr. Norman Vincent Peale who wrote ""The Power of Positive Thinking"". Let's take this a step further to the power of positive living. We live positively and people around us see this and react positively towards us.......try it - it's amazing.  I've noticed that people around the AA community are noticing the Recovery House and by our successes we will continue to grow. Conversely, by our setbacks we will fail.  Lets continue to communicate as board members, residents (future board members) and others.  The more feedback we have from others, the better the future decisions will be.  I would even like to hear from folks who read this blog who are not on the board or a resident.   Jim F. has some good views and I have asked him to get on. If I know Chase, I am sure he has invited others to read this BLOG.  Lets hear some comments!  Doug"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Much of what you say is true.  Having  achieved long term recovery, you have had much more time and trial to work on these things.  Most people aren't going to be receptive to some of the expectations you place on them. Often times, people find themselves doing the best they can given the current situation, only to feel that it is their fault that the plans given them just don't work.     I believe what we have to remember is that what works for me, might get someone else high. We have to let people acquire their recovery as THEY get it, not as I give it. Someone not meeting our expectations does not necessarily mean they are ""not ready"". Some of us have a lifetime of issues and self defeat to work through, other than a sad story about our families. Some have been neglected, abused, beaten, any number of things.     Recovery cannot be force-fed, nor can one produce consequences when expectations arent met. That is God's job, not ours. We are not supposed to choose who and why we want to help, we are just supposed to help. That might mean me realizing that the plan I have asked someone to follow didn't work, and I need to accept responsibility for that, not tell others how much of a slacker they are.     Me, I think about quitting smoking a lot. I'm just not there yet.  I will get there, though.      It's also possible that some try to do more than they are capable of doing. Passive - Agressively, as addicts, we typically commit to everything and get little done. Not to point fingers, but I know where there's a basement floor not ready, a bathroom floor not ready, a recovery house not finished, a personal home not finished........, wait I suddenly thought of another typical addict behavior; starting much and finishing little. I believe the Big Book talks about us wanting the world to judge us based on our intentions, not our actions, or something like that.      Truly, I have many defects and unhealthy behaviors. You should have seen them about 3 years ago. I am working on them, at least trying to own my own shit, which some refuse to even admit they have.     Grudgingly, Slowly  becoming agreeable."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"So Matt is hollering at Jim this morning for not hooking up DSL for Matt. My how quickly the Needy fall from Grateful to Grumpy.  My suggestion is the application of the Silent Treatment.  Essentially, Jim and everyone else, have nothing to say to Matt, until Matt starts going to meetings EVERY DAY.  Listen:  this guy is blind.  We should be running circles around him, not allowing him to blow chaos at us at 200 mph.  And Jim - if you would not talk so loud, Matt would have no way of knowing whether or not you are there.  If we wanted to have a little fun with the kid, we could tell him that as a result of his berating you [Jim] Jim has moved out.  Then I could come down for a chat with Matt, and have the rest of you sneak into the house and watch the way that I ""chat"" with Matt.  Then, once he is all contrite and saying how sorry he is, I can let him know thzt the rest of you are in the room.  My best friend from Grad School, was confined to a wheelchair with Cerebral Palsy.  He was a fine example of how it is human nature will go out of their way to help a disabled person who is polite and grateful for any assistance.  The problem with Matt is that we have to keep in mind that he was a severe addict, long before he became blind, so this is only going to work if we approach him as an addict first, and a person with a disability second.  Chase Ingersoll"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"If Doug has to put his crossword puzzle down one more time..........just kidding Doug.  He makes a good point about the aggression. If one is willing to intimidate a 60 year old man, that could be a problem.  Likely, Scott sees his behavior as wrong, and reacted in anger when it was pointed out to him, like most of us used to react with regularity. Self centeredness is the core of our disease. Can you step out of yours for a moment, Scott, and admit you were wrong? You mentioned what the program has taught you. Unless you practice selective learning, surely you would have at least heard something along the lines of admitting our wrongs and making amends.  I think we should back off the ""isn't this amusing to watch"" message, because it's not. Peoples lives are at stake. This is not what is meant by having fun in recovery. Spending our lives feeling good about ourselves at the expense of others should be an old behavior, not an encouraged new one.  I don't recall it being amusing to the homeowner when anger outbursts occurred at 501 Armstrong, nor should they be at 1016 Madison. If threatening behavior is fun to watch, how thrilling it will be when someone has a black eye. This isn't a reality show, or a video game that we can shut off when we're safe at home.  Let's also not go serious sam, on the other end of the spectrum, but let's at least not voice our amusement at those we are supposed to be helping, they likely don't see the humor in the situation when they are in these behaviors, it will, though be a catalyst for rage, if we aren't careful and mindful of others' positions."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"This is not a racetrack or a courtroom where you play with peoples lives, nor a classroom or university with a professor or professional teacher.  This is something that you don't learn by WATCHING.  Giving an example- me, personally, I would rather have a person or sounselor who has actually been where I've been and shared some of life's ups and downs, bad choices and situations and had little or no direction.  WAKE UP AND OPEN YOUR EYES  This same person that was in our house is th same people that are outside of our house and across the street, next  door, in the house, at the meetings-our mothers, sisters, daughters, brothers, sons, aunts, wifes and friends.  What kind of message are we really sending in the street about our so called reovery house, and that our primary purpose is to carry the message to the addict who is still suffering. 1016 NE Madison-IN THE HOOD- is a joke. Also-how is it that a police canine 'Katie' is fiven the okay to let people know and refer them off the streets.  Will we turn our backs on them? They will be selfish, using, manipulative liers--too sick for us better people???? I think not.  One more thing, the question was asked of me why didn't we call women in recovery, that are working a decent program (yes Chase-there are some!) to help deal with this female. Well, WATCHING for 13 years I guess you didn't see that one.  Something to think about.  My objective is to refocus on my recovery and to apologize to all regarding this incident. I would like to thank you guys for you insight, suggestions, comments and I will strongly look at myself.  That's what this program has taught me-progress not perfection.  I wish  I had the time and access to a computer but life goes on. I will continue doing the footwork to improve my life and I thank you all again for your support.  Kisses to All!!!!    LOL"

Graham left the Peoria Public Housing for the Warden's position mid- April of 04 in the Peoria Adult Transition Center, believe me, I know first hand that he means business.

AXNX7FB,male,44,A.	Anger comes from our beliefs and these beliefs can      fuel intense anger. B.	Most of these beliefs are irrational . C.	Anger can be a good thing if it is vented properly     .  Irrational Belief:  Some people are just bad. Rational Belief:   Who an I to judge a person as good or bad when I don’t have a full picture of his life here on earth. Do I just assume since he has done bad things that he hasn’t done good things. It is obvious that some people are worse then others. How much worse are they then the other person. How can it be proven that they are bad. There must be some good in them. Am I to assume that everything he has done in is life is bad? I simply don’t have enough information to support this belief. If a person is doing good things at that instant in time he can’t be doing bad things 1.	(Irrational) He should have not done this to me. (Rational) What he did was a pain however it’s not a life or death situation. 2.	(Irrational):  Others should act like I want them to.

AXNX7FB,male,44,"Matt was seen late night with a........woman? Someone call Ken Starr. Good to hear Matt is doing well. Jimmy G. is doing a nice job dealing with issues that arise, nice work Jimmy. A cookout sounds good, lets get as many people involved as possible when we get a date set. Addicts will usually turn up for free food. Some may even bring something. Maybe some kind of speaker function could be set up?   The first recovery house was Delta House without the booze, well, usually. Having Jim there should help with the overall feel of the house. Hopefully there won't be any strip club group outings or porn fiestas on the computer."
GM24J1X,female,17,"After school today I told my mom that I had watched The Exorcist. She was actually ok with it.  At first she seemed a little mad, but then we talked about that and related things and she said she was fine with it. That is good then....haha."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a fun day! I spent it with Amanda and Alex. We were going to go to the mall because Amanda wanted to look for bed frames and bathing suits. Well on the way to the mall I decided to show Amanda and Alex where I used to live in Lake Oswego. I showed them my house, and then I decided to see if my old friend Mika was home (we used to be neighbors). She was, so I got to see her for a bit. It was nice because I haven't seen her in quite awhile. I think it has been a little more than a year. We are going to try to do something on Wednesday. So anyway....we go to the mall. Well along the line somewhere, Amanda's plan of finding a bed frame got lost. So me and Alex just follow her around while she looks for bathing suits. It was fun. We did some weird things, and took some weird pictures, but it was all really fun. Even Amanda said she had a good time, and needs to take the both of us again. After that, I decided to go get some black licorice ice cream with Alex. That was fun too. After the ice cream we were walking home, and we decide that we want to watch a movie. We want to watch one that Amanda owns, so we call her, and Amanda says she'll come pick us up. Me and Alex, being the bright ones, decide that it would be funny if we just sat down on the sidewalk and waited. Of course we embarassed ourselves, but it was all in the name of fun. So we go to Alex's house, and watch the movie. Then after the movie, we decide to go through the field and take the sign that says ""Be prepared to stop"", which we've had our eyes on for awhile. It was dark, so it was the perfect time to take it. On our way there, we heard something in the grass, and it scared me, and I jumped behind Alex and grabbed onto her. It was so funny. Well, after we got the sign and were out of visibility we just kept laughing and Alex fell. It was so freakin funny! We decided to put the sign in the fort, and going in there when it was dark was way scary. It was really fun tho. Then after that, I went back to Alex's house for about 20 min, and then went home. Today was a really fun day!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I was just talking to Josh, and he was telling me that he observed a blogging trend that I have. He said that generally on ""fun"" days, I blog before 10 and on ""boring"" days, I blog after 10. That boy has too much time on his hands....well better time on his hands than something else. I dunno. I'm in a weird mood kinda. I talked to Alex today for a bit, and that was nice. She should be back tomorrow, and that is even more nice. I dunno. Haha. Today me and Amanda went to Hi-School Pharmacy for a bit, and to Subway. That was really the only thing that I did. The rest of the day was boring. Oh well. Hopefully tomorrow will be better."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I haven't been up to too much lately. On Monday I hung out with Alex and Amanda for a bit. We watched the first two installments of ""I love the 90s"". Today Amanda came over, and we watched the second two installments....haha. Logan lost his very first tooth today! I was so happy. Not much else has been going on. Tomorrow Marty is coming over, and that's about all I have planned. Sometimes my life can be really uneventful....oh well."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I'm on a search...for a new perfume. Since I'm running low on all of my favorites, I have decided to pick up a new one. Yep...I'm just that cool. Tonight was a little eventful. I cried for awhile cuz of an ""event"" that took place between me and Marty. Everything is ok now, and that makes me beyond happy. Hmm...not too much else has been going on. I'll blog later within the next couple of days because I'm sure I'll have more to talk about when that time comes. Why? I dunno."
GM24J1X,female,17,"My laugh    i   s getting messed up. T   h   ere are maybe like 3 people who read this, and one of them is watching me as I type right now. Th   a   t is right....you know who you are!!! Today Holli and Alex came over and we hung ou   t   . We rode bikes down to Amanda's house. Amanda is in Utah. Utah is a state. Holli is jaded, according to Al   e   x. MOMMY, WHEN WILL DINNER BE READY? The answer....PRETTY SOON. Chloe embarrassed herself today. She    j   iggled her boobs as she walked into the computer room, and she saw Alex. I suppose she forgot that Alex was here. Alex is a freak! She ate all the flavors    o   f the nasty Harry Potter jelly beans....without even flinching! Me, on the other hand, had a vomit one, and I almo   s   t did just that. It was gross. Hmm...well t   h   at is about it for now."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Wow...I just realized that there are only 13 days until prom. I still have a lot to do. I don't understand why prom is such a big deal. Society has made it into a huge event with the glorification of prom in movies. Many teen movies involve prom. Why is that? It is just a dance...a ""special"" dance. What makes it so special? I don't really get it, but I'm not sure I care enough to get it in the first place. Sure, I'm excited for it and what not, but I just don't understand all the hype. Whatever."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I am sick of school. I'm almost at the point where I could care less if I didn't get straight A's.  I don't know, maybe it has something to do with the fact that school is winding down.  I am just tired of working hard and still not getting everything. It sucks. And next year is going to be even harder. I don't want to take calc 2, but I think my mom is going to make me. She is set on having me become valedictorian because she says she knows I want it. Yeah, I want it, but if I don't get it, then I will be ok. I just dont want to dissapoint her and my dad. But I also don't want to have an extremely hard senior year. Who honestly wants that? I don't know, I just need to talk to my parents and tell them how I'm feeling, because nothing is going to get resolved until I am honest with them. I'm in computer class right now...free days suck. Tommy is making me mad because he keeps looking up racist jokes. He thinks they are the funniest things....it's disgusting. I tried to give Martin the DVD today at break, but that didn't work out. Oh well, I tried to find him, then I quit. So then I put the DVD back into my locker, and then of course I find him. Yeah, I was too lazy to go back to my locker and get it, so I just didn't deal with it. Nice, huh? Oh well, it's not a big deal. I better not have that much homework tonight. The only homework I might have would be psychology or physics. I have physics homework that I should be doing right now, but I just don't feel like it. Damn, I so used to not be like this. What is happening to me? haha. No, it's not that important. I'll just lie to Mrs. Briley and tell her I was unable to finish it due to ""family issues"" and if she asks me to explain further, I'll look all sad, and be like ""do I have to?"" It works pretty good...I haven't used it in awhile tho. I might have to break it out today. I don't know if it's sad or not that I don't care if I lie to a teacher so I won't get in trouble. I know some people (Holli) would never do that because they would feel too guilty. Am I supposed to feel guilty? Do I have a cold heart? Am I asking too many questions that will never get answered? Yeah, I thought so too. Today is Monday...hmm...the last time I talked to Josh, I believe it was Thursday. Wow! That's a record! I don't know why I felt the need to state that. It's not like it's a thing where I have to talk to him all the time or I'll freak out. I only worry...haha. I suppose if I REALLY wanted to talk to him, I could always call him...I dunno. I've never been big on calling guys. (haha...Alex--I always make you call them whenever there is a situation in which I would need to call a guy....did that make sense?) Whoa...the weirdest feeling just came over me. I want to cry, but I don't know why. It's weird...hmmm....I'm highly confused over my state of mind right now. I want to cry....but why? Haha. That makes me sound like I am going crazy or something. I'm not. I've been typing a lot on this blog entry...I must be REALLY bored. WE still have like 20 minutes left of class....geez! I guess I won't be doing my physics work. I need to stop with this procrastinating....it's getting really old, fast. Now, I just really want to go home, and end the school day. I'm just not in the mood to be here right now. I'm not in a bad mood tho. I just don't want to be at school, that's all. Wow, to whoever reads this (prolly just Alex and Josh...haha), I am sorry for the extreme length of this boring entry. I think this is a good time to be ending this....so I shall do that just now."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Tonight was awesome and weird all at the same time.  Ok, I thought it was going to just be another boring night but then Amanda gave me a call.  She was bored, so I told her to come on over. Well, turns out that today was the day she could LEGALLY drive ppl around, so we decided to go out for a bit. In order for it to be ok with my parents we said we'd just drive around town. Amanda's parents actually wanted her to get some errands ran, so we did that. Then when that was done we decided to just drive around...well we went up into some roads that we didn't know very well and were just driving around listening to music. It was really fun but Amanda was a little nervous since she didn't really know the roads that well and cuz it was dark. Also, it didnt help much that I was talking about serial killers and rapists. We decided to go back into town, cuz Amanda wanted to get something to eat. So we went to mcdonalds and we decided that she would eat in front of our friend Alex's house. So we go to Alex's and Amanda is eating her food when she notices that Ethan's car is in the driveway. We start laughing and wondering why it's there. Being the brilliant ppl we are, we decided to tap on Alex's bedroom window, so we do that and then we run and hide. Well Alex and Ethan come outside and Ethan starts pretending that he's mad (well he was acting like he was mad, but me and amanda kinda thought he was joking but not...so we arent really sure). Then it gets kinda weird, cuz its just the 4 of us standing in alex's driveway. Me and amanda felt really weird, so we decided to leave.  When we got into the car and drove away we decided that was a really stupid idea. Ya live, ya learn. Omgsh...at the store I saw Jory! I am like in love with him! He is way hot! But anyways...that was basically my night. Oh, when we got back to my house I showed Amanda my permit, and she was in shock. good times. Dammit, my mom is nosy. She just came into the computer room, and started reading this. Good thing the part about me and amanda joyriding wasnt visible. She would have had a cow right then and there! Freakin A! That's it. Bada-bing, Bada-boom!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Stand By Me by Ben E. King is a great song. It's in the movie Stand By Me as well. How appropriate. Today was an OK day. I had a strange experience with my old stalker Brian and one of his friends. They were staring at me through the door while I was in class. I turned around and saw them, and they were just focused on me, and they waved. It was freaky. I bombed a math quiz. That sucks. I have homework I should be doing soon. Ick. I need to stop slacking off."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I just woke up, so I decided to blog. I didn't go to bed until 3 in the morning. haha. It was because I was talking to Marty on the phone. Today I have a dentist appointment at 3:40. In a weird twisted way, I like going to the dentist. Later tonight, around 6, I'll be going to Holli's house with Amanda and Alex. We're gonna watch movies. It should be fun. When I get home I might blog, if anything funny happens. I make no guarantees, however."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was an interesting day. I helped put banners up for Key Club from 9:30 until 1 today. Alex and I worked with this older guy named Ken, and he was kinda creepy. He touched Alex's leg...hehe. After that I did nothing really. Then around 6, Alex stopped by for about a half hour. We talked about some stuff, and shared some weird laughs.  As I'm blogging right now, I am talking to Alex and we are gonna watch a movie together. I'm gonna go to her house now...so I'll blog tomorrow maybe."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was pretty boring. Did nothing really. Talked to Josh on the phone for a bit, and Holli. Experimented with various hair and make-up looks for prom. Still haven't found a winner. Gosh, my eyes really burn and are watering! I think it was from all the eye make-up. Oh well. That was my day. Later."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a boring day. Hmm....nothing much happened. Went to school, came home, did homework. The usual. Oh, prom pics came today. I think mine looks ok, nothing too exciting. Hmm....that is really about it...today was pretty boring, but still good."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Kind of a lot has happened since Friday. Since Alex was with me for pretty much all of it, I don't feel the need to go into detail. Hmm..I'll blog about today tho. It was a half day, so after school I was bored and called Amanda to ask if I could come over and clean. So I did that for awhile, and then I showed her the ""fort"" in the field. We met Alex there, because Amanda dropped us off at the middle school so me and alex could walk home with chloe. so we walk chloe home and along the way we show her the ""fort"". then we ran in the tall grass. haha. it was fun. then alex came back to my house where we made a list and some visuals for my mom to persuade her into letting me have an all night movie night tomorrow. then we played some james bond on nintendo. we felt like boys, but it was fun. so tomorrow night we're gonna try to have some ppl spend the night and watch movies. it should be fun. i'll talk more when more happens. haha."
GM24J1X,female,17,"My title is a quote from my psychology teacher Ms. Earle. We were discussing in class today how steroids affects penis size. I don't know what prompted her to say that, but she did and it was really funny. Today was a pretty good day. I talked to Martin online for about 4 hours. I am going to go to his house tomorrow to hang out. That should be fun, well I hope at least. I'll have something to do then anyways.  Hmm....what else? Oh, today it was somewhat odd in physics. I don't know, maybe because of what happened yesterday with me and Matt. haha. Sometimes I just do not think! Oh well, it wasn't that weird. It was kind of funny...until Ryan, Theran, and Luther were making some comments. And then I think they told Griffin. Oh well...nothing I can do about it. That's what I get for not thinking things through all the way.  Hmm....there is really nothing else to blog about...so I'm done for tonight."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Content (satisfied) and content (subject matter of a written work)....two words, but spelled the same. Crazy! Anyway, now that my stupid ol' observation of the day is done and over with, I can continue my path of enlightenment.....i mean blogging. I dunno, obviously I'm in an odd mood right now. WAIT! when am i not in an odd mood? haha. Before I continue any further, however, I would like to formally state that the clay aiken kid's name is Kurt, not Kirk. my bad. I was close enough....whatever. today was anything but boring. it was unboring. i dunno if unboring is even a word. i will make it a word. i yelled at/talked with ryan today...yeah, i'm really not sure how things are gonna be. whatever. hmm....i was totally in a blogging mode, and full of stuff to say, but then josh had to call and disrupt it! geez, thanks josh! freakin a! ok, im over it now. haha. anyways, back to my day. hmm...a few days ago tommy asked me to come to his house and watch movies with him, and i totally shot him down, but because i thought he was joking. well, he wasnt joking, and asked me again today...i kinda avoided the situation. haha. in physics i was hitting on sam, that was fun. i dont know if he is used to having girls hit on him. hopefully 'operation make sam my friend' will work. haha. i'm not too sure yet. well, that was pretty much my day. on to doing homework/procrastinating!"
GM24J1X,female,17,Today was a boring day. I saw my mom fall off the treadmill when my dad turned it on super high speed. It was great. I found Jory's email address...even greater. Oh yeah!
GM24J1X,female,17,"Lately, I haven't been up to too much. Yesterday was the 4th of July, but I wouldn't have been able to tell by the way I celebrated (or didn't). To make a long boring story short, Anna and I decided to go see the Notebook and Stepford Wives. The Notebook was good. It made us cry. After that movie was over, we had about 15 min to spare, so we decided to go to Burgerville to get some food because we were hungry. We really didn't have time to eat, so we decided to sneak the food in when we watched Stepford Wives. It was a little weird eating in the movie theater like that, but it was fun. Stepford Wives was an ok movie. I had thought it would have been better, but oh well. Then after the movies we went back to Anna's apartment and I spent the night. So that was my exciting 4th of July celebration. Today Amanda came over for a bit and we hung out. I might do something with Alex later, but at this time I'm not too sure. I haven't talked to Marty since Friday because he is on vacation, and I didn't expect to miss him as much as I do. I'm used to talking to him everyday, and I don't like not being able to. Oh well, I'll manage. Hmmm...well I think I'll be going now, because I don't feel like being on the computer."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Last night was prom, and I had a good time.  I was so happy, they played my favorite love song of all time! Score! I dunno, as much fun as I had, it kind of felt like something was missing. Dammit, I hate the feeling of emptiness and not knowing why I have it. Don't get me wrong, I still had a really good time tho. The limo ride was funny. On the way there, I sat between Ben and Ryan. When the limo did certain turns or something, I would kind of slide towards Ben. It was funny. On the way back, I sat between Scott and Ryan, and I would slide towards Scott. It was funny to me anyways. I dunno. Amanda and Holli kept joking around that I was hitting on their dates. At least I think they were joking. haha. I'm not sure. I wasn't hitting on their dates tho. So, I'm pretty sure that they were joking. Geez! This is so confusing. The more I think back to prom, the more I can't get over the fact of my empty feeling. I think it has something to do with the fact that I went with Ryan. Ryan is a great guy, but I kind of wished that I went with someone I liked. There were a lot of couples there, and it made me realize that I would love to have a boyfriend....but I'm just not ready for one. I've only really been able to picture myself with one guy, and of course that is the one guy I can't have. Why do things like that always happen to me? Oh well, eventually I know things will have to go my way for once....I hope. I still had a good time at prom tho, so that's good I suppose. Well, that's about it...."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I'm in computer class right now, and it is so incredibly boring. I've been awake for a little more than 5 hours. Stupid spring break, it always messes me up. I'm used to waking up at 10 now, so I have to re-adjust. Waking up at 5:30 REALLY makes the day seem longer. I just can't wait to get home! Then I can just relax...well, if I have no homework. In math today we had a sub, so I didn't do the assignment. Then again I think the majority of our 13 person class didn't do it either, so that's good. I prolly won't worry about it. Kroese is pretty laid back when it comes to things like that. That reminds me...OPERATION TOAST! Oh yeah, that will be fun. It will spice up math class a little bit. hehe. toast. I think we're gonna do that friday, but I'm not sure. I'll have to check back with Erin and Vetta. The brilliant plans I come up with. Me and Erin decided that this week will be SEXPRESSION week. hehe. We always have weeks, but I think that this one will be fun. It's an excuse for our everyday pervertedness. All is well, all is well. Good times in the wagon! (I dunno, Alex once said that...) Yay! I've wasted maybe 10 minutes. Ugh! I think Im gonna talk to my mom today about seeing Josh, cuz that needs to happen soon! I am excited for it. Oh, I found it really funny when I went to go tell Amanda. I was like 'Amanda, I have something to tell you!' and she was like 'What? Are you and Josh going out?' It was really funny. So that made it a lot easier since she guessed it. I dunno. Well I think i've written enough about really nothing, so I shall be going! Away I go! (I really honestly do not know....haha)"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today I saw the movie Dodgeball with Holli. That movie is very interesting to say the least. There were some disturbing parts (pizza, anyone?), and some parts that were very funny too (if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball). Other than that, my day was very boring."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I've decided that I really want to go golfing. I also want to be good at it.  Today was a somewhat uneventful day. Oh well. Didn't do too much. Apparently Tommy's mom said Tommy should ask me out. Let me explain...Ok, Tommy made a quote list for me. Well yesterday he showed his mom the quotes, and his mom told him that he should ask me out because I seem nice and funny. I didn't believe Tommy, but then he promised me it was true, and even told me I could ask Bobby about it. I decided not to ask Bobby, but to just believe Tommy. I just find that funny. Nothing else exciting happened today. It was an average Tuesday. Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ok, the title is from the song With You by Jessica Simpson. Anyways, today was a pretty good day. I actually had plans! Score! Finished up the prom shopping. Got my shoes, handbag, necklace, earrings, hair accessories, and strapless bra (can't forget that!).  I'm excited about prom. It should be fun. After shopping, I called up Alex so we could ""investigate"" this field between our houses.  We just decided to walk and meet up with each other. So we did that, and then we decided to walk to Amanda's house and wait for her until she got back from work. Well, we had a lot of time to kill, so we walked all around Big Meadow waiting for Amanda. Amanda got home and so me and Alex hung out with her for a bit inside her room. Then we decided to walk some more. We went to my house so I could show them the rest of the things I got for prom. Then we walked back to Amanda's house, and from there Amanda drove me and Alex home. Yeah, didn't really make much sense, but it was still fun. Anyways...for a good portion of the day I noticed myself thinking about a certain person. It's pretty weird, because I dont even know why I'm thinking about this person. It kind of confuses me, but oh well. Hopefully it's just a phase and will pass on along soon enough. I dont like not knowing why I'm thinking of people. It kinda messes with me. Well, that was pretty much my day. Adios!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I spent the day at Amanda's house. We just hung out and had fun. Also, we shared some good laughs. She apparently thought it was really funny when I was looking at Midnight, her cat, and asked why the other cat wasn't named Noon. I think I make Amanda laugh a lot, but that is good. Today was fun."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I just watched Office Space, and my title was my favorite quote from the movie. Don't know what I liked about it so much, but yeah. I think everyone needs to see that movie."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was Easter, and it was another boring day. This whole weekend was uneventful. Oh well. I'm gonna join Alex's family soon, if mine continues to be boring and do nothing! haha. It's ok tho, cuz it was Alex's idea. That way, also, her red hair wont stand out so much. I dunno. Me and Alex come up with strange plans..."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a good day. I went to the Rose Festival, and that was fun. After that I hung out with Vetta for a bit. We went to Tommy and Bobby's house. We started watching the movie Miracle, but it was boring, so we stopped. We didn't do much else. That was pretty much my day. Oh...quote of the day: Never trust a Carnie."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I love Rooney. I swear their song Daisy Duke is about rape tho. Oh well, I'm dirty minded...My title reminds me of a book I once read. I forget what it's called, but it was about this black rain that made people want to kill each other and have sex or something. Maybe I'm imagining the ""having sex"" part. But anyways, in the book a girl gets raped in a bathtub. And then this couple has sex in a restaurant bathroom against the door or something. Oh well, that isn't important. It was a weird book. Oh, and this guy was at a gas station when the rain was falling, and he stuck the gas nozzel down this persons throat and poured gas into them. I then think he lit the person on fire, but I'm not too sure. I read it in like 7th grade. Oh, I think it was called Black Rain. I could be wrong...dammit, I went off on a tangent. I had a reason to blog, and it wasn't about some messed up book I read. Anyways...I sent Josh an email trying to tell him what I thought of our ""situation"". Basically, the ball's in his court and I'm fine with that. Whatever happens, happens. All I can do is wait to see what it is that will happen...whether it be nothing or something. I dunno. Well, that's it for now from me. Peave! (Don't ask, it's an Amanda thing)"
GM24J1X,female,17,Yesterday I stayed in bed because I was sick! It wasn't very fun! Oh well. My day wasn't that eventful. So I really have nothing to blog about. Hmm...I guess I'll blog later when I have more to talk about.
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today I didn't do much. Lets see...I woke up to my mom throwing the phone on my bed saying Josh and Holli called. I decided to call Josh back first, so I did that only after about 3 minutes of being awake. We talked for awhile, and then I proceeded with my day. The day was very uneventful. I talked to Marty for a bit, and I'm pretty positive that things will be ok. I worked on my essay for school. Tomorrow I will be finishing some of it up, while also continuing with the rest of my homework. At about 8:30, Tommy called me and asked if I wanted to come over to his house and watch a movie. Having nothing else to do, I figured that it was ok. So I went over there for a little bit, and we watched a movie, and he tried to teach me again to play chess. He had tried once before, without success, and this time was no different. I just don't understand it! Oh well. So to summarize this whole stupid blog...today=boring...tonight=somewhat eventful."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a pretty good day. I went to Marty's house. We watched House on Haunted Hill. Ok, that movie is so retarded. However, it taught us that in tough situations, the ghost of Chris Kattan will save you. Don't ask. Haha. Oh, and I FINALLY figured out what Marty's GPA was! I was proud of myself! I don't really know why I would be proud, but yeah. Haha. Hmmm....not too much else happened today really. Oh, Jory was at the high school, and I didn't even go to see him! What is that?!?! Ugh! Oh well, I really don't care that much. Hmm....that was really about it for my day. Overall, I think I had a really good day!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yeah, I've already created my blog for the day....well actually it was a good enough size to be for several days--but anyways. I just wanted to state that I noticed I mention Alex somewhat frequently in my blog. By creating this announcement, I am mentioning her even more. I prolly just mention her frequently cuz she actually reads it. Alex, this post was devoted entirely to you! Yay!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a pretty eventful day. Let me see if I can remember everything. Ok, well it started out that me and alex were going to go look around the garage sales in big meadow. well we got distracted from that and decided to do other stuff. we walked around big meadow, and into the section where they are building new houses. we went into one and took a picture of ourselves in front of the fireplace. why? we dont know. then as we were walking back to my house, i took a picture of someone's house, and me and alex plan on anonymously sending it to amanda. haha. good stuff. so then we went back to my house, and we got some soda and went back to the field. wow...i just realized that i am describing all of this in detail when in reality only about 3 ppl read this, and one of them is alex. oh well. so then after the field we decided to go to subway. so we go to subway, and then after we go to ricky d's to get some ice cream. we got the licorice ice cream, which made our mouths turn a deep shade of green. it was awful. so then we went to the park, and then the library. we left some notes in random books. it was embarassing when we first walked in because tommy's mom was there, and she saw my mouth, and she was like 'licorice ice cream?'. i suppose it was kind of funny too. then we were walking back to my house, and we came across this HUGE pile of rock and dirt, so we decided to climb it. on my way down, i tripped and i slid down the pile. it hurt, but it was so funny too. i'm such a klutz. throughout the whole afternoon me and alex took various pictures. it will be interesting when we get them back. haha. well that was my day up until now, and i doubt it will get anymore exciting."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a good day. I went to Marty's house, and we watched a movie and just hung out. I had a good time. When I got home, Amanda came over to apologize to my parents about last night. I feel so bad for her, because she is so hard on herself. Amanda handles things in a very adult way, and I admire that about her. Hopefully she'll be better soon, because it hurt my heart to see her cry today. Well, other than that, my day was average."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a fairly boring day. Stayed home and watched Chloe while my parents helped Anna move. Talked on the phone to Josh, Martin (like 4 times), Alex, and Amanda. Then I went to the apartment to help unpack, and Amanda came and joined in. Anna gave us the task of helping to record a message for her answering machine. Me and Amanda came up with some weird ideas, but in the end Anna just kept it simple. Oh well. Hopefully tomorrow will be more exciting."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Good ol' 80s lyrics. I dunno. Tommy never called on Friday night, but that is really ok. I just ended up going to bed early. Catching up on some sleep was good for me. Today I took a practice SAT out of this book I have, and I only got a 1150 on it. My goal is to get around a 1300-1400 on the actual test, so I should study/practice some more. I don't really have too much to blog about. Today I watched Big Fish, and that was good.  I'm only blogging for Chubbs because I know she gets mad when I don't. Well, that is really about it. I'll blog later."
GM24J1X,female,17,"After much consideration I have decided that the #5 song on my list of favorite love songs shouldn't be Total Eclipse of the Heart. Instead, I think it should be You Got It by Roy Orbison. Just thought I'd notify y'all of the change! Like you guys really care tho.....hehe."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yesterday I thought I had overcome being sick. I was mistaken. I was once again in bed all day. Oh well. I think I just need to take it easy these next few days, and I should be fine. Well, I have nothing to really blog about, so I'll blog later."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ok, I have to make this entry long, because yesterday it wasn't long enough, and Alex was not pleased. So, Alex, are you happy now? I hope that this entry will be good enough for you. When I was first typing this, after I typed 'you' in the past sentence, I also typed the word 'answers.' Crazy! Lets see....it is only 10:36, and a lot has already happened today! That is a change.  It hasn't been good tho. All I have to say is that I DON'T FREAKING UNDERSTAND CERTAIN PEOPLE. Always saying one thing and doing another...without explanation. What the hell is that? It's gay! I'm sick of it. From now on, I'm just going to keep stuff to myself, and not share it with people. They don't deserve to know. Ugh! I don't know, and it is making me mad. Oh well. I was supposed to go find Martin today at break, but I had other stuff to do instead. Oh well, I'm sure he didnt care too much. I got an email from Josh today, I hadn't heard from him for about a week. It was nice knowing he was ok, i guess, but it wasnt good to hear that he hasnt been going to school. Bad Josh! Oh well...speaking of school....yeah, I got a 37% on that math quiz that I took yesterday. I'll be retaking that and the other one tomorrow. Hopefully I will improve on them. In spanish today we got new seats because people were talking too much. I was put next to Erin, so that was good. We have too much fun together. Haha. Yesterday she came over for a bit and worked on some homework, but had fun for the rest of the time that we weren't. We tried to mess with Martin online, but it didn't really work. oh well. Hmmm....I wonder if this is long enough for Alex's standards. Probably not...she always holds me to such high standards! It's not fair. No, I'm kidding. I don't know. I'm tired, and me being tired is not good. When I'm tired, I get into weird moods. I am in one of those moods right now. Haha. Oh well. I need to read for psychology, but that would require me going to my locker and getting my book. I should probably do that soon. We may be quizzed on it. DAMN PEOPLE MAKE ME MAD! Ok, that was random, but I felt the need to say it. Hmm....I don't know. I think I will finish this up and then go get my book. Why yes, that is what I shall do! Hmm...I am so bored. I really don't have too much to blog about right now, but I'm just going to go off on something that has been bothering me, and Holli...if you end up reading this...I am sorry, but that is how I feel. Ok...I feel like me and Holli are growing apart. We've talked about this before, and have said that we've needed to work on it. don't get me wrong, Holli is great! I love her to death, too, it's just that sometimes I feel she doesn't understand me. I'll try to tell her something or talk to her about my problems, but I always feel as if she never really listens. It seems to me that it always goes back to her problems. I would just like to be able to talk to her and tell her what is on my mind without having to worry if I'll hurt her feelings. I want to continue being Holli's friend, and work on things...it just feels as if we are growing apart into different people. I find my self not being able to relate to her as much, and I've noticed that when I am getting along with her really great, we're talking about old times. I don't want to always be talking about the old times...because I want these times to be like the old times. they arent tho, and that makes me sad. things have changed, and i honestly dont know how to get them back to normal. i dont know, i just feel as if sometimes no one understands me. i was trying to tell amanda my story of how i felt and stuff, and she was getting all defensive, and completely missed the point. everyone seems to be missing the point....well not everyone. but i find it more harder and harder to be able to fully express myself to people...it seems as if they dont really listen/care. i could be totally wrong, but i dont know. not knowing isnt a good feeling either. i would just like to be reassured that everything will be ok, and that everything is fine now. if somebody would just listen to me talk about my problems, how i truly feel about things, and not tell me what to do, just listen...and not judge. that would be great. i think my biggest problem is actually that i feel holli doesnt understand me as much. and having the feeling of your best friend not understand you sometimes makes you feel that no one else does. i know that isnt true. i just need to have things become better with holli....hopefully they will. all i can do is wait and time will tell soon enough. its just frustrating having all of this inside my head going on, and not being able to communicate it. its awful. oh well. that is the way life goes sometimes...there is nothing i can do about it. hmm....i wonder if this is long enough for alex. haha...that could sound dirty taken out of context. can i touch your cochlea? a cochlea is a bony tube filled with fluid. it is located inside of the ear. haha. i dont know why, but me and erin find that extremely funny. we can be a tad perverted sometimes....actually, take out tad. I am a big pervert when I try. It isnt all the time tho, I swear. Well, now I feel weird talking about how I find myself to be a perv sometimes. So...just forget about that stuff. wow, I think that this has acquired some great length. alex likes the length. haha....."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was an ok day, I suppose. The morning started off being ok. We starting watching Buscando a Nemo in spanish class. I've never seen Finding Nemo, so that's pretty cool. I understand pretty much what we are doing in math, so that is good too. Computers was really dumb. Good thing I only had to be in there for about 15 minutes. Ok, Mrs. Parker now says we can't even go on the internet at all because of some virus going around or something. I dont really know because I wasn't listening.  And then I had just finished my assignment, and I was just about to save when all of a sudden, it closed down on me. So then I told Mrs. Parker what happened, and she just told me to write her a note saying I completed the assignment. So that's good. Then I went to some thing for juniors about colleges and what-not in the auditorium. I didn't pay too much attention cuz me and tommy kept messing around (not in that way..haha).  Lunch time is when my day turned interesting. I'll start with the funny part first, and then I'll get into the non-funny part. Ok...the funny part deals with me and Theran. We decided to ""noodle"" the pretzel stick. Ok, by ""noodle"" i mean, Lady and the Tramp style. So we do that, and then for the shortest second, a little portion of our lips slightly touched, and ryan was convinced that we kissed. we totally didn't! i just wonder if he will tell lori. but theran was saying that lori wont believe ryan, and that lori likes me anyway, so as to not worry. i'm not too sure tho.  now as for the other portion of my eventful lunch time...somehow the convo turned into who has been drunk and stuff before, and theran was like ""i bet erica hasnt had any alcohol"" (or something like that)and i whispered to him ""um, you're wrong"" and then he didnt believe me, so he called ethan over cuz i said that ethan knew the story...so he asked ethan about it, and was like 'well, she wasnt really drunk, she more or less just had a good buzz' (this happened like a year ago, and when it did, i told ethan about it but no one else) and then holli was convinced that i was lying, and kept asking me about it. and well since it embarasses me to talk about it, i told her about 4 times that i didnt want to discuss it at the current moment...so then about 5 min pass and then she's like ""you're kidding!"" and im tired of her never believing me, so i throw down my hand (as i threw down my hand, my food fell) and yell 'Holli....fuck...im not kidding! ok, can we just drop it?!' and i'm about to cry, and she just looks at me, and then she walks away from the table...and then in physics she asks to talk to me about it, and i'm like ""i really don't want to talk about it, ok?"" and she was like 'well, i dont understand' so then im like 'holli, please, not now' and then after school she was telling me how she was mad at me because i was the one who threw my food at her (when it fell out of my hand and didnt even hit her) and embarassed her in front of the whole table...when in fact she was the one who was embarassing me cuz she wouldnt drop it, and then she was like 'why didnt you tell me?' and got all mad at me and said that i made her mad because of my reaction, and she couldnt understand why i was mad at her. it's really stupid, but it still makes me mad! ugh! oh well....that was really all the exciting points of my day. I'll blog tomorrow (maybe)."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ok, yeah that title was stupid but I was running low on ideas. I went to Alex's house today for a bit with Amanda and Holli. We did our nails so they would be nice for prom. I'm getting SUPER excited about prom! It is going to be so much fun! Well, I hope so anyways. Hmm....what else did I do today? Oh yeah, I talked to Josh. I told him that I wasn't really ready for a boyfriend, and he seemed to be okay with that. So that is good. We're still gonna be friends tho, so that's cool. Not much else happened today. That was really about it."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was an okay day.  A little boring, but I at least had something to do.  I went to my uncle's house for his bday party. People in Lake Oswego and their parties...i swear! Geez! Oh well. When I got home, Omondo came over for a bit. I played her song for her. Gigolo! Oh yeah. We just went over my list of the greatest 80s songs...well, my personal choices at least.  Keep on Loving You  by REO Speedwagon is a good song. Me and Omondo danced to it! Oh yeah! I have to memorize these sentences for spanish class, and it sucks. I can memorize them easily, but its taking the time to concentrate that is getting me stuck. Oh well....I should stop blogging and start memorizing! Side note: Anyone who doesn't think Steve Martin is one of the funniest fellows on the planet should have his head examined! (oh yeah, Chubbs, I'm good!)"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today has been a fun day so far. In the morning, around 9:30, Amanda came over. I got dressed and ready, and then we went to go ""run some errands"". First, we went to her friend Sheri's house so Amanda could pick up some clothes she had left there. She has talked about Sheri before, so it was nice finally meeting her. Then we went to the mall because Amanda needed to get a bathing suit top. Let me just say that the fat kid didn't get the low carb pizza this time! Oh yeah! haha. After the mall we stopped by Marty's house to pick up some CDs. We stayed there for about 20 minutes, maybe, and then we went to Alex's house to pick up another CD. When we were there, I had to do some ""dirty work"" for Alex. The things I do! Jeeze, I'm such a good friend! haha. So far that has been my day, but I doubt it will get any more exciting. Tomorrow Marty is coming over, and on Friday I'm going to Hooters with Amanda, Aaron, and a friend of Aaron's choice...possibly Winslow. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'll have more to blog about later."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yep, that's right. If two weeks ago somebody told me that today was gonna end the way it did, I would have called them crazy. (I love the two weeks analogy!)  I'm glad this day went the way it did. It's about damn time things went my way! haha j/k. I like this song Ocean Avenue by Yellowcard. It's cool. I like some of the lyrics:  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I don't know why, I just think it's cool. I don't think I've been in this good a mood for awhile now, and it's nice."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I just got back from the science fair at school. Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad! It was actually somewhat fun. First of all, me and Holli got 1st place for physics! We got a nifty blue ribbon! Score! What else? Oh yeah, I got a lot of interaction with Bobby tonight! Even better! The best part tho was when he blew me a kiss goodbye! Kick ass! Sadly, I didn't know science fairs could be so fun! Well, that was my evening!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"My title was my favorite line from the new Harry Potter movie. I saw that movie today. It was pretty good. Also today I went to Amanda's house with Alex. Her parents graduated from PSU, so they had a BBQ. We got to meet some of Amanda's family. It was actually really fun. We met her aunt and uncle, and they are really nice and funny. We plan on going to their house up in Washington sometime this summer. They invited us, and it sounds really fun. We'll get that planned later. Between Amanda's house, and the movie, my day was pretty much filled. It was a good day overall. Actually so far (knock on wood) this summer vacation (all 5 days of it) has been pretty good. Hopefully the rest will be good, if not better!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Felt like spicing up the title a bit with using my grandtacular spanish skills.  Why that title? I dunno...I guess it was a good choice cuz of the joke I tried to play on Alex. That is right Alex, I tried to play a  joke on you, but you already know that. I think it worked. You were getting mad. Mad...good. Goodness! That reminds me....I talked to Reggie for a bit last night (well like 1 in the morning online).  We probably talked for a good half hour to an hour. I haven't talked to that kid for awhile, so it was fun. We were both in good moods, and decided to spread the goodness. I talked to Marty until like 5 in the morning on the phone...now that was crazy. That would also explain why I woke up at 12:30 today. Amanda would be dissapointed! Oh well. Hmm...I think I've done my job of blogging enough about nothing for now. G'day to y'all!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Good ol' Chubbs...ya gotta love her! Today I took my Spanish final. I did good on it, I got an A. I think Mrs. Roth enjoyed mine and Omondo's sidenotes. haha. Then I had people sign my year book. Good stuff. Oh, today in physics we had our egg drop lab. Katie and I kicked ass! None of our eggs cracked! Score! Well, tomorrow I have the SATs, ugh! That's all folks!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a pretty good day. I hung out with Amanda for a bit, and I picked up my photos. We went back to her house for a few minutes, and then we went to Marty's house. It was nice seeing him. Amanda is one crazy girl, I swear! When I got home, I talked to Josh on the phone for awhile. I also talked to Holli too. Lots of people interaction today...good stuff."
GM24J1X,female,17,"The ship was a    rockin'  and a  rollin' ! I began my journey as a young  girl  trapped in a  man's  body. It was a  dark night  in Arkansas. There is nothing like being in the wrong body on a dark night, let me tell ya. Never was I so    confused    in my life! In search for some    juicy peaches   , I began crawling due to my childish nature. Any onlooker would have been most   confused   due to my appearance. None of this is making sense, you say? You are right to think such a thing! None of   this makes sense   and it is all because of a   very   good reason. I am lying to you. Yep, I lied. Why did I lie? I thought I would spice things up. Spice...makes me think of the   Spice Girls  . Ginger was my favorite. I once recall hearing that ginger root is good for sea sickness.   I just can't     do it captain!   What is love? Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more. I walked across an empty room. I felt the earth beneath my feet.     You had me at hello .     Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates...ya know what? Life is like a box of chocolates, and I'm going to eat every fucking chocolate in that box!   THIS IS NUCKING FUTS!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was an average day. I tried to start to talk to Ryan about our fight, but he wouldn't listen...what's new? He never listens to me, nor does he care what I have to say or how I feel. He's good at doing that. Oh well. I got mad and called him a 'fuck face' at lunch today. That's the ticket....impress him with my grand vocabulary that properly displays my intelligence...that will make him see things. Oh well, I was mad. Sam today in physics said I look like Martin. Damn Jew....doesn't know anything! The only thing me and Martin share is our red hair. Other than that, we don't look alike. Oh well. Oh, haha....funny story time! The Clay Aiken Kid (I think his name is Kirk) thinks I am hot. He told Chloe's friend Ariel that. haha. Good times. First I do a kiss and run with him, and then he thinks I'm hot. That kid is seriously blind, I swear. I dunno tho, I just find it funny. Well, I'm gonna go now, other than that my day was pretty much uneventful."
GM24J1X,female,17,"My title sounds so wrong, but it isn't. Anyone who reads this knows that my mom's nickname is Stiffy, so all is well. We were at Old Navy today and she totally tripped. It was the funniest thing. We were looking at some shirts (This stupid lady took the shirt that I wanted, and it was the last one in that size. Oh, and she was obviously too big for a medium, but she wanted to try it anyways, because they had no larges either. All they had was that one medium and a whole bunch of XL and XXL. What the heck? Ugh! I so wanted that shirt, but oh well!)...anyways, as I was saying--we were looking at some shirts and somehow my mom's foot gets caught in this string of a bag. Well she goes to walk away and her foot is caught, and it totally causes her to fall to the ground. She was so embarassed! (Then again so was I) I felt bad for her, but not too many people saw, so I suppose all is well. That was totally the highlight of my day so far! Ciao!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was SUPER boring. I spent most of it talking to Josh....and when I mean most...I mean MOST. Oh well. Nothing too exciting went on today. Tomorrow I have to go to my uncle's bday party or whatever. I swear, people in Lake Oswego have too many parties. They aren't even fun. I don't really like my dad's side of the family too much. They all have their noses in the air. Whatever. The only one I really like is my cousin Andy. He's cool and only 4 months older than me. He's a senior. He's going to go to the college that I want to go to (PSU). Marty and Josh think I should go somewhere better...but PSU is close to home. I don't want to go somewhere too far away. I dunno. I have a lot of things to decide. Oh well. Damn, I still have some homework to do. I procrastinate too much..."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Oh my...the poor apple! Why must you go and try to shoot it? Isn't that rude? How do you think the apple feels?! Oh, in case your memory has failed you, the apple is the fruit with red or yellow or green skin and sweet to tart crisp whitish flesh. Flesh...such an odd word. It reminds me of Jack Beatty, when he once said ""The maritime strategy has an all but unstoppable institutional momentum behind it... that has given force and flesh to the theory."" Such a wise, wise man! Alas! I am suddenly urged to share a story from the depths of my dear childhood. I was 16 years old. My how the days have grown since then! I was working on the corner (yes, the corner) of our family field. That is where the best worms were! Twas my job to scoop up the soft earth, and search for the worms! My family had acquired a taste for birds, so we needed the worms to bait them in! I however, did not care for the birds. But none of this is important to the story I want to share! So, back to where I started. I was 16 years old. I was walking my cat down the street, and as we turned the corner, we saw a little man. I decided to name this man Yenibs (pronounced ""George""), so I call to him: ""Yenibs, what are you doing?!"" and strangley enough he didn't answer me! It angered my cat, so she began to hoot like an owl. I believe that caught the mans attention for he turned to me and said in his woman-like voice ""Young girl, why are you only wearing one shoe?"" and I simply replied ""Because the other one is on my head!"" Yenibs chuckled, and quickly walked away. I miss him. He was my friend. Poor Yenibs! Can one artificially create a banana? Note: The banana fruit is five or six inches long, and over an inch in diameter; the pulp is soft, and of a luscious taste, and is eaten either raw or cooked. Oh dear! How could I forget?!? It completely escaped me! I am unable to eat bananas! One time, as I was riding my kangaroo, I decided to eat an banana. What an awful idea! Something in the banana created a strange chemical reaction in my brain, and it caused me to dance like a ferret while singing old African songs! When I came out of my daze, I realized I was at starbucks wearing a business suit and talking about the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System) with my ""friend"" Henry. Henry was good looking, I suppose. Something was a little odd about him tho. Maybe it had to do with the fact that he was actually a woman, but I just thought it was funny to pretend she was a man. I'm not sure, but I'll blame it on the banana. They really mess with you! Oh dear, this has acquired much lengh! I best be ending this before they come and get me! They've been after me for awhile. I made them mad with the whole ""honey-frog"" thing. Did you hear that? Yeah, neither did I!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a great day. The fact that it was the last day of school made it the best! I think I managed to pull all A's, so that is good. I cut it close with calculus tho, because I had an 89.6%, but Kroese rounded up to an A. Hmmm...what else? Oh yeah! Marty sent me flowers! It was such a great surprise! I loved it! Tonight should be fun too. I'll blog about that later tho."
GM24J1X,female,17,"haha.....ok, my title doesn't really make sense. well, it kind of does considering im wearing my hood right now. but anyways...on with my day. my day has been pretty uneventful. in spanish class we ate ice cream that mrs. roth made. it was chocolate and was good. i liked it. in math we were doing stuff that takes FOREVER to do. i only got 2 and half problems done in a half hour. that is how long it takes! it is easy stuff, but it is just very time consuming. oh well. so i have some calc homework to do tonight. erin might come over tonight so that we can work on calc. that would be good because we work together very well. oh, i havent read josh's blog yet! oh no!....ok, i took a pause and read it. haha. good stuff. i dont know. hmmm.....what else? im not really sure. amanda witnessed me leave egypt and check into the border (im sure no one but me and amanda understand that). so i guess that is good. hopefully i'll be able to cross the border soon.  i still need to figure out a lot of things, and that makes me mad. i wish that sometimes i just knew all the answers. things would be so much easier that way. oh well. i know that in time i'll come to the right decision. i just dont know if im patient enough to wait until that time is right. i guess i dont have a choice tho. i mean i need to wait. there is nothing else i can do but wait. and while i wait i might as well make the most of what i have. well im done blogging now, so i shall be going. i'll blog later today maybe...not too sure tho."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Last night after I blogged, I got this phone call from someone. It turns out that it was bobby and him and tommy were driving around Big Meadow trying to find where I lived, and said that it would just be easier if I told them. So I did, and they drop by my house, and we hang out for about 5 minutes. They couldnt come inside tho because their little brother and sister were in the car. It was funny tho, cuz Bobby was like ""erica arent you gonna ask us inside?"" and tommy was like ""we can't, the kids are in the car...maybe next time"" and so him and bobby said that they will have to come over some other time. It was very interesting! It seemed so weird for that to happen tho, but hey, I didn't mind! haha. Now for today....hmmm....this morning amanda came over and i straightened her hair. my mission for lunch is to find scott and ask him what his plans are this weekend and if he prefers pie or cake. i really want to know. haha. im weird, but hey, i know that. i have a math test that i need to study for tonight, because i need to get an A on it. well, this blog is getting kind of boring for me to type, so i'll be going!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"My title is a song by South. It's really good I think. It's on the  OC Mix 1  soundtrack. I like the whole CD. Then again I like everything about the OC....including Adam Brody! Anyways, today was a typical day. Erin came over and we did psychology homework. That may sound boring, but it was actually fun! We totally did an awesome job on our project! It is kind of sad how excited I am about it, but it really is awesome. We have the coolest eye model, and the coolest story. Juanita Bonita and the Spum-pum! Score!! We are creative! Oh yeah. Obviously I'm in a good mood as I type this...haha. Even tho I should prolly be sad since tomorrow is monday morning. Oh well. I think I'm done blogging for tonight. Night!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Here I Go Again by Whitesnake, good song. Anyways (technically 'anyways' isn't a word, it is supposed to be 'anyway' but nobody ever says that)....as I was starting to say...back to my day! It wasn't really that eventful. I dunno, I can't say I was in a bad mood, because that wouldn't be true. But then again, to certain people I wasn't in a good mood either. I guess I was fine, but there were just some parts of the day where I was getting tired of certain people. I kinda got mad at them easily, but oh well. Nothing I can do about it now, so I might as well get over it. Lets see....the highlight of my day..hmm..that would prolly have to be my psychology class. I dunno, that was the class that I had the most fun in today, so I can't really pick a specific thing. I need someone to rant to...well maybe not. Maybe I should just keep it to myself. I dunno, I tend to do that a lot--keep things inside. It's probably not the best thing to do, but I don't think I trust people enough to tell them what I'm completely thinking all the time. I mean, sometimes I do it, but not too often. And when I do, it's usually after I've hit the breaking point. I dunno....I should deal with emotions in a better way. It's weird tho, I always feel like I can best tell people my emotions once they've been completely honest with me. It's like something they need to earn....haha. I dunno, I'm just rambling now. I think that's enough for now....I need to talk to someone or I'm gonna die. haha. I guess that's what I get for not talking much during the day...oh well."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today I hung out with Amanda for a bit. We went to Fred Meyer and tried on some clothes. After that we decided to get some ice cream. Well, we were in her car when I noticed that I had spilled some chocolate ice cream on my sweatshirt. I was like ""oh shit"" and me and amanda just start laughing because I said it really funny. Then, as we were laughing I burped, and that somehow added to the humor. We both keep laughing so hard that it almost hurts. It was great. Well, then we finished our ice cream and were heading home. Little did I know that Amanda would take me to Tommy and Bobby's house. I was SCREAMING at her in the car to turn around but she wouldnt. So then she decides to call first, and she asks for Tommy, but he's in the shower, so then she asks for Bobby. She asks if Bobby would mind that I came by to say hello, and Bobby said he didn't care. So then, Amanda takes me there, and makes me go say hey. Well, since Tommy was in the shower, I just visited with Bobby for about 5-10 minutes, but then I decided it was weird enough so then we left. I'm not really sure what Bobby thought of it all, but oh well. I made it clear that Amanda took me their against my own will, so maybe he doesn't find me to be weird, but Amanda instead. Anyway, after that we are driving home and we pass Scott. He was on his way to work, so I was like ""follow him!"" and so Amanda turns around really fast and we begin to follow him. We catch up to him at Ricky D's (where he works) and Amanda's all like ""we followed you"" and Scott was all ""I know, I saw you"" so Amanda kinda got mad that she listened to my suggestion. We decided that we were even now. Hmmm...I wonder if Tommy will ask about me going to his house. Hmm..oh well. That was the extent of my evening so far, but I don't think it will be getting anymore exciting. I'll blog tomorrow maybe."
GM24J1X,female,17,"You're not bigger than this...not better. Why can't you learn?  Good ol' lyrics from Lucky Denver Mint, by Jimmy Eat World. Let's see...I went to Martin's house today. That was ok. We watched Gothika and I schooled him in 80s music. I'm talking to Josh right now, and he just shared some really interesting information with me. hmm...makes me think. Lets see what else has gone on...oh...I know! I freakin got excluded from Friday Night Movie Night! Whatever....no, I'm kidding. I understand the story. (It's ok Alex...haha). Tomorrow Erin is going to come over and we are going to work on homework. We are so cool! haha. We always have fun together tho, so that is good. I really don't have too much more to blog about, so I'll stop for now."
GM24J1X,female,17,"In physics one day, Mrs. Briley was telling our class that if you take diet dr. pepper and put like 4-5 mentos in it, it will fizz a whole bunch. Being curious, I decided to try it out. It works all right. Stupid me just decided to test it out on the kitchen table. Soda got everywhere...mom was not pleased. It was funny tho. Me and my mom went to the store today, and as boring as that may sound, it was actually somewhat fun.  We were walking by the condoms and I was like 'hey mom, um...can u stop for a second. i need to find something.' and she was like 'yeah, ok' it didnt even phase her that i was joking until i had to tell her. haha.  Anyways, I've come to the realization that if you say wasabi in a japanese-ish way, it is really humorous. Hmm...what else? Oh, I got a magazine today with a quiz booklet inside, so I took some quizzes. Lets see...according to one quiz I am tied with being a party girl and party animal. Basically, I like to have a lot of fun. haha. Another quiz says that I kinda care about my looks. I'll take a second glance in the mirror, but I also know when to draw the line. If I were a coffee, I'd be a vanilla latte. I'm full of natural sugar and i'm lovable, geniune, and have a positive presence.  My rock star soul mate is John Mayer because i'm into easygoing guys who are emotionally available and in touch with their feelings. haha. And when it came down to the ""Are you girlfriend material?"" quiz, I got Miss Taken...meaning I am ready for a relationship-and it shows. I have the confidence that attracts guys and the selflessness i need to really be there for another person. Oh, and the prom dress that fits my personality is the long, sleek gown because i'm sophisticated beyond my years. I tend to be in the spotlight.  Ok, after typing all that, it makes me wonder...who really believes in these quizzes? I just take them because they are fun and its interesting seeing what they have to say about me. Who makes up these quizzes? That is what i want to know. oh well. My sister just made a bouquet of barbies...damn odd.  Aniwaiz, this is getting long, so that is my cue to stop typing. Tomorrow I go shopping, yay! Ok, now I'm done. Later!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yesterday night was pretty fun. Alex came over first and we were just hanging out looking at my music collection. We have decided that I have a wide variety. Then Erin came and we decided to go show Erin the ""fort"". Well, as we were about to leave Amanda asked if she could come over and hang out for a bit, and I told her that we were going to the ""fort"" so she said to call her when we got back. So Alex and I show Erin the fort, and she seemed to think it was cool. We walk back to my house and we notice Amanda's car parked in front. We go upstairs and open my sister's door, and inside is Chloe and Amanda sitting on Chloe's bed watching TV, with Amanda in her prom dress. It was so funny! She just decided to wear her prom dress. It was great. Sometime this summer Me, Alex, and Amanda need to go somewhere wearing our prom dresses. It would be fun. So after awhile Amanda leaves, so then me and Erin decided to have some chocolate ice cream. Well, I was being a dork with it, and smeared it around my mouth to make it look like a mustache. Alex said she needed a picture of it, so me her and erin walk to her house to get alex's camera. as we were walking, i had the ice cream on my face. it was so funny. so we get the camera, and on the way back we decide to go in the ""fort"" again. well we went all the way back, and we noticed an opening to the field. so we go through the opening and walk in the field and we walk forward for awhile, and we notice another ""fort"". this one was scary tho because it looked someone lived there. we got scared so we ran back to the main path in the field. the grass was really wet, so we got all wet. it was fun. me and alex decided that we need to go back on a nice day and check out the second ""fort"". it was really fun. then we came back to my house and just watched movies and hung out. today was boring, so i really feel no need to blog about it."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Well today was the field trip for my physics class. It was actually pretty fun. I have a few bruises, but they'll heal soon enough. I think I ate too much cotton candy. Oh well. Tonight Amanda, Alex, and Holli came over for movie night. We watched the movie Grind. It was pretty funny. There was this character in there named Matt, and he totally reminded me of Matt Belding. It was funny. ADAM BRODY was in it!!!! SCORE!!!! I know Amanda has taken a new quote from that movie! (greetings from the interior)haha. good stuff. well that was basically it for today!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"When I woke up I thought it was just going to be another boring day. Well, it was until about 15 minutes ago. I got the BEST surprise! I can't share it yet tho, because I promised not to! Oh well, people will find out soon enough! hehe. Now I want to share, but I can't!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yesterday I spent all day with Mika. It was great catching up with her. Today I went to Marty's house. We watched Dude, Where's My Car? That movie is so dumb, but I love it. It is even better because Hal Sparks is in it! Oh yeah! Speaking of hot guys, I am going to try to make a resume tomorrow so I can turn it into Hollywood Video. That would be cool if I had a job there. It would be nice having the extra money. Good stuff. I got my report card back today, and I'M RANKED #1! I'm pretty sure that Bri is too, but I'm glad that I finally caught up. The past two days have been good, to sum things up. Tomorrow Alex and Holli should be coming over. That should be fun."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was an okay day. I saw Spiderman 2, and I liked it. The best part of the movie was HAL SPARKS! He was in it for maybe one whole minute, but that was the best minute in the movie. Other than that, my day was pretty boring. Oh well. Hopefully tomorrow will be more exciting."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a pretty good day! Kind of boring, but there were fun moments as well! Lets see....what were some of the good stuff? Oh yeah.....TOMMY ASKED ME OUT ON A DATE! I don't know why I am so excited about that....considering I told him I didn't know. Why did I have to do that? He may not even call!  So, oh well.  I just don't know why I am always scared to do stuff with guys. I totally shouldn't be. Girls my age are supposed to go out with guys and have fun, not just stay home. I'm such a loser. Oh well. I know that eventually I'll do stuff. This weekend shouldnt be too eventful. I'll just be stuck at home doing nothing, as always. I'm listening to this song called Honey and The Moon, and for some reason, it really put me into a deep-thinking kind of mood. It made me a little sad too. I don't know. I just feel that I'm incapable of making the right decisions sometime. But then other times I totally feel that I made the right choice and have no regrets. I really don't even know what I am trying to get at right now. Swedish Fish are good....right, Chubbs? Speaking of Chubbs...I haven't really talked to her too much these past few days. Hmm.. Oh well. I'll blog later."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I am so mad right now! I can not find my disposable camera! I better find it soon, or I'll freaking go on a rampage! I dunno, but it had my prom picks on it, so I really do need to find it. I was gonna finish up the role of film on me...no, just kidding....i was gonna take some pics of my nephews...and maybe one or two of myself. I went into my room, and I couldn't find it! Ah! I think that my mom put it away somewhere since I left it on my bed this morning. I don't know, I'll have to ask her when she gets back from the store. Until then I just have to stay calm. Lets see...today wasn't too exciting. We had flan in spanish class...it was pretty good. Got my calc quiz back....yeah I got a 74%, so I'll be retaking that one. In psychology we just looked at many optical illusions, so that was pretty interesting. In physics we finished up some labs....Sam wasn't there for me to hit on. Oh well. I need to find a different hobby besides hitting on guys when I'm bored. Oh well. Hopefully this weekend will be more exciting, but I highly doubt it...it's partially my fault tho. I had offers to do a few things, but I turned them all down....why do I do that? Martin invited me to this party he was going to, and Tommy invited me to his house to watch some movies...and what do I do? I say no. Why is that? I should say yes more often! That is what I am going to do now....I will no longer say no, but instead yes! I dunno, I'm just rambling now...oh well. I say oh well a lot. Hmm....I should go try to find my camera..."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Well, I'm in computer class right now. I've been sitting here for about the last 10 minutes just staring at the screen deciding what to write. I still don't have any ideas really. Oh well. I just read Josh's blog, and reading about the sugar thing made me think of what I once did when I needed to stay awake...haha. Josh knows that story. Today at break I was talking to Marty and I felt like a mother or something because I was scolding him for not going to class. Oh well. It was funny, Marty said hi to Alex and she was all like 'why do you fucking talk to Erica?' She said it jokingly of course, but Marty's reaction was funny. I just realized that Josh and Alex are probably the only ones who read this. Maybe sometimes Holli, but I'm not really sure. Oh well. She probably doesn't. I just think it's Josh and Alex. So you guys are the coolest of all my friends! OK? haha. I don't know. Oh well. Right now I should be doing calc homework, but I really don't feel like going to my locker and getting my book. I'll just take it home tonight and actually do homework I suppose. Wow, what a concept! Crazy! I can't wait until May 14th. That should be fun since we are going to go to Oaks Park for physics class. I might ask Stiffy if she wants to be a chaperone, but I'm not too sure yet. My mom is really cool, so I wouldn't mind. However, I just don't want her to overhear any Matt Belding jokes because that would be bad. And I know some might happen, because they always seem to do. She must not know about that. That reminds me...I am so tempted to tell her that I watched The Exorcist. I really wonder what she would do. Maybe I'll wait a few weeks, but I know that I eventually will tell her. I figure that if I wait a few weeks I can't get in trouble, because obviously I'm fine after seeing it. Oh well. I don't know. I just think it would be funny seeing her reaction. I really wonder what she would do.  Tommy right now is telling me how there are many sides to him, but I think he is full of crap. Oh well. And I just asked him to show me more of his sides and he accused me of just trying to get him in bed. yeah...that is it....sure. Oh well. I've been thinking a lot lately about guy stuff, and it is sometimes confusing. Damn it! Oh well. I just hope that I will get everything sorted out in time. Hopefully that time will be soon because I am getting really impatient. If only there was a way for sure to determine exactly how I feel. I don't even know where to begin, I'm that lost. I want to talk to someone about it, but I am afraid to also. But I need some help or something. I really want to get things figured out. And when things are figured out, I know that I will be much more relaxed and stuff. Oh well. I just really need to figure things out as soon as possible, because if I don't then I am going to drive myself crazy! Hmm....I think that I will be going now, because I really have nothing better to do.  Maybe I'll write some emails to people, or just browse various sites. I could always go to my locker and get my homework, but I'll save that for later. I need more stuff to do after school. Hopefully I'll hear more about that job at the mortgage company for this summer. That would be nice. I could picture myself working in an office environment. I'm good with that kind of stuff. And Amy is really nice, so I would enjoy working with her. With my luck however, it probably wont work out. I just need more things to go my way for once. It would be nice to have that happen every once in awhile.  Oh well, my time eventually will come where everything is going great. Until then, I'll just have to deal with the way things are nice...which isn't too bad. I'm pretty happy overall. There are just a few things that I would like to become improved. Nothing too major tho...so yeah. De nada. (I really have no idea why I just said ""you're welcome"" in spanish....but I really don't care either.)"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I'm bored and in computer class. I don't know, today I'm in a weird mood. I'm not really into the whole ""interaction with other people"" type of thing. I just don't see the point in it right now. Too many people are getting on my nerves (ok, only maybe 2). I'm just tired of stuff. I don't even know the point of this blog, so whatever. I guess it's just a super long way of saying that I'm not in the mood to blog, and I may not be for awhile. I don't know tho. We'll see how things go tomorrow."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ah, tis the first day of June! Today was a fairly good day. In spanish, we played Jeopardy, and my group KICKED ASS! Oh yeah! In math, Tommy had a chipmunk, so we got to play with that for awhile. It was a baby, and it was so cute! Lunch was fun too. Erin and I got into a cake fight. Holli had made cake because it was Ben's (or as Amanda would say, Jamin's) birthday. Well, me and Erin shared a piece, and we made a mess of it! She threw some at me, so then I got her back, and so on and so forth. It was fun, and messy. Those were really the only highlights of my day. Other than that, it was pretty normal. Tomorrow I have to give a speech in psychology about interpersonal attraction. I finished the paper yesterday, and I have decided to put it in here. Read it if you like, or don't. Doesn't matter to me--it is nothing exceptionally good. Well, I'll blog later.   Interpersonal Attraction  A man and woman have fun together on their first date.  They laughed at the same parts in the movie, agreed quickly on a restaurant because they like the same kind of food, and enjoyed the conversation.  As the evening draws to an end, however, the woman wonders whether to agree to a second date.  She thinks he is a nice guy, a good person, so why doesn’t she feel especially attracted to him?  As a man enters his apartment, he notices his neighbor leaving her place and they exchange smiles.  Once inside, he wonders why he finds her so attractive.  He knows nothing about her, but he always thinks about her and what she is like.  What is it about her that he finds increasingly appealing? In another scenario, a woman finds herself attracted to a coworker based solely on his exceptionally good looks.  He is clearly wrong for her, but she is captivated by his physical appearance.  Could she really be falling for Mr. Wrong just because he’s good looking?    Liking someone but not finding them “romantically” attractive, becoming attracted to the “familiar stranger”, and favoring someone for his or her good looks rather than deeper qualities seem like all too common cases.  This is due to the fact that most of us find many different people attractive in different ways (Weber, 2003).  In social psychology, attraction is described as an attitude of liking (positive attraction) or disliking (negative attraction).  In interpersonal attraction, one can see that there are many factors that attract us to particular people as potential friends or partners.  The four main determining factors of interpersonal attraction include physical appearance, similarity to ourselves, evidence that our attraction is returned, and proximity (Rathus, 1998, 472).  Physical appearance plays an important role in interpersonal attraction.  This is because we generally tend to notice a person’s appearance before anything else.  Since people have different perceptions, there is no single answer for physically attractive “standards.”  However, there are some things that are viewed as attractive to many cultures.  An example would be a smiling person, for they are generally perceived as more attractive than a person who is frowning.  In a study done, British and Japanese people were asked to identify features that they found to be attractive.  The facial features found in “attractive” women include large eyes, high cheekbones, and narrow jaws.  In another study, infants were studied to see what they found to be attractive.  It was determined that the longer the gaze towards a person from the infant, the more attractive that person was.  Infants, as young as 2 months, preferred faces that were also rated by adults as most attractive.  This evidence suggests that we may be born with a predisposition to find certain types of physical features attractive (Rathus, 1998, 472-73).    Facial features are not the only aspect studied dealing with physical attractiveness, but as well as body shape and type.  Preferences for body shape vary greatly, and there is a great deal of variation in people’s standard for attractiveness of body shape.  This includes both the shape we prefer for others, and the shape we perceive ourselves to have.  In a study done amongst college students, men and women were both asked to describe the “ideal” body shape.  Most of the men said that their body shape was near the ideal standard, while most women thought that they were heavier than the ideal shape.  This suggests that females are more likely than males to incorrectly think they are too heavy to be attractive (Rathus, 1998, 473).  There is also evidence that physical appearance has a greater role in the attraction of males to females than vice versa (Gale, 2001).  Other people’s physical appearance influences perceptions of our own attractiveness as well.  When observed simultaneously, people of average attractiveness tend to be judged more attractive when they are with a same-sex person who is very good-looking, but they are thought of as less attractive when with someone who is unattractive.  When observed sequentially, however, the reverse effect occurs.  In heterosexual relationships, although people’s overall impressions of a man appear to be influenced by his partner’s physical attractiveness, the same effect does not hold for a woman (Franzoi, 2003).    Besides physical attractiveness, it is also noticed that there is a tendency to be attracted to others who are similar to us in particular characteristics.  This is known as the matching hypothesis. Friends and partners also tend to be similar to one another in race, ethnicity, age, level of education, and religion (Bersheid, 1988, 92).  In fact, similarity of attitudes is a key contributor to attraction in both friendships and romantic relationships.  People also gravitate to others who are like themselves in terms of characteristics related to affiliation, including sociability, friendliness, and warmth (Gale, 2001).  Being attracted to people similar to ourselves can be traced back to the fact that people desire cognitive consistency or “balance” in their thoughts, feelings, and social relationships (Franzoi, 2003).  It is only natural that we want to be around someone who shares similar views and feelings, but we also like to be around people who like being around us as well.  Another major aspect dealing with interpersonal attraction is called reciprocity.  Reciprocity is the mutual exchange of feelings or attitudes (Rathus, 1998, 474). Interpersonal attraction theorists view reciprocity as an important contributor to the emergence of positive feelings among persons (Hallinan, 1999).  It makes sense for one to want to spend time with someone who enjoys his or her company as well. If given the choice, most people wouldn’t prefer to spend time with those that don’t like them compared to those that do.  Research has even shown that people are more open, warm, and helpful when they are talking with strangers who seem to like them (Rathus, 1998, 474).  If led to believe that another likes or dislikes us, we may behave in ways that confirm that expectation (Franzoi, 2003).  For example, Blau argues that an interaction is rewarding when the partner in the social exchange communicates approval of the person (Hallinan, 1999).  Reciprocity is, therefore, an important stabilizing factor in an interpersonal relation.  Proximity is another category that helps shine light onto the mysteries of interpersonal attraction.  Obviously, in order to meet, two people must share close proximity.  The sharing of this space will help one to get to know a person better. In some cases becoming more familiar with an individual can lead to a dislike of that individual. More often, though, getting to know someone leads to a deeper relationship with that individual (Bersheid, 1988, 85).  The case of proximity could be the cause of the attraction that the man held in the scenario towards his female neighbor.  It is logical that people develop feelings towards those whom they are in close contact with.  Interpersonal attraction can be better understood by studying the factors that compose the subject.  The components including physical appearance, similarity to ourselves, evidence that our attraction is returned, and proximity all help to make sense of the riddle in which attraction is hidden (Rathus, 1998, 472).  Every component, in a sense, is intertwined with the other.  Proximity will determine the number of times we come into contact with a person.  Before knowing anything about the person we come into contact with, we see their physical appearance and judge the attractiveness of it.  If some attraction is there, we may pursue them further and get to know them better.  Soon enough, we will be able to tell how similar the person is to ourselves.  Then if we want to continue any form of relationship with them, we will determine to do so or not based on the way that they perceive us.  If everything goes well, we will have a new friend or companion.  It may seem like a complicated process at first, but when broken down into smaller fragments, interpersonal attraction is not only easily understood, but it is also fascinating as well.  Interpersonal attraction is the reason and science behind everyday relationships, making it an important aspect to comprehend."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ok, I'm doing this now cuz Josh basically told me to. Ok, that makes me sound like I'm his bitch. I'm not. Haha...me being Josh's bitch. That is just funny. But anyways...today was a good day. Talked to Josh...and whoever reads this already knows about what, so I wont restate it. I'll just say that I am glad we talked about the stuff that we did. Now I'm just wondering what we decide to do, if anything. I dunno....I guess within time I'll find out soon enough. Well, I don't really have anything much else to say. So I suppose that's it for now. (Happy now Josh???) haha."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ok...Alex and I have a new fascination for shit. We love the word, and we like talking about it. What can I say? We're odd. I had a good time last night. There were some pretty interesting parts (who is your pee buddy?), and some fun parts (where the hell is my shirt? haha). I dunno. I didn't get much sleep at all. I fell asleep around 4:15, and I woke up at 5:30. Around 2:30 I think, I woke up Alex to tell her to turn off the light and tv...so she did. We didn't realize until later that I had woken her up to do it, instead of me doing it myself. Alex loves me as a friend! yay! I dunno. I'm gonna go watch a movie at Anna's tonight, but I'll be back later. Oh yeah....JORY THINKS I'M COOL!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today has been a slow/fast day. Fast because of the stupid time change, and slow because I've done nothing. I watched the movie Gothika and that was about it. People said it was scary, but I didn't really think so. It was pretty good, but the ending was somewhat stupid. Oh well. I talked to Holli for a long while on the phone too. We talked about prom and our boy troubles...haha. Good ol' girl stuff. I dunno, boys are confusing...let me tell ya! Well, maybe boys aren't confusing, girls just make them that way. I dunno. Oh well....no biggie. That was pretty much my day....boring."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a kinda boring day. I hung out with Alex for a bit. We got some ice cream and talked about plans for this upcoming weekend. Amanda came over for a little while and we played some Jeopardy. Good stuff. Other than that, my day was pretty boring. Let me just say...it is going to take some getting used to Anna and the boys living in Molalla. Yikes!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I just got back from Amanda's house. We watched A Night At The Roxbury! Score! I love that movie! It is really funny. I need to start doing my essay soon. I'll work on that tomorrow. Well, I don't have too much to blog about, so I'll be going."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain. I'm not much into health food. I am into champagne. Anyways...now that I've said a little bit about myself, I can continue blogging away. Oh...just a few words to CERTAIN people who will read this:  You know you can't hold me forever. I didn't sign up with you. I'm not a present for your friends to open.  No, I'm merely kidding. Those are some lyrics from an Elton John song....haha. I'm in a lyrical mood this evening I suppose. No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid.  Just as long as you stand, stand by me. Well, now that I am no longer afraid, we can move on! I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down. You know the one that takes you to the places. Ok, enough of this lyrical nonsense you say?!? Ok! Today was really boring, but I manged to get through it somehow. It was really nice outside, so that was good. I was able to catch some sun...but not too much or I would've burned. Damn the redhair! haha. Right now I'm talking to Alex (yes, I mentioned you in my blog that you read all the time Alex!!).....ok, back to blogging...Actually I really don't have much to say, so I think I'll be ending this before I type any more meaningless mumbo-jumbo....haha. I dunno."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Nothing much has been going on. Today after school Holli came over for a bit. We were supposed to do some physics stuff, but we didn't understand. So then we just hung out. After she left, I talked to Marty on the phone for a bit. Then Amanda came over, and we played Jeopardy a few times. It may sound sad, but its strangely fun. I don't know. Tomorrow is the physics field trip, so that should be interesting. We have to do these experiment things, I don't know, it sounds pretty stupid. Oh well. At least I won't be at school. Well, that was pretty much the extent of my day. Maybe I'll blog tomorrow, maybe not. Who knows?"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a fun day. I spent it with Amanda. We just hung out at her house, prepping for her garage sale. She bought Aaron a birthday card, and she decorated it as well. Too funny. Oh, we saw Alex and Audra at Hi-School Pharmacy. There was a tennis thing tonight, but Amanda didn't want to go, and Kaila did, so she had to drop her off. Earlier, Alex called for Amanda and wanted Amanda to come, but she was set on not going. So we try to drop off Kaila, without being noticed, but I don't think it worked. Oh well, it was funny. Also, when Amanda was trying to take me home, she decided to take the long way...a nice 20 min detour. It was so funny. Basically, today was a fun day."
GM24J1X,female,17,"This song Warning Sign by Coldplay is really good! I was listening to it, and the lyrics are fantastic. I don't know why, but this song just really sticks with me. I think it's great. Here are the lyrics:  A warning sign  I missed the good part then I realized  I started looking and the bubble burst  I started looking for excuses   Come on in  I’ve gotta tell you what a state I’m in  I’ve gotta tell you in my loudest tones  I started looking for a warning sign   When the truth is, I miss you  Yeah the truth is, that I miss you, so   A warning sign  You came back to haunt me and I realized  That you were an island and I passed you by  And you were an island to discover   Come on in  I’ve gotta tell you what a state I’m in  I’ve gotta tell you in my loudest tones  That I started looking for a warning sign   When the truth is, I miss you  Yeah the truth is, that I miss you so  And I’m tired I should not have let you go   Ooooooooooooooooo   So I crawl back into your open arms  Yes I crawl back into your open arms  And I crawl back into your open arms  Yes I crawl back into your open arms"
GM24J1X,female,17,"For the past few days I haven't been doing much. I've just been going to school, and thats about it. Nothing else. Actually, on Monday after school me and Erin went on a date. She treated me to dinner. We both ate huge plates of French Toast. It was really fun. We've just recently started hanging out together outside of school or school-related things. It's cool. We get along really well. Today I didn't do much. I made Amanda laugh a whole bunch tho. We were talking about something as she was driving me home from school, and I said ""Amanda, you should get a For Sale sign and put it in your car, but don't sell it."" and apparently she thought it was one of the funniest things. Her reaction to it was so funny. She just kept laughing. It was great. After school Tommy called me, and asked if I wanted to go to his house and watch a movie with him. I was like 'No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling good' and he was like 'oh, what's wrong?' and since I didn't want to explain, I was like 'you wouldn't understand' and tommy was all like 'is it special girl stuff?' and I just laughed, and he was like 'that's gross..why'd you tell me that? you could have just lied to me' and then we both laughed, and he was like 'well maybe some other time then' and laughed some more. it was really funny. Oh, yesterday in math it was really funny. Vetta and I were talking, and we noticed that my bangs were really long, so we decided to cut them. I asked kroese where his scissors were, and then i asked if Vetta and I could go to the bathroom. He gave me the WEIRDEST look, so I was like 'oh, my bangs are long. we're gonna go cut them!' and he just laughed. so after we cut them, we're walking out of the bathroom, and I'm like 'thanks vetta...i couldn't have done it alone' and this guy hears us, and he just shakes his head. it was really funny. well, that is really all that has been going on. maybe i'll have some interesting things to blog about soon!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yeah, I really don't know where my title came from. I had no ideas, and I saw my bottle of Aquafina water, so I went from there. Today was pretty good. It was boring, but looking back on the day, it seemed to have gone pretty well. In Spanish, I was the only one to get a 100% on our quiz...so that was cool. I took a test in calculus today, and I think I did ok. Computers was boring, as always. Psychology was kind of uneventful as well. Physics, we didn't do much. I was done testing my pendulum experiment, so I just talked the whole class time. It was fun. Then we had an assembly on drugs...that was boring. Today I wore my  Kiss Me, I'm Irish  shirt! I got two offers...Steven and Holli. Haha. I showed people my prom pics, and they all said they were cute. Tommy said I looked pretty in them, so that was cool too. I tried to show Ryan the pics today, figuring he'd like to see them since he was in them, but I guess I was wrong. He could have cared less. That is what makes me mad about Ryan. He annoys me all the time, and I'm finding myself disliking him more and more. Pretty soon it's going to get to the point where I wont care, and I'll just let our friendship fall apart. Whatever. I'm going to go shopping with Tera later today, so that should be fun. I don't have too much homework, I just have to study for a physics test....nothing TOO terrible. Hmm...that is really all about my day, so I think I'll be wrapping this up now.  SIDE NOTE: The song We Used To Be Friends by The Dandy Warhols is a good song. I like some of the lyrics:  Now everybody needs some time And everybody knows The rest of the lines In everybody else's show"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Wow, this is my first blog. Pretty exciting. (not really) Martin suggested I make one, and well I had nothing better to do so I listened. Yeah, don't really know what to write. My day was pretty boring...did nothing really. Talked to a few ppl online, and that was about it. Oh, my sister attacked me with this huge spoon, and left a bump on the back of my head. Damn her. Hopefully tomorrow will be more fun...or fun at all. Whatever."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a pretty good day. I don't have any homework for the weekend, so that is always nice. School was kind of uneventful. I was supposed to talk to Marty at lunch today, but I had a Key Club meeting, so I couldn't. I felt bad because he wanted to talk to me about something. Oh well. I guess I'll find out later. Oh, after school I was talking to him on the phone, and then it beeped, so I switched lines. And who was it on the other line?! Bobby! Yeah, so we're talking, then a half hour rolls by and I realize that I forgot about Marty!! I felt soooo bad! I told Marty what happened, and he was mad. I don't blame him, but I really did feel bad. Oh well. I just thought it was weird that I talked to Bobby. We never talk, and then he calls me to talk...it was just weird. Oh well...I'm not complaining! After I told Marty I was sorry sooo many times, I went to Amanda's house. I got to drive on the way there. Sure, it was only down the street...but that's like a record for me! I did a really good job too! We watched Never Been Kissed. I LOVE that movie! It is so awesome! Then after that, I came home and here I am! I hope that tomorrow is a good day. I think it should be."
GM24J1X,female,17,"My title was a note that Matt Belding wrote to me today in physics. It was really funny.  That was probably the highlight of my day.  Sad as that may seem. Hmm...what else did I do that was remotely interesting? Not much, I spied on Martin during 5th today. I was really bored. Got new seats in spanish, I sit next to Theran. He was gone today, and he'll be gone tomorrow too for FBLA. Hmm....what else? Oh yeah, I realized today that the reason Ryan sometimes aggravates me and stuff is becuase I find him to be a boring person. haha. Hopefully, he'll never come across this, but if he does, then I'm sorry. It's just how I feel right now. So yeah. That was really about it. So, how about them Blazers?"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I was talking to Josh about something (Hell if I can remember now), and I was telling him how I want romance. It got me thinking about how I really want something that only happens in the movies, to happen to me. I want a romantic moment to call my own. I would fall for any guy who did something so romantic. I dont know exactly what I want, but I just want it. Gosh, I'm such a hopeless romantic. *sigh*"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Marty called me today, and that was an awesome surprise! I haven't talked to him since Friday, so it was nice hearing his voice. Tonight I went to Sapphire's (Alex's) house. We watched Big Brother 5, and The Butterfly Effect. That movie was weird, but it wasn't too bad. It was different seeing Ashton Kutcher play a part like that tho. Tonight was fun...need Echo (I) say more? OH YEAH, THIS IS MY 100TH ENTRY! YAY ME!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I just got done registering for the SATs on June 5th. How lovely! I hate taking tests, but oh well. At least Alex will be taking this one with me! I don't actually know how that helps me, but oh well. Today was a boring day. It was just your typical Monday. Mondays are always mundane. Ok, I must be tired or something because I found that to be really funny. I need to get out more, I swear. Today it was really funny. I was walking with Erin in the hall, and I saw Matt. Me and Matt both gave each other a weird look/smile and then we looked away. Erin noticed that and began laughing, and she was like 'what the heck was that?' Ok, yeah not that funny as I retell it. Oh well. If something interesting happened today, I would talk about it, but since nothing did, I think I'll be done blogging for now."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Adam's Song by Blink 182 -- good song. Anyways, lets see what happened today. Nothing really....3rd period was probably the most interesting by far.  We watched a movie in computers, cuz we couldnt use the computers cuz they were needed to do testing. I asked Mrs. Parker to go to my locker...yeah, I was gone for 50 minutes. I spent that time with Holli and Theran in their 3rd period class since they just have leadership. It was fun. Then Ben came in, so him and Holli were talking...and that left me and Theran. We just talked about various stuff, but it was fun. In math, lunch, and psychology I shared some really good laughs with Erin. We have too much fun together over nothing, it's crazy. Oh, in physics I started a class discussion involving sam and his sexual orientation....so that was interesting to say the least. I didn't think it would catch on with the whole class and everyone would get involved. I felt somewhat bad for Sam, but then I didn't. I dont know. I think I may have annoyed Holli today...not too sure. I think it started when I tried to turn the situation around on her. Sometimes I think she takes things just a little too seriously. Like today when me and Theran told her we were going to be physics partners, and that I was going to ditch her, she believed me. I don't know if she is just really gullible or if she honestly thinks I would do something like that to her, because I wouldn't....she should know that too. Oh well, I don't know. Hmm...that was pretty much the extent of my day. There wasn't really anything to it. Just a little boring with a few funny moments thrown in describes it fairly well."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Amanda came back for awhile tonight. We played Jeopardy and listened to music and just were being dorks. it was fun. jeopardy...ah, good times with that! i dont know. haha. well, thats really it from me for today!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"I didn't blog yesterday because I forgot. I know Chubbs (Alex) gets mad when I don't blog daily! Yesterday wasn't too eventful. I didn't really do much of anything. Chubbs (we got that from Happy Gilmore) and Holli came over and we watched a movie. Oh, they also colored in coloring books. It was funny. Then we got bored so we decided to call Josh. Yeah, that was kind of interesting. Josh thought it was weird, I'm sure. Oh well. Who already doesn't think me and my friends are weird? Hmm...not much else happened yesterday. That was about it."
GM24J1X,female,17,"On Friday I spent the night at Tera's house. It was pretty fun. On Saturday I went to Marty's house, and so that was fun too. Today I did nothing because I wasn't feeling too good. Tomorrow Amanda will be coming over in the evening for some Jeopardy and I Love the 90s. That is what has been happening in the wonderful world of Erica lately. I'll blog more later when I feel up to it."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Tonight Alex and I spent some ""quality"" time with Sammy Harrison. Haha. We accompanied him on a shopping expedition. As odd as it was, it was fun too. There were some pretty weird/odd moments, but that just added to the greatness of it all. Perhaps Alex and I will have to do it again sometime."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Hmm...my mood has improved since yesterday so that is good. I have been REALLY tired lately. And for anyone who likes math, here is an equation to show that: Erica + tiredness = badness. It is quite simple really. When I got home from school yesterday I went straight to my bed and fell asleep for a bit. The storm yesterday was pretty cool. I love thunder and lightning. It kicks ass. I went out in the rain yesterday and played in it for a bit. That was fun. Today I have to be at school from 6 to 8 tonight for the lame science fair. Oh well. Sadly, I would have nothing better to do anyway. I need some sleep...hmmm...I've recently discovered that I like the song Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand. It is a cool song. The music video is a little weird however. I SHOULD REALLY be doing homework for physics right now, but I'm not. Oh well. Hmm...I haven't checked Josh's blog yet today, but then again I won't be surprised if he hasnt updated. Oh well. I need to figure out what my plans are for this weekend. I might do something with Holli and Erin during Friday since we wont be having school. Also, I MIGHT do something with Amanda on saturday, and tera. However, that one im not really sure about. If we dont do it this saturday, we will some other time tho. Hmm...well I think I'll be going so I can do my stupid homework."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Let's think. Thinking is good. Good is the opposite of bad.  Bad people go to jail. Jail is where my daddy is. ok....I don't know. I'm weird. Moving on! Yesterday I went to Marty's house. We watched The Exorcist. Yeah, I really don't understand why my mom said I couldn't see that movie. It wasn't scary at all. A little weird, but I didn't see the big deal to it. Oh well. After Marty's house, i went to Holli's house. It was the weirdest thing! I was talking to Holli and I stuck my hand in my back pocket and I felt a little piece of paper from a gum wrapper. I take it out and unfold it, and I notice there is a phone number written on it. I can't remember whose number it is, or why the hell it is in my pocket, so Holli suggested I call it.  Wanting to solve the mystery, I decide to do just that. Out of all the people whose number it could be, it turned out to be Josh! Isn't that crazy? I thought it was really weird. I have no idea why the hell his number was in my back pocket. It makes no sense to me. It was really weird. Oh well. Me and Holli also called Harley and talked to him for a bit. I haven't talked to him in a long time, so it was nice. He should be coming home late this summer. I miss him. Oh well. This summer I may get a job working at a mortgage company, helping to do office work. I'm not too sure yet tho. Hmm...well that was the extent of my weekend so far. My grandparents are over right now because they are going to eat dinner over. So my plan is to be on the computer so I don't have to talk to them too much. They are kind of boring. Oh well. I'll be sorry I didn't spend enough time with them once they die. Awful, but true."
GM24J1X,female,17,"The things I do for Josh...haha j/k. He ""suggested"" I should blog, so I did. Happy? Alex will be pleased too tho. I dunno. Anyways, on to my blogging. Blog is a funny word. Bloggidy blog blog. I dunno. I talked to Josh on the phone for about 3 hours today, and it was nice. We talked about seeing each other (which we really need to do!) I am anxious for that. I just think it's really weird how everything turned out. I mean, we went to the same school for like a year and a half and we never once saw each other. It seems almost too surreal...but I believe everything happens for a reason, so yeah. We'll just have to wait and see how things go. To be honest I was a little scared about the '143' thing with Josh at first, but then we talked about it so all is well. Tomorrow is school and I'm glad. It will be nice seeing my friends again. I don't remember if I said that in my previous blog or not. Oh well....the handfull of people who actually read this are used to me repeating things by now. I don't really have much of anything else to say, so I'm callin it quits."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I am so bored right now! Ugh! Oh well. I'm just chattin with Josh and Marty. Nothing too exciting happened today. School was pretty average! Today at lunch was REALLY weird. I was just talking to Alex and she asked if Mark was short for something. And I was like ""yeah, my dad's real name is Markington!"" Not that funny, right? Well at lunch I found it soooo funny! I was laughing a ton! It was really weird. It was also weird in psychology today. We had a free day, and I was bored, so I was just quietly working. Chris Nugent walks up to me, and he says in a soft caring voice ""Is everything ok, Erica?"" and I was like ""yeah, everything's fine"" and he was like ""Ok, you just had me wondering"" It was really nice and funny. I didn't even think he knew my name. haha. Hmm...interesting stuff. I think Josh thought I liked Theran. haha. Good stuff. Oh well....doesn't matter. Hmm....well I'm running out of ideas to blog about, so I think I'll be going."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I've noticed that my past two entries both start with 'Wow' and end with 'Whatever'. That is gonna stop. Repetition is no good. Aniwaiz...even tho I already posted today, I've decided to post again. Besides, the last entry wasnt really about my day...more about prom. Actually there really is no point of writing about my day today because it was pretty boring. I talked to Josh for a bit on the phone (haha....8 inches??), oh and i cleaned my dresser! FINALLY! I was proud. My dog Lacie attacked my dog Missy. Those stupid dogs just need to go away! ugh! Amanda stopped by for a bit while she was taking a walk. I felt lazy when she came over cuz I was still wearing my pajamas...and it was the afternoon. haha. ""INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE! INSANE IN THE BRAIN!"" I've decided that orange juice and saltine crackers kick major ass. Conan O'Brian...he's the best. haha. I dont know why, but ya gotta love him. It was really weird...when I was cleaning off my dresser, there was a pack of Juicy Fruit gum...but I dont ever remember buying Juicy Fruit. I'm more of a mint type of girl. It confused me...well thats enough from me. Holla!"
7DEUROP,female,37,"So I'm still working on my ""new look"", but I'm good with it.  As I mentioned (and I think I've lost some of my previous blogs....too bad) I was spending the day at my old Alma Mater yesterday to watch my son kick some ass.  I'm sorry I shouldn't refer to it that way but if you could only see him ""spar"" (fight).  Most moms get all stressed out about their kids going up to fight....for some reason, I feel completely comfortable with it (now anyways). I'm just so confident of my son and while anything can happen....he's still not at the point where he's allowed to do ""head kicks"".  So I think with that in the recess of my mind...I'm not freaking....yet!  So we got up at 6:30 Saturday morning, just me and Ted.  We got ourselves ready to go, and while I packed us some snacks and a lunch...we did do our traditional ""Micky Dee's"" (MacDonald's) breaky.  Teddy always gets the Bacon and Egg McMuffin, orange juice and hashbrown and I always opt for the Bacon and Egg Bagel, orange juice, hashbrown and medium coffee.....so bad for you, but so tasty for the tummy!  We headed off to Port Moody Senior Secondary (only a 15 minute right from our home) and entered an stomping ground that I hadn't visited in 19 years!!!  It was so different and yet soooo comfortable.  The lockers were still the same multi-colored beat up lockers and while I was hoping to get down to the office area (to check out my grad pic), I refamiliarized myself with the ""big gym"".  Believe it or not....school was one place that I enjoyed being at and I rarely skipped a class.  Trust me....I was one of those that, should you have known me back then, looked like a ""frequent skipper"".  Anyways.....we signed in and got ready for the tournament.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy going to these with Teddy (same goes for soccer).  Teddy finally got to do his pattern and received a bronze medal.  Could have/should have done better (but I'd never say that to him)...they don't spend a whole lot of time in this area at the TKD school - they focus more on the ""sparring"" side of it.  He was thoroughly not pleased with himself and quickly tucked his medal in his bag.  Later in the afternoon, Teddy was ready to go for his sparring match.  He won it 11-4....against a girl....whom he made cry.  I don't know why the officials did that....normally they don't match male against female.  Then came his second match which was against a boy from Washington.  It was much more of a challenge and they tied 6 a piece.  Unfortately they gave it to the other boy because he was just a little more agressive (it was fair though).  And Teddy walked away with a silver.  Again....he was disappointed....Teddy has been walking away with golds and has a hard time settling with anything else.  I think, it's good to be humbled!  Regardless, I'm proud of my son!  He's the hardest to handle, he's the most difficult on the nerves, he's going to be the most trouble, he's most like me.....and I love him!  with all of my heart!"
7DEUROP,female,37,"Okay, so it's not one word. Tonight I was racing around cleaning things up and getting ready to get out the door to head over to the gym. Did I mention that I  needed  to go to the gym. God bless my kids...but they're a pain in the rectum! So I had had enough of them and needed to GET OUT!      So as I'm cleaning the floor in the kitchen, Krystina starts freaking out and screaming at the top of her lungs....""mama, poo, mama poo!"" So here I am thinking that another ""bobek"" (as we like to call those hard, circular balls of ""stuff"" that somehow find their way out of my daughter's butt) had fallen on the floor...somehow. So I go running over to and find that no, there's no ""bobek"" but something is dripping beneath her. I'm thinking....""hmmm, this is strange, these new Pampers are shit!"" Then I realize that she's not wearing anything but her panties. ""OKAY.....Who the hell took off her diaper and didn't tell me about it?????"" Everyone was silent. I don't know how....unless I was hiding in a mask of Alzeihmers (sp?) and took it off myself without having the brains enough to put another one back on....she managed to slip off the Pull-Up and then put her panties on correctly, without me knowing. When I asked her....she said ""Krystina did it"". So the case of the mysteriously disappeared diaper....remains a mystery - I may find it a month from now...somewhere in the house.      Anyways.... so here she is, dripping and had been dripping from her bedroom to the kitchen (a mere 7 feet) and freaking out about it! Then...she demands she sit on the potty....""okay sure, go ahead....but you're all EMPTY now!!! It's a little too late Princess to be asking to sit on the potty now!!!! Now that you've pissed all over the floor!"" Again, thank you for laminate....cuz all I had to do was wipe (or call the cat) and a bit of antibacterial spray and the job is done!       And hey....at least she now knows what it's like to ""piss her pants""!      Here's a question....""Have you every laughed so hard that you actually (really) peed in yours?"""

7DEUROP,female,37,"It's been a great week and Canada Day so far.  I mean, how the hell can we complain with this gorgeous weather that we're having?!?!  I went to the gym yesterday and had another body composition done.  I'm down from 24% body fat to 21%, I've lost 4 pounds in 3 weeks (120 lbs) and I'm definitely seeing the shape coming in.  I was so pleased with this...so when I came home, of course the first thing I did was tell hubby.  He replied by asking me if I was obsessed and that he was worried I was going to end up like Karen Carpenter.  Oh brother!!!!!!!!!! and Whatever!!!!!  all at the same time!  Blood pressure has stayed the same at 135/87, which I was really hoping would come down....oh well, I'm having fun and I'm feeling good!  I tried to take the boys to see Spiderman 2 yesterday.  It was a 2 hour wait, so we decided to see ""Dodgeball"".  It had some funny parts and pretty stuuuuuuupid parts too.  We had $15 in coupons, so it wasn't like we wasted the money or anything.  Today I got to sleep in...yay!  And then I did a few things around the house....lots of laundry of course, baked more banana bread (I know, I know Cindy - but this heat is killing my bananas, so I had to do something with them!).  And then.......I decided to ""relax"" for a while in the sun, with a good book - I tell you, Stephen King's ""Desperation"" is just awesome!  Anyways, I was out for absolutely no more than an hour and a half (that's 45 minutes to roast each side).  Well ""roast"" is exactly what I did...at least to the chest (but that's probably because it's so damn flat that the sun can find it real easy!).  So needless to say, I'm a roasty toasty marshmellow right now. Ah well, I guess I have my ""start"".  Tony thinks I've gone off the deep end, working out, losing weight, tanning (burning)....I've already asked for the ""boob job"" - kidding!!!! Well I have, but it's just a joke between us.  Hey, as I took a quick peek at the redness on my belly and saw my belly ring...I just realized that I'll be able to buy ""new"" jewellery for my belly at the end of this month!  Woo hoo!  Now just to come up with the money to buy something nice!  Well that's about it for today....I'm going to upstairs and put an ice pack on the burn and watch it sizzle for a while.  lol  Oh, I just crack myself up sometimes.  Yeah.......not!  Oh and P.S.  Teddy's already ""tired"" of the girl that phoned and left a message (at least that's what he's saying).....they haven't even seen each other!  And no, I do not permit dating at this age.  Not until he's 25!  LOL"
7DEUROP,female,37,"Range of motion is coming back, muscles are starting to soften and the constant shaking is becoming less noticeable.  By tomorrow....I may even  be able to close the door to my van without crying out (or using both arms).  Today we did legs.....I still feel them, so I think we'll be okay."

7DEUROP,female,37,"Do you ever just feel like you're ""just there""?   That's how I feel tonight...I don't feel like talking to anyone, all kinds of things are going through my mind, but I don't feel like vocalizing them.  I ""let loose"" on my husband yet I felt so bad for that.  I'm tired yet awake.  I'm content yet anxious.  I'm irritated yet calm.  I'm ""just there"".  I wish the world would go away...and yet I wish the world would embrace me.  I'm lonely yet I don't want anyone close to me.  I'm sad yet I'm very happy.  I think I'm nuts!!!!  That must be it....just plain and simple, freaking out of my mind!   I'm having a glass of wine......to end my day.....tomorrow is another day, a day full of much work, many tantrums, much screaming, many deadlines, more mileage driven, more groundings given, more laundry, more cooking, more ungrateful acceptances, more gray hairs,  more money spent, more bookings made.  Tomorrow is a day full of love, hugs, kisses, tears wiped, diapers changed, innocent mouths fed, simple ""I love you's"" and ""don't forget to brush your teeth"", tomorrow is another day.....a day to remind me that ""I'm there"" for a reason!   Wow.....that's pretty good!   Night."
7DEUROP,female,37,"Today after dinner, I was cleaning things up, checking e-mails, etc. etc. and trying to get out the door to get in a workout.  The phone rang....it said ""private caller""...since I wasn't expecting a call and I didn't know anyone that was listed as a ""private caller"", except for hubby...but he was home, I chose not to answer it.  Then it rang again, and then again, and then again, and then one last time.  Pretty bad of me huh?  Hey, I was rushing...my time is valuable!        Two minutes later Aleks comes up the stairs and asks me, ""Mom, if you phone the emergency will anything happen?"".  I said, ""Pardon me?  Oh no...you didn't?""  ""Okay, Aleks you need to tell me the truth....did you phone 911?"" ""No mom, Teddy did...because he said that if I didn't put something away he would call 911"". And then it hit me as to who ""private caller"" was....it was the 911 department!!!      I called for Teddy  to escort me outside...I already knew the scene I'd face when I opened the door and no-one had even knocked yet.  Sure enough.....a nice, shiny, white, RCMP patrol car had pulled up to my house and two officers stepped out.  I started explaining what had happened.  And then one of the officers basically gave me a look like, ""okay, lady...shut up now...we wanna talk to the kid"".  Teddy just stood there for a few minutes, unable to say anything.  They grilled him....just to make sure that I hadn't threatened him by making him say something that wasn't true.  Then the officer seemed to soften a little and asked Teddy if knew what 911 was for.  Finally he made sure that Teddy understood that if there was a problem....he  should  phone 911 and that it was okay to.      Just before they left the other officer (a female) took down my name, birthdate, phone number and address...you think they wanna send me a birthday card next year?        Kids!!!"

7DEUROP,female,37,"My oldest son is heading off to Middle School for the first time tomorrow.  This is the ""welcome to your new school"" preview day.   I have to say that it saddens me a bit.  It seems not so long ago that I was waddling around, carrying an extra 52 lbs. on me, waiting for my first child to be born. And now....he's heading off to teen-hood. It scares me too....because of how society is nowadays - oh don't get me wrong, I don't worry about him being bullied, not even that he would be the bully, but I do worry about his attraction to teens, the peer-pressure that he'll have to deal with (and he will cave), his love for fast cars and his already too great knowledge of drugs and paraphenelia!  Why does time have to go so fast?  I looked at my youngest today....and she's no longer ""that young"" either - she'll be celebrating her 3rd birthday in 2 weeks.  I had 2 more in between and I feel as though I haven't even enjoyed them to the fullest!  Will time ever slow down?  I guess it will....when I'm old, when the kids are gone, when my garden is filled with beautiful flowers and fresh vegetables ready for the picking.  Until then....I watch and I cherish every moment I have with them and when the time is right....I let them leave the nest.  Good luck Teddy!"

7DEUROP,female,37,"Today was my first day back to church in about a year and a half (except for one service at Easter).  We belong to a very popular, very large church in Burnaby.  Each service holds anywhere from 800 - 1,000 people.  Tony helps out once a month and was gone by 7:00 a.m.  I decided it was a good day to ""get back into it"" and got the kids up and ready to go....not an easy task!  After the service...which was moving (thanks to Pastor John Neufeld) I ran downstairs to pick up Sunday School registration cards for the kids.  There's no point in them just sitting there listening to stuff that they just can't comprehend.  We have such a mixed variety of people in the congretation.  There's this one guy ""Chris""...he rides a harley, has long hair and a moustache/beard and swears like a sailor.  But he knows where he stands and he'll probably have an easier time getting through Heaven's pearly gates then some of the stuffier, high number tithing, stiff colored elders that go there.  My favorite part.....the singing, always has been!  Have to admit.....it was good to be back.  It's good for the soul."
7DEUROP,female,37,"urlLink    Brought to you by Cheddar X   - Wednesday      Would you rather:     Sing country songs buck naked to the PTA or come across your ""art"" photos on a porn site?  - Definitely not sing buck naked...I can't sing anyways, so I'd have to be completely looped!  Maybe someone would ""spot"" me and I'd make some money off my ""art""...then again, maybe not.    Have a biker gang for neighbors or five chatty Chihuahuas within barking distance?  - I could always shoot the Chihuahuas...it would be harder to shoot the biker gang.    Be addicted to sniffing modeling glue or be addicted to huffing butane from Bic lighters?  - WTF?    Lick a 9 volt battery or lick the bottom of your foot?  - Okay, that's just gross....I'd lick the battery...done that before.    Ketchup soup or mustard soup?   - Ketchup soup without a doubt....it's make out of tomato's and I like tomato's.    Live in a great house in a place you don't like or a bad house in a place you love?    -  we bought a bad house in a place we love and made it into a ""nice"" house in a place we love.    Spend a weekend at a spa or spend a weekend camping?  - If it's the Ancient Cedars Spa at the Wickinninish Inn on the island......I'm there!       And finally, just a couple of questions this week to maintain the continuity.     1. What would you host a cable tv program about?  - cooking    2. What or who do you lust for?   - what's with all these trick questions????  Vinny, of course!  lol  and my husband....of course.  :)  and a brand new Corvette.    3. You've got a spare $5,000, what do you do with it?  - pay off my debts and spend a weekend at The Wickinninish Inn.    4.

What was your most memorable first date?  - well there were two....one was a blind date....and I vowed never ever to go on another one again!  But the real ""memorable"" one had to be with my ""now hubby"".  He took me to dinner and then to see the Rolling Stones (Steel Wheels Tour) back in 1989, paid $150.00 per ticket, drove me in his 1966 Ford Fairlaine (beaut of a car) and at the end of the night......gave me a box full of a dozen, long stemmed, red roses (I still have them) and a kiss on my left cheek.  Wait till you hear how he proposed.........    3. Where did you first feel bliss?   - in ""his"" company (hubby's).    4. When did you realize that life really isn't fair, nor does it have to be?  - when I lost my second baby.    5. Why are so many people angry?  - they haven't seen how most of the world lives.    6. How do you make the world a better place?  - the question is....can you?"
7DEUROP,female,37,"I took Aleks to the library today, he took out 6 books on insects and bugs....he's writing a book on them.  I got my hair hacked....I really like it!  Didn't get it coloured though...maybe when Shalah comes back from holidays in August.  Went to the Hannam Korean Market on North Road and bought some cantelope, red currents (which Krystina just loves) and a mini Tae Kwon Do uniform to hang from the car window so everyone can see that I have killer kids in the car!  Went to Michael's and bought a poster frame for the Swan Lake Barbie poster that Krystina got for her birthday.  Checked out ""Planet Organic"" - a new concept in organic shopping.  Shit I should be a sales lady talking like that.  I see no one really liked my picture of Vinny??  That's okay....  Took it easy today....woke up with an extremely swollen, red, hot and painful left knee...I don't know if something bit me? or if I hurt it working out yesterday...although the only work I did with my legs was the Eliptical and wall squats?  Doesn't look/feel very good right now though.  Ah well, I'm going to the doctor's on Monday anyways.  Came home and did a bit of work, cut hubby's hair, dinner, DQ with the kids...all in all, a very nice day to be had."
7DEUROP,female,37,"1. Do you prefer the beach or a pool?    Most definitely the beach....but I'll go to either.   2. What kind of tan are you most likely to get during the summer... a beautiful, bronze, laying out in the sun for hours tan; a gradual, few minutes a day tan; a ""farmer tan"" from working outdoors; or do you just get as red as a lobster and peel the next day?     I've always been pretty good at tanning.....so I'd have to say the bronze type....now just to find the time.     3. Which summertime water activity are you more likely to enjoy the most... boating, jet skiing, waterskiing, swimming or floating down a lazy river on a tube?     Can't waterski (knees), I've never jet skiied but would definitely love doing it.....I love speed!     4. What is your favorite picnic food?     Okay, you're asking someone who loves food in general!  I would say...some good chicken, nice fresh salad, a fresh bun, ice tea (oh heck...make mine a Long Island) and a nice blueberry pie!     5. Do you know how to cook on a barbeque grill?     Course!  Don't you?  lol      I've been so super dee duper busy....things should calm down a bit now....hence the questionaires!       Night!"
7DEUROP,female,37,"Okay, now you gotta picture this.  It's kind of sad but really, if you think about it, it's pretty funny!       Yesterday...I was busily working in my gardening, getting rid of all of those pesky weeds.  I think Krystina was inside throwing a temper tantrum and Aleks was riding around on this electrical scooter thingy that he and Teddy got from my parents.       So anyways....I'm digging away and he's whizzing by me, around the pond, back up again, over and over.  Well this one time....""at band camp"" (kidding), I decided to look up for whatever reason and look at him.  I basically watched this kid speed by me, little skinny body bumping down the little hill, over the wire flower bed fence, into bark mulch, over a plant and straight into the wooden fence.  I mean straight into it!  And then it was over.....       He ended up on his side, scooter dead silent and blood curdling screams coming out of his skinny little lungs.  He just scraped his knee is all but blood was definitely coming out.  It took all that I had to keep from bursting out in laughter and all I could say to him was, ""What the heck are you doing....your fruitcake?  Where the heck did you get your license to ride that thing?"".       He was back on it today....so no worries.  He may be skinny, but if you've ever seen him compete against a boy double his weight in Tae Kwon Do...""you can knock him down but you can't knock him out!"""

7DEUROP,female,37,"I might as well not sleep tonight....I have so much that I need to accomplish before Krystina's big birthday party tomorrow.  This morning, I'm sitting here enjoying my jav and writing in my blog but then it'll be time to move my sore ass (it's sore from the second round of squats and leg presses) and get this house cleaned....it's been a while, I just haven't had time and if I don't want my mother to bitch about how ""her grandchildren"" are living in a dust-pool, well..... anyways... I have to go to the grocery store and get a few supplies for the dinner that I'm not really making, yeah whatever....you bring whatever you like mom, doesn't mean that I really enjoy  everything  you make either!  I'm going to make a couple of chicken braids, some chicken legs (for the kids), veggies, salad, rice (jasmine), a ""Babka"" (an old fashion European bundt cake), some appi's - I'll have to pick up the ""Swan Lake"" birthday cake tomorrow morning.  I'll have 12 adults and 10 kids here......OMG!  So I gotta do that, plus decorate, plus wrap the presents that the boys got for Krystina (or maybe they can do it themselves this year). Do laundry of course!  I didn't really buy her any gifts...she got new ""butterfly"" curtains from Ikea and some little nic nacs to decorate her room with, but goody bags and the party itself doesn't cost $10 so, I figure...she'll get enough from everyone else.  She's getting a bike from her grandparents anyways...that's a pretty nice gift for a 3 year old.  So there you go....I managed to clean my kitchen, cupboards, fridge, oven, already.  Tony said he's going to try and come home early to help....I'm not holding my breath dear.  I'll be checking my blog during the course of the day, I can't not...I love keeping myself up to date on my friends and reading what they have to say.  So have a great day everyone!  :)"
7DEUROP,female,37,"So I went to the doctor's today to go over the results of my most recent x-rays.  As I suspected....nothing was to be had!  Well of course not, it's not my bones that are giving me trouble....it's all the other stuff....you know the stuff that doesn't show up on x-rays! like ligaments, tendons, cartilage.  So this is what he said.  He suspects now that it's not my cartilage, but a frontal ligament that's messed up on my right leg.  He did take notice of the difference in size in my two quads and showed me some exercises I can do to help build the smaller one up.  The pain and swelling that started on the weekend in my other knee (the one with the torn ligament) was probably the cartilage right under the knee cap that's been irritated.  So he wrote me a prescription for some extremely expensive anti-inflammatory and told me to...........exercise more!  Uh yeah okay.  I'll add an hour to my already daily exercise routine.  Oh and I'm probably looking at another 6 months, just to see the surgeon (it's already been 6 months) - I haven't even met the guy yet!  So I'll probably be retired and unable to walk by the time I finally have this flipping surgery!  I have a headache....time for bed."
7DEUROP,female,37,"Oh one quick comment.  Met with the trainer at the gym today....it was awesome!  He took all my measurements etc.  Turns out (and I could already tell) that one thigh is 1/2"" smaller than the other.....I had surgery on the smaller one 20 years ago and have overcompensated for that leg over the years.  Now I end up like the old pirate guy....with one skinny wooden leg (not that mine is wooden)....k, I'm not being very funny right now.....time to hit the sack!  Ciao."

Do you believe that you 'fit' the profile of your astrological star sign?  - While I'm not a huge believer in the whole idea....yeah, I do belive that I do ""fit"" the profile.           4.

What is one thing (or place) that you would like to do (or see) that you have not yet done (or seen?)  - The list is too long!

7DEUROP,female,37,"Now there's a flashy title for a webpage?!      This was brought up by a very good  urlLink friend    of mine.  I noted to her in a drunken conversation that we were having on this fine evening (me - drunk on wine, her - drunk on water)...well, to be honest with you....I don't even remember what it was that I ""noted"" to her.  But the title ""ILoveMeat.com"" came up and she said that it would be a good title for a webpage...especially since my dad's a butcher!        Did I mention that my dad's a butcher?      My dad....the greatest man on earth (well at least in my eyes), next to Jesus (cuz you know he walked these soils), is most definitely and has been for the past 30 years, a butcher!  He is the finest man that one would ever come across.....he's incredibly hardworking, exremely supportive (when his wife isn't around), always welcoming and always happy (again when his wife isn't around).  I love my dad!  It'll be a very sad day when he leaves this earth...I pray that he'll go onto Heaven....but I'm not the ""judger"".  Until then.....I love him and I always will.      Okay anyways......my dad is a butcher.  Every week I put in a ""meat order"". Every week he brings home 75% of what I ask for and 25% of what I don't ask for.  But I always get 100% of my order!  Last week, I asked for goulash meat.....I got a chunk of this red, bloody piece of flesh that I had to take into my hands and cut, all the while feeling the knife penetrate each layer of muscle fiber.  I made ""Curried Beef Stew""....it was deadly.      Last week I also asked for 6 pork chops and 5 New York steaks....I got just that.  We ate those on Sunday and on Monday....BBQ'd, of course.      Sometimes I get ground beef....sometimes it's really bloody, sometimes it's not.      Every week, I ask for 3 x 200 grams of some sort of lunch meat....every week, I get just that.  But he surprises me....sometimes I get Cooked Ham, Lyoner and Turkey Breast, sometimes I get Cooked Ham, Genoa Salami and Pastrami, and other times I get, Cooked Ham, Crackow Salami and Beer Sausage...but I always get my Cooked Ham!  That's cuz dad knows what I like.      This week I also got some cheddar cheese and then to boot....he threw in some broccolli, tomatoes and butter lettuce...who would've ever thought that I could get that stuff through a butcher?!?!?  lol.      Today we picked out a new phone.....he bought himself a new Samsun A650.  I have a Samsung 406 (I think)....I never bought it....someone bought it for me (that's another story)....I will never get rid of it.      Back to my dad.....you'd think that will all the meat that I see....I'd be sick of the stuff....never!

When shopping for purses do you have a hard time finding exactly what you want?  - I shop for backpacks....not purses.  How much is the most you have ever spent on a purse?  - $60.00  Is your husband allowed to go into your purse?  - Yeah...but he never does, he just stands by it and waits until I get whatever he needs.  Does your husband ever ask you to put things in your purse so as he doesn't have to carry anything like his cell phone or sunglasses?  - Yup.

7DEUROP,female,37,"Today I was getting ready for my workout and since I have 6 loads of laundry to fold, I had to resort to a bra that I haven't worn for a while.    Well, let me tell you....I'm not sure why I even bothered!  I tried to collect as much skin as I could to try and fill out the air pockets that I had just strung over my shoulders.  There was barely enough there to fill half the cup.  I thought well it'll just flatten out when I put on a t-shirt....not!  You could see the bra material clumping and looking as though I had stuck cotton balls at the points.  It was not a pretty sight!  When I was at my heaviest (not pregnant), I was easily a ""C"" cup.  Nice size but of course (and this is the case for me) bigger boobs means bigger hips!  And I had those too.  When I was nursing my babes...I was about a ""D"" cup...a little too big, not to mention painful.  Now...babes are growing, no more in the future (100% sure of that) and I'm barely an ""A"" cup!  So to that I sing.....""Oh where, oh where, have my boobies gone, oh where, oh where can they be?""  Well, at least I don't have to worry about any black eyes when I'm running around!

7DEUROP,female,37,"This is actually pretty funny....my parents were having hardwood floors put in...this of course, was because of the demands of my mother.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the floors that they already had.  Nobody fell through them, they weren't covered in green shag and they were actually quite pleasing to the eye - but noooooooo, she had to have hardwood floors put in.  She just had to ""top"" our laminate floors with something better.       Anyways.......the idiot that was installing the floor, that gave them such ""a deal"" ended up screwing them pretty bad.  He was misleading in the total cost of materials, would show up ""whenever"", would leave without saying a word....just left, wouldn't show up at all.  To boot, my parents asked him if it would be better to paint the walls before the floor went in, or after.  He said before was just fine.  So they spent hours and hours and hours painting the walls in a beautiful darkish brown, Benjamin Moore shade.  And now......they have like 20 - 25 holes in the freshly painted walls.  Not just little pin holes....we're talking golf ball size holes!  AND......their brand new ""black"" furniture.....has holes in it too (around 6 - 8).  This was all because of the carelessness of the installer and the tool that he was using.  Although looking at the damage, you'd think it had been done on purpose.       So anyways........they fired him!  And now, they're stuck with all the damage.  My dad found a place that would be able to repair the furniture.  So Tony was asked to come up and take the armoire and dresser in his 2000 Ford Ranger pickup (hardly a ""moving"" vehicle).         So they get the furniture in the back, have it strapped in snug (my mom even checks it out and gives it the okay).  Tony pulls away and drives to the repair shop, passes by Coquitlam Centre (a major shopping mall here), drives by the bus depot and under the railroad overpass and then KABOOM!  He loses the dresser on the highway!  Nobody stops to help him.  Cars go zipping by driving over splinters of wood, thudding over broken legs from the dresser.  Tony risks life and limb to pick up the one major piece that he can sort of save.  It's heavier then stink but somehow manages to get it in the back of the pick up.       He manages to take it to the shop and is told....sorry, there's not much we can do, it'd be cheaper just to go and buy a new one.       This is all because ""she"" had to have new floors."

7DEUROP,female,37,"So I had my meeting today, which ended up being a 3 hour affair.  But it turned out way better than I had thought and we even shared some chuckles amongst ourselves.         Unfortunately, I also walked out of there with a bigger pile of work to finish.  I'm feeling  a little overwhelmed and anxious....not because I don't think I can do it, cuz I know I can -  it's just that I already have so much on my plate and I'm trying really hard to make the summer ""semi-fun"" for the kids.  I know come September and yuckier weather....things'll be different.       When I look at what I've got....it's seriously a full-time job (which I love) and I'm trying to stretch myself to be 100% available for the kids.  I'm starting to feel a little ""worn"" and I think my emotions are being affected too...just because I'm finding that I'm choking up for the silliest of things.  My only ""time to myself"" is when I workout and/or when I blog.  And yes, I did go for a workout today....I really didn't want to go, but I did and I feel that much better for it.       Tony and I had to do Teddy's paper route for him today....so as I was BBQ'ing dinner and Tony walked in the door, I reminded him that they needed to be ""put together"".  He says....""I'd really rather just sit down and veg"".  I looked at him and said, ""yup, so would I"".  He says...""my day went non-stop"".  I looked at him and said, ""yup, so did mine"".  He got the hint and while I finished up a dinner of one of his favorites (curried rice with chicken) (the BBQ was for the kids), he put the papers together and we delivered them ""together"" after dinner.       Anyways...I'm not complaining, hey I'm building my own business.  A year and a half ago I was worried that I wouldn't make enough money doing this, and now.....I think I've done pretty good for myself.  Krystina's in school in 2 years and if I can just hold it together until then....I'm laughing!  People would kill to make what I do, while working at home, in their pajamas!       Plus.....I'm really missing my ""big boy"".         I have another meeting at 9:30 in the a.m., then off to my father-in-law's to take him shopping and then I think I'll take the kids to the water park before I settle down for more work and a workout.  So.....I'm signing out."
7DEUROP,female,37,"The other day I saw a man vacumming (yes you heard me right) his driveway.....with an ""upright""!  There's this woman who drives up and down our street, honking her horn the whole way....maybe it wouldn't be so strange, if our street wasn't as quiet as it is - we probably get 30 cars drive by in total, per day!  There's a woman at the gym who wears a ""parka"" when she works out....no joke!  Even in warm weather!  I once saw a woman, dressed very ""office like"", very intellectually on a very busy street in Vancouver hoarking on the sidewalk....just like a man!  This isn't strange....but it's really gross....the other morning Tony went downstairs to the laundry room, in his bare feet and then stepped on something that felt like a small, plastic bag that was sealed and had some air in it.  The ""item"" went ""pfoof"" and when Tony looked down, he noticed it was a slug that had crawled in and it's guts propelled out both ends when he stepped on it.  Ugh!!!!!!!!!!  I once sent to grab the garbage bag that was in the can outside and stuck my finger right through a slug!!!  I still get shivers thinking about it.....it took me an hour to get the sliminess and goo off my finger!  :)"

7DEUROP,female,37,"So we took little Rocky to the vet today.  Here, when you buy a pet through the SPCA you get a free vet check if you do it within 3 days after purchase.  Anyways, it was good timing because our little feline friend was definitely not feeling too great.  He'd been coughing a little since we brought him home and today....he was just not himself.  Slept and slept and slept, threw up a couple of times and just was not in the mood for anything.       He got his look over and everything was fine except that the Dr. could hear a bit of raspiness in his throat/chest.  So out come the antibiotics.  Plus he had a fever (I had to witness the little guy get a thermometer stuck up his ass...""meoooooow""!) and was already getting dehydrated (they injected some fluids under his skin to ""rehydrate"" him).       Well he threw up a couple more times and it was a comical sight to give a cat antibiotics....but I see just a little bit of ""perkiness"" coming back....is that a good thing?       But the most important thing......no fleas!"

He's an indoor cat but it quickly being converted into wanting to be an ""outdoor"" cat!      Went for a workout last night....not sure why this week is killing me.  Did a lower body workout on Tuesday and I'm still in pain.  It's all good though.  There was a guy there wearing headphones (like who doesn't) but no, these weren't any old headphones...these were those really big (bigger than the one's you wear for ear protection) headphones....looked a little outdated.  And tell me....why do people do one set on a machine and then socialize for the next 15 minutes at it and then do one more set before they move on!  Like hello!!! there are others around.

7DEUROP,female,37,"Well it's over!  As you can see by the pictures....she looks pretty darn happy, doesn't she?  I can't believe that three years have gone by....better yet, I can't believe that almost 11 have gone by since Teddy!  The evening was pretty much what I expected it to be.  It wasn't horrible (or maybe that's just cuz I expected it and have gotten so accustomed to some of the garbage that goes on).  My parents and the first family friends arrived at 5:30.  My parents brought some food (prime rib, schnitzels and a few chicken wings oh, and some ""Russian eggs"" - they're quite good, very eye appealing) and Tony and I helped them bring it up.  My sister-in-law also brought some chicken wings (hers were better than my mother's).  My sister-in-law was late.....1 1/2 hours late!!!!  We finally sat down to eat at 7:15.  The table was full of food....I made the chicken braids (2) and a bunch of other stuff.  Made sure there was beer, wine (red and white), brandy, rum and vodka in the house. (Oh I also squeezed a knee x-ray today)?!?!?    Anyways....first thing she (my mother) says (as she sees my sister-in-laws chicken wings).  ""Why the hell did I spend 1/2 my day in the kitchen making my chicken wings""?  Um sorry, she made 3 times as much as you and it didn't take her 1/2 the day?  But she said it with such a bitter tongue.  I just looked at her and said ""It's time to eat now""!  She bitched about this and that and sure enough, she told Tony that I'm too skinny and need to be ""fattened"" up!  Whatever.  Then she didn't say not a single word about the newly painted, renovated, decorated, kids rooms and main bathroom....Extremely hard to miss!  Unless you're fucking blind!  After I was the last one to sit down and shovel some food in my stomach (I ended up eating with my plate on my lap, cuz there was no room).  She quickly started with her demands for me to get up and start cleaning up the dishes and put out the eggs. ""You get up and starting cleaning up.  When's the last time you had 22 people in your house?!?!?!""  A good friend of mine was over as well.  She's very forthright and direct and I had a feeling that her and my mother might rub the wrong way.  It actually started out really well and I took a sigh of relief.  Then my the end of the evening.....they ""scratched""!!  My mother corralled me into the bathroom (that she still hasn't commented on) and said to me, as she grabbed my arm....""that woman might be funny, but she's poison!  And you should not have her in your house.""  Well I don't fucking thing so!  This is my house, not yours, mine, we're paying for it, you're the guest and right now.....I shouldn't have you in my house!  What an awful thing for her to say!  And with that....(no, I didn't actually say that to her) she got her sweater and left with my dad.  There's so much more to the story...those are just a couple of things.  But like I said, the evening actually wasn't too bad....or maybe I really have become desensitized.  I don't like my mother, I don't like the fact that I don't like her...but she makes it very difficult for anyone to like her - they've lost almost all of their friends because of my mother.  Ah well, I still have my brood and the smile on my little girls face and the excitement that she expressed all day, makes life and it's ""downs"" so very well worthwhile!  Tony and I finally hit the sack at 3:30 a.m.  We sat for the last hour and had another (yes, I said another) bottle of wine and chatted about the kids, the party, and love.  We head off to Buntzen Lake in the morning with Teddy's class to enjoy a day of sun, water and picnicking!  Krystina has already packed her ""beach supplies"".  Will post pics later."

7DEUROP,female,37,No seriously!  I felt something crawling on my sore but and sure enough it's an ant!  How did it get in there?  Well it's life is over....sorry to say!  LOL.
7DEUROP,female,37,"Sorry folks....I've been away.....no, actually I've been slaving away!  Things have calmed down just a tad and I decided to give myself a ""night off"".  A night where I could just ""veg"".  I haven't sat down and watched the tube in over 3 weeks now and decided I would watch an episode of ""Friends"" after everyone had gone to sleep.  It was a repeat.  So here's a lo-down of what I've been up to:  Friday:  Worked during the day, made dinner and then raced off to my neighbor's daughters' dance recital.  It was really nice to watch and be with them, until I saw one of the performers.  She was a girl of no more than 8 years of age.  When I saw her....my heart ached.  She was nothing more than skin and bones - trust me, there's a difference between being ""skinny"" and being ""anorexic"" and she was definitely ""anorexic""!  I was once bulemic (in my teens) but I've read and seen horror stories on anorexia nervosa and for a child (girl) of such a young age to have this disorder....well, it makes me angry that society, media, etc. etc. has done this to so many of our youngsters.  Anyways....kind of put a damper on the evening.....I will always remember that little girl and will always hope that she gets well.  Saturday:  Well......let me tell you about Saturday!!!  It was a day like no other!  First of all, I'm already tired cuz I went back to work when I came home from the recital.  The kids were taking their time and they had to be at TKD at 10:00 (it was now 9:40).  I parked the van (the newest vehicle I've ever owned), my 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport, in Onyx, in the garage to keep it cooler and because I figured....we have a garage, why not use it!  Unfortunately the garage door is rather narrow and I have to be very careful not to take off my side-view mirrors as I go in and out.  So anyways.....I'm rushing the kids, we're all loaded up and I start backing up the van.  Okay, we're doing alright, we got the mirrors through, so I step on the gas....I always do this, could almost do it blindfolded.  Then...... BAM! .  My fricken coffee spills all over the carpet (a full mug, of course), the kids gasp and I do anything not to yell out ""FUCK""!  I knew exactly what I had done.  You see the night before, when I went to the dance recital, I took Tony's company truck. When I came home, I parked it just a little ways away from the edge of the drive way....too far away from the edge.  Cuz I just rammed the rear end of my beautiful ""taxi"" into my husband's company pick up!!!  ""Oh shit"", I say under my breath!  I get out....walk around and check out the damage.....not good!  I run inside and tell the husband....he just glares.  I leave...for my own good.  Well the damage is pretty severe....well over $1,000 for the truck and well over $2,000 for the van!  Thankfully I have ""Roadstar"" and haven't had an accident or done anything this stuuuuuuupid in the 20 years that I've been driving....so I'm okay, insurance wise...just have to pay the $500 deductible!  Which I don't have right now.  The worst part..........my neighbour was outside and saw the whole thing!  All he said was ""Ouch"".  The insurance adjuster thought it was pretty funny.....especially when she asked ""on what street did this happen?"" and I replied ""um....in my driveway"".  Oh well....live and learn.  It's only a material possession.  Then....I'm supposed to go for an x-ray on my right knee....the requisition form says they're open from 10 - 2.  Great...plenty of time...I live home at 12:40, get there at 12:58.  ""Oh, I'm sorry....we're done for the day"".  ""But the form says 10 - 2?""  ""Oh that's our old hours....it's been 9 - 1 for a year now""  Ugh!  Went to the gym to work off my frustrations...came home and worked until 2:30 in the a.m.  Sunday:  Did the church thing, did the lunch at the parents thing, came home and went back to work until 2:30 in the a.m.  Ran out of ink and paper at 2:00...freaked, went to bed.  Monday:  Raced to Staples, got my ink and paper.  Came back home to finish printing off financial statements.  Couriered them out at noon, went to the gym, came home, took the kids to TKD, made dinner in sweltering heat, folded laundry.....went numb.  And here I am once more.....semi-sane, relaxed and ready to go to sleep."
7DEUROP,female,37,"Take a look at the time....in reality where should I be right now?  In bed!  Where else?  I have to get up for 8:00 and I'm still sitting here staring at my computer screen.  I did a bit of work tonight but all I can think about is working on my blog....ugh, I need a good couple of days to myself to learn things.  Thanks for your advice Cindy in referring me to the HTML Goodies site.       Have you ever been so intently doing something, ie. staring at your computer screen, when all of a sudden something makes a noise and it scares the crapola out of you?  I'm sitting reading about ""unzipping"" files and all of a sudden the VCR decides to go into ""rewind"".  No one else is up...not even the cat.  And all of a sudden things are happening in this house.  It's like an episode out of ""Poltergeist""!       I miss Teddy.  I've written to him 3 times already......yeah, I know....""give my head a shake"".       I have to meet with an accountant on Wednesday (he's cool) and one of my (his) clients.  It's the biggest client I have....I'm actually pretty nervous.  It's to go over the year-end file that I just completed for them and I'm just hoping that everything looks okay.  I don't know why...but I've never like sitting in on meetings.  Oh well...it's a time to ""dress up"" anyways....it's been a while since I've worn ""office attire"".  I just hope that the temperature here doesn't spike again.       I take the cat to the vet for our ""free vet check"" compliments of the SPCA.  I'm gonna stuff that little furball into it's box and get it a good ""once over"".  Actually he's making a funny coughing sound and I don't know if it's ""furballs"" or if it might have that common feline virus in the respiratory system.  I don't know much about cats....I've always had dogs.  Well no, that's not true....I had a kitten once...it was a tiny little thing and one day my sister opened the front door and the fluffball ran out, got attacked by a Siberian Husky and had it's guts ripped apart.  Then I had another one....but I had to give it away cuz the house where the other kitten got chewed up at, was sold and so my sister (who let my first cat out and gave her her death sentence) gave this cat to her friend who...ended up keeping her for 18 years until she dropped dead from old age.  At least this one is pooping very nicely in it's litter box....I had to clean it out today....you gotta love technology and how you can go in with your scooper and scoop up clumps of poop and peep and you don't have to dump the whole box of that gravel stuff out.       Did I mention that I once had a bird?  Yeah, it was just a little yellow budgie....one day I noticed that it had something growing on its beak.  I took it to the vet...I was told that it can a cancerous growth on its beak and the best thing to do was to ""put it to sleep"".  I cried, but I told the vet that I had to take it home for a few more days so that I could say my goodbyes.  I came home the next day and my dad told me that ""Buddy"" was gone.  Rather than spending $35 on ""euthanizing"" a bird....he sprayed it with air freshener and killed it.       Oh and did I tell you I had a dog once....oh never mind, we'll leave that one alone."

7DEUROP,female,37,"Who the heck invented ""heels"" and why do we (women....well, come to think of it, some men too) shove our beautifully painted toes into these things?         Yesterday, Tony and I went to a wedding at a gorgeous golf and country club.  It was an outdoor wedding....I am still thankful that the wedding was at 10:30 in the morning rather than at 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon - it was an absolute scorcher of a day here!  And I am also thankful that the ceremony was only 20 minutes long!  Have you ever tried to stand in heels, on ""golf course"" grass for that long?  Yes, people were expected to stand through the ceremony, there was only a handful of chairs set out.  I thought having not worn heels in months (maybe even a year or so) and having 2 bad knees gave me no excuse to need to sit.  I am of course, only 37!         So they are this gorgeous, elegant heel.  They are a pale grey in colour, a slingback type with about a 2 - 2 1/2"" heel (I guess....they're average....not slutty high or anything) and a very pointy front - well not ""really"" pointy (Tony didn't call them ""nose pickers"").  And I have barely worn in heels since I've had Krystina and more recently since I bunged up my knees.  And I'm merrily walking in these shoes, trying to look really elegant in them, trying not to let on that my fricken toes are squashed and bent and screaming, ""let me out, let me out"".  Tony was complaining about his new ""Aldo"" shoes...he said that they were rubbing on his heel, he said that the ""flat, soft leathered, fully closed"" shoe was ""hurting"" his foot.  I just glared and pointed down at my toes.         The wedding came to an end at 3:00 p.m..  I found some new energy in these aching feet as we left the reception and as soon as my ass was in the truck.....those gorgeous shoes were off my aching feet, not to return for another few months or so....until I can once again, write a post about my aching feet.          To conclude......my tootsies looked damn good though!  And well....sometimes, if you wanna look good, you gotta suffer a bit.         We're off to a friends ""house warming"" party today....and you can bet your bottom dollar I'm not wearing ""those"" shoes!         Stay cool everyone."
7DEUROP,female,37,"So I met with   my   ""personal trainer"" tonight.  It was actually a very good meet....and Cindy, you were right all along....it was a very good idea to get someone who has experience with injuries etc.  His name is Chris and apparently knee injuries/rehab are his specialty.  We hit it off pretty good, I told him what I wanted out of the training and he told me what he was able to give me.  So now.....I just have to cough up some cashola!  It makes my stomach a little uneasy to think of how much this is going to cost me, but in the end..... #1:  I'm worth it.  #2:  My knees are worth it. and #3:  Doggone it, I'm going to look damn hot when I'm done!!!  Chris has already told me that he's going to push me hard and that I will definitely see results in an overall body revamping AND I will get what I need to strengthen my poor, damaged, older than my age knees!  I'm so looking forward to it.  I've already signed up for the ""Easy Zone"" diet thingy at the gym...I should really take a look at that again, a little more seriously.  They say that while you're in your 30's you can still push your body just as hard as you did in your teens or 20's....I'm 37 and I'm going to give it a push it will never forget.  I will give it one last hurrah!  I am going to make my hubby (and my kids) proud to call me their mama!  I should take a before and after picture.....just to show myself, what I've accomplished!  Again....I don't need to mention your name...but you know who you are and you know it's because of you that I'm so motivated! I'm the type that needs constant motivation.....well I have it three fold now.  I'll keep everyone up to date on how things progress.

7DEUROP,female,37,"So the weekend went by pretty good.  Actually the weekend went by in a haze a couple of nights....well, that's cuz my weekend (not that I ever really get a ""weekend"") started Thursday night, cuz hubby decided to take Friday off, then he decided to take Monday off and now....he's taking Tuesday off!  Yipee!  So anyways....I made a nice dinner for his birthday on Thursday.  Salmon fillet, jasmine rice with corn, asparagus and another request of his....Curried rice with chicken. Then...for desert we had apple pie with Breyer's 100% natural vanilla ice-cream!  And then 3 bottles of wine!!!! (between the 2 of us mind you).  Friday....hmmm, I can't remember that far back (must've been the wine).  I do remember working in the evening...oh yeah, I went for a workout too.  Saturday, I actually dragged hubby to the gym and we did a workout together.  I worked out my legs and am still paying for it (on that note...do you know that since I've ""upped"" my level of intensity on my leg workouts...my right knee (not the torn ligament) is actually feeling better!  So we did that, left the kids (except for Teddy) with my parents for a bit and went to Chapters and Milestone's with Teddy...had some more wine (I didn't have anything Friday...just in case you're thinking).  Then went up to my parents to pick up the kids...and had way more wine (you have to if you want to get through spending a whole lot of time with my mom).  Needless to say....I did not drive home and haven't touched the stuff since....I think the acid has finally returned to normal levels in my stomach since then.  Sunday, we went to church, went for sushi (who would've thought Krystina would love sushi?? - she ate cucumber rolls and California rolls!  Today I did a bunch of running around, went to the gym and did a workout with the trainer (Chris).  He's helped me so much and today he said that I'm one of his ""better"" clients.  And he's really surprised and happy to see how far I've come in such a short time...Cindy watch out! :) just kidding lol.  Tomorrow (well I guess it's actually today) the whole family's going to spend the day at White Pine Beach.  It's a very ""family"" type lake close by (near another big lake - Buntzen) and the kids are just completely ecstatic.  I'll catch some rays too and hubby will probably turn lobster red...as he always does first time out (he's pretty fair skinned).  Well if I'm going to enjoy it..I better get some shut eye!  Ciao."

7DEUROP,female,37,"Well, we're back!  Actually had a really nice time, despite the weather!  Headed over to Camp Kanaka Friday night and slowly settled in.  I was bunked with a lady from Korea who didn't speak very much English AND 5 very rambunctious, loud, prepubescent, 10 year old girls!!!  What a weekend!  One of the girls introduced herself as soon as I walked through the bedroom door....by coming about 2"" from my face and screamed ""Hi"" (over and over and over again)...she referred to me as ""Mrs. Teddy Bear"".  The other girls were a little (and I do mean ""little"") quieter.  But the girl that was bunked above me....was an extremely restless sleeper.  After talking about this and that until 2:00 a.m., I was allowed to go to sleep....or was I?  The next 5 hours were spent listening to her talk in her sleep and flip from one end of the bunk to the next (and I'm not exaggerating) every 5 minutes.  Needless to say, as soon as I got out of bed (at 7:15), I went to the first ""leader"" that I could find and asked if they had ""done that"" to me on purpose, to torture me?  They knew full well what those girls were like and that's why I was assigned their room......  That morning (even though I was only asked to come to be an ""extra eye"") I was put to work....I got to stand in front of a hot, industrial (restaurant type) stove and cook bacon for 41 people!  The amount of grease that came off that bacon was absolutely disgusting!!!!  So why does the stuff taste so good?  So I think it turned out to be 10 (extra large) packages of bacon that I fried up.  Then I helped clean up.    Despite the weather, we went for a bit of a walk...came back to set up for another ""game"".  All of a sudden a couple of the boys came running down the hall saying that someone had fallen and had lost 2 teeth.  Panic sets in......turns out, this boy had sure enough fallen (because they were making bridges out of the mattresses between bunk beds) and had broken his arm!!!  So once this guy got his arm set, we headed over to the hospital. His father was there to greet us and after 2 hours....well, this boys fun was over (although maybe not, cuz he was smiling when we left...maybe due to the Tylenol 3 with codeine)...he was headed for the operating room.  Went back to camp and got ready for dinner....where I got to cook the pasta for 40 people!  And then help clean up.  Considering I had no sleep the night before...I was doing okay.  The kids were spent and went to their rooms by 10:00 (the grade 5 boys stayed up until 3:00 a.m.).  Sat and chatted with the other leaders (adults) until 12:00.  The girls were much quieter (and calmer) and I think I managed 3 hours of sleep.  Could have kept sleeping....but it was time to get up and help make pancakes for everyone and then of course....help clean up!  Headed back at 10:30 a.m. and filled the van to its capacity....7 people and bags and sleeping bags and jackets and shoes and crafts.....good thing I filled up at 99.9 cents a litre!!!!!!  Teddy has now gone swimming with his buddy and I'm ready to sleep for a week!  How do these kids do it???  Should have the main computer home later this week....hope to share some pictures.

I instanly regressed 8 years and instantly deemed it a case of ""finders keepers.""

7JQQ84O,male,14,"Today I watched Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 , and although I don't want to sound snobbish, I am not amused. Well, actually I am amused. Some parts were entertaining, but overall, I found it to be an emotionally manipulative film that left out chunks from the big picture just so he could make his point. The movie was made more to fire up people who were already shared his opinions on Bush, Iraq, etc. than it was to convince those of opposing thought.  For example, images of Iraqi children playing, people eating at cafes, and a wedding (all pre-war) were shown as President Bush read a speech on the ""threat"" posed by Iraq. Then, in the next scene, footage of Bush talking about the justness of our cause was mixed with charred corpses of innocent children were being dumped into the back of a pickup truck as mothers wept and cursed the U.S. Another thing I disliked was how he speculated what George Bush was thinking as he was informed of the terrorist attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001. It was just slow-motion footage of Bush sitting in a chair while Moore made suggestions of what he thought was going through Bush's mind.  But the movie still had some parts I found entertaining. Upon his realization (and to his horror) that most legislators don't read the bills they vote for, Moore commandeers an ice cream truck and reads the Patriot Act on a loudspeaker as he drives through Washington D.C. I also think he had a point of how the post 9/11 ""trust no one"" and ""constant vigilance""  mindset was exploited through scare tactics in order to pass the Patriot Act.  In the end, I think it is very unnecessary for someone to spend millions of dollars making a movie so that they can tell me that politicians have the capacity to lie.

Soon the second will be as antiquated as the bushel, peck, acre, hand, or stone.

7JQQ84O,male,14,"The roots and ideals of Satiricism can be traced to radical writings and rants of Henry J. Foster, who single handedly planted the seed of our noble ideals in the Devronshire pub,  The Raving Scotsman . On the cold evening of 16 January 1897, Henry, in a drunken rage talked of the imminent threat of a banana led invasion of Wales. It wasn't until the next night at the same pub that a now sober Foster laid down the foundations of Satiricism to a sleepy crowd of 3 fellow barflies. And so, the legacy of The Party began. Its birth signified the death of the monarchy.       It's Easier To Think When You Don't Have To -Big Brother"

7JQQ84O,male,14,"People these days. Them and their loud music, long hair and supposedly unalienable rights. What this nation needs is a good, swift kick in the arse, and I know just how to do it.  What we need is to do away with all of these unnecessary ""rights"" people think they deserve. Most of them hardly use or are even aware of them anyway. We'll start with that pesky 8th Amendment. Capital punishment for capital crimes I say. Heck, they don't even need to be capital crimes. Littering should be made punishable by public burning at the stake. That'll make the streets cleaner. Like Singapore. Why can't we all be like Singapore? It's so clean. And efficient.  See? Already things are better. Clean streets, more parking (no more need for street cleanings) and public executions to keep our nation's youth from staying in the house and rotting their brains on violent television. Hate those people who close the elevator on you? Well, that could be made punishable by being strapped into a chair and being forced to watch reruns of teletubbies for the rest of eternity. I'm not even breaking the current standing 8th Amendment  that  much. A punishment isn't unusual until after the first few hundred times, and cruel is a very subjective word.  Let's see, what other unneeded freedoms are just rotting away in the leaky corner of the basement? Let's toss out freedom of the press. They're doing a shoddy job of it anyway, that free press. Why just tonight, I was staring at the tele-you-what-to-do-a-ma-bob-vision when I saw ""breaking news"" on  Inside Edition  of VP nominee John Edward's son's thumb sucking problem. Egad. Or how about the constant gossipy prolefeed produced by supermarket checkout tabloids like  urlLink  The National Enquirer   or  urlLink  The Globe  . You see, people are idiots. You don't want  them  in control of what you think, do you? People who think they're happier because they are told so are happier. It's the great placebo. Why, just look at good 'ol North Korea. They may have hundreds of thousands of people starving per year, but they're starving with a  smile .  Slowly, we can phase out any and all forms of liberties and have a fully operational oppressive government up and running within the next 2-3 years. It is here where my point is made. Hey, we have a lot of freedom other people in the world don't. Use it well.  Perhaps we ought not go as far as to create a totalitarian regime every decade or so, but instead have an annual, two week-long ""Totalitarian Fest"" in which every citizen of the U.S. lives in a gulag type camp.

Then, we herd consenting citizens of senior age (60+) into government constructed homes for the elderly. There they are provided their own rocking chair, knitting needles, and a daily milk ration. To create a clean source of energy, we can harvest all of that precious kinetic energy made by the rocking chairs by way of miniature generators affixed to each one. To occupy their time on the chairs, they will be given the opportunity to chat and will be provided knitting supplies. The Chinese may be able to operate sweatshops at pennies per person, but our labor will be free! Thus, after only a few years, energy costs will be lowered, the elderly will get their welfare, and trade tariffs with China may be lifted.

How can I avoid using the so-called parenting skills I learned as a kid?    She’s smart; maybe just talking to her about it will help.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I generally have a poor view of people in general, but sometimes I am stunned by my reaction to people.  It may be nothing they do or say, it is just a feeling that pops up when least expected.  I went through the drive-thru at Arctic Circle.  (a low-class fast food joint with ice cream, I wish there was a Dairy Queen in town)  There is one guy at the drive through who has always creeped me out, and he is always there waiting for me, telling me in his smarmy, lewd, perverted voice, ""here's your chicken salad, out of a big TEN dollars, your change is 3.53!"".  But today as we exchanged food and money, our hands briefly touched in that strangely uncomfortable way, and a subconscious drive-thru speaker sounded in my head, screaming ""HE MASTURBATES WITH THAT HAND"", then ""CHILD MOLESTER"".  I was so stunned almost drove off without my food, thankful when the other worker handded it to me.  I cannot describe the disgust and revulsion that came over me in that moment.  He did nothing out of the ordinary, and is probably guilty of nothing other than nerdiness, but I will never get that out of my brain. The salad tasted poisoned, as I thought about it all of lunch.  Did you ever read Stephen King's Dead Zone, where the character gets a psychic flash of people when they touch?  Very creepy.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I am going through a particularly rough stretch of depression right now. My logical side knows this, is trying to process this, but cannot do anything about it.  I feel so empty inside.  Someone push me in front of a bus now, and be done with it.  This entry is from last night and this morning, just a stream of consciousness at the time I wrote it.  7/7/2004 6:09 PM I don’t often really feel honest emotions, good or bad.  I act happy or sad or mad sometimes, but when the moment is over, I am surrounded by the grey.  It’s not a losing or winning, not an up or down.  Just a flatline, a cold, emotionless zombie, a shell, not really alive, undead.  I have a difficult time feeling emotionally close to anyone.  I love Anne, but I am afraid we are not close anymore.  It is hard to feel loved and at the same time have her be emotionally distant and silent.  Dan has grown up to be as moody and brooding and angry as me, with occasional violent outbursts and frequent periods of self-isolation, because that’s what I taught him for 10 years.  Nikki has learned the anger also, but she expresses it much differently.  My best friend lives 500 miles away and I never get to see her, Anne is jealous of our relationship, and she would not “let me” go see her on the recent road trip.  It is impossible for me to feel close to anyone I work with now or previously, or anyone from college or high school.  I don’t enjoy things that should be fun for me.  I could have enjoyed fireworks, the beach, playing music, going to dinner, having a night alone with Anne, playing a game, or whatever.  I either did not enjoy it at all, or I maybe just was slightly pleased, but after the task or activity was done, it is back to normal life, with no real enjoyment or satisfaction at all.  I feel bad about procrastinating and letting things stay in disarray, but not bad enough to anything about it.  The retirement fund is in a low-paying investment – I don’t care.  The car needs a tire replaced – oh well, fix it later.  Taxes need to be done – who cares, I have lots of time.  The upstairs is a mess – whatever, if it is not urgent, screw it.  Stuff to do in the yard, oh well, it can wait.    I have become so indecisive and passive that I just don’t care or take any satisfaction in accomplishing things, and I just take the easy way out of any problem.  We bought our house, fine, now we move our shit, but nothing really changes.  A co-worker wants to start a company, but it is easier to stay at my job and bitch about my career.  Anne and I don’t communicate very well and I still feel very distant from her sometimes, but it is easier to say nothing and not cause trouble.  I don’t really look forward to anything right now.  I have nothing to accomplish in my current career or job that will mean anything or give me any satisfaction at all.  I get a paycheck, nothing more.  I don’t enjoy work, I don’t care about work, I don’t care if things get accomplished or not, I don’t care if the company lives or dies or stays the same.  Nothing I do there makes much difference, I don’t really care about any of the people there, and I could be (and maybe should be) replaced at any time  I don’t feel like I will ever be a happy person.  I will survive being cold, distant, scared of people, isolating myself, and sinking into a grey blanketing fog, drowning in mist but not enough to die.  The best I can do is try not to hurt anyone on the way into hell.    7/7/2004 6:43 PM  I feel love for Anne, but it is more of a family or companionship love than a lover’s love.  Last night in bed, Anne was letting me know she wanted me.  I had to talk myself into having sex, because even holding her, I realized it didn’t matter one way or another.  On the nights when she is home in the evening to talk to, she usually would rather watch something on TV (I’m starting to hate television).  She has been loving and comforting and caring and passionate, but those times are very rare.  Usually I feel like our relationship is distant, silent, convenient, more like roommates than lovers.    I think I would feel different if Anne opened up to me a little more and let me know what she is thinking or feeling.  I have asked several times over the past 6 months for feedback, a reaction, her thoughts or feelings about my depression and how it affects her and us.  She will tell me almost nothing.  I believe she loves me, but I think I would feel much more positive about our relationship if we could talk more about what has happened to our relationship, our feelings, our love, and how we have changed since we met.  Instead we talk about inane, small stuff like daycare, TV, Oprah, daycare kids, foster kids, more about daycare, my job, or mindless trivial things.   7/7/2004 7:39 PM  I don’t care about going camping this next week.  It will be nice to get away from work, but I have very little desire to spend several days camping with the rest of the family, and screaming kids.  Anne’s sister has adopted kids, and her mother has foster kids, so there will be 7 kids younger than 8 years old (not counting Nikki and Dan).  It will be excruciating for me to listen to the constant whining and crying and yelling.  I love camping where I can just sit and be peaceful with nature.  As usual, this will not be that kind of camping trip.  7/8/2004 8:04 AM  It’s the depression talking.  I need Anne, I need my family, I love them very much - I know this is true.  But at the same time, the grey blanket won’t let me feel any lasting emotion, happy, sad, contentment, hurt.  I will feel better for a few minutes, but the depression pulls me back in like gravity, like a magnetic field, inescapable, smothering, drowning.  The wet, cold, grey blanket smothers out any spark or flame of ambition, dreams, feelings, positives or negatives  I don’t want to talk or interact with anybody.  I am antisocial.  When I don’t like people, it is the depression talking.  It takes a tremendous amount of effort to not snap at everyone.  I try to not look like I feel, because then people will ask if I am OK, or what is wrong.  They don’t really want to know, they are just being polite and (social)?  If I really tell them, it is too much information.  Nobody likes a gloomy sad sack, nobody likes Eeyore, people want everyone to be happy and shiny and Feeling Good.  It’s not safe to tell the truth, so I keep it inside as much as possible, say nothing to anyone,   I want it dark, hoping I can remain in the grey zone and avoid the light.  The sun burns, sears, makes everything too bright and colorful.  The fog is the depression - it is comforting in a perverse way.    I don’t care or don’t want to do anything, just sit in the grey zone and be fucked up, be miserable, be invisible.  I do nothing, it does nothing, we all do nothing, the world just stops for a while when you are in the fog.  I think I could just sit and do nothing for days, weeks, months, just not care about anything, not give a shit whether the world exists or not.  I almost wish a disaster would happen, either that or win the lottery.  Either way, my life would either be over, be more interesting, or be free from my current life.  Disaster, lottery, who cares - at least it is something different than the fog."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I have so much to say sometimes, I wonder how I can contain it.  I wish I could sit and write for 2 or 3 days straight, and just get it all out in writing so I can see the beast and kill it.  I have so much pent-up frustration and dissapointment and anger with myself and almost everyone around me.  Sometimes I get a panic attack and I have to go to the beach and start yelling.  I am so fucked up.  The therapist tells me I am still an abused child, that I continue to abuse myself every day.  Bite me, maybe I like it that way."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Nikki has been sad lately about her great-grandpa.  GG (Anne's grampa) died just before New Year's 2003, and we traveled to Goldville to attend the funeral.  Within the last year, she has been sad because she wishes GG could come back to see her.  Talking to her the other day, I think she feels bad because she does not really have any actual first-hand memories of GG, she only knows him from stories and from going to the funeral.  She said that she didn't want to hear stories from Anne or her parents, or see a video of his 80th b-day party, because it would still not be her memory.  She says sometimes that GG gets to see the tops of all the redwoods, or that he is talking to her in the wind (when the wind blows hard, he is reminding her she did something wrong), or that he gets to fly over everything.  She says this very matter-of-fact, not like a fantasy, which strikes me as un-childlike, almost a native-american manner of rememberance.  I felt so sad for her the other night, I had no way to help her feel better - a very powerless feeling.  I think she will grow out of it, but I also wonder if this will affect her notions of death and beyond.  Sometimes she acts 10 or more, sometimes she acts 4.  The average is her actual age, 7."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"OK.  To reset, about 10 days ago, Anne and I were in bed snuggling and being lovable, when she says in a particular tone of voice that she needs to ask me something.  This is usually a warning that I will be asked to do or say something from which there is no graceful escape.  She then says that she thinks she knows what my answer will be, but she wants to ask anyway.  Now I really am nervous, because it must be something I've already expressed apprehension about but she wants me to do what she wants regardless.  Finally, she gets to the point: she wants another child.  I suspect she actually wants a specific child, a 1-yr old in foster care with her mom.  This was not entirely a surprise, because she mentioned it about a year ago, and similar discussion occurred then as now:    We already talked about this a few years ago, that was why I got spaid or neutered 4 years ago.  We didn't want any more kids then, what has changed?  Kids are inconvenient, messy, and for a period of several years their sole purpose is to turn your life to shit.  (Going to dinner last night, for example.) They take what would ordinarily be an easy relaxing task, chew it up, and to replace it they hand you a load of shit, which may include whining, screaming, tantrums, trips to Disneyland, puberty, and multiplying credit card bills.   I love my kids dearly because they are mostly done with the stage where you have to do everything for them, and they can perform many tasks with minimal supervision.  There is no way in hell I want to ever change another diaper or get shit on or peed on or puked on ever again.  Two is enough, I can't possibly stand any more.  I especially don't want to go through the process again for someone else's child.  I am so emotionally fucked up right now that I don't need any more stress at all.  I have a hard time dealing with life right now.  If another child was added, I would snap.    I told her that I felt like I was in a no-win situation because if I say what I said, she would be angry and resentful toward me.  If I let her do what she wants, I would be resentful towards her and the child, and our kids would probably have some negativity as well (Nikki in particular - she would be unmanageably angry and hurt).  I said that we make comments about people who decide to bring a new child into a less-than-stable home situation, and I think my emotional state would qualify as unstable right now.  So am I a selfish bastard?  Am I heartless and uncaring about the plight of foster children and my wife's desires?  Or am I making a reasoned, logical, wise decision?  I am second-guessing myself, but I think I did the right thing.  Please insult me if I am wrong; be specific and verbose."

Oh look, a funny.  I have not had much humor for several days; its return is a sign I am improving somewhat.  However, I am still weighted down by what happened.

Dan plays percussion now after trying the trumpet last year.  The main reason for his switch was that the instrument was too heavy.  Good thing Beethoven never said the same thing.  Anne and I were picking out kids in his group who reminded us of people from our band days in high school.  We met in high school band, I played tuba, trombone, baritone, and she was in the flags/banners.  I was a band geek (it's no longer politically correct to say band fag, although that's what we were called) since 5th grade myself, starting on trumpet and switching to low brass when I got braces (ouch).  My mom also payed trumpet for 4 years in high school in the 50's.  Nikki has musical talent, but she is not really interested in lessons yet.  She has pitch memory and can pick out and memorize almost any sone, including key changes, and hit them right on.  I am very impressed.  She probably will learn piano and do choir, but you never know what kids will choose.  The harpsichord is a silly musical instrument.  I can get very similar sounds with a series of rubber bands and pie plates.  Baroque music irritates me, for the most part.  If I were stranded with a musician in winter, I would want them to play string instruments.  Not for the music, though.  I can start a fire using the violin for kindling, keep myself warm with the cello, and cook the musician over the coals of the string bass."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I e-mailed a couple of people from high school on Classmates.com last Friday.  The paranoid critic says ""They won't respond because you were a geek and they never liked you.""  In reality, they probably check the Classmates site about as often as I do, meaning it may be weeks before they get the message.  Fine, it's been 15 years, what's another week or 2?  My world will not end one way or another.  However, I would like to hear from Angie's sister, if that was really her. (see earlier post.)"
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I was at Round Table the other night with the fam.  Anne and I are often people-watchers, and we happened to be watching an unlikely couple.  There were three guys, 20-ish, who looked like they were typecast for President, VP, and Secretary of the (D&D, Chess, Computer, take your pick) Club - they looked like total nerds (yeah, like I don't!).  Anyway, one of them looked like he was following a girl with his eyes, and later, gets up and follows her into the video-game room.  This girl, also around 20, is simply gorgeous - around 5'3"", dark tan to olive skin, some non-white ethnic background, attractive figure, etc.  I thought, how creepy, is he trying to stalk her?  Then I realize she is talking to him, then they start sucking face like the asteroid is coming - get a room, kids, I'm trying to eat here!  My next thought is, wow, she is his girlfriend??!!  How did that happen?  He must have some sort of contract with Satan for that to have happened.    This just proves to me a few things: --that love can occur in the unlikeliest places --that inner beauty can still be appreciated by the physically attractive if they have a good heart --that I can be pretty dumb sometimes assuming I have people figured out when I really don't."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I am very fidgety, like there is electricity flowing within me, waiting to jump out and fry everyone and everything around me.    Anyway, I had therapy today, and I was not in a talkative mood.  Essentially it comes down to the idea that I can never please myself.  No matter what I do, it is never good enough, I can never win, I can never be satisfied, everyone else will realize I am a fraud and a sham, that I should be fired from my job (current job or any other), that I don't earn my pay, that I am a bad parent, a bad husband, etc.  If I am not trying my best, I have failed.  If I slack off or make excuses or don't pull off a miracle like I sometimes do, I have failed.  Imperfection is all around, but I am the most imperfect of all, because I was given so much potential and have wasted it.   There this dark place inside me that is a dying little child crying to get out.  If he does not, the darkness will destroy me and everyone I love.  Every time I try to listen to this little child inside, he is smacked down by the Critic or the Worrier.  The Child can only sneak out during dreams or subconscious states, or sometimes when I have escaped my life.  The Child is awed by the beauty of the natural world: forests, mountains, streams, animals, flowers, granite, soil, oceans, wetlands.  Every day the Child is pushed down, he dies a little bit.  He has been surviving for almost 30 years, but there is very little energy left.  The Child, in order to live, needs me to run away from everything I have and give it freedom to explore and grow and live.    But I don't know how I can do this.  My family needs me, I need to be a provider, I need to work to survive in this world.  I can't just run away from it all.  That is what little kids do, right Annebrev?  Vacation doesn't help, it is only a momentary escape before diving back into the reality of working and eating and sleeping and avoiding meaningful conversations and struggling with parenting.  This process has brought me from miserable ignorance to seeing the edge of the barrier, whatever it is that keeps me from being whole.  The gulf between is huge, awesome, horrifying, impossible.  How can I ever cross?  I am so flat inside.  I might feel happy or soothed for a few minutes, but nothing replaces the overwhelming weight of this depression.  It is a cold, grey, damp blanket that smothers every spark of creativity or desire or motivation or happiness.  It is a force stronger than gravity, always present, always pulling downward, stronger than dreams or prayers.  I don't care about anything.  I don't care about ever being happy, about work, about home, about people, about succeeding, about dreams, desires, anything.  This life is my purgatory.  The Child cannot survive this asphyxiation much longer - he must escape or die.  If the Child dies, every shred of emotion and humanity and pleasure will die with him.  Then what will be left of me?  What will be there to fill the hole I leave behind?  Bitterness, anger, tears, sadness, unfulfilled promises, stolen years, missed milestones, photos, everything that makes a life.  The only thing that can save me is to run.  Can I expect Anne and the kids to let me run, then come back when I am ready?  Will they run with me, or will they care?  I don't want to be alone, but if I have to, so be it.  It does not matter."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Just to show it's not all about me, I will talk about Anne, who is going through some of her own work troubles.  She does home child care by herself in our home.  Her method of child care is child-directed, play-based and loosely scheduled, in which the kids get to do essentially anything they want (within appropriate bounds), learning and developing through play and social interaction with other kids.  This would be the exact opposite of the structured pre-school environment, in which there is a schedule and a lesson plan for what the kids are told to learn today.  Anyway, she is having a problem when parents choose to remove kids from her care and put them in a more traditional pre-school ""so they can be ready for kindergarten"".  When parents do this, she feels like it is her fault, like she is doing something wrong, like she needs to change what she does to reflect what the parents want, that she is hurting the children by doing what she does that makes the parents want to change, etc.  I tried to tell her that if she really believes she is doing the right thing, then she should not take it personal.  She cannot control what other parents feel or believe is best for the child.  She did the best she could for that child for the time they were in her care, and that's all one can ask.  She cannot decide if she wants to believe that or if she even wants to continue doing daycare. I think she feels like she cannot stop, or take a break, because the disruption would negatively affect the kids.    I think she is an extremely patient and caring person for doing child care, because I will be the first to admit I could never do it.  I think the part that bothers me about the little ones is the total dependency.  When they are older (like our kids), they can do things for themselves when you need a break.  But Anne does need a break, whether or not she will take one.  She won't ""call in"" sick, because it is difficult and inconvenient for the parents, even though it is usually a parent bringing a sick child that causes Anne to be sick.  She is stuck in a similar loop to me, i.e. ""I have to be there for the kids, because they need good care, so I will put their needs ahead of my own"".    At the end of the day, she has very little to no energy to deal with family needs, meaning kids and me, so she gets away from the house to do stuff on her own at least 2 nights per week.  I like to let her have that time, but I also struggle with lack of energy from my issues and wish I could have that time away as well.  When she does stay home, she generally does not want to do home chores, because she has been home all day running after kids.  When she does decide to do dishes/laundry/cleaning, it seems like it is always at 11pm or later, when I am ready for bed.  I try to fill in and do my share of things, but I feel like it is never enough, and I believe she thinks the same thing.    I think this is one of the basic problems between me and Anne at this time, even though neither of us really wants to address it.  (This is also why it is simply inconceivable to me that she is interested in another child - more about that later.)  I am not in any way saying that she should stay at home and cook and clean and not work - I don't believe that is fair to her, or any other woman in the same position.  All I am saying is that we need to address this problem, because I think that deep down, it is a real source of anger for her that hurts our marriage."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Well, I will be on vacation the next week, camping in the coastal wilds of Oregon, so likely no opportunity to be on the net at all.  Wow, a week without computers - how will I function?  Just fine, actually.  If I can get some quiet time with the sitka spruce, wax myrtle, red huckleberry, salal, pitcher plant, hawks, osprey, and whatever flora and fauna I can find, I will be relaxed and peaceful.  Nothing helps my state of mind more than the forest, except maybe for forests in the mountains.  Beaches are ok, but not the same.    Listening to:  Weezer, first album (including ""Buddy Holly"")  I think my mood is lifting somewhat.  ""Supplementing"" my normal dosage of anti-depressants helps a bit, but so does just keeping my mind occupied with thoughts that are not self-destructive.  I wonder if I (and others like me) actually get addicted to depression.  In the same was as alcolholics, I don't know what to do if I haven't had my negative thoughts for the day.  I can't be happy for an extended period with falling off the emotional wagon.  If I accept that chemistry is more to blame than anything else, I am at the mercy of an imperfect body.  If I choose to believe my problems are entirely psychological, then why can't I escape the grey moods I get into?  I guess the reality is that it is both mental and physical, and I need to deal with both aspects separately, but in a coordinated effort.  Honestly, I prefer anger to the bleak grey moods that hold me captive.  Anger makes the body active, alive, gives me a purpose.  The grey fog just sucks every bit of energy and motive and caring away from me, and I just want to do nothing but sleep and wallow in self-pity.  Well, clean up loose ends at work, set out the backup tapes for someone to run, finish locating details for the casino development plans, and get out of here without offending anyone or running away.  Sure, I can do that.  Bye for a week, blogger friends (anne, kim, and others)."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Greatest Hits - 01.16.2004  So I finally decided to say the D-word: depression.  I went to the doctor for migraine medicine after two real scary-excruciating headaches.  While there, I mentioned that I was trying to isolate causes, and had settled on stress, tension, possibly depression, and maybe mold in the office.  Doc's ears perked up when I mentioned depression, so I had another appt., talked about it more, and I will start seeing a ""shrink"" very soon.  I did not realize how difficult it would be for me to actually discuss w/ the doctor.  I felt so defeated and powerless, like I can't help myself, I may as well join the dopes on Jerry Springer.  I know logically that I should not feel that way, but I did.  Sue me.  I have started thinking about what to say or discuss, and of course I think first about what is wrong with me, and bad memories, and start into a downward spiral.  I see help coming though, so I will withstand the urge to self-pity.  I can see that this will be a VERY difficult process for me.  I hate when I can't figure things out, and I hate worse admitting that fact.  There are a ton of memories that have receded far back in the past that I would like to keep in that dark little corner of my brain, but I have a feeling it is in my best interest to clean out that corner.  What does it mean to ""deal with"" things in the past that are so bothersome?  I have a mental image of cleaning out a dark, musty, pile of creepy, alien objects that belong in another dimension... taking each object, cleaning away the gunk that obscures the details, and examine it with a magnifying glass under bright lights... understanding every detail, making sense of it, accepting it without the filters of time and memory and values.  Finish with one object, go on to the next, making notes on each, assembling a pattern of clues that will reveal some wisdom about how these things were created ...why I think the way I do, why my experiences and beliefs have affected the way I relate to people, why I like being bummed all the time, and why I have such a hard time accepting the way things really are."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I went to the M.D. today. My old doc moved away, so I had to find someone new, but in the same office due to the HMO plan. When making the appointment, I asked for someone who was knowledgeable about depression, anxiety, and migraines. The person said ""Oh, all the doctors here know about that."" No, I mean really know, so I don't have to wait for them to figure out what to do with me. I think I lucked out, and they listened to me. I ended up with the new doc, a relatively youngish woman, who seems knowledgeable and understanding. She made me feel relatively comfortable talking about my problems, and seemed informed about the different medicines. Normally I end up seeing a male doc, but the last two now have been women. I have absolutely no problem with that, and I think women are better able to actually listen to a patient and be a partner with the patient, as opposed to some male docs I have met who are arrogant know-it-alls. As long as they don't tell me to turn my head and cough, everything will be fine.     Anyway, we discussed how the Celexa was not working for me. I have been at 40mg for about 3 months. She agreed that if I was still having that much difficulty with depressive spirals, that the medicine obviously is working very well. I gave her the 5-minute life history of my illness, and she thought that since I have both symptoms of depression and anxiety, Effexor has worked well for that combination of problems. So I will try to survive going off one pill, then starting another. I have read of people going 3 or 4 weeks with no medicine waiting for one chemical to get out of the body and the new one to take effect. Apparently I can stop the Celexa within 6 days, then immediately begin with the Effexor. The initial dose is 37mg, then 75mg, then more if needed. Hit me, baby, I need a bunch.     BTW, I can't seem to say Effexor without doing a superhero-type dum-dum-DAAAAAA sound effect."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I have not had the experience of watching my parents get old, like most everyone else.    I never had a dad, and my mom died 13 years ago at age 56.    Anne’s parents are turning into old people, sometimes funny old people, but definitely not healthy old people.    I have the bad feeling that there will be some sad times ahead for Anne as her family gets older.    Her grandma is 83 and in relatively good shape after losing Grandpa 18 months ago;    her dad is 60, and essentially subsists on crackers, ice cream, and coffee; her mom is 57, overweight, high blood pressure, and sometimes looks very ill (although none will admit it, being from stubborn, hardy stock Midwest families); her aunt and uncle appear healthy but at ages 54 and 63 (I’m guessing there) have their own problems.    Our brother-in-law, who is on dialysis and needs a transplant, could turn serious very quickly.    I’m afraid that in the next 5 to 10 years there will be lots of health problems and possibly deaths in her family.       How will this affect me?    Since I really have no family, these people are my extended family as well.    I have no one to care for as they age, so I will do whatever I can for her parents.    I will need to be strong for Anne, because it will hit her very hard.    I know I can be strong and support her, but at the same time it will hurt me also.           I realize this is a depressive thought train, worrying about and anticipating sad events before they even happen.    Hopefully I can avoid dwelling on this idea."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"There is a woman at my office whom I secretly call Mousey, or Abby (after my cat who behaves the same way).  She is very timid, refuses to take the right-of-way in the hallway or at the coffee pot, and is afraid of computers in general.  She is our bookeeper, and steadfastly chooses to keep hand-written ledgers to duplicate the work that the expensive accounting program does.  She doesn't trust the software, and keeps records to ""check"" the software.    She drives a small Honda Civic, ordinarily a nice little car, although it is funny for a 60+ yr old woman to have a ""sporty"" car.  Anyway, the car has stupid headrests.  I have become unnaturally obsessed with these stupid headrests.  They have posts on the side, rather than the center. I don't know how to describe them other than stupic.  They are aesthetically offensive.  They were probably designed by the ultra-conservative right-wing, or maybe the liberal media, or maybe the miltary-industrial complex, or maybe Osama.  They are just really STUPID headrests, and I wish I could rip them out of every Civic in the world and bring them to the Japanese designer's desk and stomp on it in front of him, shouting ""DON'T YOU SEE HOW STUPID THESE ARE?????""  I am amazed at how much time I have devoted to denigrating the headrests on a car.  Konichiwa."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I am emotionally stunned, shocked, raw, bleeding all over. I am seriously thinking about how sharp the knives in the kitchen are, and how many little wounds I could cause without anyone noticing.  I am home again.  I have spent today basically avoiding as much contact as possible.  I called in “sick” to work (one can’t exactly call in “depressed”, can one?) and wrote several items on the laptop, including an excruciating description of last nights abortive runaway attempt.  I stayed in the hideaway until about 12:30, then went out.  Anne asked where I was going, I just said “I don’t know” and left.    As I was driving toward town, I figured I may as well accomplish something since I was off work and not in the mood for anything even remotely fun.  I got the oil changed in the car, then went to get a chronically repaired tire repaired for the 2nd time.  I then stopped at the mall to look at Borders’ books (on depression, my favorite topic!!), then the library, then Staples for a laptop mouse, then home.  As luck would have it, Anne and the kids were just heading out for shopping and errands, so I get another 2 hours of self-loathing in silence  The giants are playing ball tonight, maybe that will help.  On the other hand, maybe I will get shit-faced on scotch and drown in my own vomit.  At this point, I don’t fucking care.  I don’t have the will to fight or live or die or fix things or save a marriage or help kids or help myself.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Why do I feel like such a failure?  I don't know how I cam to establish ""the rules"" of my life, but I know that one of them is that to be satisfied with myself, I need to do it right or perfect every time, all the time.  Anything less than perfection equates to failure.  I have always been very confident in my ability to do things and reason through situations, but if I have problems I see that as a failure.  If I have potential to do sometihng right, but I don't, I have either wasted my potential or I haven't tried my hardest, both of which are greivous sins.  By these rules, how can I succeed at anything?  I have created a situation where I must fail almost every time, even when others see a partial or almost complete success.  I cannot trust anyone to do things for me because (by my rules) they will fail also, either through their own shortcomings or by my expectation of their performance holding up to my standard of perfection.  As a result of these rules, I feel like I have failed repeatedly in life, although when I logically step outside myself and look at the record, I hove accomplished some  good things in my life.  Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible for me to have any pride or satisfaction or sense of accomplishment in my near-successes.  I get no satisfaction at all for being intelligent, completing college, the ability to change careers, financial stability, stong love for my kids, etc.  It is like being in an art gallery, staring at the paintings, but feeling no sense of beauty at all, only emptiness.  In addition, what I am doing right now, writing about my problems, is very important to my sanity, but is also a source of guilt.  I am supposed to be working on a report right not, but I'm not.  This means I am trying my hardest or putting out my best effort, therefore I am failing not only myself but my employer.  Then I get paid for doing my job, so to get paid for wasting time and failing is essentially fraud.  I should be caught and fired the same as if I was stealing money from the company.  But I don't care about work right now.  I just want to get rid of the gray emptiness.  What is important to me, stupid work, or saving myself from destruction?  I know how fucked up this line of reasoning is, but I don't feel like I can ever escape it."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I'm really too busy for blogging today, I have a ton of stuff to do and I know I won't get it done today.  But I wanted to get something, ANYTHING, in writing today.  Getting paid is really cool, especially when it is $24 per hour.  I have always felt that my current income is the result of a combination of hard work, luck good and bad, and making good decisions.  I have had problems in the past with being guilty about making money when other people have little or no opportunity or luck and are dirt poor, struggling all the time.  That's how I grew up, so I am familiar with poverty.  I want to impress upon my kids the good fortune they have to not have to worry about food or clothing or electricity, but I don't want them to feel guilty about it like I do sometimes.  When I am in a depression spiral, I start obsessing about work, that I have trouble concentrating therefore I'm not being a good employee, I'm not earning my money, I'm a fraud, and so on.  I don't really know what the answer is there.  I have a serious problem allowing myself to feel like I earned whatever I get without feeling guilty about my success or that anything less than total success is a total failure.  I have a habit of saying that a chimp can do my job, that I can be replaced tomorrow, just perpetuating my insecurities and adding stress that I don't need.  While I've met some smart chimpanzees, I am learning to take pride in the fact that my work DOES have value and IS challenging and IS worth getting paid good money for.  However, this does not change the fact I don't really like my old or new job (new duties in same company), and I have many other related issues.  I'm just not happy working right now, because I sense that it is the least important to me in terms of what I want to focus my energy on.  I really want to be a wildlife or wetlands naturalist or study native American culture or a bus driver or a million other things than what I am doing now..  I have a good rant from a few months back about my sense of value related to my so-called career, so I will look for that and post it when I get time."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"A strange thing happened a few weeks ago.  Driving down Broadway, I noticed a young woman, early 20s maybe, in the next lane.  She was crying, sobbing uncontrollably, trying to stay in control but obviously in extreme despair.  I obviously don't know what happened.  Did she just get a call that someone died?  Did she just break up with a boyfriend?  I was immediately touched and sad for her, wishing I could do something for her, talk, listen, give a hug, whatever.  I realized I was staring, and looked away, not wanting to invade on her private sadness.  I would have been very embarrassed if she suddenly looked back at me, even though I knew I was basically invisible to her at that moment.  But I couldn’t help watching her try to cope with whatever had happened.  I feel like I remember her face from somewhere, maybe a photo on a desk here at the office, or maybe just seen around town.  So beautiful, but so sad at the same time.  I won't forget her for a long time."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"A correction regarding my earlier statement about gas prices.  According to  urlLink an article  in GeoTimes, the magazine of the American Geological Institute:    ""...analysts point out that while gas prices are higher than ever before, when adjusted for inflation, the true price of gasoline at the pump has fallen more than 40 percent from its peak of $2.77 per gallon in 1981.""    OK, but it's still cheaper in Oregon."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I have a very high anxiety level when trying to socialize at a gathering, such as the company picnic last weekend.  Usually I dread these gatherings because I just don't feel safe letting people past the outer defenses (hence the army of plastic cats - see my profile).  It is also hard for me to make trivial small talk, because it seems so trite and meaningless and silly.  So I end up mentally isolating myself from everyone else around me, internally retreating into a safe little cocoon where I can still be myself.  I can be totally, utterly alone in a room full of acquaintences, or even friends.    I remember my friends threw a suprise party for me when I turned 21, but even then I can remember feeling very alone for a few minutes.  Even though I was being shown by people that they liked and cared for me, I could not fully accept their feelings, as if at any moment they would all turn around and say ""we made it all up, we don't really like you"", the pig's blood would drop on me (image from  Carrie ), etc.  Someone sensed I was drifting away, and they came to me and physically/emotionally pulled me back into the present moment where they I did not have to be alone.  That has happened several times, and then other times I would desparately wish someone, whether a friend, or a ""crush"", would read my mind and come rescue me (because I would not tell them), but they never did.    Illogical line of reasoning # 325:    I feel like I have to constantly test others' love for me, and that if I don't constantly hear them telling me or feel the love, I start to question it.  If they do tell me or show me they love me, I start to question their sincerity or motives or intelligence.  I want love, but when I get it, I feel unworthy, so I must test their love, then when I get the answer that I want, I don't believe it.  If for some reason the other person doesn't respond the way I think they should, that confirms that they don't really love me.     I see how illogical this line of reasoning is.  If i can just learn to accept others' love, freely given, because they feel I deserve it, that should make me accept myself and like myself a little more.  I just cannot get past this fear of people being disingenuous, or betrayal, or someone's lack of ability to love me.  Hows that for a fear, kids?  I am afriad that someone doesn't love me because they are so messed up they may not have the capacity to love me, therefore I am not worthy of anyone's love.  Without realizing it, I accidentally/subconsciously wrote ""fear of being left alone"".  Is that all it is, just a fear that something will happen to everyone around me, and I will be left alone to cope (or not), whether by death, divorce, don't like/love me, or catastrophe, or ___?  I often tell myself I want to be alone, but deep down I really don't.  Deep down I want to be able to let people like or love me, to be able to accept and reflect those feelings, and to feel safe in letting people see a little bit of my emotional self.  How can I get over this fear?  I don't know..."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Hello Monday.  Another week at the salt mine.  It's not so bad, really, but sometimes I just get so stuck in the depressive spiral that I want to go postal.  Most people here see me as someone who can get a little nuts sometimes, so the element of fear keeps many people from pushing me too hard - this can be a good thing.   I have not been terribly social the last few days, but I'm not putting myself in a depressive spiral either. Overall, I have been in a decent mood the last week, not super, not ""happy"", but not too shabby.  I have been on the Effexor for a week now, and I move from 37mg to 75mg tomorrow. The only significant side effects so far are nausea, and intestinal ""issues"", and (to put it at discreetly as possible) mild sexual side effects, i.e. occasional difficulty maintaining or finishing. (This is not a big issue for me, we both understand it and accept it, so it does not become a problem.) The same side effects happened with Celexa also, from the lowest (10 mg) to highest dose (40 mg).  Hey, you clicked here, don't blame me.  It's all about sharing too much information."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"We went to Applebees last night for dinner.  The only reason I went is because I got a gift cert for helping someone move.  Our waitress had that shifty, abnormally high energy, frenetic twitching, can't remember my name, methamphetamine vibe.  Anne and I, being from Goldville, immediately recognize the druggie shuffle after years of seeing people affected by meth.  She forgot to enter our order, messed up our order, forgot to bring drinks, and had to be bailed out by the other waitresses.  She was not rude or mean or anything, just in withdrawl jitterbug mode.  I half expected her to start climbing the walls or throwing things at random, but she barely remained control.  As we drove away, she was outside the back door smoking as fast as possible.  Fucking drugs.  Yes she chose to do drugs, but anyone can make a mistake.  Once you are hooked, you are fucked."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I'll live, don't worry.  The depression is talking to me, the many voices in my head.  Maybe I need a higher dosage, maybe I need a new therapist, maybe I need a break from therapy.  I know I always feel worse before I feel better, after a session.  Often the discussions in therapy send me on a  dark spiral that I eventually get over, but not without some trying times first.  Bye for now."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"So here I sit Monday morning, dreading another day of work.  I almost drove the other way this morning.  A few blocks from the office, I had this barely controllable urge to turn off before I got within sight.  I don't know what I would have done, probably just sit and berate myself for being foolish.  So I continued to work, and pulled in the lot, and walked inside, and said perfunctory hellos, and got my coffee, and started working on computers, and started typing this entry, and wonder how the hell am I going to be productive today, when I simply don't want to be here?  Obviously, this is not just the Monday blues, but a continuation of last week's funk.  Anne and I were talking about this the other night.  I basically made her listen to me because I was so desparate, and she could tell.  Up until now I thought she really didn't understand what I am going through, but I the she is starting to.  She started talking about options how to pay for things on just her income for a month or 2.  She even suggested that maybe I could work 1/2 time for a while, allowing me to make some money, while having additional time for taking care of myself.  I think she understands now that I will go nuts without doing something different.  That is actually the best idea I have heard lately.  I have not thought it out very far, but maybe I could work about 4 hrs per day - not enought time to screw around or get distracted - and then have the afternoon to do projects at home, or take time for myself, write or talk to people, or whatever I need to do to help myself.  Just broaching this idea to my supervisor is (by my fucked-up rules) admitting failure, but out of anybody in management here, this person will understand and provide support.  If necessary, I may also be able to get my therapist to order me to cut back, thus taking the decision out of my hands."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"There is a young woman (I think she is 19) in our office who could be a model.  She is not too skinny or pouty or stuck-up, she looks great, and she smells captivating.  Whatever she wears for perfume, it is definitely worth whatever it costs.    BTW, speaking of attractive, Alanis Morissette's new look is very beguiling."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Later last night when Anne and Dan came home, I was just mentally drifting when she grabbed me and said hello with a nice kiss. The kids were busy with a movie, so we sneaked upstairs laid on the bed, just cuddling and talking. One thing led to another, and we were soon both crying in an emotional mess. Well, I guess that was mostly me. The conversation went something like this:    R=I don't know how you can love me, I feel so not worthy, I feel like I let you down all the time.  A=I love you anyway  R=I have a hard time loving you in return because of the depression.  I think you would be happier without me.  A=I love you very much, I need you.  R=Sometimes when the ""depressed-me"" is in charge, I think about leaving for a long time.  A=[silence]  R=When ""I"" am in control, I know I could never leave you, but ""I"" am not in control most of the time. The ""depressed-me"" is in control often, and he wants to push everyone away and be miserable, run away from everyone, including you.  A=[still silent]  R=I know you love me, but I can't return that love very well. When the ""depressed-me"" is in control, I don't feel love for anybody, I don't want anyone to love me.   A=[still silent}  R=I can feel so alone, whether by choice or not, with you, with friends, with family, at work... at those moments I really need someone to ...  A=pay more attention?  R=yes, and pull me back into the moment and let me know that I'm okay, that you care even if I am being a jerk. I feel so damaged, so incomplete as a partner, a companion, a husband...  A=[silence]  R=and the other part of me just wants to ignore everyone and be left alone in the grey zone.  A=I need to be alone sometimes too.  R=for weeks or months? for several days in a row? enough to make you question everything you have ever done end every relationship you have?  A=No.  R=I know you love me, and I love you very much, even though I don't show it very well. I'm sorry I am so messed up, I'm sorry I am causing you so much stress over this.  A=I do love you, very much  R=I don't know how to make you understand how I can be happy and so sad at the same time.  A=[silence]    Well,  at least this is different than feeling nothing, right?      added 2:50 pm:      Later, she made a joke:    R=What are you thinking, about how to get rid of me and hide the body so you can collect the insurance?  A=No, I already know how to do that...    We will be OK, I'm pretty sure.  It's not her, it's me."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Quote from me, last April:   Daniel is a great kid.  I wish I could care about people as much as he does.  He is almost always considerate of other peoples' feelings and truly cares about his friends, even when they aren't nice to him.  Give him another year, and he will find out how insincere and superficial other people really are, and turn bitter and hateful like me.  For now, he is wonderfully naive.   It turns out I was wrong on several counts.  A year later, he has not turned spiteful and bitter like me yet, and I hope he never feels he has to.  He has learned to protect himself a little while still feeling free to express himself at home, usually in an appropriate manner.  More importantly, I am learning from him (and from therapy) that it is not normal or healthy to turn spiteful and bitter and hateful and angry.  If I can re-learn how to protect my inner self in an appropriate way, I can learn to interact with people without being scared and mistrustful of them."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Another strange dream, not about death but an earthquake.    PART 1:  A giant quake, 9.5 or 10, hits San Diego (basically impossible), and we feel it strongly here in Eureka, 700 miles away (beyond impossible).  SD and LA are basically destroyed, with nearly 100,000 dead and over 5 million injuries - a catastrophic but probably unreasonable number.   Anyway, the whole family is here having dinner, and I feel like I am going to black out, but the shaking starts.  A very strong rolling shake, then a pause of several seconds, then not as strong, the shuddering, sharp shaking (typical quake here, but the timing was all wrong).  In the neighborhood (the street was the same, but all the houses and people were different), a 12 to 13-yr old girl is watching her 9 siblings while the parents are at dinner.  She is scared and hysterical, so Anne goes to help her out.   Fast-forward to the next morning, and we are at some sort of ceremony that is part candlelight vigil, until the jazz band starts up with Buddy Rich and Duke Ellington music.  Anne is mad at me for some reason, so she goes upstairs in this meeting hall and starts working on a computer (this is apparently her job).  My real-life boss Leo is her boss, gives her some encouragement, then looks at me, wondering what the hell I am doing wasting time?  I said ""I don't think I work here,"", and he says ""OK, you don't now!""  The rest of the day, I am trying to find TV coverage of the disaster, but no stations seem to have anything.  They show video from a clogged sewer manhole being pumped behind the NBC studios in Burbank, and Anne's mom says ""Oh yeah, we used to live in the hills right behind there.""  I am wondering if I am crazy, and ask if there actually was an earthquake, or if I was just dreaming.  Everyone says Oh yeah, we all felt it, you were right here.  I said ""why is there no coverage on TV, if this big a disaster happens?""  Nobody answers me, just looking at each other ...   PART 2:  ... then suddenly I wake up (in the dream I wake up; in reality I am still dreaming).  I am saying to Anne ""boy that was some weird dream, about this huge earthquake,"", and she says ""that was real, remember, we all felt it!""  So I head for work, totally confused, to my job as a bank teller in the mall.  As I am headed toward the bank, Donald Trump, coiffed with different but still hideous hair, stops me in the mall about 3 doors down from the bank.  He holds out his Visa Check Card (TM) and says ""Hi, I'm Donald Trump, you know, with the Visa Check Card (TM) commercials.""  I said, ""yeah, we met in New York a few weeks ago.""  He said ""I need to close out this Visa Check Card (TM) and open a new Cirrus credit card.""  [aside:  Cirrus card, are you freaking kidding me?  That was an ATM card from about 10 or 15 years ago, and I don't know if they even still exist.  Not only that, but why Donald Trump, and why had I met him in NY?]  So we go into the First Interstate Bank (which in reality was swallowed by Wells Fargo about 10 years ago), I sit down behind my desk, and I am absolutely clueless about how to do this.  I call the manager, who turns out to be Chevy Chase.  He says ""just push the buttons on this keypad,"" pointing to a 30-year-old device with a greed LED readout.  I punch in some numbers, and the screen says ""CALL PETE AT 1-800-..."", whatever the number was.  Chevy looks at me, I look at him, we both look at The Donald, and he finally says ""Well, call Pete!""  I do so, and Pete is either stoned or has just woke up.  I tell him the machine said to call him, and he says ""Is it a Visa Check Card (TM)?""  Yes.  ""OK, here are the numbers,"" and he rattles off a 18-digit number, seeming from random or from memory.  I try not to imagine who or where this guy is as I confirm the numbers and hang up.   Chevy looks at my numbers and says ""This can't be right, you have fractions, 6/11, 18/7, let me see this,"" end makes some seemingly random changes.  Finally I said ""so where is the credit card?"", and Chevy looks blank for a second, looks at Trump, then says ""oh yeah, that could be a problem.""  He sticks a receipt in to the ancient machine, it prints some numbers, and he hands the paper to The Donald, who walks away.  ... and I actually wake up slowly, stuck in that nether region between dreamland and reality.  I ask Anne if there was an earthquake, and she says ""no, maybe it was just you farting.""  OK, I'm back to reality now."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Why ia admitting depression or taking anti-depressants such a big deal still?  It's not like saying you're gay.  People take pills for headache, diabetes, heart problems, why not brain problems?  But there is still a stigma (doctor's word) that still lingers about psychotherapy.  I admit that I feel somewhat embarassed or awkward about it, when logically I know that is silly.  A common phrase is ""chemical imbalance"".  that word 'imbalance' in particular has connotations that go back hundreds of years in the English language, as well as unstable, unbalanced, manic (like maniac). (just an observation.)

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I have been feeling pretty good for a few days now.  That is hard to believe, considering the depth of the downward spiral I was mired in last week.  It feels really good to feel better.  I am doing stuff with the kids, there is less tension, they are not stressed trying to figure out my behavior, I am not being overly picky or critical or intolerant.  It is in these moments when I think I can see a future where I am in control of the depression, rather than it being in control of me.    I still have a hard time concentrating at work, but maybe I just feel less guilty about it at the moment.  Let's shelve that for now.     I am writing this in the living room on my laptop.  I tried to start at 9:20 when I sent the kids to bed.  They interrupted me several times until 10pm, when Anne came home.  I gave up until 11:30 when she went upstairs, then Nikki comes out at 11:40, then I have to investigate what the cat is dooing at 11:50.  Too many sounds, too many noises, too many people around.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"We had a case of the mangled manual on The Siblings Court the other day.  Dan claimed he saw Nikki and her friend ripping the manual to his Nintendo game, and that they ripped it again after he caught them.  Nikki's defense was that it was ""an accident"".  We set up a court, and I was the judge.  I made them take turns speaking just like in court, except I did the questioning.  Dan objected, and Nikki thought objecting meant he could lie.  The evidence showed that the the first rip may have been an accident, but the next 3 rips were not.  Anyway, Nikki was found guilty, and sentenced after she offered her apology (and attempted to bribe me with $50).  They both decided it was fair, even though Nikki was not really sorry about it.  They both had fun, it was fair, and it was a different way to solve a problem, in ... the Sibling's Court."

Well, that was done between the accounting office and the tank fund reimbursement office here.  After moving computers around and installing new wiring, a big file cabinet prevented removal of an unused network cable.  Eventually, someone asked my why they could not access the server.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Well, Anne and I are talking again, mostly light stuff, nothing serious, certainly nothing about the aborted runaway attempt.  Maybe she feels the best way to deal with it is to ignore it.  Maybe she is right, and I am making too much out of it.    What if I did the same thing?  I had a weak moment and took off in a rush to calm myself down.  Did I hurt anyone?  (actually, yes, hurt her feelings very badly, and maybe hurt our relationship as well).  Did I do something crazy or foolish or mean?  (foolish yea, crazy maybe, mean - up for interpretation.)   Is it possible to allow myself to just let that moment go, like burning toast or spilling milk?  It was 'The Beast' in control, not the real me.  But I think the reality is, the real me has to deal with the fallout caused by the Beast.  I think it is not a simple as ""forget about it, move on"" when it affects other people, my family.    I am reading a book from Anne Sheffield, about how the family of the depressed person is affected.  I started reading it to get a sense of Anne's perspective, what she might be thinking dealing with me.  Maybe I will try to get her to read it.  Also, I think she needs to have a session or two with the therapist, with or without me, whether she likes it or not.    Related to this, I had a talk with Nikki tonight.  She was being very nice.  She senses things are not right, just like Dan.  Anyway, a few days ago I had written her a letter she could understand about me problems.  I think it went well, I hope it helps her understand better.  (See next post for letter.)    Anyway, I am in a better mood, partly due to feeling useful at work, also because I have worn out the depressive side for a few days.  I don't have any self-pity left for now.  After watching the movie yesterday, I am going to be more decisive, and be a bad-ass if I need to be (okay, maybe just look at people when I talk to them).  When there is a situation, I will ask myself, What Would Bourne Do?  WWBD.    Someone just came into my office without knocking.  WWBD?  Smash his face with my coffee mug, keep everyone back with a gun, steal his car and race down Broadway, leaving destruction in my wake.  Everything will be better tomorrow.  OK, maybe that is not the best policy for now."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Bad things happen all the time to people of all ethnic and economic backgrounds, but the only time the media gets really interested is if the victims or their families are rich and white.  The Media force-feeds us tragedies of rich white people across the country as if the problems of the elite in their gated communities somehow relate to the rest of us who live or work or die in an imperfect, unmanicured, chaotic world.  In the past year, the TV networks have tripped over themselves and each other to see who could most dramatically portray the terrible stories of the upper crust: the kidnapping of a girl from a rich Mormon family living in Utah, or the divorce of 2 rich white people in Miami, or the custody battle over traumatized children resulting from an affair between rich white people in Manhattan.  Granted, the Laci Peterson case in Modesto does not involve rich people, but they sure are white.  I am willing to bet there have been several suspicious deaths of black or Hispanic victims in the Modesto area in the 18 months since that story appeared.   Why is it that the harsh realities of the lower middle class of varied ethnicity who work one or more jobs every day do not get the same media attention?  For every “high-profile” case that makes it on Dateline or Court TV or 20-20 or all the other shows, there are dozens of similar cases with equally terrible crimes, equally devastated families, and similar legal issues.  Are the crime victims of Oakland and Modesto and Eureka and a thousand other cities and towns not as important as the victims of the Hamptons or Aspen or Beverly Hills?  Does the skin color of the deceased make a murder more or less mysterious or appalling or final?  Is the perpetrator more or less guilty based on the number of zeros on the victims paycheck?  I blame The Media, which seems every day closer to becoming a group of public relations firms, intent on keeping their bosses/clients/supporters in the news every day, no matter what.  The rich corporations and rich individuals who own The Media need to look in the mirror and see their own kind.  The TV becomes that mirror, showing a homogeneous, white and green reflection that is the opposite of the diversity in culture and financial status that accurately reflects our country.  The only time that the media is truly interested in the hardships of minorities or the poor is when they are celebrities (OJ Simpson, who transcended race because of his athletic prowess, comes to mind) or when it directly affects those in power (visible homeless populations are unattractive to a city making a bid for the Olympics, for example).  The network news shows are the worst, but it happens in every media outlet from Peoria to Portland to New York City.  The media took a break from rich people during the aftermath of the 9-11 attacks; that coverage was somewhat sensitive the first few days but quickly degenerated into a race to see which network could find the most heart-wrenching and tragic and ironic story.  In addition, there are people in the media who look for stories that affect families and neighborhoods and communities where normal people live.  In those instances, the resolution of the story and the effect, positive or negative, is just as important as the crime itself.  In particular, I think the America’s Most Wanted show is honestly about solving crimes and bringing justice to all people, no matter what their socioeconomic background.  This is not a blind rant against every white person with lots of money.  I would like to be in that same position some day, and it is not for me to judge how a person earned (or was handed) their wealth.  If I am fortunate enough to earn stacks of money, I hope that I do not suddenly think that my problems outweigh those of my neighbors.  In addition, I certainly do not mean to suggest that the victims of violence or disaster deserve their fate or do not deserve any sympathy.  Death and fear and greed and hate and Mother Nature are still truly and painfully colorblind.  This diatribe is pointed more toward the idea that some persons are more important than others, their hardships are more significant, or their losses any more painful because of their circumstances of wealth or race.  Everybody deserves to have safe homes, safe children, well-built schools, adequate protection from the scourge of drugs.  Everybody deserves to feel like something positive can come from hardship or tragedy.  But please do not feed me the idea that the problems of the upper crust are a fair representation of the problems facing the rest of us.    Am I wrong?  Am I too critical?  Let me know what you think."

I'm not sure why, but in the dream it was a meeting in a house, and this small paper lunch sack represented a solution to the problem at hand.  Everyone there was very condescending, like I was powerless or not relevant to the action, and I had no skills or ability to give.  I was concentrating on the bag, like an irrational thought that if I could move the bag it would show everyone that I was powerful, that I could solve this problem.  I glared at the hateful bag and (in the dream still) sent a mental 'shove' to escape the inertia of normal physical laws of physics - AND THE BAG LIFTED!  Just for a second, and everyone saw it.  But at the same time, (in the dream) I dropped into semi-conscious trance, a seizure almost, but consciously aware (between sleep and awake) that I am shaking my way back to the bedroom, (struggling to escape the seizure) in my bed finally but still stuck in place, almost like my soul being pulled out of my body against my will.  The dream/seizure finally ends, I am fully awake, heart pounding, mentally checking myself to see what is normal and what's not.  Maybe only 5-10 seconds in awake-time, but it seemed like two minutes since lifting the bag.  I remember having a real, tangible feeling that I actually lifted the object through telekenetic force.

Fern Canyon is adjacent to one of the least crowded but accessible beach areas remaining in California.  You have to drive about 7 miles in and out on a little dirt road - pretty typical for this area.  The land is an uplifted terrace, with layers of compacted soil and depositied gravels compressed together over time at the bottom of the sea.  When uplift occurred, this section of the coast was not deformed in the same way as most areas locally.  Streams began cutting into these tightly compacted gravels, but created vertical-sided gorges rather than the typical V-shaped canyon with unstable slopes.  The resulting landform gives you up to 75-foot high near-vertical walls covered with many species of ferns, with a year-round stream flowing at the 20-30' wide bottom.  There is wildlife in the area as well.  There are several herds of Elk roaming the area, and you must be careful to not get too close accidentally.  There were coho salmon fry (endangered here) swimming in the stream, waiting untill fall rains to migrate the short distance downstream to the ocean.  Frogs were abundant, but we did not see any salamanders.  After walking the canyon, we went to the beach and watched seals, pelicans, cormorants, crustaceans, and waves.  On the drive out, we stopped about 15 feet from a medium size bull elk, munching on a willow tree, wary but not concerned with our van's presence, velvet still decorating his large antlers.  It was pretty cool seeing one that close in its environment, but I'm glad we were in the van and not on foot."

Since he is in his car, he DOES have a place to put the money!  I guess he is extremely comfortable with his body - fat, balding, naked, probably orange too.  God bless America!

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Dammit, I have been invaded by piss ants overnight.  They found lunch trash in my garbage can.  Instead of an ant trail, I found the Bayshore Freeway, 10 lanes of ants, toll booths, highway patrol, two ants trying to run an insurance scam, and prostitue ants on the exit ramps.  I was fascinated for about 7.2 seconds, then the carnage began.    I think ants freak out when they find other dead ants.  I have noticed that the smell of dead piss ants is a deterrant to use of the trail. In our old house I had killed an ant, and left the carcass on the trail as a warning to the others.  One ant found the body and started freaking out.  I thought he was going to eat his buddy, but instead he did a little st. vitus dance, spun around a few times, and rolled over in agony.  He stopped moving a few minutes later.  Very fascinating.  I wonder if the ants have some sort of collective consciousness, and actually have ""sympathy"" for the dead?  Here we go, anthromorphizing again."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"It is getting late, the weekend fast approaching, and I feel myself starting down the spiraling path again.  I am so mentally tired.  All the good feeling of the last few days had disappeared, and I can feel the weight of my thoughts taking hold, pulling me inexorably downward.  This sounds really pathetic and weak and self-defeating.  I don't care, welcome to the last 25 years of my life.  I am so unmotivated for work right now.  I really don't care a lot about anything other than getting better and improving my life.  I realize this fight against depression is the most important thing in my life right now.  I think that as long as I need to work, I will not have the energy I need to get better OR to be better at work.  I am beyond feeling guilty or stressed about work.  I am beyond wanting to move to another job.  I do feel pretty pathetic about the state of my career accomplishments.  I just feel like I am trapped by the paycheck, like so many other people.  I feel bad about having a well-paying job and having this problem.  I feel bad that I am wasting opportunity and talent fucking around at work, while other people with less opportunity and worse luck struggle to feed themselves and their families.  Kim says ""why don't you just do something different?""  I could, but I am scared of failure, worried about the money, have a huge fkn mortgage, and so on.  What would we do while I decided to retool, retrain, and start from the bottom as a 34-yr-old rookie at something?  How can we possibly afford the life we have created if I am not earning the primary income?   What would I do?  I think I could write professionally, but it takes so much effort and perserverance and a little luck to get noticed.  Where do you start?  How do you get noticed?  There are a million people trying to be writers, what makes me think I could get chosen by someone?  I don't have any formal training in writing, or computer science, or biology, or wildlife, or mapping, or any of the things I would really enjoy.  It is possible I could find some sort of service job where I deal with one of those interests.  I am definitely at a cross-roads, but I am too afraid to take any side roads.  I used to be decisive and well-informed about potential decisions.  I feel like I have lost the ability to make big life-changing decisions, because I really just don't care.  I can see the boring, straight, smooth road ahead, the path of least resistance, that leads to either the mental hospital or worse.  I wish I knew how to break out of this.  I suppose this is partly depressive thinking, but this is also just being realistic about my life.  I am not making good decisions right now about anything.  I guess I will see if I can get better internally, then start working on career.  I can't wait for winter rain and cold."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I had another weird dream, this on the day before driving to   Florence ,  Oregon   for our camping trip.    Dan and I were riding in my Mom’s old 1971 WV Bug, the 7-toned yellow one.    We were driving on the coast on an old, tiny, narrow road with very sharp corners, so sharp the Bug could not stay on the road.    The road turns a very sharp corner, and I calmly realize there is no way.    Dan (who is slightly older, perhaps 13) says “uh, DAD, LOOK OUT!!”, but too late as the wheels are already over the edge, driver’s side first, starting to nose down into the cove.       Falling - we are about 50 feet above the clear blue water, waves gently breaking on the rocky shore.    Time has stretched out in that dreamy way, giving us plenty of time to shift our weight backward and bring up the nose so the car is nearly flat by the time it hits the water.    There is time to look at the beautiful section of coast, the birds, the clouds, the slowly approaching water, as we fall.    As we are about 10 feet from the water, I am thinking, “VWs can float for a minute or two, so we will have time to –”       Suddenly time accelerates to about 125%, freaky fast, not quite fast forward.    The car immediately fills with water as we plunge below the surface, drifting quickly downward.    There is no time for either of us to breathe, or to warn Dan.    He is struggling to unlatch the (stupid VW) seatbelt, open the door, roll the window down, do something to escape, but he is running out of time.    In the meantime, I sit and do nothing, watching him without helping, while I idly fiddle with the rounded, black door-lock lever.    My lungs are imploding, but I don’t feel it or care.    Just before I breathe in the water, just before we both drown, I go black ... and wake up."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Greatest hits - 9.17.03  Sometimes Nikki says something where you think she is a tiny bit psychic, although you never know for sure.  I think most kids are a tiny bit psychic, but when you grow up you talk yourself out of believing in that ""little voice"" from the subconscious.  But you hear all the time about stories where someone didn't get on a plane, or knew to call someone at the right time, etc.  I take that back, I think maybe boys lose that ability at age 6 and never regain it, while girls are just a little psychic for a while longer.  My son specifically, and boys generally have a problem with this; hindsight is more like 20-200, not 20-20, and foresight is beyond the realm of belief.  Things like Nintendo and Captain Underpants and Spongebob Squarepants get in the way of logic, planning, reponsibility, etc.  Boys also have a general interest in anything involving the crotch area or flatulence; this finally wanes at about age 30 and returns at age 40 until death."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Here are two poems from essentially the same source: a series of curves in the Trinity mountains, and a dangerously wandering imagination while driving. I like the first one best, with multiple voices and a detached-observer feel. The second is much darker, with first-person suicidal hints, but IMHO not as well written.   Beyond the Lines Driving through the mountains, through the night the cold, grey, constant asphalt hums beneath the wheels No chatter, no slush, no gravel, no squeals  A monotonous road, like a monotonous life, is hard to enjoy no adventure, no challenge to keep you awake. I could fall asleep, or more likely make a mistake  The lines, stretching on, mark a simple boundary between morbid excitement and the continual grey (although the risks are fatal, they say)  Beyond the lines, the desperate risk everything dark, heavy dreams, straining at flight (and plummeting darkness, eternal night)  A brief rush in the moment, weightless and free something different from monotonous grey (blindly discarding all you have today)  A momentary freedom from all the constraints careless disregard for physical laws (but in the end, the plan has its flaws)  In a moment, a final decision is made to escape from a mind-numbing, lackluster life (the body is identified; someone contact his wife)  Caught in a moment between life and death the soul leaves your body, not to return (he failed to negotiate the sharp turn)  Your final gift to your family is a lifetime of heartache and pain. (he slid off the road in the rain)  Locked in a casket of steel and chrome, Your body falls to the river below To the hereafter, your soul must go   One Last Drive I'm driving the final miles on a journey with no end i'm exiting this highway just around the next bend  the grey asphalt stretches ahead a boring, monotonous life flat, endless, a stable roadbed (i wonder how they'll tell my wife)  You've got to stay on this road you must keep moving along fold your wings, keep them stowed there's no flying here, they say it is wrong  The painted lines enforce the rules that define the constraints we share no stopping or turning or pausing to rest don't cross the line, don't you dare  If you stray outside these lines leaving the road, right or left you leave all that you are behind a white boundary between life and death  But i'm here on a mission to see what's beside the road, the interesting part beautiful landscape and scenery the mountains and trees touch my heart  The watchful creatures that line the road are the souls who escaped before a fox, an owl, a possum, a toad hear the destiny in the tires' roar  I'm crossing the line, breaking the rule I can't drive this road any more I'm sure you think that I'm the fool until you find out what's in store.  The road is perched impossibly high upon the canyon wall death for the foolish or unlucky or those who maybe wish to fall  Leaving the pavement much too fast scenery changes to a sullen grey blur I though this beauty would forever last But it's temporary, I'm pretty sure.  I'm falling faster than I thought one can't escape Newton's law. I miscalculated, and now I'm caught. it seems my plan had a fatal flaw.  I always wondered what it felt like to fly now I know, and now I can die."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I’m so fucked up, so crazy right now.  Everyone stay away from me.  I started to run away, I almost made it, and then I came back.  I was doing so good for a couple of days, too.  How fast things change.  More than anything else, I guess I just feel ashamed and stupid.  What do I think this is going to accomplish??  Pain suffering, heartache for everyone, not just me.  ------------------  Nikki was pushing me again.  Every bedtime I get so mad at her, because she will not listen and not just do things.  She has to screw around with animal noises, being slow, stalling, whining, complaining, refusing, ignoring.  Last night she did the same thing, but it went too far.  I was trying, pleading with her to just brush teeth and go to bed, so I could have a few minutes alone, so I could quietly rest.  I told her, “Please do this simple thing so no one gets mad, nobody cries, nobody gets in trouble.”  She would not do it and would not answer.  “Please don’t make me get angry at you, I don’t want to yell.”  Again, just looking at me, mot moving, not responding.  Getting impatient now, I say “Why are you doing this?  Do you want a problem, do you want yelling and crying, do you want me to be mad?”  She just looks at me, now with a twinge of defiance in her eye.    I am losing control inside, and I am ready to start breaking things.  I start repeating “Go do it, NOW”, louder each time, until I am yelling as loud as I can.  She looks away for a second, and I slam a book on the table inches from her, scaring her into motion.  She runs to the hallway outside the bathroom and kneels on all fours like another fucking animal impression, while I follow her to keep her moving.  Yelling again “GET UP NOW”, I nudge her with my foot.  Then I have the urge to kick her hard.  Mentally I feel myself swinging my foot forcefully into her ribs, feeling her small bones cracking against my foot, hearing her scream in a sudden mixture of shock, pain, and fear, kicking her again in the butt hard enough to break her hip bone and my foot at he same time...  I am blurring the line between reality and dark, hateful fantasy.  I have to stop, I have to control this mad urge.  I manage to force my foot to remain pinned on the floor, and I yell at her, “I am so mad right now I want to kick you and hurt you.”  She yelled something equally childish to me, then runs into her room.  [no, I did not do anything to physically harm her]  A minute later, she comes out in to the living room and says to me, “I hate you, I want you to die, I want to hurt you, I want to stick a sharp knife in your head,” then runs back to her room.  This hurts so bad, but I have to tell her something.  I follow her and get almost face to face, and very quietly say:  “There is nothing you can say to me or do to me that will hurt me worse than I hurt myself.  I want to hurt myself all the time.  I say bad things to myself ALL THE TIME, worse things than anything you can think of.  I want bad stuff to happen to me, and I think about it ALL THE TIME.  I hurt myself worse than anyone else ever can.”  This was too much for her, and she turns away and lays on the bed, crying quietly, then louder as I leave the room.  I am sitting, hating myself and the beast within me.  I think about stabbing myself repeatedly in the arms and hands with a knife or maybe an icepick.  I think about the pistol upstairs, grateful there is no ammunition in the house.  I think about taking a bat and destroying everything in the house until I cannot pick up my arms.  I briefly think about wanting to hurt my little girl, and I start crying.  Soon the sadness disappears, the tears dry, and there is nothing left but hate and loathing for myself, for the Old Bitch, for the Beast.  Anne comes home and immediately senses a problem.  “What’s going on?”   I say nothing for several minutes, a long, heavy, oppressive pause as I am mentally testing various explanations for my latest downward spiral.  Finally, I say “OK, do you really want to know?”, almost in a challenging tone.  “Should I?”, she asks.  “Yes, you should.”  “I had to struggle to keep from hurting my child tonight.  It was all I could do to keep from kicking the crap out of her, hard enough to break bones, hard enough to need to take her to the hospital.  That would have got your attention, huh?”  Thinking about further ramifications, I say “that would have got lots of people’s attention...  or, what if you were at home, you tried to stop me, and I take a swing at you instead?  Or, what about me wondering if taking half a bottle of antidepressants would give me a heart attack or a coma?  Or what about the urges I get to fling myself over the cliff driving on the highway just to find out what it is like to fly?  Or, what about the fact that it is a good thing there is no ammo in the house for the gun?  Or what about the urge to simply destroy everything we own, tv, windows, stuff, just break it all?  How about that I think you and the kids are better off without me, that I need to get away before I hurt someone else?”  I finally run out of words.  Through this outburst, I am not really looking at her, I don’t have to, but I glance over to confirm her shock and surprise at me.    “I’ll bet you’re sorry you asked, huh?”  I let that thought sit there as I go into the bathroom, leaving her in shock on the couch.  When I return, she has gone upstairs to cry on the bed.  I stood for a few minutes, debating what to do.  Finally, without really thinking and without saying a word, I grab my keys and wallet and rush out the door with a slam, get in the car, and drive off before Anne can react and try to stop me.  Well, now what, I think as I start driving toward the highway.  I am filled with a hundred conflicting destinations, thoughts rational and otherwise, and an overbearing self-ridicule.  A part of me is trying to be detached and logical about it, but I’m not listening: “Where the hell are you going to go?  What will you do when you get there?  Won’t it be worse every mile you go?  What about tomorrow?  What about the next day?  Doesn’t it get harder every day you don’t return? You are being irrational, melodramatic, impulsive, out of control.”  I am just driving, through town, aimlessly north on the freeway, the lines leading me onward, 20 miles without even changing lanes, oblivious to the few cars on the road.  This road goes for 500 miles, I was thinking, without having to turn off.  There is a sense of escape conflicting with the guilt I feel with every mile.  As I pass Trinidad, the last lights I will see for a while, I get a sense that I am have reached a decision point, a threshold between a do-over and for-real.  As the last lights fade, the logical part of me checks the gas gauge out of habit and experience... and the rest of me grudgingly accepts that I can’t run anywhere without more gas.  I flip a u-turn across the divide and go back to Trinidad.  While getting gas, I go inside the mini mart for coffee.  The guy says “have a good night, man.”  Yeah, it has started off so well this far, I think, driving away... but I don’t get back on the freeway as I intended, instead continuing on the old road parallel to the freeway, leading south, toward home.  I am driving somewhat aimlessly, but I realize at his point that I cannot run any further away.  I make my way back to town indirectly on side roads, passing our old house where Dan was a baby 11 years ago, passing the street to Anne’s parents’ house, passing my office, then turning around and sitting in the office parking lot for a few minutes.  I’m aware that my presence in this neighborhood well past midnight might attract police attention, which I don’t want right now, so I park in the shadows and turn off the lights.  Then I pick up my phone, 2 hours after running away.  Anne answers on the second ring.  “I’m sorry I am such an idiot, such a fucking failure to you”, I said.  “I was waiting to get a call from the hospital or the police”, she says without accusing, but it still hurts me.  “I don’t want to kill myself, that’s too easy ... I just want to hurt and punish myself.”  Pause.  “I’m sorry I can’t control this or handle this mess any better.  I guess I’m being childish, running away.”  Longer pause.  “Do you want me to come home?”  “Yes,” she says, and starts crying.    So I head home, through the fog, the grey blanket shrouding everything and everyone, most of all my heart.  I think about trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together, and I wonder if we have been irreparably damaged, despite my return.  I return to a dark house, and go upstairs where she is waiting awake in bed.  I undress and get in without either of us saying a word and without touching each other.  After a few minutes, she finally turns toward me, and we hold each other, somewhat guardedly at first, not quite a full embrace, more from relief than anything else, no hint of passion.  I feel the sadness and the hurt coming from her (can she feel mine?), but I can’t say or do anything.  Finally we simply let each other go, and it took about an hour to fall asleep."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I saw the  urlLink Bourne Supremacy  yesterday.  I enjoyed it a lot - very fast, tense thriller from start to finish.  This film (like the first) has a very European feel to it, from the scenery to the shot selection to the soundtrack to the vehicles.  There are a few humorous turns, but they usually precede some bas-ass action by Bourne.  Matt Damon IS Bourne, without a doubt - another good acting job.    Not to give anything away, but you could tell after the first 10 minutes that the movie was in no way based on the book.  Having read all 3 books in the series, I know that they are interdependent on each other.  The way the movie started, it was clear that the remaining 90% of book number 2 and all of book 3 were no longer possible.  OK, fine, once I got over that, I enjoyed it.  I think I liked the first movie better because it was the first, and the audience discovered along with the characters what was happening.  In this one, the only person who doesn't know what is going on ... is Bourne.  The guy selling popcorn knew more than the main character did.  The premise was already in place from the first film, and the second added very little to the persona of Bourne, other than just another problem to solve for the same character.  I'm sure there is a film term for this plot device, but it is essentially ""Wheels are alrady in motion, drop the poor schmuck into the situation and see if he gets ground up into a chicken pie"".  The first movie was more true to Ludlum's novels in that regard.  Finally, some of the effects and chase scenes are simply beyond the realm of possibility, given the structural limits of funky Russian taxis against souped-up Mercedes sedans and the frailty of the human body.    Enough complaining, i'm being way too picky.  It was great!  B+."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I was adopted when I was three days old.  Due to the draconian laws of the Soviet Republik of Kalifornia, I cannot get my  original  birth certificate, only my revised b.cert. with my adopted name.  My mother was 17, I think, when I was born.  She was the daughter of an Air Force family, I think, so it's possible she moved somewhat frequently.  I have a picture from the high school yearbook in 1969, and yes, there is a strong resemblance.  I even mailed everyone in the country I could find with the same last name (only 400 or so, not that common).  But it seems like I can't find her.    I have decided to make a stronger effort to find my mother and see what happens.  Believe me, I have been over the pros and cons many times mentally and with family.  I realize it may turn out badly for one or both of us, and she may not want to meet me.  I have gone through the possibilities, and I am prepared to deal with whatever happens.  Whether or not we develop a relationship, there are a few things I want this person to know.  I want to thank her for giving me a chance at life.  I had the opportunity to live and experience everything, good and bad, because she made a conscious decision to give me a chance.  No matter how messed up I am, not matter what happened to me between 3 days old and today, none of it is her fault.  I have no anger or ill will whatsoever toward her, just gratitude.  I hope she does not feel guilty, and I hope she has not been sad about me, although I know it is likely she has.  I cannot imagine how painful it must be to give up your own child to someone else.  I want her to know that after all this time, I can tell her she made a good choice with the cards she was dealt, and it worked out just fine.  BTW, in no way is this a political stance one way or another on abortion vs adoption.  Neither should be a political issue, and I think everyone should shut the hell up about it.  Men should have learned by now that it doesn't work to try to tell women what they can or cannot do, because women run the whole show."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Sign in therapist’s waiting room, no receptionist:  “Please sit down - Someone Will be With You Shortly”  That is an open-ended statement, right?  If you are in a therapist’s office, it takes a great leap of faith to simply wait.  There are lots of possible negative outcomes here.  What if no one ever comes??  Maybe they evacuated, maybe they all fainted from carbon monoxide, maybe they all died of the superflu, maybe there is someone holding them at gunpoint, maybe they just don’t want to help YOU.  Maybe they will all come and tell you how messed up you really are, forget the touchy-feely crap, we have a special jacket for you, come see these men in white coats...  Maybe someone looking for you just left, and now you have missed your appointment and will be billed, but in reality you were there waiting the whole time, inventing horrifying possibilities why no one ever came to help you.  Something for me to think about in the waiting room."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"One ongoing problem is the communication block between Anne and I. One of my fortune-cookie maxims is that ""Communication only occurs when the message received is the same message that was sent, and the sender knows the message was received."" I was discussing this with the therapist yesterday. I think I have tried to Anne my thought or fears or problems, and I think she hears me, but I don't get the feedback I need to let me know she understands, or she doesn't and I need to say more. On the other side, I think that because of my depression I have not been very receptive to listening or receiving her messages. I think that she could make more of an effort to let me know what is in her mind, because trying to read her mind has not been very successful.     The shrink says that she has rules for when it is time to 'talk turkey' (her words). Among the rules are that you only speak truth, which may be uncomfortable for one or both people, but do not make judgments about or blame the other person. I think this is major stumbling block for me. One of my favorite coping mechanisms through life has been to avoid confrontation, and avoid rocking the boat. I think I would rather not say potentially uncomfortable things which may cause damage to our relationship, and instead keep it all in to avoid causing a problem. I suppose it may be a minor discomfort now, but wait a few years and see how these non-spoken issues grow very large and very painful to deal with. I am also afraid of the worst-case scenario, where we finally decide to say nothing but the truth, and it turns out that the truth hurts so much we can not recover. That would be worse for me than holding it all in and self-destructing.     Having said this, I think we will be OK in the end, but it will be painful getting there."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I wondered what was the right way to tell her more about my depression, but talking to a 7-yr-old can be a challenge.  So I wrote this down, we read it together, and talked about it a little, then she kept the paper to read again if she wants.  I hope it helps her understand.     Nikki,    I wanted to tell you why I am sad or mad so much.  I am sick right now.  It is called depression.  I have had this disease since I was 8 or 9 years old.  I won’t die, or need to go to a hospital because of this disease.  Instead of making my body sick, it takes over my brain, my thoughts and feelings.  I call it “the beast”.  It is like I have two people in my body - the real me, and the beast.    The beast is in control of me a lot.  The beast makes me think and do mean things.  It makes me want to hurt myself and be alone.  It makes me want to run away sometimes.  It makes me not want love from anyone.    You did not do anything to cause me to be sick.  Please, please do not blame yourself.  You are not the cause of my hurt.  Remember I told you about the mean old woman who hurt me and my Mom?  This is all her fault.    The real “me” is the Dad that you like to talk to, and play games with.  The real me is in control when I am happy, laughing, and patient.  The real me loves you very much and wants you to grow up into a strong happy person.      I try every day to fight the beast inside my brain.  Sometimes I win, but often I lose.  I am trying very hard, I am seeing a doctor, I am taking medicine, and I am reading lots of books to learn how to fight the beast.    You can help me fight the beast.  You can help me by being kind and showing love.  You can help me by having respect for me and Mom, and listening when we tell you to do things.  You can help me by choosing to brush teeth and get ready for bed without being slow or ignoring me.  You can help by not fighting with Daniel.  I don’t need you to be sad for me, because that will not help me or you.      It always makes me feel better when you sit with me to talk about stuff, or to ask questions, or to just give hugs.    I know you are a good person, and I know you do not hate me, even when you get mad and say that.  Please always remember that I love you no matter what, and I will try very hard to control the beast.  I don’t want to do anything to make you sad."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I am in the process of writing a long summary of what happened when I was a kid, the warped reality that resulted, and what I've done with that reality since.  I am also developing the list of characters that are in my head, to try to nail down the negative self-talk problems.  I will post it, even though it will be quite long.  I was real down last night, although I can't put my finger on why specifically.  I think sometimes I just get emotionally tired, not necessarily sad or angry or depressed.  I know it's just a symptom, but sometimes I have no energy or desire to do anything.  I wanted to leave the house for a while last night and just be by myself, but Anne was going to her quilt class.  She offered to take Nikki with her, so Dan and I were at home.  He left me alone for part of the time, but wanted to play later, so I did.  I forced myself to play a game with him (I like to play with him) but I really didn't want to .  I went to bed as soon as Anne got home, while she stayed up late (as usual).  I am feeling sick.  My migraine is back, the stuffy nose and allegies have been after me for a month now, and I just feel worn out.  Sleep helps, but not much.  My stomach is upset, and I think I will go home.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"Today we went and bought beds for the kids.  This morning, home-cooked bacon and eggs, fruit, and sourdough toast for brekkie - yum!  I'm at home now, supposed to be working on stuff, but writing instead.  Oh well, I guess I am really addicted to this writing thing.  The other night I wrote a short story about my grandpa's workshop, what it felt like, smelled like, and how much Mom and I missed him after he died.  I ended up almost crying by the time I was done.  I did no proofreading, but I think it came out pretty good, maybe one of the best things I ever wrote.  I will look at it, then post it here for anyone to read.  I guess I should get one of those creative commons copyright thingees, in case I ever decide to try to get anything published.  I am supposed to be working on taxes!  Yeah, the thing most people do in April.  I got the extension and paid my bill in April, then did not touch anything tax related until today.  I suppose I can get another extension, and just make this a year-round hobby.   Fuck the IRS.  I think someone could rewrite the tax code into a pamphlet smaller than the contract for a home purchase.  It's real simple:  if corporations stop getting deductions over a certain gross income level, and if individuals stop getting deductions over a certain gross income level, and there are smaller tax brackets, I think there will be more than enough taxes for anything we need.  Eliminate about 10% of the government employees at the state and federal level by eliminating redundant agencies and by simplifying laws.  Fly one less shuttle mission per year, and build 9 jets instead of 10.  States do not get a single penny of local property tax, business taxes, fees, or sales taxes.  Finally, a sales tax on everything except fresh food, and people under a certain income level get $__ dollars of sales tax refunded at the end of each month.  Everyone has a smart card that keeps track of the taxes they have paid.  Thanks, send me your payment for $100,000, and I will be glad to fill in the details."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I wake up this morning and feel defeated, lost, shamed, sad, guilty.  Guilty for hurting those around me and being such a failure as a person, a father, a husband.  I know this is the work of the inner demon, but I cannot stop it.  It would better for everyone if I ran away, I usually say, but it turns out I don’t even have the will to do that.  Unable to face work or family, I have banished myself to the hideaway over the garage, feeling like I’ve locked myself in a medieval tower for self-punishment.  I hope the kids do not find me here.  I can tell how stunned and shocked and hurt Anne is.  I guess I got her attention last night, eh?  Nice job, fucked-up loser. The greater the love and trust, the worse the shock is when one person suddenly snaps and acts in a way that is outside the other’s realm of possibilities.  I guess this is me trying to push her away, trying to get her to hate me as much as I hate myself.  If I keep working at it, She probably will not hate me, but just simply need to be apart from me for her own sanity and self-preservation.    It took longer, but I feel myself trying to do the same thing to her I have done to others.  The night I ran away from Becky in Reno, her silhouette staring at me from the window as I drove off to go rock-climbing at Donner at midnight.  The day I blew up at Angie for hiding my car keys in fun, and for the deal with Alyssa’s ATM card.  Other relationships with less intense feelings and correspondingly less elaborate sabotage.  My lack of connection with anyone in Mom’s family, despite their attempts to reach me after she died.  My lack of will to maintain any connection to Mom’s friends, or high school friends, or college friends, or former co-workers.  My habit of “wearing out my welcome” at each employer, where initially people seem to like me, then I become angry and bitter and distance myself from everyone.  This is what I do.  I get close to people, then I hurt them.  I push everyone away so they dislike me or ignore me.  I have tried and failed to maintain and uphold the value of Anne’s love and devotion to me.  I can’t place a high enough value on our marriage anymore, it’s not her fault at all.  I’m not worthy of her, I can’t stand the closeness, I just want to be alone for a while."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"My current good mood reminds me of one time in high school.  Normally I would hang out near the band room (I hear y'all saying GEEK or BAND FAG), but near the end of my senior year I was getting tired of that scene, I needed a change, I needed to feel something different.  Also, I was relatively happy the last half of that year, I had a few good friends, doing well in school, coming out of a shell socially.    One particular day, Alyssa and I and maybe someone else (Jason or Rich?) spent the majority of lunch sitting in the quad, typically the hangout of the ""in crowd"" and very much the social focal point.  Normally I avoided this place, but on this day the grass was a little greener, the April sun warming me inside and out, and I was encouraged rather than unnerved by the sound of people laughing and chatting.  I ate a thick chocolate milkshake with M&Ms, the candy freezing hard, crunching in my mouth.  We joked, we watched people, we talked about whatever.    The library guy had rolled out a stereo system and big speakers, typical for springtime.  Led Zeppelin IV was playing.  It was the first time I had really listened to the song Stairway to Heaven.  I felt every note. I was very quiet, taking it all in, seeing what I had missed out on during my self-imposed exile from the rest of the world, saving the memory like a video in my brain.  Alyssa asked me if I was ok - I must have drifted off into my mindscape again.  Yeah, I'm OK.  I have my best friend, I'm not nervous, I feel music, I feel alive."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"After high school, I attended a semester at Univ of Nevada, Reno.  Why only 1 semester, that's a story for a different day.  I have many good stories from that first semester away from home to write down.  Anyway, I ate regularly at the UNR Dining Commons (aka Dysentery Commons) because it was included with the dorm.  Two bad experiences:  There was one lady working there who apparently had plucked her eyebrows off, or else they were burned off in a kitchen accident.  (Why women pluck, I will never know.)  Then as part of her makeup ritual, she painted on new eyebrows with what appeared to be 90W gear oil.  She always seemed to be working around the steamed vegetables, steamed corn, green beans, or peas, where the steamer pan is set into the steel countertop which contains hot, steaming water.  The steamer was in a small side room, and all that steam and humidity made it very warm, and people, including the eyebrow lady, would sweat.  When she started sweating, and the steam hit her face, the painted-on eyebrows started running down her face, looking like stained tears from alien eyes.  The eyebrows ran into her eye and down her cheek.  I don't know if any of the eyebrows made it into the steamed vegetables or not, but I know I skipped steamed vegetables after seeing her working.  Another time, after eating lunch at the DC, I didn't feel so good.  I went back to my room and went to sleep.  I woke up two and a half days later, undressed, with a few concerned friends sitting around.  They told me I was delirious and had a high fever the whole time.  My friends Becky and Tracy had taken off my clothes to help me stay cool from the fever, but I never knew it.  (They never told me if they did anything to me while I was asleep and undressed, but they seemed to enjoy whatever happened.)  They said that they were ready to call for medical help if I had not woke up when I did.  Apparently I had got bad mayonnaise or mold or maybe salmonella from something.  The funny thing is, I don't remember getting up to use the bathroom (outside the room, down the hall) the whole time.  Anyway, be careful of food!"
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Back in 8th grade through 10th grade, I had braces.  Yay, that was fun, especially the bi-weekly clockwise quarter turn. Anyway, as if I wasn’t geeky enough, I had the headgear for s short time, until I simply refused to wear them.  Anyway, this teen moment came after the braces were off, but I still had a retainer my soph year.  I was still getting used to it when one day, I happened to be playing around with a girl (a senior) I had known for several years.  We were just pushing each other a little when she slipped and fell on the floor.  I leaned over to help her up, and at that moment by retainer fell out of my mouth ... onto her fuzzy sweater ... and hooked itself into the fabric right between her breasts.  We were both stunned, but she recovered quick enough to start screaming “oh my GOD”, recoiling in horror from the ghastly orthodontic device.  My first reaction (the wrong reaction, of course) was to attempt to extricate the retainer from her cleavage.  I had one chance, and quickly grabbed it, twisting as if I were removing a hook from a dying fish, but it would not come loose.  At this point I have vomited hardware onto her AND grabbed her chest.  That was too much, and she ran into the bathroom to remove the retainer.  I had to wait for her to come out of the bathroom to get my retainer back.  Obviously, it was slightly awkward between us for a while.  Sorry, Jeanette."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"The cleaning crew comes to our office Monday evenings, so the toilets are clean on Tuesday morning.  I don't know about other people, but to me one of the great pleasures of manhood is doing your business on a pristine, untouched, virgin toilet.  OK, I realize this may be a little weird, but I think the guys know what I'm talking about.  The men's room is one of the last places on earth where the sanctity of male relaxation is still firmly in place.  I have a few bathroom phobias anyway, not sure why.  I don't like multi-user bathrooms.  Not only do I like being in a bathroom by myself, but I like having TWO locked doors between me and the outside world.  Even better, a private bathroom with two locked doors surrounded by a locked gate in the middle of the woods.  I don't allow any family members in the bathroom with me.  The paper has to be OVER the roll, not under.  Whoever invented the little napkin-size square paper dispensers should be forced to use them forever.    There was an episode of Scrubs where there was a toilet on the roof.  If the door could be locked, I would go for it.  If there are any psychologists here, I'm sure that you can identify several Freudian theories about the obsession with the bathroom, so leave me a reference I can find.  I already know I'm messed up, but it would be interesting reading.  ===  OK, I have to do the boss' homework for his business class now.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"The old saying is that opposites attract.  Anne and I are not opposites, we come from similar economic setting, both quite introverted, a little nervous of social situations, etc.  I wonder if maybe we are too similar.  She has a very hard time communicating with me about her thoughts or feelings, unless it is about her job (she can talk all day about that).  We talk about the boring mundane stuff frequently, but it's like we are both scared to scratch any deeper.    The problem for me is that sometimes I get on a tangent and need to bounce really deep ideas or fears or concerns off someone who can give me feedback, constructive criticism, good advice, or even just pretend like they care.  Usually all I get is ""uh-huh"" or less, just a look that could mean ""I understand and I love you and I will support you no matter what"", or maybe ""I don't talk about my problems, so why must you"", or maybe ""Oprah is coming on, I need to end this conversation"", or maybe ""that burrito was a mistake.""  I can never tell what she is thinking, and she won't tell me, even when I literally beg.  I have not been a perfect partner, but I think I have gone way more than halfway in trying to communicate and trying to keep the interest alive in our marriage.  She just will not communicate with me unless it becomes a big deal, with tears and heavy emotions and pent-up stuff coming out in a pyroclastic blast.  I fear that so much that I start not communicating myself, on the premise that I have two choices.  I can say what is on my mind, and cause an emotional crisis, or I can just keep my mouth shut, and put off the crisis another day.  I just feel like she is not interested in sharing things or discussing things with me that are REAL important - feelings, fears, problems.  Sometimes I think she loves me but doesn't really like me.  Maybe it goes both ways..."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"The other day, I set mailbox limit warning messages for the first time.  I figure 5 MB is good enough for most users in an office environment, as long as they are maintaining their mailboxes correctly.  There was much weeping and gnashing of teeth, but I think most everyone here understands the need for reducing mailbox sizes, thereby reducing stress on the server.  I have one person, though, who (1) thinks he is the smartest individual on earth, (2) thinks it should be the sustaining job (i.e., my job) to ""fix"" the e-mail problem for him, and (3) sends me angry messages every day asking me to fix it for him.  He's a good guy, so I will ""fix"" it while trying to educate him a little.  In an office of 45 people, you can't really be the Asshole-IT guy, because everyone still knows you.  I imagine it is easier being a tyrant in a larger office (100+) when most people don't know you, and you can effectively hide behind the scenes and have people do your dirty work for you.  ===  We had the big company picnic and campout in the redwoods this weekend.  It went pretty well, no injuries or arrests, no brawls, only limited drunken debauchery (and I missed that part), and a few Sasquatch sightings.  Oh, that was just Dennis.  I was in charge of breakfast Sunday morning, and it was excellent.  Saturdays lunch-dinner was good - shitloads of bbq tri-tip and potluck side dishes and desserts.  The people who stayed overnight included the potheads and the lushes, and me and family, and one other couple (who think their dogs are their kids, which bugs the crap out of me).  Ordinarily I hate these functions, but I think I am starting to act in a more genuine way as far as being comfortable and secure as myself, whoever that is, instead of being my ""Work Character"" for everyone.  I was worried a little - see my earlier post.  In fact I never did what I considered:    ...when the fun is over I will just collapse into the dust and drool a lot, then wake up with dirt caked onto my face...   A few other people did just that, however.  Daniel got to play Frisbee (oh excuse me, DISC) and volleyball with the adults, and he did just fine.  He is becoming a big kid now.  Nikki, who was mad at her bike for several months (after learning to ride w/o training wheels), started riding again with very little effort."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"That basically sums it up at the moment.  It was nice to have other people in the house for simple fact that it distracts Anne from sitting and thinking about the other night (OK, she has Big Brother also) so I can ruminate in mental isolation.  Still have thoughts of self-inflicted pain, but more emotional rather than physical.  After reading W. Styron's short book on his depression, I keep thinking about where he says he improved dramatically in a hospital just because he was in a structured environment where the only demands placed on him were to feel better.  Sounds great, if I had a boatload of money and could afford to take off work and have no demands, I would have done it long ago.  If was considering suicide (I'm not), I can see the need for supervision, but unless I win the lottery, that will be a luxury I cannot afford."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Nikki won a goldfish at the fair, so we bought a small aquarium.  Before it was setup, Goldie went belly-up.  Nikki had to bury it in the garden, so I’m sure will find the decomposed carcass sometime in the future.  Anyway, we decided to buy more interesting and less sensitive fish from the store.  We ended up with neon tetras, and other fish I don’t know the names of (or really care, so I make up names like See-thru and Red-eye), 7 total.  The fish food and equipment supplier had a brochure, titled something like Fintastic - Fish are Fun!  In it, there is a blurb about how in (use big announcer voice) Major University Studies, people with fish were found to be more relaxed and less tense than others.  So I sit, watching a group of creatures collectively smaller than a pickle, with roughly the same mental capacity, swim in endless circles around in a small cage with glass walls and fake plants.  They depend on people, creatures outside their universe of which they have no concept, for all food and care.  Meanwhile we sit and observe their movements, secure and confident in our mastery over the natural world.  Having been taken from their friends at the store, they endure a meaningless life of several months waiting for either death by bloating, or for a curious cat to pluck them from their watery tedium, swat them around while they suffocate, then eat them in a few crunchy bites.  Yeah, that makes me feel much more relaxed about things.  Doesn’t remind me of my own distorted concepts about life at all, does it?  Real important place in the universe there.  Rock on, little fishies, you inspire me.  Anne says it’s not like they were taken directly from the Amazon River, and even if they were, they just would have been eaten by bigger fish anyway, so why not enjoy them?  Why not, indeed. I think we should throw in a predator fish, watch the carnage, then cook his ass for dinner."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Some days I feel like life is moving past me, and I can't keep up.  This is one of those days, where I sense the feeling that there are important or necessary things for me to do, and fun/enriching things for me to do.  I'm doing none of those, and am instead trying with little or no success to appear busy at work.  As stated before, I am no longer of the opinion that working somewhere else will solve my career angst.  I need an entirely new career, possibly involving entirely different sets of knowledge and skills.  But first, I need to work on myself, becoming whole and powerful.  Too bad I cannot possibly afford to quit working and go back to college for something new.  Choices made, mortgages signed, vows spoken, promises to be kept, lives entrusted, paths already taken.  I always thought that people were never really stuck.  I still believe that, but I now also realize that we sometimes allow ourselves to be held in place, stuck with molasses instead of super glue.  Sometimes the getting unstuck is more difficult that the tedium of marking time.  The rewards of pulling free are hard to see and harder to appreciate when everything around you is urging you to go with the current, don't resist, don't look around, just keep moving along.   People who do great things find the strength to resist the current, while those who are less strong live on in obscurity and grey tedium until they pass the baton for good, hoping their children will have a better life and do great things.  Is that how you know you have given up on life, when you start wishing great accomplishments for your kids, and neglect to care about your own dreams?   I had strength, once.  I resisted the current, for a few memorable moments.  Now I've forgotten how, and the Beast won't let me remember what it felt like.  I want that feeling back, I want to feel like I make a difference to the world, I want to be proud of something I did.  How, I don't know just yet.

I didn't need a perfect dad, just one who could be there.  I don't have anyone who can be strong for me in the rare moments when I can let down my guard.  I don't really have a rock I can lean on.  My best friend is the closest thing I have to a rock, but she is so far away, and she has her own life.  I have to be strong for everyone else around me, whether at home (emotional strength, dependable, provider, parent) or at work (dependable, trustworthy, productive).  I don't want to be any of those things, but if anyone else is around it is never OK to let myself be quiet, vulnerable, scared, sad, sick.  I only give myself permission to be that way when I am alone.  I think this is part of why I am so scared of people - I always need to put on a face for someone, including at home.    When I need emotional support from Anne, she has a hard time giving me what I need at that moment.  She loves me, she cares for me, but she won't talk to me when I really need it.  Last night I came home from work a nervous, anxious emotional wreck and basically cried myself into a nap.  I told her this later, and she kept right on quilting, acting like I had told her the car needed gas, or we were low on milk.  I poured a big glass of scotch and went to bed, passing out at about 10pm.  Later, around 2am, she woke me up to make love.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"A followup to the idea of characters or duality:  I noticed yesterday during therapy that I have built another barrier, created another character that I play while I am in a session. I am mostly honest with her, but I am also on my good behavior, the listening, understanding, agreeing me. Underneath, I am thinking "" she's trying to psyche me "", "" what a load of mind-bender shit "", "" what you say is nice here, but not in the   real   world "", or "" my friends are better therapists that you "".  Yesterday at the end of the hour, I accidentally let that facade slip a little. She said ""see you next week"", and I flippantly said ""yeah, if you want me to come back..."". That got her attention, and she said ""what does that mean?"" I said that I wasn't sure, it just popped out, and she said maybe I should say what I really was thinking. I said ""OK, I'll be here next week if *I* want to come back,"" which really is what I was thinking, but trying to disguise it in a perceived rejection from her.  After all the talk about not mind reading or assuming the other person's feelings, I still think she was a little taken aback at that exchange, because I think it totally surprised her - she could not hide it. I wasn't too surprised, because I have always been prone to saying exactly what I think, with brutal honesty, at the least appropriate moment, and damn the consequences.  Why am I thinking this way? Have I set her up as an authority or an expert, and now I'm looking for ways to tear her down?  Maybe, I always distrust the ""experts"" . Have I entered a self-destructive phase where I don't want help?  I don't think so . I really think I have just grown tired of letting someone look at my life who doesn't really understand me, who has some good answers and valid viewpoints, but nothing I could not reach with a little help from friends, or fellow blockers with similar problems.  I guess what I mean to say is that the talk therapy has about reached the end of its rope with me, at least on a weekly basis. I have read a lot, educated myself, and given myself better tools to deal with these issues on my own, with limited assistance.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I don’t know if this makes any sense or not, but here is a stream-of consciousness idea for your consideration.  I have heard of alcoholics or dug addicts having a brief moment where the logical mind makes one final, intense push for the person’s attention, the so-called “moment of clarity”. I definitely can relate to that from a depression standpoint. No matter how miserable or messed up the Beast has made you feel, there are moments where your logical mind forces you to look at everything about yourself and your world, good, bad, and in between, with a non-judgmental eye. Intervention from friends, loved ones, or even just caring strangers willing to help another human being, is very helpful, but sometimes the realization must come from within. If you can recognize this and honestly appreciate the good parts of life, no matter how briefly, I think it gives strength to carry on, to struggle though the darkness, and hope for recovery.  My heart hurts with the realization that there are many who cannot or will not see the good and gain strength. I think I have gained more compassion for people who seemingly have nothing to live for, but they probably do. It is just hidden too deep for them to see, shrouded in a fog of mental illness or addiction, and it is even more difficult for anyone else to see."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I can be real wordy, but I don't have a lot to say the last few days. Sure, the daily grind comes and goes, but who wants to hear about what I ate or what street I took to get home? The only thing worse than being mundane is reading about someone else's mundanity (made up word, but I like it).  One thing that just occurred to me is: Many of the songs, movies, name-brands, or people I dislike are a direct result of my insecurities, and my associating those things with other people having a good time when I am not, therefore fuckkem. Kinda stupid, but true. Two examples: 1) I will never buy a Dodge pickup becaue their commercials epitomize an arrogant, bigger is better, my vehicle represents my manhood, tough-guy male stereotype. 2) There is an 80's song, can't think of the artist or title, but it has the line ""you really know how to dance"" and was used in Bud commercials. I hate that song and can never listen to it.  I may explore this more in the near future.  Wouldn't it be ironic if this post were several hundred words long?  Not much to say, indeed.

We have VERY large poison oak here, sometimes reaching 50-60 feet tall climbing the trunks of redwood trees - locally known as ""old-growth"" PO. Very interesting how marching straight through the PO is more macho than ""tiptoeing around it like a pansy"", this statement from someone who has spent most of the last several months miserable from reaction to PO. Anyway, we always keep the Tecnu around.  Actually, I seem to be one of the few people who has very little to no reaction to poison oak, yet I am allergic to every other plant on the planet.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I have been reading several blogs lately, and I am drawn to people who have thoughts and fears and problems similar to myself.  Pretty typical, I suppose.  I think the thing that strikes me most is how many common feelings are shared by many people, in different ways and different language, but still similar: joylessness, anger, boredom, being unfulfilled, compromise, confusion, worthlessness.  I think most people do not feel a need to constantly question and doubt themselves and everything they do and everyone else around them.  I think it is more that people like myself end up finding common ground with each other, if we can get past our fears and inhibitions enough to actually talk about things like this.  I also think these are the people who end up blogging or finding some other outlet (like group therapy).  Take myself, for example.  I am basically terrified of talking to people from fear of not being accepted, a lack of self-confidence, and difficulty setting appropriate boundaries for relationships.  I can be utterly alone in a room full of people I know just because I am afraid that they don’t care about anything I have to say.  In a group of strangers I may engage in some small talk, but it is still uncomfortable for me.  If I was in a room for 2 hours with 10 people having the exact same thoughts and problems as me, what is the chance any of us would ever talk about it?  Pretty slim.  It's not ""safe"" in normal society to just blurt out your fears and concerns to total strangers.  But in the blogging world, everyone essentially shares a little (or a lot) about themselves, and it is a lot easier to “get to know” someone by reading their thoughts like you never can in the real world.  There is a safety in being somewhat anonymous, but you can still interact with others whose blogs get your attention.  I have e-mailed a few people about things in their blogs that struck me, and have traded a few messages now.  I think it would be cool to sit down with these people and have a cup of coffee and talk about whatever, heavy things, funny stuff, what makes them tick, etc.  This has opened me up to the possibility of caring about other people’s feelings and desires, and the feeling that I can share things to other (anonymous) people without being too close or getting hurt or damaged somehow.  I think this is helping me grow as an individual.  I suppose my outlook on blogging would totally change if I was blogging to keep in touch with friends, share funny stories about the gang giving away watermelon, discuss Sarah's crush on Joseph, or whatever else people with friends do.  I see some blogs as a group journal where a group of freinds shares stuff that is mildly funny or frivolous or interesting, but not very deep or intense or angst-ridden.  (That's not a put-down at all, just an observation.)  Obviously mine is not that kind of blog, as I am doing this for soul-searching, for figuring stuff out, for survival.  Finally: I think there is a tacit understanding among everyone here in Blogworld that we are all a little vulnerable, and we need to be careful with each other’s feelings.  I know some people do not have that same level of care and respect, but so far I get the feeling that there is generally support and concern for a person’s feelings, and people without nice things to say don’t say anything at all."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"I’ve crossed a threshold, gone too far outside the line, too close to the edge.  Anne is trying to pretend nothing happened, but she’s not a good actor.  We have said only a bare minimum, and only about mundane things, not a word about the gorilla sitting quietly in the corner of the room.  She won’t talk to me, won’t tell me what she is feeling.  She is going on with life, but keeping all her feelings inside.  Just like her note that time said, she doesn’t feel like talking about things to other people, so she may not say anything to her mom or sister.  I will probably find out, because the entire fam, including brother-in-law from Goldville, is descending on our house today for a lovely bbq get-together.  Maybe I will talk to my niece D., the 15-year-old alcoholic therapist.  We get each other pretty well.  No I haven’t stabbed myself yet, but I’m still thinking about it.  I have been awake since 8am, but just getting up and showered now.  I don’t really care.  I am the hideaway again, talking to the blog bcuz Anne won’t.  We lay next to each other for over an hour this morning, I gave her a backrub trying to be nice, but the deafening silence continued.    Maybe I’ve succeeded in driving her away, the wedge splitting the wood, the first crack making it all the way through.  Like hard old oak, if we are doomed to separate, it will not be a quick break but a tough job to break through all the knotted fiber and cellulose holding us.  I don’t want that to happen, but I am more afraid every day that it might."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Work? What's that? I think I have done about 2 hours worth of actual productive work in the 12 working hours since returning from vacation. I actually left the office and am sitting in the local library so I can write blog stuff without feeling guilty. OK, so the 90 minute lunch is not good for my employment status, but fukkit. Maybe I subconsciously want to get myself fired. That would shake things up a little, eh?    I have a decided lack of creativity in my culinary repertoire. The last several times I have drove through McDonalds for lunch, I have ordered the exact same thing - 2 McTastes-Like-Chicken, a Fruit & Yogurt, and the extra-large diet coke for $3.85 (again, my body is a temple - for devil worship) . Today, I thought I would do something different, so I left off the Fruit&Yogurt and paid only $2.78. Not only am I gastronomically challenged, I am pathologically cheap.    I had a spectacular poem I wrote from a dream, about crashiing into the ocean in my van. It was honestly one of the best things I have ever written. I am so pissed. I hope I find it.    I hate leafblowers. They symbolize everything that is wrong with Americans. They are loud, noisy, give off noxious gas, and they push one person's problems (leaves and dirt) onto someone else (my front yard) with little to no effort. Even worse ar those people who think they are too good to pick up their own fkn leafblower and instead hire illegal immigrants for $3/hr. How dirty would LA be without them??    Gas is too damn expensive. Behind the redwood curtain, it is 2.39 for unleaded. In Brookings, Oregon, it is 2.19, just as isolated, and they pump for you. At the Tolowa reservation in Smith River, it was 2.07 - no fed or state taxes for the tribe.     California sucks, I want out. Maybe I am a girlie-man democrat that has suddenly realized it is not so cool to have far-right-wing-Terminator as the governator."

I told Anne I wanted the same cake for my birthday party.  She said ""you never want a birthday party, you hate birthdays, you never want anyone to make a big deal about it.""  Touche. Fine, then I want a big huge party this year, and everyone I have ever known is invited (except the old bitch, assuming her possessed earthly form still haunts the earth).  I will invite people from high school, college, Goldville, wherever.  In fact, everyone who reads this blog is invited.  See you in the Redwoods next year.

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I have a fantasy about writing an episode of CSI, or maybe just a short story, about the homicide of John Elway. He is visiting in Vegas and is murdered in his hotel room. The weird part is that his head is severed and replaced with the severed head of a donkey. Meanwhile, the donkey with Elway's head is recovered from the bathroom near the sports book at the New Frontier. The donkey is just fine, and was chacking out the horse racing on the TV wall. Of course, police recognised Elway's body in the hotel room immediately, because of the facial resemblance to a donkey, and it took several hours before anyone realized the head in the hotel room actually belonged to the donkey downstairs, who by now is in a room with a couple of prostitutes, saying ""I'm a Stallion!"" over and over. Anyway, it turns out the crime was committed by a crazed Raiders fan, who is sitting in Gilley's watching midnight bikini bull riding.    BTW, I'm hope Elway's arena football team gets their ASSES beat by Bon Jovi's AFL team.  Bon Jovi is cool."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"Another billable day.  Ho-hum, whatever.  I have vacation in about 3 weeks, so that is something to anticipate.  I guess I am in a blah mood today, but not really the wet gray blanket I have felt so much lately.  Not every day can be happy and bright.  Just slightly above blah is OK for me right now, I can't handle too much contentment at once.  I think that I am starting to believe that I can change my thought processes just a little bit, enough to be more in a healthy controlled state rather than the violent mood swings or hopeless, panicky depression.  It turns out that the medication maybe does 20% of the work, but I have to do the rest.  I think that I need to mourn for a lost childhood, lost opportunities, and a lost father.  I need to direct my anger at its cause (the Old Bitch).  This will allow me to not be angry at the people around me or myself.  I need to remind myself constantly that I don't need to be paranoid about people and that I don't have to trust them with everything to be friendly with them.  I can't control others' actions, I can only control my reactions.  I am not defined by my job or my appearance or my history.  I will be defined by my actions and my thoughts today and every day in the future.  OK, one day at a time.  Small steps, small goals, enjoy small successes.  (This sounds really dopey, but it makes sense to me, really, I swear.)"
4VSEFM9,male,34,"So I was sitting in my car, contemplating the sorry-ass mood I have been in, reading my cognitive therapy books, thinking I have reached the bottom of my current grey mood.  I am trying to listen to the Inner Critic, hearing the constant litany of crap channeled through my conscious thoughts...  Then suddenly a  very large BOOM  shook the ground, the air, my car!  In a town of 30,000, you hear loud noises occasionally, but this was very large, like a bomb or an explosion.  I drove in a loop around downtown, but no one seemed very concerned, no sirens, police cruising sedately down Broadway, and so on.  When I got back to the office, several people heard it and felt it.  I was over a mile from the office, so it must have been something large.  Maybe we are under attack.  Maybe Al-queda needs redwood trees for something so they are here to kick our ass.  Oh well, as long as the terrorists don't ask me how I am feeling today.  The next person that asks me ""how ya doin?"" will get punished, I'm quite sure."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"I just got several votes in an online awards ceremony.  Worryingly, they were for 'really needs to get laid'. REALLY worryingly, only one of them was me voting for myself.  So the question is: Were the other votes sympathy votes, or ridicule, and are any of them likely to result in my getting laid?  Pesky secret ballots. And why am I even admitting to this?  edit: All the votes were ridicule. bah."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, about to leave to drive into town to meet dave, Steve and Kat last night, I get to the car. And see that something's wrong. Notably, that my rear tyre on the driver's side is flat. There is a simple reason for this situation. It's because some fucking cuntweed has slashed it.   I am still raging about this, even the next morning. That car's seemed to cost me nothing but vast amounts of money since as soon as I took posession of it. Now most of the costs like insurance, I can handle, because I knew they were coming. But now I have to fork out for a new tyre simply because some fucktard with nothing better to do has put a sharp object into it. It's not going to be that expensive, and I have the money, it's just the principle of the thing.   It's times like this that I really give serious consideration to moving away. Even just a few miles out into the countryside, away from Glasgow. Where I could be pretty certain that my posessions would be safe from the constant threat of mindless vandalism. Where there wouldn't be neds hassling you all the goddamn time.   Why can't half the population of the world just go somewhere quiet and just fucking well curl up and die?  Not in the best of moods at the moment, and this was just the final straw."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Heard some good news today, an old friend is getting married soon. She emailed me this afternoon to tell me, and while I was shocked to hear it, I'm really happy for her, despite the inherent cliche of Valentine's day proposals.  In all seriousness, this is great news, she was a fantastic friend to me before she moved abroad, and was always there for advice, and more often than not, she saved me from total embarrassment by guiding me away from routes best not taken. There will always be a place in my heart for her, and I truly believe that she is one of life's good ones. She deserves nothing but the best, and by all accounts she's found it.  I raise my glass to thee (metaphorically speaking, since I'm not holding a glass at the moment). Congratulations!"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Bunch of us out last night for Eilidh's farewell night out.   Went to Wagamama or whatever it's called in West George Street. Seemed like a nice place, and indeed, we all enjoyed ourselves. At the time. The atmosphere was good, and it was nice and airy.  Moved on to The Lab, and everything seemed to be going fine....until I started to feel sick. One vomit later, and I'm feeling decidedly less than pleasant. The second vomit later on came after me running (""Faster than I've ever seen before""-Dave) to the toilet. General analysis of the symptoms suggests that there may well have been nut traces in the food.   Wasn't feeling well enough for the Cathouse, so I just went home to bed. Seems like a bit of an anticlimax for Eilidh's big final night, but it really couldn't be helped. I am actually gonna miss her more than words can say, she's been a really fantastic friend to me over the past 18 months or so. She deserves the best of everything, and I hope with all my heart that she has a great time in the US.  Now, to go and see if I can get my stomach to settle down enough for breakfast."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Went to see the wrestling at Braehead this afternoon.  Got there in plenty of time, and managed to get parked without too much difficulty. Got inside, and our seats weren't too bad. I always get worried about things like that, thinking I'm gonna be miles from the action, but it's always closer than it looks on TV. It is now clear that getting tiered seating would be a good thing in the future.  As an arena itself, Braehead is surprisingly good, nice and modern, and with good facilities and acoustics.  As for the show itself, it was a minor letdown, to be honest. Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle were missing, for obvious reasons. There weren't that many top stars there, and when your opening match is Chuck Palumbo vs Orlando Jordan, you know what to expect.   John Cena was hugely over, although his match lasted about 2 minutes max. The whole show had a sort of lacklustre feel to it. Some of these guys have had only one day off in the past 7, and the tiredness certainly showed.  Crowd was into Eddie and Rey as well, plus some inexplicable cheers for that fat piece of shit that they call Rikishi. Plenty of cheap heat and pops, so they were at least putting on an effort to make this more than the 'Hello, insert city's name here!' that there usually is.  A pleasant enough way to pass an afternoon, but not what it could have been."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, yeah, got the tickets and everything sorted out, and I'm confirmed as going to Las Vegas.  Fly out of Glasgow on the morning of the 20th April, and get back on the morning of the 29th (having left Vegas on the morning of the 28th - timezones eh?)  Spending 8 nights at the Circus Circus hotel, and current exchange rates give me about $800 - $900 spending money while I'm there.  The flights were ludicrously cheap to buy, got them for £290 + tax, which I'm told is great for a return flight at this time of year. There are stops in Amsterdam and Minneapolis, but I can tolerate that. Gives me a chance to stretch my legs. Land in Vegas at about half six in the evening, so the flight times are good as well, not the usual ""Flying out on holiday from Glasgow? Then you won't be wanting flights in daylight then!"" type shenanigans.  *bounces about, unable to control his glee*"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Work was fun yesterday, as we taunted the English about losing in Euro 2004 by altering the phonetic alphabet. ""That's P for Portugal, B for Beckham, M for Miss..."". Was a fairly quiet day overall, not that many people calling in, so I wasn't too stressed. Got told towards the end of the day that there had been a system crash of sorts, so my extra shifts today and tomorrow were cancelled, and Monday was in jeopardy. So I'll find out on Monday morning whether or not that's happening.  This meant that last night, I was able to go out for a while. Headed out to the Cathouse, where a decent enough night was had, albeit with a few minor issues. It's also always funny when the dj is completely panelled though, and last night was no exception. Was being watched in a suspicious matter at one point, but nothing was happening, so gossip mongers can STFU.  PC upgrades have now taken place, with a 160gig hard drive now in my machine. Much cheapness, managed to get it for £65 including postage. Not many upgrades to go, I'll keep the 6gig that was the E drive, and make that a removable one, for file transferring between here and Scapegoatia, and there's an extra fan to be installed. After which, it's only broadband to be added, since an ethernet card was fitted last night. And possibly a new case, depending on how I feel at the time.  Got not very much sleep at all last night, so I'm just gonna have a lazy day today, I think."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Not done much this week, mainly just working and similar such crap.  Gonna get myself broadband in the next couple of weeks or so, and seriously considering switching to Linux once I've done that.  Other than that, it's been pretty dull. Job still sucks, but I've been informed of a possible date of exit. Which would be 'teh rock'"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Been listening to this for much of today (well, since I got home from work, at any rate), as the Prodigy album I was getting sent hasn't arrived due to Trillian crashing twice.     I have to say, it's really a fine album. Probably because it's a collection of reworkings of blues songs, so Tyler and Perry weren't allowed anywhere near a writing session. Actually, that's unfair. Tyler and Perry can write some damn fine stuff, it's when they allow the record company to parachute other songwriters onto the process that it all goes to shit.     But it's a damn good collection of good old-fashioned blues rock, which, let's be honest, is what Aerosmith do best. The Geffen-era output was okay, and it certainly revitalised their careers, but it wasn't a patch on the material they were coming up with when the Toxic Twins were loaded up to the brim with high-powered drugs.     Aerosmith have always been a double-edged sword to me. They were the first band that I ever got really into, way back in the early 1990s, but a combination of poor albums (Just Push Play, anyone?), and THAT concert in 1997 (a blatant contractual obligation concert, never before have I seen a band go through the motions in such a banal manner) led me away, and onto other stuff. But I've always had a soft spot for them when they're on form.    This album that I didn't pay for has been brought to you by broadband internet connections."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"This new job, while it is just callcentre work, appears to have the potential for serious raking in of cash. Working bank holidays gives double time, and I could even get triple time if I worked Christmas Day. For that kind of money, I'd happily skip any family dinner shenanigans.   Training proper starts tomorrow, at 9am. Which is quite early, but still, I'm finished by mid-afternoon. In the 5th week of training, I get my shifts proper given to me, and they can't be changed for 26 weeks. So I could, in theory, be starting work at 7.15am for 6 months. That'd be 6 months of getting up at 5am. Yikes!  Seen a couple of movies recently. Caught Underworld on Monday night, which was enjoyable enough. Blatant rip-off of Romeo and Juliet, but since I hate Shakespeare, I'll allow such flagrant theft. One thing that stuck in my mind was the shoes that Seline was wearing. If she's meant to be some death dealer or whatever she calls it, surely some footwear that allows her to run....well, less like a girl...would have been better. Just a thought.  Then last night, the intention was to see Battle Royale, which I still haven't ever watched. But no. The spirits gathered, and wreaked their terrifying revenge on those who wish to see movies by decreeing that the movie be sold out by the time I got there. Thus it was so.  So I went to see Bad Boys II. Probably about a half hour too long, but good enough as a 'leave your brain at the door' type movie. Some of Will smith's lines were fairly amusing as well. 2 funny moments, as one of the guys is drinking a huge (and I do mean huge) soda, and Jeff leans over and just says ""That's a medium. They cost 40p."" Other amusement as I'm one of probably 10 people out of 600 in the cinema who knew who the hell Dan Marino was when he made his cameo.  Other than that, not really a great deal been happening. Picked up Ring (Japanese version) on DVD. Will probably watch that soon enough, and find out if it's true that the American remake was as bad as they say. Well, not  bad  as such, just a shadow of the original's brilliance.  Pub for a while tomorrow for Dave's birthday, but Friday morning work hits any plans for major chaos over the head with a large hammer. No saturday morning work, though, so shall probably hit the town with him on Friday night, if all goes according to plan.  Right, this time I am away....."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Spent most of this weekend tinkering with my PC.  Well, not the hardware, since that's just an accident waiting to happen with me. But some software tweakery abounds, and everything appears to be working a bit better, which naturally makes me a happy person. Browser is now Firefox 0.8 (must products keep changing their names?) and I have a method of playing Real media that isn't bloated to whale proportions like the official realplayer is. Minor mucking about means that (fuck knows HOW) Zone Alarm and AdAware also work, which is a first for me.  Other than that, not been up to much. There's a rant building up on a previous employer, but I'll sit on that one for a wee bit, best to wait until everything is clearer, and nothing I say will have any possible recriminations.   Staying in tonight as well. Had considered bedlam, but not really up for it. I know it's something that I should probably go to one of these days, trying new things and all, but tonight will not be that night."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Big fuck-off thunderstorm a few hours ago.   Went for a walk after it was over. I LOVE doing that, it's one of the absolute best times to be out, with the air so crisp and such like.   I give it 2 days before the humidity's intolerable again."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"I've been quite busy this weekend, which makes a change, it's nice to once in a while have a weekend where I don't just waste it by allowing myself to vegetate the whole time.  Started off by going over to the Barras market with Steve yesterday afternoon. Didn't buy anytyhing, but it was good just to look around and see what was for sale (and be inherently suspicious as to the legality of a large portion of the available goods - ""Naw, these DVDs are pure legit, there's writing on 'em to tell you what it is an' all""). Walked into town, and I picked up the Michael Palin 'Around the World in 80 days' DVD set for £3.99, which was muchly bargainsome, and, like all proper versions, does not feature 'kung-fu loon' Jackie Chan. I mean really, I like Chan's movies, but there are certain roles that he should be kept the hell away from, and Passepartout (sp?) is one of them.  On the way back to the car, we ran into a throng of the sort that reminds why I hate Glasgow. Yep, the World Bigotry Championships had their Glasgow heat yesterday, going under the title of the Orange Walk. The joy of a bunch of intolerant fuckheads marching to celebrate beating some people of a mildly different religion in a battle 314 years ago, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, while a few thousand neanderthals drag their knuckles along the ground supporting them and cheering them on. There's no need for it, and it really shouldn't be happening in this day and age.  Come the evening, having consumed a large steak, 4 of us headed out to watch Shrek 2. I enjoyed this movie a lot, much like I did the first one. It strikes the right balance of slapstick and pratfalls for the kids, and decent jokes and pop-culture references for the more mature audiences. The animation was absolutely top-notch, and may well be the final death-knell for 2D animated movies. They just don't have the same level of immersion that you get with the newest crop of 3D pictures.  I have only 2 gripes about Shrek 2:  1) The changing voices. This isn't really a dig at the movie in and of itself, more at Hollywood in general. Now, in this movie, Joan Rivers and Larry King have voice parts. But some assclown at the studio has obviously decided that we aren't culturally aware enough over here to know who these people are, so they've been overdubbed by Kate Thornton and Jonathan Ross. So we have a character who looks like Joan Rivers, and is acting like Joan Rivers (i.e bitchy and deserving of a long time - ideally the rest of eternity - in a pine box), yet is voiced by that daft bint who presents (and I use the word reservedly) Pop Idol. We're reduced to having the no-talent presenter of a no-talent show because we can't be trusted to know who is providing the voice in a film. Thank you Hollywood. Thank you very fucking much.  2) They've announced that there'll be a Shrek 3. And a Shrek 4. Maybe I'm just a little cynical, but I don't think they'll be able to keep the quality up and fresh for another 2 movies.  3) Hell, here's a 3rd gripe. The trailers prior to the movie. Around The World In 80 Days I've already spoken about (and never will again, with any luck), but the others were all about the destruction, nay obliteration, of my childhood memories.  Thunderbirds the Movie: Looks shite. Garfield the movie: Looks shite. Garfield in particular fills me with horror. The only possible saving grace is Bill Murray as the voice of the Garfield, and I still feel they should have retired the whole concept when Lorenzo Music died. (the day the music died? Sorry)  Post cinema, me, Dave and Eilidh all headed back to Dave's, and watched Monsters Inc. Again, a good movie, first time I'd seen it. Dave also had a magazine with a feature about the Hives, and asked me to autograph the bit where the guy who looks like me was pictured. Glad to oblige, fame at last.  This morning, I went to the early showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 (a 4th July special, if you will). I agreed with most of the politics behind it, but it seemed a bit contrived in places, and it was very much a movie of 2 halves. The first half was classic Michael Moore, political conspiracies and all that jazz, but the second half was pretty different, it switched to an anti-war emotive piece, as he went for the heartstrings. To be honest, the second half doesn't work as well as the first, and it lessens the impact of the film as a whole.   I think the criticism of Moore isn't as valid as the Republicans would like it to be. This isn't an objective piece he's made, it's his opinion. Yes, he presents facts, but he presents them in such a way as to support his points. But, if we're being entirely honest, that happens in all documentary pieces, albeit usually to a lesser degree. No film-maker can be truly objective, there's always a part of their subconscious that'll influence it. But I did like the quoting of Orwell at the finish, and the fading out to ""Rocking in The Free World"". Free world indeed."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Things are looking good.  My sister's just bought herself a car. So she'll have her own, and with my mum having her own as well, that leaves me as the only driver of the dentmobile.  What this means: I'll have to pay all of the petrol costs. This is not a problem, since I already pay for the petrol I use, so there'll be no change there. I'll have to pay all the road tax. Not a great problem either. I'll have to contribute to the insurance. At the moment, my Mum's had the Megane on her insurance, so we haven't had to pay anything for it. I've told her I'm willing to stump up for it, on condition that the policy goes into my name so I can start building up a no claims bonus. Checking online for some quotes, and I can get fully comprehensive cover for £470-odd a year. The snag for this is that I have to be the registered owner of the car, but if it all comes down to it, my Mum may be willing to sign the owneership of teh car over to me (for legal convenience purposes only, natch. It wouldn't actually be my car...) The current insurance isn't due for renewal until May, so it's not of vital condern.  Upshot of all this: Come early next week, I'll have almost 100% control over the Dentmobile.  Things are looking good."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Bunch of cunts.  They're apparently not showing either of the next 2 Pay-Per-Views. I want my wrestling, dammit! The Wrestling Channel's not even going to be on ntl, and now this happens.  I wonder if they realise quite how many people only have Sky subscriptions for the wrestling. This could come back and bite them.  I know what they're up to, though. If they deprive us of this, then they're hoping there'll be a huge demand of relieved people when they try and launch more wrestling on Pay-Per-View.  Bastards."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Took a call in work the other day from a Mr Akuma.  Managed to fit the phrases 'uppercut', and '15 hit combo' into the conversation without him noticing, which was one of those rare moments that makes work feel not so bad and lets me smile for a few minutes.  Having said that, the guy was so stupid and slow that I could have detonated a small nuclear device in his front room and it'd have taken him a while to notice."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So the Butler report's been released and it basically says that there were serious flaws in the intelligence that the UK government used to take the county to war in Iraq.  Blair now says that that's all well and good, but the war was still ok because Saddam's gone.  I KNEW he'd do this. Fucking slimy cocksmoking liar."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Work dragged in today, boring as hell, with cretins aplenty calling in.   With about an hour and a half to go, though, things picked up. The Doncaster call centre picked up a fault, and that meant manual login to clear the backlog of calls trying to get through. Or at least, it would have meant that, but our manager was off, and so it was basically a license to skive for the rest of the shift. I took 3 calls in 90 minutes, with times of 7 minutes, 18 seconds, and 3 seconds.   I'm now off for two and a half weeks. It's great.  Credit card still hasn't arrived though."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Well, got my application for the secondemnt handed in at work, so it remains to be seen how well that goes. I don't even kniow yet how many have applied, but I'd like to think I'm in with somewhat of a chance.  Going to get myself a new mobile phone at some point soon, I'm getting fed up with the current one. Can't decide what one to go for. Shall probably wait until a couple more wage packets have gone in to my account though. Well, there's last month's bonus to be paid, but that's not for another couple of weeks though.  Speaking of wages, it appears that work did actually pay me for the holidays I took. Despite the fact there's no way in hell I'd accrued those holidays. Feh, I don't care, it's cash for me.  Other stuff I will probably end up buying in the future:  A digital camera. Just because I want one. A decent size hard drive. Because 6gig and 8 gig are not the storage sizes to be running a system on. Plus, it'd be needed to go with the other thing to buy... Broadband. I'm fed up with 56k, I really am. I reckon I can afford it easily enough. And if my sister thinks she's piggybacking on it, she can fuck right off.  2 minutes left on this connection. Time to go."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"There appears to be a problem with my PC, where trying to post something over a certain size to the internet, be it here or on a forum, is causing problems. Mozilla browsers pop up the error detailed below, and IE / Avant browsers go to an 'action cancelled' page.  No idea what's causing it."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"In work today, it was a 'fun' day to mark the fact that BT had been in that building for ten years. Very little fun took place, but that was of secondary importance, as the hot manager on my floor was getting into the spirit of things by wearing an astoundingly short skirt, and some knee high boots.   Distraction-tastic, and all of a sudden all I can do for the rest of the day is stare and drool.  We got a couple of hours of manual login, so it wasn't all bad. Skiving ahoy."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Was covering a shift in the Vic last night. It seemed pretty quiet, but managed to take in £400, which apparently isn't bad for a Tuesday night. One guy was in though, and oh dear god he was the most annoying and boring man in the world. When he found out I'd done a degree in Politics, he went off on a rant about how Scotland is dying, and it's all the fault of the politicians who legalised abortion. Now at this point, I heard a small sound, but didn't know what it was. With hindsight, it was an alarm bell going off in my head.  Later on, it got worse. I was wearing a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and the conversation went a bit like this: ""Zeppelin were a good band. But they're all dead old now."" ""Yeah. Hell, one of them's a corpse"" ""But his spirit's in heaven"" ""If you believe that sort of thing, then yeah, I guess"" It turns out that was just about the stupidest thing I could have said, as I was then subjected to a rant about how 'The Lord' (in quotes because it's fictional) was guiding our spirit and our soul from this world to the next. I said I didn't believe all that, and once you die, you're worm food. Cue him telling me that  ""Oh, it's not about belief, it's historical fact"".  Somewhat annoyingly, I couldn't let him have the full brunt of my argument, I had to try and be as non-offensive as possible. Oh, how I wish I'd been on the other side of the bar, to tell him that sorry, but he's talking shite, and the fact is that this so-called God simply doesn't exist, and was an invention of the church to try and scare the people into slavish obedience.  The guy then went on to tell me to make the most of my life, and how he'd raised 5 kids in a Canadian mining village and never taken a day off work in his life, and...file under boring stories and irrelevant opinions.   Other than that, not a great deal's happened. New Flesh tonight, and it appears that there's been a fuck-up with the sound system at Fury Murry's, so Steve's night upstairs there doesn't open now until  next  Thursday.  That's all for now, folks."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Got my dollars for Vegas yesterday. Twelve hundred of them, thanks to a really good current exchange rate. Got $200 in cash, and $1000 in travellers cheques. This should be fun.  And after having to send 'em some payslips, the bank approved me for the emergency credit card.  And the manager at work finally remembered to put my days off into the spreadsheet. Only 2 of the team are allowed to be off at any one time, and there are 3 of us with holidays booked at the same time as me. But I'm in the spreadsheet, so fuck 'em. Hell, fuck 'em anyway, I was going no matter what work said.  This is all shaping up to be really good."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Not been up to a great deal most of the week, just working and sleeping really. Went to the pub with Dave on Tuesday night, but found myself getting tired really quickly. I'm not liking these early starts AT ALL.  Work itself has been fun when I'm actually in there. Yesterday I hit my points target for the first time since I started, which means very little since I'm still getting my bonus protected for the next week at least. I then followed that up by having a really shite day points-wise today. There has at least been humour though in the ways to cut people off, and phoning them back if they hang up on you.  Also, I took a call from a guy today who sounded like Weebl. I had to try VERY hard to stop myself from laughing.  Problems afoot on the 'seeing Dream Theater' front. It looks like I won't get the Friday and the Saturday off, only one of them. So I'm going to have to take the Friday, and then travel back overnight to make it into work on the saturday. It sucks, but I am NOT missing this concert.  That all, really."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"There's not a great deal to say here, since this is in fact the first post I've typed here. But there'll be more to come. I can't vouch for the quality though.  If you want to read the details on the shit that's been happening until now, then feel free to visit  urlLink  here . It covers the last 15 months of my life, and is of only mild interest. Shit happens."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Didn't expect THAT.  A good victory for Celtic, and it contained everything a good match should. namely, attractive attacking football, hard tackling, us winning, and a pier six brawl breaking out.  Rab Douglas is a cretin, Bobo Balde only mildly less so, but he played well tonight, so I'll let him off."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, another Halloween's been and gone. last nigth was actually the best fun I've had in ages on Halloween. The costume worked really well, despite the necessity of a few iterations.  I'd bought all the necessary stuff earlier in the day, so drove up to Steve & Kat's to get made up as The Terminator. It was a lot less painless than last year, and only took an hour or so. This time, also, Steve recorded it all on the digital camera, so there's no need to wait forever to view it.   It also turns out that last year's use of glue as the bottom layer was a good thing, as the scar wax was having issues with staying on my face, and it won out in the end, with falloffery in extremus. Still, the silver and blood looked good, and it worked really well with the bullet-holed sunglasses.  Headed to the catty, via Heather & Jeff's flat. Six of the Magnificent Seven were out, and the tone was set when we got there at 10.20 and saw a queue that's longer than I care for. Man, it was packed in there. Too packed. But I managed to find a few places where it wasn't too hot, and thus it wasn't too bad overall. Got my photo taken for the official site as well, and there were a fair amount of people commenting on the goodness of the costume.   Gave a few lifts home afterwards, and the spiderweb nature of the destinations meant that I didn't get to bed until 5am. Still, I don't begrudge any of them, they're my friends and I'll drive them home rather than leave them to run the gauntlet of the city centre.  That's about it so far."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Was out last night, wasn't a bad night out, but I got bored and tired far too quickly. I'm getting a bit sick of the Cathouse, to be honest. It's just...the same, all the time. These days, how good a night out I have is determined mainly by the people who are there. The club doesn't change. Now don't get me wrong, there are some damn fine nights I've had there, where I've danced like a loon for hours on end, and the music's been off the charts. But those are a lot fewer and further between these days.    I'm just a bit down at the moment. Not down, even, so much as confused. I've got some stuff going on in my head, and I can't get it shifted. I really have to make a decision soon, but if I leave it too late it'll be made for me. It may be made for me anyway. There's no real wrong outcome for this, just a good one or a better one. 8 or 2? Who knows?"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"I was going to write here about how good Requiem for a Dream was. To keep it short: A fantastic film, very depressing though. Only bit I didn't like was the bit where she and the host leave the TV. Lost the realism from the movie a wee bit, I thought.  But that's all you're getting about RfaD. Because I got a disturning IM about 5 minutes ago. One that told me about the plans of Hollywood at the moment. They're remaking Dark Water.  Were they not content to make such a hatchet job of Ring? Must they destroy another movie that I love? Is it beyond the realms of possibility for them to, just once, LEAVE THE FUCK ALONE? What was wrong with it the way it was? Nothing that Hollywood can fix anyway, that's for sure.  Japanese horror movies are a breed of their own, they have that quality that's so hard to get right, they have atmosphere. Hollywood will ruin this, guaranteed, and I am so fucking raging about it that it's untrue.  Damn you Hollywood. Damn you straight to hell."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Got home from work today to find out that some people (although I use the term under duress) had broken into my sister's car last night. Drilled a hole in the front passenger side door, and went in hoping to steal the CD player. Which was in the house. So they made do with stealing....wait for it....you won't believe the haul they got.....a Fiat Punto owners manual and a few burnt CDs. Hope whoever it was feels it was worth it.   Seriously, why the fuck would someone go to that much effort for what they got? My only conclusion is that they are nothing other than parasitic subhuman blots on the face of humanity. What this country needs is prison sentences. Long ones.  Grrrr.  *so angry right now*"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So we did watch Wrestlemania last night, and I was very impressed with it.  First up, what I didn't like about the show: The tag title matches. Really, they were just two clusterfucks that took up space and didn't really do much in terms of storyline or crowd reaction. And that fat piece of shit Rikishi is still on TV. It would have been better if they'd taken the time from these matches and given it to...  The Cruiserweight match. Ten guys, ten minutes. What the fuck you mongo? This match really needed a half hour, and it could have been a classic. Chavo Guerrero retains, which drew complaints from Dave since ""How can Rey Mysterio lose? He's dressed like the flash?""  About 2.30am or so, Kat texts and asks who won what so far, and gets a reply about jam. Simultaneously from me & Dave. Ach, I was videoing it for her and Steve anyway, but I haven't checked yet if it worked. And I forgot to do it on LongPlay, so it's split over two tapes.  The rest of the show was really good, I thought, with some solid wrestling throughout. Didn't really expect Trish's turn at all, but on the plus side, it does make Jericho a bona-fide face. It was also an example of how to do a storyline PROPERLY. A slow buildup, and no need to hotshot it in the desire for ratings.   Evolution and Rock'n'Sock put on a good match as well, with a finish that I expected, but wasn't disappointed with.  Brock Lesnar and Bill Goldberg learned the hard way about New York crowds that they cheer and boo who they want to. And the entire arena seemed to know that Lesnar was quitting, as 'You sold out' chants echoed all over MSG.   Eddie retains title over Kurt in a top class match. This was one of those matches where you didn't know beforehand who was going to win, which is rare these days.   Two matches to go, and it's MARK OUT TIME! Kane in the ring, and me and Dave are literally on the edge of our seats waiting for what's about to happen. Lights out. 'Oooooh yeeees'. Paul Motherfucking Bearer! Druids with torches. Crazy chanting. A short pause. This is what we have truly waited many months for. BONG! Fucking Yes!  To explain, The Undertaker was the wrestler I marked out for when I first became a fan, and I've always had a soft spot for the deadman character. Although not the biker idiot. So to see him back as the zombie type Undertaker for the first time in over 4 years was a nice moment. He's not the full-on deadman that he was before, and the match was short and plodding, with so little selling that you'd think it was a Hulk Hogan convention, but the entrance was the most important bit of it, make no mistake there.  In the main event, a legitmate classic, with the correct result. The crowd chose wisely as well, and while I'm sure that this won't last as long as it should, be aware of one thing above all else. The record books will show that in front of 20,000 people or so, at one of the most historic arenas in the world, Madison Square Garden, Triple H submited cleanly in the centre of the ring to Chris Benoit.  The show closed with Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in the ring together as champions.  Wrestlemania XX was billed as 'Where it all begins...again'. if this is the beginning, I'm looking forward to what's to come. I repeat, Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in the ring together, each a world champion. It is a good time to be a wrestling fan."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Fantastic movie.   Let's be honest right from the start, movies with zombies are almost always good. This is no exception. Many moments that are laugh-out-loud funny, and plenty of geeky in-jokes and references to be had. My favourite bit was the battering of the landlord to Queen's 'Don't stop me now'. Most amusing.  Plus there's the constant references to Big Al.  Thumbs way up, highly recommended for all to see."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Well, thanks to a quick visit to an internet cafe, I was finally able to get a gmail account set up, so with ntl still teh b0rked, I'll be using that for my email from now on.  So if anyone wants to contact me, I'm now reachable at gordon.henderson(@)gmail.com Remove the brackets though.  Heard good things about the service, namely the spam filters, and the fact that there's a gig of storage. So none of this hotmail '2meg and you run out of space' crap. And the much-criticised adverts appear no more intrusive than the ones at the side of google search pages that everyone ignores anyway."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Was up at Steve and Kat's last night. The visit has confirmed one thing for me that I was well aware of, but am now acutely aware of: I'm never having kids. I simply do not have the patience to look after something that small and annoying. I'm sure it's cute and all, but the constant crying would have resulted in defenestration if it was my child. Hence the no kid-having in these quarters.  Elsewhere, not been up to a great deal. was out on Sunday night, and it was fairly amusing, as Jam once again comes to the fore in riginals. I wonder what they must think of us in that place.  My sister's away on holiday for a week, leaving today, and yet the first I found out about it was yesterday. Gotta love that whole 'communication within the family unit' thing. Still, it means a week of no restrictions on my use of the car. And a week of paying for all of the petrol.  Gonna probably go to this job fair thingy tomorrow, see if that brings anything. Doubt it, but it's always worth a shot.  Not really had much to say, so I shall say not very much. Indeed, I haven't. Cheerio!"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Well, last night was fun. In the 'Would rather have my eyes removed by a rusty spoon' sense of the word fun.  I've decided that, by and large, people are scum. One guy last night seemed unable to tell the difference between a £10 and a £20 note. So he basically accused me of being a thief and a liar. Which was silly of him, since I was 100% sure that I was right. So when he continued to try and argue his point, there was only one thing to do - break out the sarcasm. He didn't like this, but I stand by my actions.   Then, while getting the bus home, some shit almost kicked off. I'd always thought that 'Excuse me mate, could you get your elbow out of my spine please?' was a perfectly reasonable request. Apparently not. The guy next to me was clearly under the impression that his ticket gave him the right to a seat and a half, with added attempts to injure other travellers.   His attempts at 'threats' were of just about the lowest quality I've ever experienced. After repeating ""don't start"" many times at my initial requests (which was strange. In my view, it's the person who elbows someone else who's starting it.) he then changed his line of argument to ""What are you wanting to say?"". Which again was strange, as he repeated that so often that he never even gave me a chance to say anything.   Thank fuck the weekend's over, is all I can say. I can only hope that time will solve problems. It should never have come to this though."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Watched the replay of the wrestling last night, wasn't too bad a show. Some crazy bumps OF DEATH, and some not too bad wrestling all in. Triple H jobbed as well, which makes it all worthwhile. Not a massive turnout, but more than would have been there had I watched it on Sunday night. Good to see Heather back up for the first time in ages as well.  Plan for afterwards had been to go to frequency, but that wasn't on, so I just pissed about online for a bit and then went to bed.  Wednesday night wasn't so good. Went to New flesh as always, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do. After about an hour there, I was tired and just wanted to get to my bed. Didn't really spot anything wrong with the night musically, it may just have been the way I was feeling.  I keep getting invited for interviews for these jobs that I applied for from the job fair. I only applied half-heartedly, hell, I don't want half the jobs, but they keep trying to offer them to me. Still, I'll see how those go, got a few interviews next week.  Shenanigans are afoot. The bad kind. I get the impression that there's about to be a screwjob ending, and I can't help but think that it's entirely deliberate. It's what they've secretly wanted for ages now, and if things pan out the way they're looking, then they'll get it. I will have no part in their ill-gotten supremacy, though. It's old school or not at all.  Elsewhere, I'm getting inklings of something stirring, but at the moment, they're nothing more than that. Text is annoyingly good at concealing true feelings and thoughts.  ...and now for the weekend. Busier than normal for me, plus the return of an honourable night out. Should be fun."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"It's the last week of the month in work, and while I still hate the place with all my heart, I'd like to leave on my terms, not theirs.  So to avoid P45-ness of suck, then my stats and performance have to improve. Mainly because I spent the first 2 and a half weeks of the months arseing about like I invented it as a pastime. Now the simple stats, like time offline and other such nonsense, I can fix easily, that's just down to my attitude. The other figures, namely how much I've actually sold, are what causes a few problems, since it is partly out of my hands, requiring as it does the cooperation of those who call in to buy stuff.   So how do I go about fixing this then? Simple, when you think about it. Remove the need for co-operation. Wave goodbye to your conscience. In other words, ""If they're breathing, they're buying"". Take no for an answer? Nuh-uh. They'd better have a damn good reason for not wanting the product, or I'm gonna make damn sure that they take it.  Now, to the casual reader, it may look like like I'm scamming, but it's not really like that. I'm not going to put something on a person's account without them agreeing to it, I'm just going to use every trick in the book to get them to agree. I'm going to become the exact type of salesman that I despise. But only for a week until I get myself off the performance improvement plan that I'm on. Then it's back to my old friend laziness.   Of course, I've already spotted a few loopholes that can be used to boost stats within the rules at anytime. So they'll stay in my armoury."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"The Ric Flair DVD set arrived yesterday.   Watching it, I'm reminded of an age gone by. An age when the wrestlers actually knew how to wrestle. They had technial training. They knew how to work a match. They were experts in psychology. They were well aware of how to get the fans into their match. They thought nothing of wrestling for over half an hour every night. They were people who looked like you or me. With a bit of work in the gym, you too could get a start in wrestling.  Fast forward to now. The norm is people who are well over 6 feet tall, and 250 - 300lbs heavy (now I'm about 250, but not in a healthy, actually has muscles, sort of a way). Most have next to no actual wrestling ability, instead knowing a few big moves and separating them with punchy kicky shit. With a few exceptions, they can't go more than 10-15 minutes without becoming blown up. 1 hour matches are rare to the point of almost being in museums.  The only way to break into wrestling's top echelon (and by this I mean the WWE) is for the average man in the street to grow 6 inches, or hit the steroids big time (no, HHH, I'm not talking about you. I fully believe that you got that physique from hours of painstaking work in the gym.)  The blame for all this lies on many fronts. My main beef is with the fans of wrestling these days. They've watched the decline of wrestling. They've seen McMahon's army of roidfreaks take over the sport. They've fallen for the catchphrases and the comedy skits.  They've become pavlovian in their repsonses, chanting back towards the ring whenever The Rock or whoever feeds them the set up line.  They've been conditioned to accept a 3 minute match on Raw as a legitimate contest, and as such, whenever someone does try to have a proper technical match, it's dismissed as boring because there isn't spot after spot after spot. Only if the participants are already legitimate main-eventers is the match accepted. The 'sports entertainers' have taken over, and I don't like it. It's partly because of people being determined to keep their place on the top of the card, when it's obvious to all concerned that they should have retired long ago. So they have a match with the young upstart, bury him, then claim that as proof that he can't draw money and should drop back down a level.  Sometimes I worry for the future. I needn't be overly worried, I'm sure. There'll always be quality wrestling available. It may just be a bit harder to find. Meanwhile, the big leagues will evolve into another iteration of what the power men think wrestling should be. And the fans will follow like the sheep they are.   On a slightly less depressing note, there are some promotions (Ring of Honor springs to mind) that are trying to turn the tide. But they draw 400 people to an event, and the WWE draws 12000. So it's a while to wait.  Also, the Flair DVD, need I say it, is off the charts brilliant. Buy it. Now. All of you."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Got the notification from the DVLA the other day that I was now the registered keeper of the Dentmobile. Which is all well and good, until the fucking thing develops a hole in the exhaust within 8 FUCKING HOURS of the documentation arriving.  Raspy engine noises are bad, so while I was at work today, I got my mum to take it to the local branch of Kwik-Fit to see what was up with it exactly.   Got home from work, and discovered the exhaust looked suspiciously brand new. Which it was. And it had cost £130 or thereabouts. At that price, I'd expect the thing to be solid gold. They even had the audacity to say that we should be thankful that the catalytic converter was okay, because that would have been another £200 and a pound of flesh to replace. So whoop-de-fucking-do for the trees and associated huggers.  The heated rear windscreen's still fucked though, but that's not so vital at this time of year."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Yesterday wasn't as good as Saturday.  Turns out that my dog has an anal abcess. This means she's in constant pain, and has mild constipation. So the vet's given us some pills and antibiotics for her, which should clear it up in a week or so. It's kinda sad to see her like this, for as much as she annoys me almost all the time, I don't like to see her as miserable as she clearly is.   Being a dog, it goes without saying that she's having none of the pill-takery, and much spit-outery is in evidence. To get around this, I decided to wrap the pills in a little bit of cheese. Success! as it doesn't even touch the sides of her throat on the way down.  Elsewhere, went to the Cathouse last night, and on the way in, there was a very distinct smell of air-freshener. Turns out that this was because a pipe had burst the previous night and spilled its contents all over. Worryingly, it was a sewage pipe. I'm told a large amount of the staff had to get innoculated, so in a short while we can expect them to be complaining of Cathouse syndrome (it's like Gulf War syndrome, except with the same symptoms every week).  The night was mixed. The first 2 hours were great, there was stupid banter with all sorts (it's been decided that Slipknot should sing Sinatra while doing a kickline at their next concert - c'mon, it'd be funny...), and a decent length of conversation with Eilidh, which is all too rare these days with her normally living up in the field. But then she got sick and left, and I got bored and tired, and just generally fed up with everything.   To tell the truth, I've been feeling like this on and off for the past few months, basically since I got back from Las Vegas. I had such a fantastic time out there that Glasgow just doesn't seem to hold my interest the way it used to. It comes and goes, but the periods where I mope are more extreme, and the times when I'm truly happy are all too fleeting.  Got another 4 days at work starting tomorrow, and I'm just dreading it. The regular manager's back from her holiday, which means an end to the working environment of fun, and back to the constant struggle to get anything done with the 'would be pointy-haired if she was male' moron shouting all the time.  And someone can count themselves very lucky that I value someone else's opinion and wishes as highly as I do, because it's just saved them from extinction."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Out last night for Ross' birthday. Was pretty good, some good banter from most of those gathered, and general fun abounded.  Discovered that I could lift up certain people using only my feet. Also discovered that my fingers are not meant to be bent back the wrong way, thanks to someone's attampts to do exactly that. (Looking in your direction here, Eilidh). Also, found out that certain rumours are going around about me. They're false, people.  Was watchful in case interference needed to be run, but danger was averted.   Home, slept, up. Things are looking up on the shenanigans front, had a decent natter about it, and there may be a resolution soon. As before, no side-takery for me. But much listening."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Decided that I couldn't really face going out tonight. Mainly because it's the Glasgow Fair weekend. (note to non-Glaswegian readers: Historically, all the heavy industry shut down for their workers to get 2 weeks holiday for the last 2 weeks in July. The first weekend of this featured a fair of sorts held in the city for those who couldn't afford to leave. Although the heavy industry's mostly dead and holidays are a lot more staggered and modern, the tradition remains, and thus there's a public holiday on Fair Monday, i.e. tomorrow)    So, yeah, it's fair weekend, which means that everyone's off work tomorrow (except those who work for BT, go figure), and the Cathouse will thusly be more packed than a tin of sardines that's been crushed under an industrial steam-hammer. Frankly, the Cathouse is a bit shit when packed to the rafters, and full of far too many arseholes, so rather than going out and getting annoyed by a swarm of cretins, I figured I'd just have a quiet night in.    Quiet nights in are much under-rated. It's good just to have your own company for a while and relax watching movies or pissing about on the internet or whatever. Plus, you're never more than a few feet away from bed, it doesn't require any effort to pass out through tiredness.    Watched Edward Scissorhands just there, and I'd forgotten how much I loved that film. Which is to be expected, since it's Tim Burton, and the only film of his that I haven't loved to bits was Planet of the Apes. All of his other stuff has been really great, and I need to pick more of it up on DVD.    Other than that, not done much. Headed down to Dave's last night, just hung out for a while with pizza and other such munchables. A good night, with all kinds of stupid banter. Sometimes I think we'd actually be real trouble if our minds were left to bounce off each other for too long. I've known this since the Napoleon theory and the extra episodes of The Bible though.     Right, offski."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Work isn't too bad so far. Trainer seems a nice enough person, atmosphere's nice and relaxed all good as yet.  Rest of the training class seems OK. 9 of us, 3 men, 6 women. 1 person never speaks, 2/6 BGW, 3/6 IIWD, and 1/6 NWABP. Most of them are friendly enough.  Away from work, was out last night for Dave's birthday, and will be out tonight for Dave's birthday. Not working tomorrow, though, so won't be leaving early tonight. Final payment from the jobcentre isn't through yet, so it's once again a sober one for me.  That's all really. There was a longer entry, but my PC crashed, which it's been doing a lot recently. Just randomly rebooting, sometimes without me even touching anything. It's 5 years old, so I think it's on its last legs. May invest in a cheap replacement soon. Don't need skynet, something that has the power to run Photochop, has a decent HD space, and a CD burner would be perfectly sufficient."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Forgot to mention, I found out why I didn't get asked back to the Union this year.  Turns out that they did plan to ask me back apparently, but got confused and sent the letter to the wrong person. Someone who they didn't want back.  I can fully believe this, given the general management competency level there."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Until I get the problem with posting things fixed, it's gonna have to be many small updates as opposed to one big one.  Ate dinner at Ichiban last night, and managed to avoid a repeat of previous Japanese restaurant shenanigans, so the food stayed down. This is always a bonus. I can't remember the name of what it was that I ate, but there was (pigeon?) beef in it, so if you're there, I can recommend a portion of No.26. I'm actually developing a bit of a taste for Japanese food, and I can foresee a sushi-fest occurring in the not-too-distant future."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Usual deal last night, a few folk over to watch it, and some good banter ensued. Highlights included: - The spontaneous laughter from the group as Chris Benoit reversed a move into the Crippler Crossface. - The total surprise from us all as John Cena actually managed to lift the Big Show. - Steve Austin vs the interns. (If you were there, it was funny) - Michaels and McMahon trying to outblade each other. At least, that's what it seemed like. I was half expecting HHH to have bladed before he headed to the ring, just to prove that he is the Game-ah.  But a good show, and I'm sure there'll be similar shenanigans next month."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"I feel dirty.   Today, I did one of the things that I've sworn for ages I'd never do. I applied for a credit card.  I've always had a deep unwillingness to get one, purely because I hate being in debt (okay, I'm £2500 in student loan debt, but that's to the government, so it doesn't count), but I felt that since I'm going to be in America, and nowhere over there is likely to accept switch, it's best to have a card that I could use in an emergency, even if it's just to get me home or something. But it's an absolute worst case scenario, I have no intention of using the card.  And I'll be cutting it up when I get back to the UK."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Spent most of today at the cinema, and it was certainly a day of two halves.   First movie to be seen was League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And it sucks more than a hoover factory. Now, some of the set design was fantastic, I will give the movie that, but they appear to have spent the entire budget on that. The special effects weren't special, the cast (Connery in particular) seemed most disinterested with the whole thing, and the plot made next to no sense. I mean, come on, for fucks sake, Mina harker's supposed to be a vampire. So why is she checking herself in a compact mirror?!? Or is she a special kind that DOES have a reflection?  This movie also raised an issue that I've been meaning to rant about since I saw Hulk. The British film classification system. Why did they bring in the 12A rating? What was wrong with 12? Now, any parent can take their kids to see one of these movies, and the fact is that many kids simply have no idea of how to shut the goddamn hell up in cinemas. I preferred it when it was a simple 'Are you 12? No? Then fuck off'.  Thankfully, there were no such similar problems in the second movie we saw. Kill Bill. I can say without fear of contradiction that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. I loved it from start to finish. There are actually no faults I can find with this movie, it is THAT good. I recommend that anyone reading this goes and sees it. Immediately.  Back at the ranch, my mum's home from her holiday in Portugal, so I can revert to 'doing nothing about the house' mode. Which, let's face it, is my favourite way of living. If something's worth doing, somebody else will do it.  Work plods on, got my first pay through, which is always good, and also it appears that the dole office are finally paying me the last of the money they owed me. About fucking time as well.  Picked up Pro Evolution Soccer 3 for the PS2, and it's predictably fantastic. Many folks online have been complaining of stuttering, but I don't appear to be suffering from that, so go me. Although that may be because the commentary is turned off on my copy. (Well, turned off by me, since it usually sucks).  Can't really think of much else that needs saying at the moment."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"It's been raining here in Glasgow almost non-stop since late on Sunday. With the exception of the odd small period of dryness punctuating it, it's been near-torrential constantly.  Apparently, these are the after-effects of some big fuck-off hurricane that was out in the Atlantic about a week ago, but it's seriously fucking intense. We had the average monthly rainfall for August fall in 2 days.  Consequently, I've been getting soaked a lot.  Last day at BT tomorrow. Woo."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Thieves are stupid, it would appear.  My sister got her purse nicked at the Tunnel last night, and they took the cloakroom ticket out of it, and went and got her bag. The scummy thieveing gypsies then stole her mobile phone, but, get this, left all her money, all her bank / credit cards, and took a scarf that was worth about a fiver.  The bag was then found abandoned at the end of the night, and someone phoned here today to say that they'd found the purse outside afterwards, and could we go and collect it.  So it appears that the phone and scarf are all that's gone.  Still, I hope death and pain visit them in great quantities."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, I've finished the training part of work. It was astoundingly easy, and the poeple were cool as well. I now find myself starting out on the sales floor on Tuesday, and it remains to be seen how that goes.  Was out last night. Mucho drunkenness from me. I'd been drinking Wild Turkey after I finished work, and then I got wired into the Jack Daniels. Crashed at Eilidh's, and have only been home for an hour or so. And dear god my head hurts."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Fun in work yesterday. BT has recently announced that it has the technology, and will be blocking its web users from accessing child porn.  Some woman phoned up to complain about this on the grounds of internet freedom, and well, I was in one of those moods.... -- So, you want to complain that you can't access child pornography? -- No, I want to complain that it violates people's freedoms. -- But it's illegal in this country to even view the material. You want to allow others to commit this crime? -- But it's an issue of personal rights. People should be allowed to look at what they choose. -- Right. So you're in favour of people being allowed to look at images of children being sexually abused? -- That's not what I meant. -- But it's what you said. This sort of thing ruins childrens lives, and you want to allow it on the grounds of personal freedoms?  /Customer Hungup It makes it all worthwhile, really it does.  Have an interview with the Inland Revenue tomorrow, so shall see how that goes."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Out last night for Ruth's birthday. I knew I had work this morning, so I planned on leaving early, it was more 'showing face' than anything else.  Was actually a really good night, a whole lot of 'fine upstanding citizens' out and about, and much humour and banter from all concerned. Left at half one, ostensibly to try and get some sleep before work.  Turns out I'd have been as well just pulling an allnighter, as when I got home, I could get no sleep whatsoever, and thus I'm now sitting at 37 hours of non-stop wakefulness. The joys.  Work wasn't actually too bad, the day went quite quickly, and we were all arseing about on a grand scale, including going on break for 25 minutes to watch an argument break out amongst some people. By the end of it, all the ISC advisors on the whole floor were logged off and watching. And laughing.  Haven't decided what I'm gonna be doing tonight. I'm not actually that tired at the moment, but that will no doubt hit me not too much later on.  Right, I'm away. I have more to say, but now is not the time..."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Not been a bad day, all in. Got woken up at 3am by my sister crashing though the door, drunk as hell.  Woke up again at 10am, and told my mum with 30 minutes notice that I wouldn't be going to the family church service, mainly due to my hatred of religion in all its forms, and the fact that I don't believe in god. She took it OK though, so that was good. My sister seemed more disapproving, but her opinion counts fuck all to me.  Decent enough haul of presents, mostly cash and vouchers since I'm really picky and almost impossible to buy for. Basically, if I haven't outright said I want it, then buying something for me is a risk. So this state of affairs suits me fine.  Relatives were tolerable today, but things got a bit frosty when I cracked out the Michael Jackson jokes. Fuck their attitudes though, the guy's a [insult removed for libel reasons, just in case].   The meal was OK, but my mum forgot to cook the roast potatoes (!), and the turkey was overly dry. I've had worse though.  Other than that, it's been the same as every other year. Tired as fuck now, going for a lie down soon."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Had a strange thought in work today. Despite the constant pressure on targets and such like, we are always told to 'sell to the customers needs'. In theory, this would be fine, if we didn't have the sales targets. Customer calls in, we find out what's best for them, and sell them that.  But it's not like that. Because we get told that we have to sell all these products, and they give us various amounts of points towards our bonusplan. This raises an interesting quandary, ably demonstrated by an example customer from this afternoon.  He doesn't speak great English, but enough that we can understand each other, and certainly enough that I don't want to slam the receiver down in a fit of rage. I do the check to see which option he'd be best on. As it happens, it's the one that gives me the most bonus So I go on to explain how it works, and he agrees. But I could tell that he wasn't listening, and that he didn't really understand what he was buying.  Now, on this occasion, I had no problems with this, because this particular option WAS the best for him. But on other occasions, it'd be perfectly possible to sell someone something they don't need or want, purely taking advantage of the fact that they can't understand properly what it is they're signing themselves up for.  This musing is of no real consequence, I suppose, since in the grand scheme of things I'm going to get the best possible deal for myself, and I'm not about to reduce my pay, or get myself warned for performance reasons, just so someone gets the best possible deal.  But it's worth a few moments thought."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Stand back. It's rant time.  Last night, went to Revolution for the first time in about 18 months. I had a not bad time. The music was pretty much the same as all Muppet's other nights, but there was good banter from various sources, and I think things are getting back the way they ought to be on one front.   But there was one downer on the night. it was quite hot in there, so I went to the bar to get a pint of water. And waited for TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES to get served. What in the blue hell is up with that?!? This night is constantly busy, yet they put 3 staff on. Now I know how busy these night can get, hell, I worked in Strathclyde's Union for a while, but that was just beyond the pale. I mean, we were never that bad at Rage, we always managed to get folk served reasonably quickly. It wasn't a great hassle, because I wasn't drinking alcohol, but the wait was ridiculous. Future trips to the bar took place upstairs.   Speaking of Unions, it would appear that contrary to what I was told earlier, Rage WILL be back, but they're putting it in Vertigo. For those of you who've never worked in the Union, that translates as 'They're trying to kill it'. Vertigo is seriously the absolute worst venue for a night in there. It's cavernous, so unless it's rammed full, then there's no hope in hell of any atmosphere being generated. The bar is tiny, even smaller than the QM, and can only really hold 4 staff before 'too many cooks' syndrome kicks in. It's also too small to cope with the number of freshers who will inevitably show up for Rage. So, they'll stay sober, or spend a large chunk of their night queuing for the bar. And we all know how much fun that is.  I don't give it very long until the students get fed up waiting, and migrate to another rock venue on a Thursday, be it the catty or Frequency, a new rock night upstairs in Fury Murrys, with top-quality promos that are better than both the Catty and the Union. God, I sound like Fletcher with all this whoring. Unclean....  Back to the rant about last night. Having left the QM and dropped Sarah, Layla and Dave off, I headed to the airport to pick my sister up from her flight in from Tenerife. Parked the car, and went in to wait. Bored and tired, as there's a minor delay on the flight, so I decide to go and get a coffee to kill time for a bit.   That turned out to be a good plan, with just one little flaw. No fucking coffee shops were open. Is it really that difficult to have a small stand of Starbucks or whatever open overnight for the poor suckers who are probably quite tired and might actually NEED some coffee? Evidently, it is that difficult. Idiots. Fucking provincial airport 9-5 mentality. Fuck it in its stupid ass.  Plane gets in, sister gets off, and we head back to the car. I've been parked for 65 minutes. Put the ticket in, and guess how much payment they demand? Go on, guess. I'll wait. Done that? Good. If you guessed £4.10, then you're spot on. FOUR POUNDS MOTHERFUCKING TEN! If the ticket machine had had a gun and a mask, and said ""This is a stick up"", then it might have been a more blatant example of highway robbery, but that's the only way. I am still absolutely fucking livid about this.   Short of doing a 4x4 escape over a flowerbed there was no real way to avoid paying it, so I was forced to cough up.   That's about all that's been happening recently, really. New Flesh tonight, more than likely. I'll maybe go to a pub or something to watch the Celtic game beforehand, sinceit's on Sky Sports extra, and ntl don't carry that channel.  Ciao anyway folks."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Who'd have thought it?   For the first time in a long time, there was no Pay-Per-View watchery on Sunday. Most of the folk who normally show up for it were unable to attend for whatever reason, be it working or having just had a kid etc, so I decided it wasn't worth staying up until 4am alone, and went to the Catty.  Wasn't a bad night, some decent conversations, and I danced for a longer time consecutively than I think I ever had before. Given my general level of unfitness, this came damn close to killing me.   Afterwards, ended up giving Stacey a lift home to Motherwell, since wherever she was meant to be staying had fallen through. Road was an absolute deathtrap, particularly on the way from Motherwell back to mine. Parts of it were practically a river. Still, made it home by a reasonable hour.  Got a job interview tomorrow, for bar work in some hotel in the city centre. It's one of those jobs that I just applied for to try and keep the dole office off my back, with the predictable haphazardness about the application form, and they've only gone and given me an interview. Still, if I do get it, it'll be money until I get one of the infamous 'proper jobs'.   The one possible downer on it is a late license. I've worked in a hotel once before (for 3 shifts! - well, actually, I quit because of this) and the license basically kept going until the guests stopped drinking. So you'd be rota'd on until close, and would have no idea when you'd finish. Still, we shall see if this does that.  So there's that tomorrow, then New Flesh at night, and I'll be watching the replay of the wrestling pre-Frequency on Thursday.  I'll probably update again after the interview. Byeeeeeee."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Saw the director's cut of Alien last night.  Now I'll start straight off the bat and say that the movie is fantastic. That was never in doubt. It's one of the best sci-fi horror (Is it really horror, or just suspense? What IS horror? That's for another post, I guess) type movies that's ever been made, and I absolutely love it.  But it's the second high-profile Ridley Scott film to get a director's cut, and it got me thinking: Why do we have directors cuts? (Hereinafter referred to as DC) Is it a genuine attempt to get the proper vision if the director out to the masses? That was obviously the case with Blade Runner, although that was necessary due to the hatchet job done to it by the studio. I have no objection to DC's being used to overcome studio interference, in fact, I positively encourage it. I defy anyone to say that the DC of Blade Runner doesn't piss on the original from a high height.  But the DC of Alien is different. Well, actually, it's not, and therein lies the problem. The only noticeable scene that's added is when Ripley discovers the cocoon, and that was on the DVD version already. So in this case, it seems very much like it's simply an attempt to cash in, or indeed to raise awareness of the upcoming DVD Quadrilogy. (How can you have a quadrilogy when only 3 movies exist?)  On the note of the DVD set, it looks like I may well be investing in it, since it has the theatrical and extended versions of each movie (Fincher cut - Yay!)  But yeah, getting back to the main point, I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of DCs. But maybe I'm just getting more cynical as I age."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, yeah.  Work today wasn't too bad. the time passed fairly quickly, mainly because we found new and exciting (read: mildly less boring than normal) ways to distract ourselves from the drudgery of taking calls from cretins.  The guy sitting next to me has even more contempt for the customers than I do, and really doesn't seem to give a damn if he gets sacked, so it's always fun to be around when he's ripping the piss, which he does regularly and with great ease. The best bit is that the customers never seem to have even the slightest idea that he's doing it.  Having got home, i'm now tired beyond belief, hence the reason that I'm not out tonight. I picked up a few DVDs yesterday, but I'm too tired to even watch them. But they'll do for occupying me over the next couple of weeks.  Celtic won the cup today in Henrik Larsson's final competitive game, which was nice. Dunno what the team's gonna do to try and replace him next season, but I expect just about every agent in Europe is about to try and hawk us their 'star' player.  That's about all for now, so I'll go get me some sleep. Sleep good. (Napster bad)"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Went to the cinema this afternoon, and caught one of the previews of Troy.  It's certainly classic Hollywood, in the sense that it takes liberties with the story, panders to the lowest common denominator, and is a triumph of style over substance.   Brad Pitt's accent changes many times throughout the film, and he's just generally useless. Clearly there to look good, and in that sense he succeeds, but he doesn't do much else.   Orlando Bloom's even worse, although he is given some utterly risible dialogue to work with.   Helen of Troy is supposedly the most beautiful woman in the world, the face that launched 1000 ships. Based on this movie, they launched in a desperate quest to flee her attempts at acting.   I liked Brian Cox as Agamemnon though, and Peter O'Toole gave a nice turn as the King of Troy, stealing the whole movie with his speech to Achilles.  There's no sympathy for any of the characters, which is a major flaw. Most movies like this at least try and set up one side as the faces and the others as the heels, but Troy insists of switching all the time. First you think the Greeks are ok, and that helen's a cheating bint, but then Achilles is such an arrogant bitchy cunt that you start to prefer the Trojans. And then we switch to the Greeks again, hoping someone will kill that twat Bloom. The end result of all this is that you don't care about any of the characters, and don't really give a rat's ass who wins.  One thing that really got my goat was the typical Hollywood idea that audiences have no attention span and everything needs to be dumbed down. The Lord of the Rings trilogy showed them that movies can be long and still have people go to see them. This movie runs 160 minutes, and yet they still don't have time for the siege of Troy. It's no surprise that the end credits list the movie as being inspired by Homer's Iliad, as opposed to based on it.  Speaking of The Lord of the Rings, it's worth noting that as big as the battle set pieces are, they don't seem that awe-inspiring since we have the Pelennor as our new reference point.  This isn't to say that I hated the movie. It was well shot, and didn't particularly feel that it was as long as it was. Overall, it's worth seeing if you've got a few hours to spare, but there's no need to make a special trip."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Finally got around to seeing this, and overall, I'd say it was worth it.  The battle scenes at sea were well done, particularly the effect of splintering wood as a cannonball flies in at great velocity. The claustrophobia of the ship was captured well on film, and even Russell Crowe gave a performance that I didn't hate.  My one main criticism is that we aren't properly introduced to many of the ship's crew, to the extent that it was hard to feel any sympathy when generic crewman #78 kicked the bucket. maybe that was the intention all along, although I somewhat doubt it.  A good way to pass 2 and a bit hours though, certainly worth seeing."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Work today, amusement ahoy. ""Good morning, thanks for calling BT, my name's Gordon, can I..."" ""Get me your supervisor"" *goes to get supervisor* ""Sorry, she's on a call at the moment, but she'll be with you as soon as possible."" ""Right, complaints department then."" ""Okay, I'll just put you through to customer services, they deal with that sort of..."" ""None of you lot listen, I want the complaints department"" [Note: Customer Services deal with complaints] ""As I said, it's customer services that deal with..."" ""You're all as bad as each other, none of you scumbags care!"" ""If you'll just give me a chance, then I'll put you through to the people who can..."" ""FUCKING SCUMBAGS, THE LOT OF..."" *click*  Silly man. When I can terminate the call with one button, he should have known better than to be abusive to me. BT's official policy is '3 strikes and you're out', which means on the 3rd instance of abusive language, we can terminate the call. My policy is 'one strike and you're out', which kicked in here. So he was gone, and probably ended up in an even bigger rage.  It raised a point when he said 'None of you scumbags care', though. It was at this point that I decided the call would be ended by my hand, and it was only a matter of deciding when. I thought about it a bit later, and realised that none of us DO care. My customer care skills are zero, for the simple fact that I don't care about the customers, and I'm fast developing a barrier to keep out the emotive language that people try and use.  ""It's for my mother, she's 94 and has terrible asthma."" Well, that's great, but I still can't make the appointment any earlier. The bottom line is that as long as it's not my fault, I get paid no matter how fucked peoples phones are.  Now this may seem like a callous attitude to have, and to an extent I suppose it is, but the fact remains that I don't get paid enough to actually give a damn.  So next time you phone a callcentre, just remember that any sincerity is more than likely as fake as Michael Jackson's face."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Went to the Catty last night for the first time on a Sunday in almost 2 months.  It was a good night, some top-quality banter from many of the gathered throng. Didn't dance much, but when I did, I actually seemed to have some tiny semblance of rhythm, which surprised even me. Evens that it won't be repeated though.  Got home just before 4, and some cretin had parked across the turning circle at the top of the street, so not only did I have to reverse back down, I also had to walk to the house in the cold. And dear god it was fucking freezing. Which I suppose is to be expected, what with it being Scotland in novemebr, but it's still not pleasant."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, I saw Psyko Dalek (or Pysko Dalek, if the tickets are to be believed) for the first time last night, and I have to say I was impressed by them.   Of particular note was the drumming, which I liked, and special mention has to go to Div, who's quite the frontman. He strikes the right poses, is almost Fear Factory-esque with the odd semi-melodic bit thrown in, and has an all round good stage presence. ""This song's about tanning burds up the arse""  Bit of a catalogue of disasters at the gig though, one of the bands pulled out (which turns out to be a good thing for scheduling purposes), one band walks off withing 2 minutes of me getting into the gig, another one (Second Skin, I think) losing half their set due to sound problems (which is a shame, because they acquitted themselves well from what I saw), and about 50 people not getting in because the tickets were ambiguously worded, and they thought it was over 14s, with only the bar area over 18s. When in fact the whole place was over 18s only. But meh, I'm sure this happens at all gigs.  Hit the Cathouse afterwards, and had a decent enough night for the time I was there. Danced more (and worse) than I have for quite a while, and I'm feeling it this morning."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"In the process of switching to Mozilla as my browser. Seems easy enough, just a matter of getting used to the new stuff.  If anyone out there on web-land's got any tips, they're much appreciated as always."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Got a call on Saturday asking if I was interested in getting 2 Wednesday tickets to Download for £50. Now, this was something I wanted to go to, but I had previously baulked at the thought of paying £45 or thereabouts for one band I really wanted to see (Metallica), one I wouldn't mind seeing (Slipknot), and 2 that I was somewhat indifferent to (Korn & Him). But at £25, well, that's worth it, because it's what you'd expect to pay for a standard metallica gig.  So, having got the tickets, I was then left with a spare one, since Dave couldn't go. Got that sold easily enough, and headed along to Glasgow Green after work yesterday.  I arrived there just as Him were taking the stage, so I watched their set, and it was somewhat of a mixed bag. The songs are pretty good, but the band seemed to be going through the motions somewhat, and the sound was utterly risible (this was to be a recurring theme throughout the day).   To elaborate on the sound, it would be clear for a while, and then muffled, then clear again. Almost as if there was some sort of automatic noise limiter in effect. If that was the case, then thank you Glasgow City Council, and thank you local residents (with one or two exceptions), for being a self-centred bunch of fuckheads.  Slipknot were up next, and they put in a good performance. There was a lot of energy in it, and I thought it was an improvement on the last time I saw them (Gig On The Green 2002). They've reached the stage in their career where they can play a decent length of set without having to add in filler tracks, and can even get away with leaving out some of their bigger songs. The sound seemed a bit better here.  After Slipknot, I met McLeary, who launched into a rant about the barrier system (there was an area at the front that was restricted to a set amount of people). Homosexuality in the form of a solid object, he called it, and I have to say I'm inclined to agree with him. If people can't behave sensibly in a festival environment, then frankly, they deserve to get injured.  Korn were due up next, and I wasn't overly impressed with them. But then I'm not overly impressed with them on record anyway. They put on a decent enough showing, but the set seemed somewhat top-heavy, with most of the big songs in the first half, which mean that my attention waned as they went on. Jonathan Davis did get the cheapest pop of the day for coming onstage playing bagpipes. Not very well, but playing bagpipes nonetheless.  Following this, I grabbed a bite to eat, as I hadn't eaten since breakfast that morning (6.30, fact-fans). And was promptly horrified at the cost of the food, verging as it was on the astronomical. £3 for a burger? £2 for a cup of Coke? And not even the good coke either, it was the UK stuff. Ludicrous, I tells ya.  And now for the main event, the reason I was there in the first place. Metallica. I missed the chance to see them play when they were last in Glasgow (8 years ago), so I was pretty excited about this. And they didn't disappoint.  Opening with 'Blackened', they set the tone for the rest of the evening, with a set full of the classics, played tightly, and with a decent level of between song banter, even if it does seem a little interchangeable between cities. The pyro was put to good use as they took full advantage of the setting sun and growing darkness. My only gripe is that they didn't play 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', or 'The Four Horsemen', but then again, there's only so much time they've got to fit in everything folk want to hear. The new material from St Anger sounds a lot better live than on record, as well.  2 and a half hours later, as 'Seek and Destroy' comes to an end, there's about 15000 people leaving, and all but the most hypercritical should have enjoyed themselves for at least part of the day.  As I left, I got handed a flyer for 'the new Wednesday rock night' in Fury Murry's. Which I found odd, since they'd cancelled Fletcher's just the previous day. My suspicions were correct, as they'd ditched him, and had known about it for 2 weeks without telling him.  Headed round to Barfly to New Flesh, and it was, to put it mildly, utterly dead, with all the other descriptions of corpsehood from the Parrot sketch being equally valid. That finished just after one, and I hamed it. I'm off work today, though, which means that I at least got a decent sleep."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Just got the standard daily nonsense from my mum there. I'm really getting sick and fed up with her constant nagging about the fact I don't have a job. Does she think I haven't noticed? Then when I can't be bothered answering the same fucking questions every day, she walks away as if she somehow thinks she's in the right. Newsflash: She's not. What exactly does she think she's going to accomplish by complaining because I'm on the internet? I've heard the same lecture time and time and time again, and you know what? I still don't give a fuck what she thinks.  The fact is, she last worked in 1979, before I was even born. But she seems to be under the impression that she knows all there is to know about the employment market. When in reality, the way she thinks things work is exactly the way things don't work. And just because a tactic worked once for 'the daughter of a friend' (I mean, really, that's up there with ""Some guy gave it to me"" in the grand hall of woeful attempts to back up a statement) does not mean it'll work for me.  She's often brings out the ""As long as you're happy with your lives, then I don't mind what you do"" argument. Apparently, this has the hidden proviso ""as long as it's exactly what I envisioned you doing"". It drives me insane at times, it really does.  On the job front, away from the rants of an ageing moron, I signed on again this morning. Got held up for ages 'cos the guy in front of me in the queue seemed to be incapable of answering even a simple question from the guy at the desk. Although this meant that when it came my turn, the guy practically went hypersonic in getting my stuff signed. Had a quick look at the job terminals to see what was available, and it made depressing reading. Just about everything seems to have unreasonable requirements or a really shite salary. I hate to say it, but I don't see it being much longer before I cave in and go back to bar work.   Speaking of which, most of the others from the Darkroom last year have had a letter for the past few weeks asking if they're gonna be back this year. I have had no such letter. So it appears from my marvellous powers of deduction that they don't want me back. I guess that's probably because of the slating I gave them on the internet after they made me redundant before the summer.   I don't care, to be honest, if they asked me back, I don't know if I'd go. Let's face it, the place is going to shit, and even though Allan Mawn's leaving, that leaves Sniffy in overall charge of the bars and such like. So no-one but her will be allowed to take any sick days, and her friends  and dealers  will get all the jobs and contracts.  I did hear that the Barony and Gameszone (currently being refurbished) aren't going to be ready for freshers week there. Mere words are insufficient to describe the joy I felt upon hearing this. That place is a potential goldmine, and it's being run into the ground. There goes another year's takings. *laughs*  I think that's enough ranting for one day. More Union-bitching to come in future entries, you can be sure of that though.  Had an odd night last night. Went to the Cathouse, and it was different from a normal Sunday night there. Well, not different as such, just there were a whole lot more people there that I knew, it was almost like the Sunday nights of a couple of summers ago.   Started off promisingly enough, decent banter with a few folk, but as the night went on, things went...kinda weird. I don't even know why they felt weird, it was just like something was out of place. I can't quite put my finger on what it was, though.  Anyway, enough of this malarkey, I'm off to do very little."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Was out last night for Eilidh's birthday. And there was drunkenness. Oh dear god there was drunkenness.  Hit the Lab at about 9pm, and a nasty moment as I'm stopped at the door and asked who I'm with tonight. Got around that by explaining (truthfully, for once) that a bunch of us were meeting, and I'm the only one with even a semblance of punctuality. Get inside easily enough though, and discover that it's really rather busy. It quietened down as the night went on, so it wasn't all bad. Good banter, and several lunatics were in the building. Luckily, they were all part of our party.  Moved on to the Cathouse, and silliness abounds again, although I start to feel the onset of queasiness in my stomach. Yes folks, it's Cathouse Coke kicking in again! A quick tactical vomit, and a switch to lemonade as mixer, and everything is all good. Left about a half hour early because I was too tired and drunk for my own good, and went for food, where it would appear that Eats1 can rival riginals for chips n cheese. Bit more expensive, but also a bigger portion, so that's fine.  Woke up this morning astoundingly hungover. Bah. But it was a good night, so I'll take the hit."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"I'll keep this short and sweet.   Friday night - good night, had fun.  Saturday - ntl engineer arrives. All goes according to plan, but then the account doesn't set up properly. Leave it for a while, go into town. Meet Dave, Steve, Kat, and Roz, plus Heather who left early, in Rock Gardens (easily the best of Glasgow's 'rock' pubs). Good laugh, much joking about. Head off to the catty, but there aren't many people there that I know, and I'm tired, plus Steve and Kat are pished. Dave is Dave, as always.  Sunday - That's today. Phone tech support, and they give me a fix for the account non-startery. It works.    So, I now have broadband. It rocks. I can never go back to dialup. No more am I fearful of large files or overly elaborate websites.     Internet....do your worst."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Another family dinner today. Oh joy. Is once a year not enough? Still, another 358 days of not having to go through this crap after today."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"What I'm about to type may be difficult for some people to grasp, but please bear with me, and at least try.  Now, I don't know if anyone has noticed, but it IS possible for a male and a female to be friends, and nothing more than friends.   What this means is that when a male stays overnight at the flat of a close female friend, there is no reason to assume that anything is going to happen. There is no need to react with instant suspicion. There is no need to make innuendo.  And there is no need to believe everything (or indeed anything) that you hear. For those still in doubt, feel free to ask me as to the truth of rumours about me whenever you see me or speak to me. I will be more than happy to confirm or deny them."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Interview didn't go too badly.   Job seems easy enough, and in response to my earlier worries, apparently the late shift in the bar finishes at 2.30am, which is better than 'when they stop drinking'.  Should find out in a few days, they said.  Fuck all else happened. Ciao."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"This album arrived yesterday, and it's fantastic. It's a much heavier effort than they've done previously, but that's a good thing. Some stupidly long songs on it (only one is less than 7 minutes, 5 are over 10), but again, no complaints about that here, except perhaps that there aren't any tracks that are likely to get played in nightclubs.  Still, shit happens. I'm now even more excited about going to see them in January."
BGTGOOS,male,24,Dream Theater tomorrow. Update when I get back to Glasgow.
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Today, I have been mostly bemoaning the fact that I'm single.  I hate Valentine's day with a passion, you get all these images of couples being all loved up etc etc, and it just fills me with...well, with jealousy. They're happy and I'm not.  The whole imagery and sentiment of the day, while designed for people to show their love for one another, simply emphasises just how alone the single people are.  Maybe I'm just bitter though. Well, I know I'm just bitter, but maybe I'm overly bitter."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Not a great deal's happened since I last updated. Work still progresses, and it would appear that the team I've ended up in are a bunch of complete nutters. There is, however, plenty of good banter, much piss-ripping at the expense of customers, and there does seem to be an all round good atmosphere about the place.  On the negative side, this whole malarkey of having to get up at 5.45am is a bad, bad thing, and it feels like I can't really do anything anymore, since unless I want to be an absolute zombie the next day, then I have to go to bed about 11pm, which is stupidly early by my standards.  Got the Altnation event at the Carling Academy tomorrow night, which is shaping up to be a good one. Following that, I may be out on Sunday night at the Catty, my first Sunday there for ages. Well, 6 weeks at least.  Also picked up a ticket for A Perfect Circle in February. Got in nice and early as well, so I am now the proud owner of ticket number 11.  Time to go, I shall update after the weekend, I would suspect."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Went to the BCW show in East Kilbride tonight.  I'm consistently impressed by the shows and the promotion in general. They've improved dramatically since I first caught them last year, and there were some really good matches and spots tonight.  The performance was perhaps hindered a bit by the low ceiling at the arena (I can't believe I just called it that), which put some restrictions on the moves that could be done off the top, but everyone adapted well.  Match of the night was clearly Alex Shane vs Doug Williams, and Shane in particular has some damn good mic work, although he we would be well served checking, before he calls everyone in the arena mongoloids, that there are in fact no mongoloids in attendance. Oops! And credit to the fat guy in the front row (legit 500lbs) for being a good sport about the constant ridicule he suffered.  The main reason for going was of course the appearance of The Honky Tonk Man and Marty Janetty. True old school. Honky worked the crowd well and was super over, although the workrate wasn't particularly off the charts.   Janetty was lumbered with The Highlander (who I remain convinced only has his position on the card because he's the booker) as a tag partner, but still seemed to be in pretty decent ring shape. And he actually did the 'tag partner making the save' spot properly, pushing the opponent off the pin, rather than just hitting him, which was a pleasant surprise.  Overall, a good show. Worth seeing them if you can."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Well, for the moment, the problem with the errors appears to have been fixed somewhat. Thanks to the age old trick of 'throwing out requests on a forum and hoping I get an answer', I altered the proxy server I connect through, and that appears to have solved the problem.  It was frustrating though, as while I would never class myself as an expert on computers, I do like to think that I'm fairly PC literate. I don't even mind if somethings wrong and I know that I have to do A, B, and C to fix it, but don't have the knowledge. It's when I don't even know what the problem is that I get frustrated, as there's not even a starting point.  Still, it's fixed now, so that's not too bad.  Borrowed Stone Cold Steve Austin's autobiography from Kat last night, and read it this morning. Quite quick and easy to read, but it's one of the more blatantly ghostwritten books from wrestlers, very obviously pasted together from transcripts of interviews. He has some interesting points about his career, but he never gets near the level of detail or reflection that Mick Foley did, and that hurts it. It's like autobiography-lite, if you will. An enjoyable enough way to pass a few hours, but not deep enough for the true wrestling geeks. I do agree almost entirely with the ideas he has to improve the state of wrestling today though, a return to the old school.   Finally, I really should get on with arranging the deferment of these student loan repayments. It doesn't feel like a year since I last told them to fuck off (in a manner of speaking, and through official channels, obv), but needs must, and I'll get the form filled in, it's just a case of finding my payslips from the past few months. Once I get more cash together, I might see about just paying it all off in one go, as opposed to the '5 years of paying' crap that they seem to be wanting."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"The foot was a lot better when I got up this morning, but it's still be no means perfect though.  The camera arrived in the mail this morning (well, actually, it arrived by parcel force, but it was at the same time as the mail, so it counts), so I've been mucking about with that today, trying to get a feel of what exactly everything does.  Decided to head over to Comet to pick up some decent batteries and a charger. Car stalled when I tried to start it. Twice. Got it going the third time, only for it to cut out again at the end of the street. This should have beena  warnign sign, but nay, nay and thrice nay, I carried on. The lack of any real power in second gear was a bit annoying, and when I turned onto Clarkston Road, there was even less power. As in none. So I drift over to the side of the road, and try to get it started again. Nothing. Fuck.  Call up the breakdown people (thank christ I added that onto the insurance policy), and to their credit, they had a guy there within 20 minutes. And what happens? Why, the same thing that always happens in these situations. He tries it, and it works first fucking time. He'd been getting a lot of stuff like that, it was just the rain, apparently, so he sprayed some WD40 about to insulate something or other, and I was off.  Didn't feel like chancing it though, so I just headed the 200 yards back home. I'll get the batteries after work tomorrow.  And that's been my day. What fun."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, first day on the sales floor. Was bricking it a bit prior to starting, but the first call I took was easy enough, and most of the customers were okay.   Minor irritants included other parts of BT who don't want to take the call that you're trying to transfer to them (this can be fixed by my finger 'slipping' onto the transfer button anyway), customers who can't speak English, customers who can't understand you because you're Scottish, and customers who's mobile cuts off about 30 seconds before you can finalise the sale of highly-bonused products to them.  The rest of the team seem pretty decent, and a wee bit mental at the same time. I'm ludicrously tired at the moment though, but I'm sure my body clock'll just take a bit of time to adjust.  And the manager didn't seem to have any worries about me getting the time off to go to see Dream Theater. So it's all good."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Friday - Cathouse. Good night, but left early due to tiredness on a grand scale. Saturday - Lazy day, then sushi. This is a good thing. Sunday - Dawn of the Dead, then Cathouse. Movie good, better than I thought it would be, and I liked the Richard Cheese action. Catty not too bad, but was quite tired, since I hadn't had much sleep at all. Gave Barry a lift home, and got to sleep about 5am.  Apologies for the above crapness, it's short attention span day here, apparently.  15 days until Vegas. People have been giving me 'orders' of stuff they'd like brought back. Some of it won't be a problem, but at this rate, I won't be able to manage it all. Bear in mind I do have a 20kg baggage limit, and I'm only taking one suitcase. So if it doesn't fit, it's not coming home with me."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"For the past day or so, my phone's been messing around.  When I've been near a speaker, tehre's been the sound of interference that signifies a text trying to get through, but it never gets there.  So if you've got something important to say, then a call is probably the best way of making sure the message gets through."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Post graduation, we went for food at the Ivory restaurant (no, that's the name, it's not actually made of ivory - b'doom tiss)  It's actually very nice, the food was both affordable and tasty, which are alwats two plus points in my book. I can particularly recommend the chicken strips, and the duck. Also, the strawberry cheesecake was to die for.  After that, I need never eat again. (Note: That statement isn't true, and such fact will be demonstrated tomorrow morning, right about breakfast time)"
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So, I installed an exhaust fan on my PC this afternoon. Just a cheap thing from Maplin's, but it'll keep the inside of the case a bit cooler for the longer times I expect it to be up and running for. And once I get Linux, then we'll see the true meaning of long continuous uptime...    It's only really temporary until I get a new case, as this one dates back to 1998, and I'd like to upgrade to a monster case (well, not monster in size, more in cooling and such like. And I'd like a few front USB ports as well).    But the main point here is that I managed to get it all going without having to call upon assistance from outside. Granted, it wasn't exactly difficult, but the intent was there."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Last night was a good evening of entertainment.  Arrived at the venue a bit later than I'd planned, since I had to stop off at Furys to get flyers, but afetr what seemed like an age in the queue, I got to the front, and had to exchange the SECC ticket that I had for one of the Academy ones. Only because I was so far back in the queue, then the only tickets they had left were balcony ones.   This annoyed and irritated me somewhat, since I'd wanted standing, which is why I bought standing. Hell, I had ticket No 11 for the SECC, I bought it early for a reason. Balcony wasn't too bad though, it's the kind of gig where you don't have to be on the floor to appreciate it.  Show itself was utterly fantastic, I enjoyed it immensely. Light show was good, apart from the one spotlight that seemed to be pointed straight at my face. But James Iha was a kindly soul and stood in front of it for a while.  Maynard had a worrying obsession with people taking off their pants, but he seemed in good humour for most of the gig, and managed to fit in the traditional apology for President Bush.  Music was as good as you'd expect, highlights were hearing The Nurse Who Loved Me and Magdalena in the live setting, I loved those.  Annoyance as I'm only a few seats away from THAT GUY (you know who I mean, there's one at every gig), but he'll probably be overtaken by evolution soon enough.  Afterwards, got a decent amount of flyers handed out, and bought a t-shirt. Which, upon getting home, turned out to be size M. Great. I asked the guy for XL, he checked and handed it to me, so it seemed like a safe assumption that he'd given me an XL, so I just pocketed it. Waste of a fiver, and my sister now has a new APC t-shirt.  Catty afterwards, was alright but nothing special."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Well, that's annoying. I just spent the best part of quite a long time typing out a post, and now it's vanished. Well, I'll just type it out again, but I expect it'll be a bit more truncated.  My feet are sore. I was standing up all last night, and the boots I was wearing have next to no cushioning in them. That's to be expected, since they're about 5 years old. But the upshot is that I'm in a bit of pain now.   On the journey home, I saw a guy I was at school with. Made me think about friends. I used to be really good mates with the guy, and was just about the last one to finally give up on him when his drunken arsehole antics started becoming part of who he was while sober. So I basically cut him out of my life, and when I got a new mobile, I didn't give him the new number. He's tried to contact me a few times since then, but he doesn't appear to have changed.  Anyway, he wasn't able to talk to me last night, since Eilidh had phoned me, which was somewhat of a lucky break. It got me thinking though. Looking at my mates, of the 6 (technically 7, but one's in Miami) that I'd class as the closest, the ones I can talk to about anything, only Dave was in my life 5 years ago, I'd never even met the rest. Just shows that nothing's set in stone.  Was out on Wednesday night at New Flesh. It seemed really dead, even though the numbers were up on the previous week. I think this was because there were less folk there that I knew (verging on none). So I spent most of the night talking to the Faerie, which was pretty good fun. I've certainly had worse nights out.  Going to a wrestling show tonight in Kilmarnock. Managed to get the car from my sister, which is a godsend, as the transport to and from Kilmarnock is a shambles (last bus at 10.30? I ask you...). Should be good fun.  On a bus related note, that reminds me. When I was getting off the bus last night, the guy started to drive off while I still had my back foot on the step. It was a feeling of weirdness, as I felt my leg spinning round and starting to twist around the other one. So I stumbled onto the pavement, the driver continued to drive off, and Eilidh caught the barrage of obscenities that I fired off in the bus' direction. Sorely tempted to write a letter of complaint, here.  That's about all I've got to say at the moment. May update later in the weekend."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Work are being cunts again.   A notice came around today saying that all Scottish workers would now have to follow English bank holidays, because when we're off on our bank holidays, the English still call in, and the workload is bigger. So we get shafted.  I'm legitimately raging at this. Where in the fuck do they get off changing our holidays just to suit another fucking country? This is symptomatic of the English mentality of making everyone else bend to suit their view of the world, and I for one am fucking sick of it. What next? No holidays at Christmas because a bunch of people don't celebrate it?  So the bottom line is that when just about everyone else in the country has the day off, we're fielding calls from cretins. And when the English ahve a bank holiday, we get the day off, but there's nothing to do, OH NO, there's nothing to do, because why would there be special nights on anywhere when no-one else is off the next morning.  Gah."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"It's odd, as soon as I decide I want out of BT, an opportunity arises to get a secondment for 6 months doing site support for the agency. The only downside is that I wouldn't get any bonus, but that makes no different to my finances, and it's more than offset by the fact that I'd be offline. No more calls from cretins!   Even though it's only for 3-6 months, it's still a chance to get some decent admin type experience. I'm going to give this one serious thought."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"...ly shit I'm bored at the moment.  It's 11.05pm local time, and I'm alone in the house. My sister's out with her boyfriend tonight, my mum activated heathen mode and trundled off to church for the watchnight service.   Really, though, what's that watchnight service all about? - Right folks, that's midnight, Jesus was born loads of years ago today, ignoring the fact that even if Jesus existed (and I'm sceptical at best), they've not taken account of the time difference between here and the middle east, and also science has supposedly proven that the birth was meant to have happened in March.  I know science has made plenty of mistakes in the past, but I still trust it more than a book that some crazy religious nut-jobs wrote 2000-odd years ago and used as a method of trying to brainwash others into joining their cult.  The family'll be over tomorrow for dinner, and I give it less than an hour before I get sick of them and want them all to leave. Not only that, they're bringing that stupid fucking dog of theirs. I just KNOW they're gonna try and get us to watch shit Christmas day television, but that'll happen over my dead body.  I'm just somewhat thankful that I don't have to do anything difficult in the preparation. Hell, I don't have to do anything at all.  Well, typing this out's killed 10 minutes or so."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"At times, I despair about the state of people in society. More accuarately, the people who call into BT. Some crazy old woman phoned today wanting to get her rental phone fixed. A rental phone so old that it uses the old style of hardwired socket.  So she demands a new phone, for the same price as she's currently renting it for. I half expected her to say she was paying half a groat. But no, she pays £2.75 at the moment, and can't afford to pay more than that. Well, tough shit missy, because our cheapest one is £4.99. I offer to put her through to the faults department, because my screen tells me (it's good like that) that faults with residential phones go to the faults department. She isn't happy about this, but once again, tough shit missy. So she goes through to the faults department, because frankly, if you call me,  I  control what happens with the call.  I am fast developing a dislike for stupid old people, and stupid Glesga Wummen who can't even accept that there's a set procedure I have to go through to even get started on the call. The bottom line is, my job is sales. And I can't sell if someone's taking up my time with a trivial enquiry, or can't even understand a simple menu and get themselves through to the righ department. So somenoe that tries (however unwittingly) to stop me doing my job, from trying to make my targets and bonus, then they're going to get a dose of customer service, Semprini style. No-one's yet had to join club RLS, but that'll happen soon enough."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Tomorrow, I have the joy of attending my sister's graduation. And frankly, I'd rather be disembowelled with a rusty spoon.   Now don't get me wrong here, it's not as if I wish any ill to my sister, I'm pleased for her that she passed everything and such like, but I can think of few things that fill me with more dread than this.  It was bad enough when I was the one involved, I'd have happily grauduated in absentia. I told all members of my family not to come if they didn't want to, thinking this would afford me the same privileges at their ceremonies. No such luck.  So I now have to suffer through the boredom, the speeches, the general mind-numbing tedium, person gets name called, wanders on stage, shakes hands, gets degree, lather, rinse, repeat, 'Quick, this is her', they all look the same to me, ""don't ridicule the others, their parents could be sitting close by"" - ""I'll ridicule anyone I damn well please""  As if all that's not bad enough, I'm the designated driver, which means hanging around while my sister talks to her vapid asshole friends as if she'll never see them again, when in fact she talks to them constantly on the phone, and then bitches about them to all her other friends on other calls.  God I'm bitter tonight.  In happier news, I got accepted for that job I went for at the Inland Revenue. They're full at the moment, but I'm on a reserve list, so once a slot opens up (oo-er), I'm there. And more importantly, I won't be in BT."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"There are many ways to ensure that you're wide awake and alert in work of a morning. Watching DVDs until 3 in the morning, thus giving you less than 3 hours sleep, is not one of them.  So, yeah, been somewhat of a zombie today. Was fairly quiet in work, so that's not so bad, meant I could blend into the background, and skive a bit. I've noticed that, actually, over the 9 months I've been there, that if I just show up, sit there, do the job, and go home, making only the odd sarcastic / cynical comment along the way, then they don't even notice when it's a day that I turn up, sit there, do nothing and go home.  Was up at Steve & Kat's on Wednesday, since it was Morgan's first birthday. Doesn't seem like a year ago that she was born, but the calendar reliably informs me that it is. A good evening's entertainment was had. And vegetarian food isn't actually that bad, in as much as something containing no meat can be good.  The Chris Benoit DVD that I'd ordered appeared yesterday, so that's all good. It's always amusing to see things reversed into Crippler Crossfaces.  Out to the catty tonight, I'm currently on a streak of 2 and 0 for nights out there that haven't sucked, which must be a record for recent times.  Bought myself a digital camera yesterday as well, which is something that I've been meaning to do for ages, but a decent sized bonus from work made it possible this month. Nikon Coolpix 3200, got it for £150 or thereabouts from Amazon, so I can expect delivery in 3-5 days, apparently. Got a 256Mb memory card as well. I was just gonna get the 128Mb card, but was talked into the big one by Brian Shannow, as only he can: ""youll kick yourself later if you get the smaller card and run out of storage when some drunken bint on the landing whaps her chebs oot""  But yeah, that's pretty much it for me at the moment. Time for dinner."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Mondays, being my rota day off work, generally follow one of two possible patterns: 1) Get up mid morning, and do something semi-constructive. 2) Get up at lunchtime, and piss about on the internet all day.  So today, I ended up getting up even earlier than I normally would have, as I'd been roped into giving Steve and Kat (and Morgan) a lift to get some 'foties took'. Or rather, they had to get from EK to Newton Mearns and then town by 11am, and someone with a car is the best way to do that.  The photographer was overly camp, verging on the ludicrous (or fabulous, depending on what way inclined you are - I'll stick with ludicrous), but Morgan behaved, and so the whole ordeal was painless.  Headed along to A1 afterwards, and I finally caved in and bought an action figure to put on top of stuff. Clarifying, the plan's always been to get geeky stuff on top of speakers, monitors and similar appliances that I own / use, but until now, I've never got round to buying any. So, as of today, I have a small Xenomorph on my left PC speaker (sadly one from Alien3 - yes, Jeff, it DOES exist, especially in the form of the extended cut - and not the original), and a Buddy Christ on the dashboard of my car. I'm undecided as to what to get for the right speaker (The Luggage, ideally, if I can find one cheap and with semi-decent quality), and I quite fancy one of Ryu, Ken, or Akuma for the top of the monitor.  Have set the wheels in motion for upgrading one of my hard drives (the media one), and thus the 6 gig effort I'm using will soon retire, to be replaced with a 160 gig monster (well, by my standards it's a monster) in preparation for the eventual installation of broadband. The 8 gig drive will stay as my Windows / programs drive for now.  That's about all I did of note this week(end), but on a slightly more depressing note, England look far too likely to do well in the European Championships. If they win this thing, we'll never hear the end of it...  Peace out for now, y'all."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Not been up to a great deal.  Did a shift in the Scotia on Thursday. Plan was to head along to Frequency afterwards, but by the time we got finished (which was in time for curfew), Steve had texted to say that it was dead quiet, and they were closing it at 2am. So went and got some food from Bifteki, and got Steve outside. Gave him, Kat, and Eilidh a lift home, and sat online for an hour or so.  Woke up yesterday, and Bifteki's revenge had been exacted. My stomach appeared to have taken an intense dislike to its contents, so it ejected them. Anything I tried to get down there made a prompt reappearance, and from now on, I eat at riginals.  Feeling a bit better today, so that's not so bad."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Got a letter this morning from the Inland Revenue.  It would appear that according to their calculations, I didn't earn enough in tax year 2001-2002, and thus unless I fork out £21, that year won't count as contributing to my state pension.  As a matter of principle, I'm not going to pay it, for the simple reason that given current trends, I don't expect there'll BE a state pension by the time I hit retirement age. Once I get a permanent and secure (well, secure-ish) proper job, I plan to geta private pension, since that's the only way I expect there'll be cash coming in post work-stoppery.  But still, bastard government. And bastard Union for not giving me enough hours."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Watched this last night while up at Steve's. Wasn't really sure what to expect, aside from the fact that it was Japanese, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's quite clearly one of the most blatantly violent movies in the history of my movie-watching antics, and the blood count must venture into the realms of many, many gallons. Having said that, it's not just a gore-fest, there are a few amusing moments in it. Well, to be more accurate, it's full of amusing momenst, but they probably won't all be quite as amusing to someone who doesn't have a sense of humour as sick as mine.  One touch I did like was Kakihara's mouth. They just don't make humans like that anymore.  The ending got a bit confusing though. We think we worked out mostly what had  happened, but those crazy Japs                                                                                                                                                                          never seem to be quite capable of telling a simple story in a simple manner.  And I want a pair of those boots."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Caught this on DVD last night at Steve's. Started off quite humorous, but took a more serious turn as the movie went on. Certainly not what I was expecting the film to be, but not necessarily the worse for it.  I did like the cinematography, the desert environment was well-handled, and some of the sound for bullets whizzing past was well done as well.  Usual moralising tone present for most of the movie, which brings it down a notch or two. A good movie, but not one I'd buy."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Boring weekend, did nothing very much, and then got bored and miserable at the Cathouse, left just after 2am.  Saw The Day After Tomorrow today. Standard 'switch off brain and watch the pretty FX' summer blockbuster fare, although the wolves were somewhat crap in the CGI stakes, as in LXG bad.  Other than that, I've not really been up to a great deal. It's Bad Blood this coming weekend though, so that should be quite good. If nothing else, it'll give me a week's break from the constantly repeating cycle of Sunday nights.   I'm so bored right now."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"It would appear that the Americans have finally captured him.  Watching the coverage on TV at the moment. The press conference smacked of triumphalism from the US, and in particular the hooping and hollering was a bit over the top.  Tony Blair's said that he wants Saddam to be tried in Iraq by the Iraqis. So, some questions about that: Will Bush agree? (No) Will Saddam get a fair trial? (Of course. I hope you're not suggesting that Blair and Bush would pack the jury with people who could be relied upon to deliver the 'correct' verdict) What if he gets found not guilty? (I don't think we need to worry about that happening) Have any weapons of mass destruction been found yet? (Erm....) Wasn't that why this war was started in the first place, to find WMDs? (Shut up) Do you think they'll ever be found? (Lalala I'm not listening)  The war was still morally and legally wrong from the very start though."

1YX99F2,female,26,"so, i was hiding under Belle's bed this morning, and i overheard the strangest thing. she was on the phone, but i don't know who she was talking to. she kept mentioning ""the squeeze"" and something about a garbage bag full of 20's. i was a little freaked out, but turned on... so finally she finished the call and then she was humming a strange tune. something from the rocky horror picture show, i think... anyway, at the first opportunity, i made like Jesus (and got the flock out of there). and when i ran into her in the bathroom a few minutes later it was a little awkward. ...and not just because i was in the middle of peeing when she walked in. we chatted about the weather, but she could tell i was spooked, since i didn't make any lewd comments. she had a look in her eye, not unlike suspicion. she couldn't have known i was listening to her shady conversation, but i'm a little worried anyway.  so if Belle asks anyone what happened to the stash of porn she had squirrelled away under her bed... don't tell her it was me!"

The conspiracy first started during a rock concert in an undisclosed location (we could tell you but we'd have to kill you.). They have been responsible for many events throughout history, including Marilyn Monroe's skirt incident.  Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be identified by squealing and panting pledges of undying devotion.  They want to beat the Rolling Stones and imprison resisters in boz's septic tank using little blue boats.

Actually, about the firefighters. I agree with their strikes, I don't agree with how much they are asking but striking is giving them the attention and support they need. However, I do not agree with them going on strike now when we are about to go to war with Iraq, which I reckon will happen in about 10 days time if that. (They better leave korea alone btw, just look at what happened in Vietnam!!!!) They are tying up valuable troops. Even the Gerkuas or however you spell it are helping out and they are extremly valuable! These are the guys which is their sword is drawn they must produce blood with it or kill someone before it can be put back into its sheath believe it or not. Now I will continue to support the firefighters, my Dad used to be one and we tend to go to alot of the these firefighter things, shows etc.. but I really do think they should stop all this striking until tropps are available.

How rude! There was a bunch of year 9's in there because we saw Doe's bro. That is outrageous. Even Jackie got asked her age. Bless. Anywho, thsi is the review type of thing from the official site, if you haven't seen it and want to don't read, its a spolier, slightly:  For every beginning there is an end  Final Destination 2, the sequel to the hit 2000 supernatural thriller, finds Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) the only survivor of the crash of Flight 180 left alive. Locked away by her own choice in the perceived safety of a psychiatric hospital, Clear now lives in constant terror that Death is coming to claim her, as it did all her friends. Clear may be considered crazy, but she's not wrong. Death is moving toward suburban Route 23, heading south.  En route to a weekend getaway with her friends, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) watches helplessly as a logging truck careens out of control and loses its deadly payload, setting off a horrifying chain reaction that leaves twisted metal and dead bodies in its wake  including her own. A moment later, Kimberly finds herself still stuck in on-ramp traffic, with a line of commuters she saw die moments before trailing behind her. It was only a vision. But was it also a warning? Shocked into action, Kimberly blocks the cars from joining the traffic on Route 23 as a young police trooper (Michael Landes) arrives on the scene. The commuters begin to honk and complain until Kimberlys premonition comes powerfully and tragically to life before their eyes.  Death tears up the highway in a massive pile-up, with those left on the onramp narrowly escaping with their lives. But Kimberly knows its not over. Death won't be cheated so easily. Now this random group of strangers, who in Kimberlys vision were all meant to die in the freeway disaster, must join her in a thrilling race against time and their own paralyzing fear to do what all but one of the survivors of Flight 180 couldn't  stay alive.  New Line Cinema presents Final Destination 2, from the same producing team behind the original film, Warren Zide and Craig Perry (American Pie I-III, Cats and Dogs), with Justis Greene (Mission to Mars, Ill Be Home for Christmas) serving as Co-Producer. Noted second unit action director David R. Ellis (whose work has been seen in such films as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, The Perfect Storm and the upcoming Matrix Reloaded) directs from a screenplay written by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, based on the story by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress and Jeffrey Reddick. Returning from the first film are Ali Larter (Legally Blonde, American Outlaws) as Clear Rivers and Tony Todd (Candyman) as the mortician, Mr. Bludworth."

I don't think there is any need to make people apply seeing as this is just a blog as has been pointed out. Looks like its going to be Matt is everyone ok with that?
96TQZLJ,male,17,I have just seen the best number plate Jo! It was J2 RAH - how cool is that?
96TQZLJ,male,17,thanks.
96TQZLJ,male,17,Yeah. Go Tom. I can get a can of coke for 30p and a packet of doritos for 23p from the vending machine at work. How cool is that?

96TQZLJ,male,17,Got to kick kid sout because they were letting fire crackers off in the store so Ritchie walked up and pointed to the door and said 'out' and they protsted so we booted them out. Woo.  And Max can start off the subject thing again.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well. What an interesting day. Had to take half my personal belongings into school today to pack into a barrell for D of E, and I just know I'm going to have forgotten to pack something really crucial. As it is I've forgotten plates and cuttlery (quite important!), so i'm gonna have to sit on it tomorrow in the mini-bus. So yes. I just hope that a) it doesn't rain, and b) it doesn't get too bloody cold!!! I think that the cold is going to be the worst bit, having to camp for 3 nights in the freezing cold lake district, with nothing but 5 layers of clothes, a sleeping bag and a lilo for warmth. Hey ho, gotta do these thigns to get places in this world, I guess! Sholud be a laugh though, I just can't help feeling a bit nervous cos we've got to capsize in the lake, and I hate deep water. However, we do get life jackets so it sholudn't be too scary................But I bet I end up in tears whatever happens! Hey ho, so gutys have a good weekend, be back on Tuesday! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,Dave- calling something gay is really no different from calling someone a bastard... it doesn't mean that they are really an illegitimately born child does it? And I'm sure people who were really born when their parents weren't married aren't gonna take offence at the term
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well i've been cleaning ink out of my printer all day, FUCKING THING.  Sorry."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"We are a lazy soceity, the rate of obestitiy proves it! 30- 40 yrs ago there wernt T.V's and computers so children went outside to play EVERYDAY, not once a week for 10 mins but they would spend all day outside just playing and mucking around Because all of this new stuff is around children dont do anything, and aldults are just as bad! I'm not saying that i dont agree with all this new technology as it makes life a lot easier and conviente. But what i think needs to happen is control over what is used by parents ect.."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well I stayed in bed for about half an hour and then my dad convinced me to help him in the garden. Lawn mower doesn't work. So lets go inside and see if I can get the computer to work. Oooo, I know what the problem is, why don't I just move the hard drive into the other computer and then look at it? Good idea, I thought. So I did. Then it caught alight and smoke started to rise out of the computer. Back to the drawing table. Bloody cabages, should have stayed in bed."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"OI!!! Where'd it go?! I know it wasn't helpful or full of anythign useful, but I thought it summed up today quite well. If this blog isn't for blogging, I don't know what is. Hmmmph. Teenagers these days."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"I was topless around 20 mins ago.  Hard day today, the hight of all our things at work have been increased.  Had to move everything around.  8 and half hours."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Ah, now you see this is exactly what I mean when I say that I would get left, I already am being left out. People are organizing groups etc.. to go with in limos and stuff yet no one has asked me. I mean I happy to help out organize a little group but I don't want to be like THE one who does.  No, I don't think I will go to the ball after all.  Has anyone else made any other blogs no wthey have an account? If so what are they and I can link them to your name above instead of email or other sites."
96TQZLJ,male,17,What you mean? what happened to hotmail?
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well, i dont like the new blog. I had just got used to the old one and now they go and bloody change it! Grrr. Well i am going job hunting tmor with Darren although i believe that all the jobs have gone and it will be a waste of time but neva mind its a chance to get out! Well today woz okay, but i now belive that Simon doesnt like our group of freinds, i dont particulary care tho cause he seems to get on with other peeps! Erm... Only 9 more days until i go on holiday ! Yay, i can't wait i'm really excited now, it will be sooo good. I will come back really borwn and i can rub it all in when we visit the park maybe. Well i have notinh gmore to say."
96TQZLJ,male,17,awww ok.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Morning everyone, Lots of changes to alert you to. First of all we have a new layout of: Tic Tac Blue as requested. Enjoy guys. Please keep your profiles updated. I can't figure out how to delete archives because I thought it'd be good to almost start again, ie: with the new template start new archives. However can't find this option so gonna have to have all the old posts as well which isn't too bad but remember (this goes to everyone) they are old posts from the past when things were different and before we grew up over the summer. Some people may get that more than others.  Um. Ok so that is the main change. LOL.  Sorry I couldn't make it to bowling, had to work all day and then do revison (forced to by parents, gah). I hope you had a good time.  General Studies today, should be a giggle NOT. 2 and half hours. Yipee. 3 hours geology tomorrow. Pants.  Hope you all have good day!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"35 hours of over time so far in One Week!! How are we all?  Sorry Ive not been around to chat much, been living at sainsbury's!  Im gonna get a hoomungus pay check! Can't wait!  I wasn't happy about Englands football game.  I know no one is a big footie fan, but if you saw the game you will understand!  We were beating France, the competition favourites, and they scored two goals in less than a minute to win it!  bastards :(  Still, Im thinking of organising a get together somewhere, somehow.  So after nine gruelling hours of sainbury's, 3 on trolleys in this blooming heat I'm rather sweaty so I am now off to take a bath!!! see you all soon :)  Andy"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Damn it, i shoulda come ! Lol, neva mind. Good job you had fun"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"I still have done no work. Umm, I really should be working now, but I really can't be arsed. I am liking: Rasmus: In the shadows Very good song."
96TQZLJ,male,17,I'm dying from lack of sleep. Got woken up at 9:45 today because I had to carry 6 chairs and a very large table into our back garden. I should be halfway during my sleep.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Andy - you said you blogged yesterday but you haven't so please blog. Max - please blog. Tom - please blog we are not going to argue with every single thing you say. Tell us about your work shadowing or Brazil prepartaions or SOMETHING!!!!!!  If no one knows quite what to blog here's a bit of fun, anwser the following questions and lets see what we find out:   1. Do you own a wristwatch? Describe.  2. How old were in you 1997?  3. Which is more important  financial success or personal happiness?  4. Can you whistle?  5. Do you believe in the supernatural?    When the blog starts to lag I shall post some more questions up. Some are random some need more thought so enjoy and lets find out some stuff. (I'll anwser them later once we've got some anwsers from you!!)"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"This is a group blog for, er, a group. I think the line up is myself, Tom, Jackie, Max and David T. Just a few notes though guys, can we try not to swear unless your in a reeally bad mood. If your arguing with someone else on the blog please don't argue through the blog. Remember, its Post & Publish not just post!!!!  Oh and please no shamless plugging of your website, and that was mainly focued towards Dave. Tsktsk. :)"
96TQZLJ,male,17,What cute cats everyone has. That is a nice picture of Soda. I wills can some of my cats in later. Park today and the weather looks okish. Hmm. I am very suspicious of it though.
96TQZLJ,male,17,I am working on wednesday. Also I'm good thanx.
96TQZLJ,male,17,*Sing* I like traffic lights....... I like traffic lights........
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Yes! never ever have to sit through another music lesson ever, anything I do to do with music will be strictly voluntary from now on! And to celebrate, Tom and I have had simulatneous book burnings! I burnt my book which wasn't entierly successful, firstly it wouldn't light, and when it finally caught light some dead leaves caught alight too, and set fire to the fence!! OOPS! when I'd finished, I cam back up and found a folder full of notes and songs from choir, which of course I had to burn too! This was a little more successful, I went down behind the wall at the bottom and created a nice little bonfire, whihc burnt very well for about half an hour until it started to rain. But all my music is now reduced to ashes, which actually feels like a great relief. Ok, so it's vandalism. Ok it ruins the atmosphere. And ok, a few flowers got singed. But hey,. it'ss a weight off myh mind!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Ha ha ha ha. No. That's not really funny. That's really dispicable. Do you have to pay for a new one, or can you claim it on your insurance? Anyway, blog more later, gtg to a music lesson now!  OK I'm back. Well today was a bit of a bizarro day. Firstly those stupid questionairres that we spent most of the day devising stupid answers to. Then something else funny happened, and I can't even remember what it was now. DAmmit. But yes, and odd day in all. Boring music leesson, got into trouble for not having done enough work. Yipeee. MOre school tomorrow, can't say I'm looking forawrd to it. I was going to bring my camera tomorrow, but it looks like it's going ot rain so I don't think I will now! Anyway, dinner time, talk to you later guys"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Nobody is blodding any more. Hmmm. Probably cos the weather is too hot to think properly. But hey, just thought I'd mention it. NOt that anybody's gonna read this of course, seeings as nobody seems to be visitng blogger atm."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Happy Valentines day everyone!!  I should be going to the cinema with Paul later but when I checked my hours for tomorrow I found that I am working from 8.30 and I may be working all day until 5.30 so ahhhh that means we'll have to refigure our plan. Gah.  Hope you all have a good day, half term now so at least we can chill out. A bit. I have a riduclus amount of work to be doing. Ack.   Matt has been invited to join us."
96TQZLJ,male,17,That is excellent news Jo!  Party In The Park 2003 Photos!   Nicki getting very pissed off with people invading our area.    Helen and her alternative sun-glasses.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well yesterday I went to a party with some friends from Riddlesdown, but there defenition of party is more 'piss-up' than party. But anyway, it's really funny watching all theboys who get completely trashed then dance around madly to Electric Six and Led Zepplin. Extremely funny. I left about 11pm, but everybody else 'crashed' on the floor at Bennett's house over night, havign done a midnight raid on Tesco's with  ""a spot of bush jumping"", as Paul so delightfully put it. Anywho. Today I've been to Caterham and the library and stuff, got a supply of alchohol for Thursday (good or bad!), and got this wicked album out the library: ""Ether Song"" by Turin' Brakes, it's great! Also just discovering The Thrills and The Vines, they're pretty good tooooooooo! Thursday is drawing ever closer, trying to fill up my time to forget about it! I think I might take a trip into crodyon tomorrow to go to Beano's and get some more music, wander a bit, then I'm going to the cinema in the evening with Paul to see 'Pirates of the Carribean'. Yay! Tonight I am going out to a friend's house for a catch up, so no thinking about GCSEs! yay! Hmmmmmm! Just heard that Andy's party is hawaiin themed, so better go think about that one! ttyl guys!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,lol cool. Well here is this week's diary: Tuesday: Paul to my house Wednesday: Work and Paul over Thursay: To Paul's house Friday: Enrollment and off to work Saturday: Work and party with Paul Sunday: Who knows?! Monday: Who knows?! Tuesday: Paul's at school :(
96TQZLJ,male,17,"I finally finished one peice of coursework. It's not very good, but hopefully i can have it back to improve! :D"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Lol, Some people have all the fun! Me- Sat at home like a computer geek and was on habbo all day... And someone else bloody blog Wot ya and paul did? And have fun at da ball"
96TQZLJ,male,17,Boogie Woogie! YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
96TQZLJ,male,17,*cough* blog *cough*
96TQZLJ,male,17,Gossip: Rudders and Charlene are a couple.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Dream Job: Self-employed computer engineer with a reasonable workload, earning enough money to live on and get what I want.  Why? Good at PC repair/maintenance. Its a hobby for me as well as a job."
96TQZLJ,male,17,thats fine.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Guns- Death  Thats basically my veiw, guns shouldnt be allowed ne where, surely there must be a better way of patrolling the streets, even if the highest trained professional gun shooted could mis aim and therefor fatally injure someone. I beleive that things like stun guns should be made standard issue for  policce officers as they are far less dangerous. But there again jo has made a good point, crimals wont be so inclined to perform illegal acts if they see police carrying guns.  But if you think about it there will always be crime, whether it be viscious or not. There is nothng we can do to stop it. In my view prevention is better than stopping it mid way."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"That's a rather unfortunate acronym, kind of ironic as well.  I haven't blogged for quite a while, nearly two weeks. What have a done? Not a lot really. I've been listening to Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas quite a lot, which is quite odd because it's not my normal taste in music, but I really like this song; and I have been introduced to Sugarcult who just rock. Rather stressed with the amount of work I have to do, but it's nearly holiday time, only two weeks left, so I'm not too worried. It's my birthday on Saturday, having a driving lesson which should be amusing! Bought my Christmas cards this evening with Jo & co in Oxted (haha, that rhymes).  So a mix of really good and really bad things - I supose they level out."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Sorry for not posting for a few days, I completly forgot about it!  I'm not bothered what we use."
96TQZLJ,male,17,Question everybody.  Who was the first ever person on your MSN contact list? Mine was Dave Dodson.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"So Max, you don't like Johnny Vaughan? What about Dom Joly? Good stuff from Fat Boy Slim? Well the channel is designed for 20-30 year olds, so that could explain why you don't like it."
96TQZLJ,male,17,Only 5 minutes to go :(
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Grrrrr, thats stupid innit, we can pretend we are 18 and do the survey but then it would be pointless! ERm school woz fun! (never thought you would hear me say that eh!) Had a bit of a water fight and then had fun while doing some P.E homework in the computer room! AND CHEESE!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well, I did Katare Last night! Today i worked this morning, Now i gotta get pre orders for Love Actually.. Any offers? Tommorrow I'm taking part in a trampolining display up at De Stafford school, So that should be fun! And Nicki i got good news to tell ya!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well i mite as well post my results from test the nation now. I got an IQ of 112 I got 54 out of 70 I got 3 wrong on language I got 2 wrong on memory I got 6 wrong on logic I got 3 wrong on numbers I got 2 wrong on perception I beat both of my parents, which was good. My dad got an IQ of 94 and my mum had an IQ of 106. Any way i am very pleased about that as it means i am above average. Yippee anyhow what did the rest of you lot get? that is if you did the quiz !"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"lol, it was quite funny. Dad kepy piping in about burying giblets under the patio, for some reason. Nancy was throwing up in the lounge cos she is really ill, she has been up since 3am crying, she is so hot you could fry eggs on her, and she has been sick numerous times. Also she is being very ""mummyfied"" today, and won't be in a room without mum, so when we were eating lunch she was sprawled on the sofa. Which wasn't a good idea, seeings as she could see and smell the food."
96TQZLJ,male,17,Maths annoyed me. There was a question about the mean number and all I could think of was the advert where that man goes 'can you spot the mean number' and one number takes an ice cream from the other then hits him. Dammit. I would've been so depressed last night if it weren't for lovely Jackie. 2nd July.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Jo's party. 21st June.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Party In The Park. Whenever that is......hehe. Then I was reading the email Si sent me aasking fi I did actually want to go to the cinema or was it just Jackie messing about. Hehe.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Fair enough Dave. Hope ya have fun in Canada! Nice place.  Hey Max I presume you've spent most of your days playing this Counterstrike game then huh? Heehee, I've spent most of my time when I haven't been out playing Rolocoaster Tycoon 2. I'm addicted :(   Coudln't sleep last night. Thought I'd get to bed earlyish but it was so hot and then once I finally got to sleep I woke up again then went back to sleep so all in all I slept about 3 hours last night before waking up at 8.15 by the sun streaming in through my white curtains. Gah. So I'm tired."
96TQZLJ,male,17,I wanted to make a drink. I went into the kitchen and I picked up a mug. I put four heaped spoons of hot chocolate powder into the mug. I filled the kettle with water. I put some milk into my mug. I stirred the milk in with the powder until it was a chocolate goo. I waited for the water to boil. I poured the water into the mug. I stirred it up. I took a sip. It burnt my lip. I waited for it to cool. When it was cool I drunk some more. It was nice.
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Jo its Dave D and I don't think its funny. A bunch of year 9's got in so why the hell couldn't our guys? I am rather annoyed at that, I may complain to them. Does bro was in there!!!!!! Geez!!! An dit was the first time Rich had actually come to the cinema with us and he couldn't get in. How rude!!!!  Today I still have to do all my homework. I have to write an english essay, anwser around 30 german questions, in german, find music for our english speaking, do some history questions and write up my ROA. Darn it!! Why am I blogging if I have so much to do??? Silly me!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"What lucky folk you are.  I have been having a bit of a bad weekend to say the least. But I will discuss that in a mo. First of all tomorrow I have a textiles exam. Woppe. In the afternoon I am going to the garden centre with father because I need to get a proper cactus house for my cactuses because after 3 years of neglect they are alive! So now I intend to keep them all nice and healthy. Tuseday I am going to Croydon with Jackie to get Jo's pressies. I am also intending to but myself a few CD's and some matrix posters....hehe. Wednesday we should have the park. Loads of people haven't emailed me back on whether they are coming or not yet. Grrr. So spread the word people. Thursday I am not sure what I am doing. Friday is the day of reckoning with the Information Communications Technology test. Sorry, I think it sounds so much better athn ICT or IT. LOL. Today I have been reading on of my books. Did you do in WHSmith you can get any 2 books for ust 10? That is a good deal, and they have some good books on the shelves too!  So my dilemea. I have the sixth form letter. And guess what. I have subjects that clash. Wopee. But then guess what. The 2 subjects which clash are the 2 subjects I reeeeally need to do for my future career. Grrr. I wouldn't care so much if I had to drop Geology or English lit but I have to choose between HISTORY and ART/TEXTILES. HOW THE HELL DOES THE FLIPPING SIXTH FORM EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? I MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE COURSES!!!!!!!!!! I will be on a rampage tomorrow as I must go and complain to Miss H then to Mr V. Anyone care to join me? Grrr."
96TQZLJ,male,17,SORRY!  GEEZ DIS IS JUST A BLOG! >:(
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Boo, my results: 2 C's the rest were B's Cant be bothered to write out wot i got for each subject as im really tired! Erm party last night woz good but i think Andy woz stupid cause it kinda ruined his party!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well... I'm shattered.  Went to bed at 1am last night after saying I would have an early night. Got up at 7.30 and started work at 9am. finshed work at 5.30pm.  Working tomorrow 9.30 till 1.30 so that shouldn't be too bad, Sunday I'm working all day...  I seriously need to catch up on sleep."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Well, at Woolies we have a canteen and kitchen. But it is filled up with entertainment boxes so, er, yea. I vote for free coke!!! If ever you think of me Jackie, you know I like my coke :p"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Right ok I am here. Now I won't be able to reply with something full of facts and figures etc.. simply because I don't do any subject to do with stuff like that except general studies. And in general studies Max and I made a very sucessful presentation about it all. We came second in the polls. We voted for the communisits. I say send them to France simple because France - I dislike. Thats not a decent reason to say that I know but hey, thats me. Like I say before, I don't know that much about it all. I don't mind the seekers who happily pay there way and live quietly without causing problems. Thats fine. I understand about war countries and goverments pursuring people and stuff and yes its horrible for them which is why I say with the amount we'd save on the illegal ones being kicked out we could help those countries. Thats also a better way than sending in our army like Iraq. But hey, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I don't know all the ins and outs. I have no need to know really. Only time it bothers me is when I'm in Croydon and they're all around and its like ah get away. Yea, I guess what I'm saying is we should send the illegal immigrents away somewhere, anywhere, else and find another way of helping them.  Tomorrow  Jo  will be choosing subject/question."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Yes, What did matt say? And erm i live in south croydon, surrey, i dnt live in warlingham hamsey green or sanderstead! and my postcode is CR2 if that helps?"
96TQZLJ,male,17,yay!!!!!
96TQZLJ,male,17,We are getting new vending machines. Yay!
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Am I right in thinking this is a blog where you put down your feelings and stuff that has happened during the day?  Yes. That is right. The reason I don't want people slagging each other using the blog is because that is all that will happen. People will just sit here and diss people. If I let you and Max slag each other off now then you wouldn't be talking probably, ie: your previous post. You'd still be slagging each off. Fair enough if people don't get along but slagging each other off all the time isn't gonna help. I should know, just look at Lisa and I! Do you see where I'm coming from?  I am putting off my history coursework until tomorrow. Its all confused me, i don't feel we have done enough work on it. I mean for our Vietnam one we did like a terms worth of research etc.. So far we've had what, five/four lessons on it? Well. Tsktsk. And Jo, I relaly hope we can sort out that London thingy. I get hyper whenever i think about it! Heehee. And can we move the Imperial war Musuem trip to the next inset day? Ii am away at half term. Thats a point, what is everyone doing at half term? I'm off up to Norfolk to see my Auntie! Her house is so lovely. Actually, hers and Andy's are simelar! OMG, guess what I did thsi morning. I nearly choked to death [no, seriously I relaly nearly did!] on CORNFLAKES!!!!! That is outrageous! A few saturdays ago I nearly choked on a piece of rice while watching you've been framed and the evening before that I managed to get a chunk of chocolate stuck in my throat. I really should chew my food."
96TQZLJ,male,17,"Am I first home or first to be sad enough to come online?  Excelent time, can't be bothered to type it all out, way too tired. Just 'cool' is all I can say!"
96TQZLJ,male,17,"So you enjoyed it then Tom? I wasn't sure whether you were going to l ike it or not (seeings as u are a Moby fan etc etc), but I think you enjoyed it? PErhaps not quite so much as Bon Jovi, but after such a wicked concert anything would be hard to follow! And Nicki, I had a fab day with yo u and Helen and Tom, was a good group to go with, and I have a big bruise on my back from when u knocked me over taking my shoe off! But I had fun. Meatloaf was really good, I can live happily ever after now I've seen him do the full version of ""Bat out of Hell"" live, I felt a bit lonely tho cos nobody else knew all the words (well, apart form the old fogies!) but hey, I had fUN! I am very burnt though, and it is rather painful. My back is all prickly and so are my shoulders, and my face is quite a strange pinkish colour!

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"I stood by the window last night watching the approaching storm. I told my few remaining customers that they had better head home if the didn't want to be caught out in the rain. They scoffed and rambled on about how  the weathermen have not predicted an accurate storm in weeks, it'll blow over they said, nothing to worry about they said. I told them I don't watch the weather and I don't listen to the weathermen. I watch the radars and look outside. To the north the sky was black, grey and green. The sign of an impending Texas storm. The kind of clouds that bring night at 4pm. To the south were long rolling clouds. The sun washing them in hues of purples, oranges and reds. The sky around them a vibrant blue. All giving no impression of the destruction to follow the sun shrinking into the night.  moments of eternity later I was alone in the bar when the wind began to howl. The windows rattled and the building shook. A fine mist covered the ground first and then the rain began to fall. Hard drops pounding the hot pavement. The wind so fierce the rain appeared to be coming straight out of the ground. The doors creaked and groaned, popping open and slamming shut in one fell swoop. The ceiling quivered. The walls trembled. The driving rain found it's way in to every crack and crevice of the old building, and poured thru the roof. The lights sizzled with every flash of lighting and flickered with every crash of thunder. I stood next to the door of the walk-in cooler, waiting for the ceiling to collapse or disappear. I didn't know which, but waited none the less. I made busy with mopping water off of the floor and putting buckets under the leaks. Anything to keep my mind off of my possible doom. and as suddenly as it started, it ended. The rain began to fall from the sky instead of rising out of the earth. The lightning and thunder began to move off to the distance instead of over my head. The wind died to a whisper. Every thing was calm. The sky broke, revealing deep blues and blacks, a few stars shown thru the remaining wisps of clouds. And my evening returned to normal. Pouring cold beers and shots of whiskey, gin-n-tonics and shots of jager for the customers that had braved the end of the storm to seek refuge from the blackness left when the storm took their electricity. And I sat and listened, like I do most nights, to their stories of woe and excitement. But tonight it was a shared story. We had made thru another angry Texas storm. Together."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i wish there was something i could say that would make it all better.  i have a few things to say on the matter, but right know it doesn't seem to come out right everytime i type it.  give me a few moments to meditate on it and i'll give you my two cents."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well damn, i had this long post about the pleasure of napping and my computer burped when i posted. lost the whole thing"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"So once again feel as my life is too cluttered. i feel like i own too much stuff, and i decided that my house is not too small for all my stuff, my stuff is too big for my house. my current goal is to be able to pack everything in the back of a 20foot moving van. not that i'm planning on moving anytime soon, but i may need to one day. Late last night i begun. i chose a huge pile of clothes to be given away. i'd like to see my friends get them, so i'll maybe publish a list here soon. and i filled a black contractor bag with TRASH. When will i ever have a need for a torn half-shirt with my Highschool Football teams logo, so out it goes with the bits of scraps of paper. A reicept for photos i paid for TEN years ago?  Gone!  Whcih brings me to this. so i'm sitting here trying to figure out if The spin doctors"" Pockect full of Cryptonite"" is worth of draggin me into clutter hell. i'm mean i bought it once? but do i need to keep it?"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i have come to the concluson that i need to figure out at way to blog from the shower. i have found myself latley just standing in the shower, letting the hot water run over my head and down my body, for several minutes a day. sometimes as much as 20mins. just standing there thinking, and conversing to myself. sometimes i just i don't think at all. i just stand there.the problem is i i'm usally in the shower getting ready for work, so once i get out i continue my hygene ritual, get dressed then it's out the door. i also do alot of thinking while i drive. not because i want to mnd you, i'd love to drive blissfullu down the road like the rest of america, oblivios to my surrounds but unlike most of american drivers do not have a radio in my truck. that is really a misreprentation. i do have a radio in my truck, it's just that i can't use it. the lot i bought it from some how lost the removable face plate. and well i bargined them down so much on the truck, i didn't really think it was a deal breaker and didn't want to push the point. chiefly because the deal was done and well ther wasn't anything i could do about it, secondly this is the next truck in a long line of vehicles i have owned that have not had a radio. so i'm getting quite accustomed to riding in silence. i find myself from time to time even turing off the radio in my G/F's truck.     THPPHHHHHHHH!!!"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i have been reflecting on my liffe with Johnny Cash yesterday and today, and here is a small snipit of my thoughts. i can give credit for the man helping me be the man i am today. the very first memory i have of Johnny is ""one Peice at a time"" it was a favorite of mine as a child and still one of my favorites today. upon further reflection i realized that might be that reason for my passion for building motorcyles and cars......""i built it once peice at a time and it didn't cost me a dime, you'll know it's me when i come thru your town......."" the second one is you have to stand up for what you believe in and what you know is right."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"I live in fear of ""what if?"" more often than not I do things because I don't want to regret. I live in fear of being 90 years old, sitting in a chair with a blanket and a cup of coffee, wondering  what if? . It is one of the reasons I keep my TV on CNN. I don't want to miss anything. For the same reason I tend to also do things I think will hurt me. Because then I know if they will hurt me or not. I won't wonder. But I still do wonder. And I drive myself crazy thinking about it.  what if......."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Patrick is heart-broken today. something is broken, but he can't figure it out. she came over last night and there was alot of tension between her am him. she didn't even kiss him. he had to kiss her, and when he did there was no spark anymore. he hadn't see her in almost a week, and it was just plain weird."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"so yesterday i was standing at the ice well making a vodka and cranberry. and for some reason i had a memory of the road. the memory i had was being at a shell station outside of Seattle somewhere in the mountains. we filled the truck up with gas and our stomaches with tacos. one of which found its way under the truck seat until monday(5days). whoops. anyhow it was a bright sunny day, i think there might have been some high clouds but not many. the trees were tall and green. and there were some rock n roll hippies. i have no other way to describe them. people who from a distance look like hippies; worn baggy clothes, long hair, and shabby shoes, but on closer inspection reveal themselves to be metal heads;a Dio baseball shirt or metallica tee, wallet chains and corduroy pants, and old nike shoes. on a side note, i wish that the chain-driven wallet had not gained so much popularity. i liked it when people looked at me with fear and disgust just because i wore a chain on my wallet. now every one from weekend bikers to 14 year old korn fans wear them. however, i'm a goober and if my wallet is not attached to my body then i would set it down somewhere and forget where i put it. also the reason that i have a hook on my keys. i haven't lost my keys since i put my them on the hook about 10 years ago. now that i'm saying this i'm probably gonna lose them.  so anyway back to the point, it was a nice memory to have yesterday. thinking of that warm fall day. me and my girl. on the road to seattle and self discovery. i just wonder what it was that triggered the memory.........."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,nuthing else to say today. i did some revisions on the story. there seems to be some inconsitanceies when put together. that and i can't spell for shit.
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"not much going on these days. still fighting tooth and nail to get the triumph done with no money. did get a new tattoo this weekend though. i kinda feel bad. that was money i had earmarked for my new truck, a 1941 dodge, and it was money that could have been used for bike parts. but then again i am always envigorated by a new tattoo, so i think it was money well spent. cides, i got a pretty deep discount."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well i'm working on the bike again. i really want to have a new bike that i don't have to work on constantly. however i do get some simple satifaction in the work itself, and i know i'll owe next to nothing when i'm done. but i really do want a new bike, i just don't know if i can or want to afford the payments right now. oh well i'll let ya'll know. speakingof knowing, let me know what going on with ya'll who read this."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"You know me by my name, i know you by your drink. young pretty girls drink light beer and vodka tonics, young men do shots of whiskey and schnapps between their beers. old men drinks scotch and draft beer. old women drink wine or drinks with simple names. i hate you all. for different reasons of course. but i still hate you. because your loud, your rude, you don't tip, and you don't know what your talking about. your talking to hear yourself talk and to make your self feel important. why on earth do you want to talk to me? is your life so un-interesting that you find delight in my mundane life? Fuck You, Pay Me!"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"not much going on these days. been working alot. got to see my brother on tuesday and for breafast wed morn, on his way back from kuwait on his way to DC to work at the the big building. slept all day on wedsday."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"I will find your alter ego, oh yes, I will."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"that sucked you didn't get to dj, you even had ppl come out to see you...maybe this week?"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well it's been along time since i came here.  here is another account of the trip. i'm hoping that in the next few days i can continue writing the account. i know that the longer i wait the more fuzzzy the details will be. and the more i'll fictionalize to make it a better read. but anyway here it goes.  5800 hundred miles to go, I want to be sedated...  	August 16th, 9:14am Saturday morning, the alarm blaring in my ear telling me it was time get going. We woke up late and had alot to do today. But, coffee first.  Then find my smokes. Move slowly to the kitchen, and make coffee. Ah, sweet, sweet coffee, the stuff that fills your lungs with aroma, your mouth with flavor, and you body with warmth. We had to be in town by noon for lunch. High noon. The exact opposite of the midnight witching hour, the time of the day that all is supposed to be clear, though highlighted by the deep shadows cut by the sun straight above. And things were very clear today.  Even though The Princess had begun packing I had not even started. I didnt have as much to pack as she had. She was moving across the country to begin her new life, I merely the vehicle that would get her there. I was to be on the road for a week, return to gather my belongings and begin my new journey to join her. I didnt know how long she would be out there, but she knew enough to realize that what she didnt take would be gone forever. Im sure if we had finished packing the night before we wouldnt feel so rushed, but we both wanted one more night out on the town before departing.  One more night to remember. And that we did, we partied like rock stars. This spontaneous change would set the tone for the entire trip, as well as be the cause for our late departure. After I had my coffee and morning smoke I began to pack my bag. A few t-shirts, under shirts, some socks and a pair of jeans. I also packed my cowboy boots. I find it interesting that in normal day to day I dont often wear them, but for some reason, as soon as I cross the state line they go on my feet and stay there till I get home. I would also be flying home and well they are just plain easy. No steel toes to worry airport security, and they are easy to get on and off to be checked for prohibited items. So I had all I needed to last me a week on the road. The Road. This journey was to be a short one for me. She and I would simply drive her truck to California, where I would then get on a plane out of LA. Short and sweet journey. Planned destination. At least that was the plan till we had lunch with her father. Pops pulled me aside and told me of the dreams and aspirations he had for his daughter, and living in California was not one of them. He suggested that we make a vacation out of it, see some of the country and take time on the road to fully realize the opportunities a that were available to us. At this time I had no job to return to and no real reason for staying in Fort Worth. I knew that following love was a dangerous decision, but I also knew that if I let it go, I would always wonder what would have become of us. So I took her fathers money and advice. I put the money in my pocket and finished loading the truck.  After loading the truck our decision to head east or west was made by the toss of a coin. Best two out a three sent us west. If all went as planned we would make our way to our originally intended destination in LA, and make the decision to stay or go. My small trip had been instantly changed into a grand road trip. The New American Dream. Living life on the open road. Following the wind and going up stream. The new plan was simple. West Texas to say hello to her family, North to Denver to meet new friends, onward to Montana, to see an old friend of mine, west to Seattle to see old friends and make new ones and then down the coast to LA where our destiny awaited.  After several stops for last minute items, we began our journey at 8:45pm. Nearly 12 full hours after beginning preparations, and many, many hours later than intended. So much had changed this first day; only our imaginations could conjure what lay before us on that dark and desolate road. West into the sunset."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,maybe i can be more attentive this time
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"We were trying to make it to Odessa, TX the first night so she could visit family not seen in a while, but we did not make it. Due in part to our late departure and the late night partying, by 11 pm we were both exhausted and ready to rest for the night. We made it from Fort Worth all the way to the big town of Sweetwater. We managed to find a suitable seedy motel for the first night of our adventure. The Longhorn Motor lodge. In the dark, drab West Texas night we had found an oasis of lush green light. The entire motel was rimmed in green florescent lighting. Absolutely a site to behold. As we pulled into the drive all kinds of thoughts flashed thru my head. I saw bits of old movies, and the covers of long forgotten Pulp Fiction novels. I didnt know if the man behind the counter would give me grief or not. I was afraid he might, given that the age difference between the Princess and I. Would he think that this was some late night rendezvous? That we had met in some backwater bar on the highway, and this was the only place we could go? Was I having an affair? Was she? I also had ideas about the man behind the counter, what would he look like? Would he be a skinny old man, who reeked of booze and cigarettes? Or would he be fat man in his forties, who had greasy hands and hair with sweat stain under his arms? I imagined it would be the later. I dont know for sure, but at the time I never gave it any thought that it might be a woman. But true to our fantasies it was a man who was old, fat, and greasy. I dont think he much cared why we were there. I think all he wanted was his money, his form to be filled out correctly, and to go back to his beer, or bed or both. Thru all of this I became more and more excited. The Princess and I had agreed that we would forgo the modern sleek corporate hotels in favor of small roadside motels. The ones that weary travelers might have sought out before the day of the super highways. Before modern conveniences had jaded people. A time before the Internet, a time when super highway meant four lanes and roadside attractions. The glory days of the automobile.  And this is what we had found the first night and without even trying. I could barley wait to get to our room and discover what we had ourselves gotten into. I was not  to be disappointed."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well it would seem i have some new readers. welcome to the corner of my mind, and and welcome to the patio. grab a beer, pick a chair and enjoy your stay.  feel free to leave comments."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i've got alot of things in my mind today, just don't know where or how to start. well for starters i'm more sick (physically, i don't think i'm capable of becoming more sick mentally, but i shouldn't speak so soon, i could always blow a gasket and completly lose my mind) than i have been in quite some time, i even missed a day of work. which is quite a bummer. thursdays are genarlly good happy hours and i make a few more dollars than normal. and well august and september just plain sucked and i need the money. oh well i guess i'll get by like i always do. i've been giving more and more thoughts to going back to work, but damn i sure do enjoy my life right now. the only problem is that me and queenie are on oppisite schedules and hardly get to see each other, and when we do one or the other is often sleeping. we never talk anymore and when we do it's usually me in a drunken stupor attmping to sort my thoughts out thru a haze of whisky and jager. i know it's wrong to initiate such converations drunk, but i'm still very self-conscience and still have a hard time revealing my true emotions. i guess the only redeeming valaue is i know that i want to discuss things, i want to have an open honest relationship, and i don't want to have to hide anything. oh well."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well we are in the fourth day of the war. i'm getting tired of seeing protesting. i can't help but feeling that i should be there. i feel like i missed the last war, and i'm missing this one. alot of my peers are prior military, alot of them saw action in the gulf last time round. i have had several people ask me a question only to say well never mind you were there wern't you? and i have to say no. i am very proud of my military record. i am very proud of where and how i served. but i spent my entire time at home base. many of my counterparts had a involvment in operations, but i never got to go.  most genarations have a war of there time. i have had at least two. but just like the last war with Iraq i'm sitting on the sidelines. i remember when we went to bosnia, i worked 14 hour days preparing equipment fore shipment. i didn't have to, but i wanted to. i also vollenteered to go, but i was not needed. so i got to sit on the sidelines. i got to paint alot of equipment. i got to make stencils, to mark vehicles as part of the peace force. but i wanted to go. i wanted to help. i guess i could be satisfied with the knowledge that i was needed were i was. and that i was an asset to the unit. it makes me laugh, when i was a memeber of the primary deployment team, i couldn't be deployed to the balkins because i was on the primary team and i was needed in case a real war happend. funny huh? oh well..... i guess i 'll go back to watching bombs being dropped on bahgdad"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i'm hung over as hell today, slept till 1:30pm. and now i'm all shakey"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,i was wondering if i should go back to story writing
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"awe hell, i really don't have any thing today.  it's s nice cool day teh sun is shining, birds are singing, and my hangover is waning just a few random thoughts.  local music sucks, local music rocks. i'm a rockstar. i like pop music everybody sucks but me. i live like you want to live, i drink like you want to drink, i fuck like you want to fuck, i fuck the girls you wanna fuck. (with apoligies to eicky) i hate people. i love their money. i love that i can make them do anything that i want. people are stupid.  don't talk to me asshole. fuck you, pay me!"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"so i have begun the long arduous task of going thru my life agin. i do this from time to time. for some reason i tend to go thru the same stuff over and over. today i went through pictures. and i threw alot away. i threw away some from a forgotten trip to the woods. i don't where or when they were taken. so they got thrown out. i have so much paperwork from the military, and i have gone thru it from time to time, and everytime i find more papers that i thought were important at one time but now i find them completley useless and a waste of space. space. this is why i've begun this again. i have run out of space. i lost a room in my house to my bestfriend, now roomate, and i no longer have the space to store the scraps of my life. i'm workign to a point where i can load everything i own into the back of a truck and leave. some day i hope to start over. brand new life, brand new friends. brand new everything. and to do this i have to find the strength to let go of my past. from time to time i hate my past. i made chioces that i'm no longer happy i made.   but i guess you can't run from your past can ya?"

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i have been hearing some small snipits of news that seems encouraging. i don't know what to make of them other than take them for what they are. i heard that some Iraqi prisioners where surprized to find out they were not going to be injected with poisen and killed. apparently they they had been told this be senior iraqi military. a woman and small girl approached us military and asked if the US was really on there side. of course they said yes, the two then returned to where the came.  sidenote. while typing this and writing to others i have noticed that armed conflict and tragady termnioligy have alot of 'i's and 'o's. just a thought."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"ok my dream last night/this morn was pretty weird. it was much like the Paris dream except this time i was supposed to be in Bagdad. allthought it did not look like bagdad, it looked like a old european city, with the exception of everythign being written in ariabic. there was skinny wet streets, and old grey buildings. everywhere i went there where american flags. and hand painted signs welcoming american troops. i remember going into a church, the church was massive, and brilliantly adorned. the odd thing about this church was in the front of the church was a several hundred year old piano. the odd thing was the piano, legs and all, was carved from a solid peice of marble. it was carved very romanesque, and we were told it took along time to get it to resonate like a wood one. then there more narrow streets and rain. for some reason my travling comapions and i had to get to a store onthe other side of town. nobody believed that i knew where i was going, but i proved them wrong when we finally arrived at our destination. from there we had to wind our way back across the city to a party. but i had to go to the hospital because my shoulder was hurting. when i got to see the doctor, he told me my shoulder hurt because i had been drinking and driving, then he told me he called the police to arrest me. i argued that he had no proof that i was drinking, he told me my hurt shoulder was proof enough. then i woke up."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"I just can't get them out. Just all kind of images floating around. Trains, planes and automobiles. Thoughts of Paris streets being cleaned by shop keepers and men in blue uniforms. Ranches and Texas sunsets, hell even sunrises. Images of people dancing, in the streets, in the clubs. Sometimes I drift off and daydream of being a rock star. This intrigues me as well. When I ever I have gotten on stage in recent memory, to say a few words of welcome or thanks, my voice trembles and my mind reels in fear. But I still see my self bathed in light in front of a roaring crowd moving to MY rhythm. Actually I see myself onstage as if I were standing in the crowd. I see how I look and how I move. I love me. teehee I also had thoughts of setting balloons free at the break of dawn. Hell I have so many thoughts and images floating in my head right now I can't even get them straight enough to put them into words. rain, highways, fences, tall grass blowing in the wind. Big trucks on the highway, a big truck driving down a small two lane road in the middle of nowhere West Texas, blowing the tall dry grass growing on the side of the road. They way the mist forms on the roadway in the rain with heavy traffic. Neon lights and thunderstorms. A forgotten radio playing in an empty room. There was a story in a magazine about an old man who owned a warehouse full of motorcycle parts. Buried somewhere in the place was a radio. It had been on the same station, buried under parts for 50 years. That makes me think about an empty room with white walls and a bare wood floor, a small wooden table and chair sits in the corner, near a window. The thin curtains are swirling in the afternoon breeze. On top of the table is a radio, playing songs from a place and time that never existed. A voice telling me about the time and temperature of a place that has never been. The other corner of the room is small bed. White sheets, worn by time. A green wool blanket pulled taught across the frame. A little blue nightstand, holding a book and a lamp. A sad room. The room of a man who has no love in his life. A man who life consists only of work. From sun up to sun down during the week he toils away in some unknown job. But on Sundays, his only day away from the grease or gloom or dirt of labor, he sits at the table. Listens to his radio, and watches out the window. He thinks of time ahead and behind. He thinks of a woman he has never seen. Who plays in the sun. A white dress twirling and floating on her shoulders as she spins and leaps in the grass. Every now and then she'll take a moment from her dance, she'll stop and look towards the window. And she smiles and waves and he smiles back. Cigarette smoke floats around his head, and blows out the window into the empty yard. The girl only in his head, an angel of sorts. The hope and wish of blue eyes looking into his. A soft hand holding his, a warm hug that lingers while he works. And the radio plays on, delivering songs that no one has heard but sound like you have heard them you whole life."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"so hows everybody today? i'm supposed to be going to work, but somehow i don't feel like it. it's supposed to be my day off, but instead i volenteered to assist with the remodel of the bar. but i take respite in knowing that it cannot be done with out me. oh well. i have alot of thoughts in my head, but unfortunatly most of these thoughts happen while driving so not only am i not able to post them, i'm not able to even record them in any way shape or form. oh well i've been wanting to do some painting, but i never sem to make the time. i would'nt even know what to paint really. i have a few ideas, but a blank canvas is much like this blog. i have all these great ideas, but when push come to shove, i go blank. sometimes if i stare att he canvas long enough it tells me what it wants to be. i'm looking forward to redoing the extra bedroom. maybe i can sqeeze my easel and table in a corner somewhere between a book shelf and the computer."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"judging by the UN report this morning it appears that the weapons inspectors believe that Iraq is currently in compliance, but there is still evidence of prohibited activity, and it will take years to complete inspections and for iraq to become fully disarmed and be in compliance......i don't know. i was having a hard time figuring it all out. was Hans Blix saying that more action needed to ba taken or that they need more time......i don't know."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Well, i'm home. 5800 miles and 7 states later i'm home. we decided that she would live with me. we would take things one day at a time and see what happens. who knows for sure. i don't. the trip we left FTW,TX drove to sweetwater,TX. spent the night in some crappy little dive motel with green neon lites surrounding the whole building. beautiful rose and pink tiled bathroom. took some great pics. woke up around 10, and drove into Odessa, Tx. spent the day riding motorcycles after a grat BBQ lunch at the VFW. ended the day eating mexican food and listening to mariachi music at a local eatery. next morning drove to Amarillo, Tx. spent some time wandering around a target and barnes and noble. bought some books and headed onward into the sunset. stopped at Cadillic Ranch and took some photos. drove on into Raton Pass,NM. woke up the next morning and drove into denver. first stop in denver? a record shop to buy the new Bowling for Soup Cd for my gal."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"so i had a weird dream wake me up tonight, the funny part is it not that wierd at all, except the peolpe i was with would not leave me alone long enought to talk buisness. in the dream, i get turned on to a Benigans that will be closing in a few days, the bar is separate from the restuaraunt, and this guy mario tells me about it. says he can get me the space. it sounds perfect. all i got to do is buy paint and likker. but alas i wake up before anything can take place. so in my sleepless state i start thinking of places to rent. i think about at tiny little place(where you could lose your face) that is an old abandoned gas station. it would be just wide eonough for a row of barstools. i could call it ""the Elbow"" i dunno then i start thinking of a clothing store. the i wonder why i even bother. sometimes i feel like i am destined to work for others my whole life. i do my best work when i'm doing it for someone else. i always make sure i can be counted on, and i try real hard not to let people down, but why do i always let myself down....."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"welli figured out what i was doing wrong, seems i was using a template that was out of order. even though i like the previous template, it was a bit pompous and i thinki like this better."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i want a nice house. i watch HGTV constantly along with most current home makeover in a day/weeknd surprize/whileyouwerout/cribcrashed/youdidn't knowiwasgoingtoremakeourliving/bed/bathroom/kitchen. and now i must add monster house to the list. i really don't know why i watch these things but i do. i have from time to time implemented ideas i have seen on these shows into my house, but rarely i have the money or take the time to make the kitchy/crafty things. i want a house with soft blue and grey walls, beige and green. i want a house that looks like a movie. i want to live the ""good life"". but i live in the barrio, and i rent. so i don't want to do anything to the house that i can't take with me or will cost too much. i am also reluctant to put money into a house that i know i will never get back. even if it was my own house, the neighborhood i live in will not bear the level of living i desire. concrete and stone,chrome and stainless steel, dark wood and plush upholstry. the neighborhood would accept the nice oak cabinets that my landlord installed, but not the cherry craftsman style with glass fronts i desire, or do i want maple? i miss my old house terribly. i miss the feeling of the cold slate under my feet in the morning. the cool tile under my hand as i lean on the counter and peer out my window pondering the days upcoming activities. the warm, soft, well worn wood flooring in the living room. the soft green walls and linen curtains. i miss living in a neighborhood that would appreciate the improvements i make to a home. not the neighborhood where gangster wannabes hang out across my street drinking 40's and wishing they were cool. (i wonder if they like Eminem?) i miss living in a respected and desireable neighborhood,instead of the established one i now reside. i may be painting a bleak picture of my surroundings. i live amongst hard working people. people who love their home and do the best they can. many of whom will never know monetary wealth, for whom everyday is a struggle to make a better life for themselves and their children. people like me. who are doing the best they can the best way they know how. good people. however they try the will never get beyond this barrio/barrier. will i? i don't know. i yearn to break free, yet i can't seem to get far enough to even see what it is i'm trying to break away to.  i desire to have the pleasure of home ownership again. for cool stone floors and warm inviting walls. a place to call home."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"yeah i thought i could go a week with out drinking. who the hell was i kidding. i went 2 days. on weds. i went out, and had a bourben and coke. big mistake. i thought i could handle it. and actually i could. i didn't even finish my drink at dinner. but then i went out for drinks, i had two. during the middle of my second i ordered a glsass of water. but afterwards i went home, got my roommate, went out for a few more, then we went home and drank till 5am. i realized i love the way bourbon washes over my mouth, and over my body. it's sweet and bitter just like a woman. i decided that i cannot not drink right now. i love it way too much. i love the bitter sweet flavor, the wetness in my mouth and the warmth on my throat. the shiver down my back and the buzzz in my head. goodnight."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"not much going on these days. just plodding along. i think i may have taken too much time off work this month. it's been weird lately. it seems that every other month is good and every other month is bad. i'lll work for damn near a month starigh, then take some time off, then bamm i'm no longer caught up and then i gotta bust my ass to catch up. i guess one of these days i'll get around to better manging my time and money"

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Dark bars and Dark secrets   out of the mouths of drunk comes the strangest things. i don't know what they are, but hell their talking, and if they are tipping while they talk i'm listening. so last night a small group of six waltz into my place in arlington. two girls and four guys. they are out celebrating the brithday of one of the gents in the group. i only know this because they called proir to arriving to ask if it was ok if they brought a small leashed dog with them. ait turned out i was the only bar they called that would allow a canine companion to accompany them into the bar, so they didn't bring the dog on  their birthday bar crawl. the group turned out to consists of a neighboring bar owner, his wife, one of their bartenders and two of their friends, one of whom was the birthday boy. i know these folks from visiting their bar, and lovely folks i might add. back to the story at hand. the birthday boy was obviously well passed drunk, was having a great time, but could barley speak or stand. being his birthday and knowing he was in good hands, i gave him what i imgine to be his last beer for his birthday.  he was trying to get me to buy him a shot for the special occasion but after realizing just how intoxicated he was i tried to hem-n-haw around while i served others, tried to change the subject and basically avoid buying a shot one, and two having him puke it back up on my bar. so the night goes on and the bartrender girl remembers the last time i was in her bar i was buying everyone i could find a beer or a drink or a shot for those who were willing to do jager with me. i think the bartender was the only one whom i did not buy a shot of jager for because she stated that she did not care for taste. i bought her something else if my memory serves me correctly. this all came about because i had ended up working an unexpected double, made some stupid cash, i was caught up on my bills and i decide i was going to share the wealth. the whole time that batender girl and i were rehashing that lovely day and the enormity of my tab, birthday boy is listening intently and watching as best he could. then out of nowhere and in the middle of someone elses sentence, just as the word jager come out of my mouth, he jumps up, wobbles, points his finger at me and proclaims "" i know you now, your the guy that bought me a shot of jager and told me a funny story"" why yes i did, i bought a lot of drinks that day"". no sooner had this realization hit him, another one hit him and he needed to use the phone. poof. gone. goodbye. it got me to thinking on my way home, yup that's me. the guy who'll buy you a shot of jager and tell you a funny story. what story will i tell? i never know, and neither will you."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Patrick had a rough day at work slinging drinks to all the 7th street drunks. at just after 3:30 he had managed to get them all out of the bar, everything put away for the night and the door locked. he walked over to the 7-11 to grab a hotdog and a pack of smokes. same story ever night. in the short walk from the store to his bike ha had managed to swallow the Bigbite, zip up his jacket and make his way to his bike. a glistening beautiful mix of chrome steel, polished aluminum, greasy black paint and rubber. it didn't look like much but it ran like a demon set free from the bounds of hell. Patrick had spent years slinging drinks all night and day to get this bike running and it was finally done. he swung one leg over the seat and fumbled with the key switch, it stuck from time to time and required a light touch to make it turn. once the ignition was turned on, he reached down and tickled each carburetor to give a little extra gas for starting.  reaching down with his right hand he pulled the kick starting pedal out with a reassuring click letting him know it was firmly locked into place. he picked up his heavy boot from the cool damp pavement below bringing it to rest on the kicker. in one fluid motion he twisted open the throttle and brought his weight to bear on the quiet engine. in the same instant the engine roared to life. while letting the bike gently warm he double checked his gloves and cinched his jacket a little tighter, adjusted his weight on the machine, and slid his glasses down over his eyes. after returning the kicker pedal to its home position, he moved the transmission into 1st gear. while letting the clutch out with one hand he began to accelerate with the other, out into the street and gone into the dark night, the exhaust rising and falling with the shifting of gears, fading into endless black top that was his sweet eternity. The bike sang as it ran down 7th street towards downtown. the air was cool and crisp, the pavement dry and smooth. as Patrick rode he could hear every gear change from the exhaust bouncing off the empty warehouses the lined the street. they would be bustling with activity soon, but for now he stood empty and silent.  he accelerated towards the large monoliths standing vigilant over the central business district. 40mph, 50. Third gear 60, 70, 80 and into fourth with a reassuring clunk, the handle bars went loose in his hands as the bike crested the bridge with the front wheel off the ground. 90, 95, 98, 99, he was willing the bike to go faster and faster, throttle wide open. hunched over the tank to slip as much wind as possible. the bike compressed it's suspension and pushed itself frurther into patricks chest coming off the bridge to the rise in the road to downtown. at top of the rise the magic Ton,100 mph. the world went silent for Patrick. the valves ticking away between his legs, the rush of air through his ears, the exhaust bouncing off the walls of the city. all went silent. the voices in his head stopped as they reeled in horror at the world rushing at them. the voices began to wonder. were the wheel bearings tight? did Patrick tighten that axle nut sufficiently? was there anything in the road to puncture a tire? what about a cop doing his reports, were there any? what about civilians? would some dumb schmuck half asleep, not see that red light? Patrick didn't worry. he knew all was well. every nut tight, every bearing properly lubed. a small grin appeared on his lips knowing that there was nothing between him and downtown but a mile of straight dry road till the next red light. as he crossed Henderson the bike lifted again slightly and he knew it was time to shut down. closing the throttle he sat up and let the wind push his body back, pressing the brake with his left foot and reaching out for the security of the front brake at his right hand. the bike howling and belching resisting the de-acceleration. the excess fuel popping in the hot exhaust as he reached the red light on cherry street. the bike clenched up as it came to a dead stop at the intersection.His heart beat resuming to normal as the tremors of adrenalin washed over his body. and he sat waiting patiently for the green light."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well it's another wednesday. it's raining. i have been working on the house for close to a week. the landlord wants to inspect the property. i know i shouldn't be worried but for some reason i am. it may be a sub-conscience memory of military inspections. where everything had to be perfect. i'm worried that i'm supposed to have an outside dog, and i have an inside dog, because when i put him out, he gets out of the yard. i keep blocking his egress but he finds more. when i lock him in the house, he eats it. the house that is. so far i have replaced everysingle mini-blind int he entire house at least twice, some three or four times. on top of that the carpet is destroyed. my only saving grace was it was in poor condition when i moved in 1 1/2 years ago. my last worry is that i have a roomate i am not supposed to have.  i don't really know why i am worried. when i pay the rent, which i have been only late three times, twice my fault;for which i called everytime, i have paid the rent on time and in cash. i don't know why i am woried. he has been the most accomadating and helpful landlord i have ever had. besides whats he gonna do? give me demerits? make me work weekends? an hour later well everything went fine. he didn't even come past the living room hallway, and was complentary of my work to the hard wood floors. then we stood on the front porch and BS'ed for another 45mins. whew. i don't know why i even woried. the good thing is i made repairs to almost everything my dog has destroyed. and i now have a clean house to live in for the moment. i say moment because i know, if i don't keep on top of things, like i promise everytime i clean the house, that it will become the pigstie the i allow myself to live in."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i didn't mean to make your daughter cry, i apoligize a thousand times......"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"MY HOUSE  so for years i have been trying to imagine what my dream house would be. i have dismissed the expansive masions in part because; i hate cleaning, i'm lazy and don't like walking up or down stairs,elevators no matter the novelty of having one in your home, are slow, and  finally i'm a pakrat. i would just end up being lost in my own home buried under piles of papers, motorcycles and empty whisky bottles. so i have determined i would most likely be the most happy in a small bunaglow, someting in the neighbor hood of 1200 to 1800 Square feet. 3 maybe 4 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms a nice living room and a den. i had den in my house growing up and i miss be able to reast comfartably in the back of the house. i might like to have an office but it's not entirely nessecary. i could convert one of the extra rooms into an office/studio. now comes the important part, i really need two garges. One would be for my daily driving needs. it would be large enough to accomidate two vehicles, a couple of motorcycles and lawn maintence equipment. sure i would love to have the money to pay someone to mow my lawn but this is a dream i want to attain, and right now taking care of the yard myself is resonable. the second garage would be my workshop. my ultimate dream is to have about a 10 car garage. maybe 2000-3000SqFt or more with a lift and a paint booth.  but as much as i would enoy a shop as large or larger than the house i could get by on something smaller. maybe 900-1000 SqFT? it needs to big enough to house several motorcycle projects, a car project and assorted mechical parts. in addition to this it would be large enough to store all related equipment to build, fabricate and maintain the aformentioned projects and vehicles. and while i'm dreaming, i'd like to have a full bath in the shop complete with shower. maybe even a kitchette area. ok lets see if i can take you on a short tour of the property. as you pulled up to the house you would not notice much from the street but a small unassuming structure of dark green surrounded by plants and trees in purple, green and grey with touches of red, blue and yellow sprinkled throughout, seemingly melting into the yard. the yard is small in the front with lots of plantings and an even smaller patch of lush green thin bladed burmudia grass. grass not much different than you might see planted at the entrance of a commerical complex. as you pulled onto the cobblestone drive you'd see the house. the grey/green flagstone walkway flanked by low knee high shrubs inviting you to the front door. walking the path you find little surprises in the shrubs. little square copper and glass lamps to direct to you the door at night, in the daylight would give soft reflection of the plants around them. short squat japanese boxwoods, spiraling yoppaun hollies, fluffy nandinas with their mutli colored leaves in varying hues. all held together by an assortment of wild flowers. you would step up two steps to the porch thru stone colums of limstone stacked to look if you leaned on them too hard it would fall over, marking not only the rise to the door but firmly anchoring the corners of the house to the earth. the porch is inviting and wraps around the house on both sides. a few comfortble furnishings are arranged in a small sitting area to the left. covered in cloth matching the lushness of the lawn. arriving at the massive wood door you can almost see into the house by looking in the floor to ceiling  foot wide windows on either side, if they were not draped in light pleated chaffon cutains. you grasp the heavy door by an equally impressive silver handle, contrasting with the rich darkwood, a handle that lets you know what you are about to open is special, something to cherish. if the door is locked, just look in one of the potted plants blurring the distinction between house, porch and lawn. walking in and closing the door behind you you admire the way the door closes with authority. giving you peice of mind, and letting you know you are safe from the world. you are home. what do you want to see next? you need to use the restroom? or are you thirsty by chance? can i get you someting to drink? eat? tell you what. you go bathroom while i grab us a couple of drinks, it just down the hall there, you can't miss it."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,just wanted to drop in and say hi
TA0Q1LV,male,34,i don't have anything to write today. that's not true. i have plenty i  could  write about but i just flat out don't want to.
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"as he entered the dark garage he confidently walked to his bike, zipping up his jacket and putting on his gloves. he swung one leg over the seat and fumbled with the key switch, it stuck from time to time and required a light touch to make it turn. once the ignition was turned on, he reached down and tickled each carburator to give a little extra gas for starting.  reaching down with his right hand he pulled the kick starting pedal out with a reassuring click letting him know it was firmly locked into place. he picked up his heavy boot from the cool damp pavement below bringing it to rest on the kicker. in one fluid motion he twisted open the throttle and brought his weight to bear on the quiet engine. in the same instant the engine roared to life. while letting the bike gently warm he double checked his gloves and cinched his jacket a little tighter, adjusted his wieght on the machine, and slid his dark glasses down over his eyes. after returning the kicker pedal to its home postion, he moved the transmission into 1st gear. while letting the clutch out with one hand he began to accelerate with the other, out of the garage into the street and gone into the bright sunshine, the exhaust rising and falling with the shifting of gears, fading into the day."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Reluctantly crouched at the starting line, Engines pumping and thumping in time. The green light flashes, the flags goes up, Churning and burning, they yern for the cup.  They deftly manouver and muscle for rank, Fuel burning fast on an empty tank, Wreckless and wild they pour thru the turns, Their prowless is podent and secretly stern.  As they speed thru the finish the flags go down. The fans get up, and get out of town. The arena is empty except for one man, Still driving and striving as fast as he can  The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, And long ago somebody left with the cup, But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns, And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.  He's going the distance. He's going for speed. She's all alone, all alone in her time of need.  Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse. He's going the distance.  Yeah!  No trophy, no flowers, no flash bulbs, no wine. He's haunted by something he cannot define. Bowel shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse, Assail him, impale him with monster truck force. In his mind he's still driving, still making the grade. She's hoping time that her memories will fade, Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse.  The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, And long ago somebody left with the cup. But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns, And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well crap i can't believe i have to get over it again. i thought i had suffiectly braced and reinforced my fragile heart. the image i have in my head is of a bloddy heart laying on a table or maybe hung on a wall, wrapped in metal strapping tape, wire and screws, all held up by a couple of 2 by 4's. the ends of the boards covered in blood, the sheen of the cold galvinized industrial metal glistening with coagulating life. strong and unyeilding. but in one fell swoop it was all ripped off, and thrown to the floor with our clothes. i don't know if that was the intended purpose or not. but i suddenely feel naked and vunerable and confused. of course mybe i brought this all upon myself. hopefully i can get passed this and move on. maybe i reading too much into this. maybe it was just sex. maybe it doesn't mean anything."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"To Pink, i don't think that i'm not real, and i have a pretty good idea you are real, however i was drunk for so many days when we met in person, who knows, i guess we could have had a mutaul hallucination, but that is a debate for another day. however the point i think i was trying to get at was just how long ago things seem. i have incredibly vivid dreams, and there have been times i wondered ""did that really happen? or was i dreaming?"" so i think in the meloncholly mood i wrote that in i was just thinking, man that was soo long ago, sometimes days seem like years and years seem like days."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Its just you and me kid............... well last night was a complete bust, not one single solitary person showed up for the party last night. i am getting tired of hearing promises of coming to one of my parties and then getting no shows. two people called and said they would try,one had car troubles and the other was working, but they were called back and told not to bother that no one else had shown up yet. well i decided last night that i am not nearly as cool as i thought i was, and that this is the end. From here on out no more parties, no more Patio Kings. this i say with a heavy heart. simply because i enjoyed it sooo much. but since my bike is down, and has been for nearly a year now, i get called less and less for outings. and with summer quickly approaching i know that the infrequent call will get more and more infrequent. but ya know? fuck'em!!! i don't need them. if they were as good of freinds as they thought they were, they would not have stopped calling. last weekend i even tried to get involved a little bit, i asked the guy with the extra bike if i could borrow it to go riding with everyone. did they call, NO. did they go riding? YES. so i say again FUCK THEM. if this continues i may have to start taking medication again, and well i can't afford it. so i'll prolly end up self medicating again. Jager,Beam and Beer. it worked for awhile, but it never works for the long haul. last time i self medicated i lost a wife, a girlfriend and damn near lost my life and liberty. but i guess it doesn't really matter. for along time now i have always been the one guy who could be counted on. but here as of late, it seems people are only my friend when they need something. it just makes me remember when i figured out no one in this life would help me but me. last time i tried to start my own buisness i got alot of excuses from those who offered help. my own family even didn't believe in me enough to help. ya know, fuck everybody. i made it pretty damn far by-myself and i'll continue to make my own way by MYSELF. i'll make my own rules and play the game the way i see fit. and if anybody want to come along, the can go to hell, they should have been there when i needed it. i wonder if any of this has to do with not having many friends in school. at one time i thought that part of my life was over. seems i should have taken that as a clue to how my life would be......""is life always this hard or is it just when your a kid? always like this."""
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well. i went out last night and got stupid drunk. i have been doing this more and more often. i think i need to scale it back some. i think i am hurting others and i have more to think of than myself. i am embarressed of my actions last night. i did nothing terrible wrong mind you. i just didn't do anything right either. i chose to saty out, and in doing so i put myself in a postion to not be able to drive. thankfully i had some people around that did not let me drive."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"""Somebody at one of these places asked me: ""What do you do? How do you write, create?"" You don't, I told them. You don't try.

TA0Q1LV,male,34,i realized that i have nuthing important to say today. i just wanted to take up some band width.
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i've been wondering for the last few days why something so damn small as a flea, can cause such high levels of itching and burning. you'd think something so small might not even be any cause for any atttention at all. but damn flea bites are annoying. stupid fleas."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"5800 hundred miles to go, I want to be sedated... August 16th, 9:14am Saturday morning, the alarm blaring in my ear telling me it was time to get going. We woke up late and had a lot to do today. But, coffee first. Then find my smokes. Move slowly to the kitchen, and make coffee. Ah, sweet, sweet coffee, the stuff that fills your lungs with aroma, your mouth with flavor, and you body with warmth. We had to be in town by noon for lunch. High noon. The exact opposite of the midnight witching hour, the time of the day that all is supposed to be clear, though highlighted by the deep shadows cut by the sun straight above. And things were very clear today.          Even though The Princess had begun packing I had not even started. I didnt have as much to pack as she had. She was moving across the country to begin her new life, I merely the vehicle that would get her there. I was to be on the road for a week, return to gather my belongings and begin my new journey to join her. I didnt know how long she would be out there, but she knew enough to realize that what she didnt take would be gone forever. Im sure if we had finished packing the night before we wouldnt feel so rushed, but we both wanted one more night out on the town before departing. One more night to remember. And that we did, we partied like rock stars. This spontaneous change would set the tone for the entire trip, as well as be the cause for our late departure.          After I had my coffee and morning smoke I began to pack my bag. A few t-shirts, under shirts, some socks and a pair of jeans. I also packed my cowboy boots. I find it interesting that in normal day to day I dont often wear them, but for some reason, as soon as I cross the state line they go on my feet and stay there till I get home. I would also be flying home and well they are just plain easy. No steel toes to worry airport security, and they are easy to get on and off to be checked for prohibited items. So I had all I needed to last me a week on the road.         The Road. This journey was to be a short one for me. She and I would simply drive her truck to California, where I would then get on a plane out of LA. Short and sweet journey. Planned destination. At least that was the plan till we had lunch with her father. Pops pulled me aside and told me of the dreams and aspirations he had for his daughter, and living in California was not one of them. He suggested that we make a vacation out of it, see some of the country and take time on the road to fully realize the opportunities a that were available to us. At this time I had no job to return to and no real reason for staying in Fort Worth. I knew that following love was a dangerous decision, but I also knew that if I let it go, I would always wonder what would have become of us. So I took her fathers money and advice. I put the money in my pocket and finished loading the truck.           After loading the truck our decision to head east or west was made by the toss of a coin. Best two out a three sent us west. If all went as planned we would make our way to our originally intended destination in LA, and make the decision to stay or go. My small trip had been instantly changed into a grand road trip. The New American Dream. Living life on the open road. Following the wind and going up stream.          The new plan was simple. West Texas to say hello to her family, North to Denver to meet new friends, onward to Montana, to see an old friend of mine, west to Seattle to see old friends and make new ones and then down the coast to LA where our destiny awaited.  After several stops for last minute items, we began our journey at 8:45pm. Nearly 12 full hours after beginning preparations, and many, many hours later than intended. So much had changed this first day; only our imaginations could conjure what lay before us on that dark and desolate road. West into the sunset.          We were trying to make it to Odessa, TX the first night so she could visit family not seen in a while, but we did not make it. Due in part to our late departure and the late night partying, by 11 pm we were both exhausted and ready to rest for the night. We made it from Fort Worth all the way to the big town of Sweetwater. We managed to find a suitable seedy motel for the first night of our adventure, the Longhorn Motor lodge. In the dark, drab West Texas night we had found an oasis of lush green light. The entire motel was rimmed in green florescent lighting. Absolutely a site to behold. As we pulled into the drive all kinds of thoughts flashed thru my head. I saw bits of old movies, and the covers of long forgotten Pulp Fiction novels. I didnt know if the man behind the counter would give me grief or not. I was afraid he might, given that the age difference between the Princess and I. Would he think that this was some late night rendezvous? That we had met in some backwater bar on the highway, and this was the only place we could go? Was I having an affair? Was she? I also had ideas about the man behind the counter, what would he look like? Would he be a skinny old man, who reeked of booze and cigarettes? Or would he be fat man in his forties, who had greasy hands and hair with sweat stain under his arms? I imagined it would be the later. I dont know for sure, but at the time I never gave it any thought that it might be a woman. But true to our fantasies it was a man who was old, fat, and greasy. I dont think he much cared why we were there. I think all he wanted was his money, his form to be filled out correctly, and to go back to his beer, or bed or both. Thru all of this I became more and more excited. The Princess and I had agreed that we would forgo the modern sleek corporate hotels in favor of small roadside motels. The ones that weary travelers might have sought out before the day of the super highways. Before modern conveniences had jaded people. A time before the Internet, a time when super highway meant four lanes and roadside attractions. The glory days of the automobile. And this is what we had found the first night and without even trying. I could barley wait to get to our room and discover what we had ourselves gotten into. I was not to be disappointed.          The room was small and well worn, the freshly made bed, was drooping from untold years of sleep, sex and what not. The carpet was trampled, mashed and worn. The curtains thick, and the lights bright. But the bathroom, the bathroom was absolutely beautiful. It was rose and pink tiles from floor to ceiling. It looked as though it was built in 1940, and it the door left closed till I opened it. Not one bit of wear was found. Then i found the note laying on the desk. ""Please do not use hotel towels to clean mud, grease, oil, heavey makeup or blood. There are ""rags"" under the sink in the bathroom for such activites. If you need more than provided please contact the office."" BLOOD!! holy shit, what have i gotten ourselves into?  While I fumbled with luggage, the TV and my cameras, the young woman had begun preparing herself for the upcoming adventures. I looked thru the tiny door opening from the bed, and there she stood. She was wearing a mans white undershirt, her breasts pushing at the seams. She wore tiny, well-worn cutoff jean shorts that accentuated her lovely hips and ass. If you looked closely you could see her ass thru the fringe. She was beautiful. Her black raven hair, pulled back tight out of her face, was in sharp contrast to the pink-rose tiles. She was slightly bent over, one leg in the sink, slowly and carefully shaving her legs. I grabbed my camera to capture this moment forever and to let a select few share a few minutes of my life with the princess. After taken a few pictures I lay in bed, and just watched. Soon she was done with her royal primping and came to join me on the bed. She soon peeled out of her tight clothes, crawled under the covers with me and we both drifted off to sleep. She fell asleep a few moments before me and gave me time to ponder what had become and what was to be.          This was the end of the first day of so many more to come. We had finally broken the bonds of home. Even though we had not made it far distance wise, we had succeeded in covering an enormous distance emotionally. For the very first time since we had met, there was no one else. Tonight we lived and died with, by and for each other."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"i'm really bummed that i didn't get to Dj last night. not only did i go and buy a new CD player for last night, i had a great theme i my head. i was gonna try and do the whole night of bad women, or just songs about women in general. i was figuring on doing alot of country, oh well i guess i'll save it for another time. i just hope i'm in the mood when the next night comes around."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"grrrrr, everything is loading sooooo slow. damn i want a faster connection, today everything is moving slow, i want to be able to zing in and out of websites with reckless abandon, instead i have to sit and wait, much like the people in ads for broadband."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well tonight i have a date with my sweetie. but as usaul i may be trying to sabotage myself. it seems i have developed a bit of chest congestion. aside from that i have no idea what to do. if this was a date with a stranger i would suggest going to the bar and having a few drinks. however the place i would suggest is a place that is frequented by both my sweetie and myself on a regular basis. and i would imagine it might be no different than any other  night of just hanging out. i would like to have a creative nice eveing, but all i want to do right now is take a nap.  on a side note, makes me think of something. the difference between hanging out and a date. what exactly is the difference? you wanna go out? ok. is that a date or just hanging out?"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"well i'm gonna try this again, we will see what happens.  BTW, Hi Queenie."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Patrick sat in his car outside her house, as he sat there, the clouds that been building all night begun to shed their rain on the earth. It began slowing building to a steady rhythm as he sat and stared out the windshield, wondering why he felt the way he did. He played with his zippo still warm from lighting his cigarette. As he exhaled, the smoke wrapped around him, and then drifted out of the window into the night.  Patrick was confused; he didnt know what to feel. He wished that all this pain he was feeling would be washed away in the rain, or carried off into the night with the smoke. Where the pain was coming from was as big a mystery as was why he was sitting in front of her house wanting to leave. She was inside waiting for him to come to bed, a situation any man would jump at the chance to have. But still, here he was trying to figure it out. Trying to find something in his head that would explain how he felt. He was scared, he was happy. He was scared, cuz he didnt know what was next. He was happy, cause it came from deep in side him, whenever she looked at him, whenever she touched him. When they kissed, waves of energy would wash over him, it was warm, and it almost tickled. Hed grin uncontrollably every time they kissed.  Still he kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, shed say, with a look in her eye, I need to tell you something. And it would be nothing, yet every time he heard that his heart sank. He knew some day it would come, and crush him. So he sat in his car, in the rain, waiting for something to happen. He not once ever reached for his keys to start the car. Maybe he was waiting for her to come running after him, maybe he was waiting for the hand of god to reach down from the heavens and poke him in the chest, and tell him to do something with his life. He didnt know, so he sat in his car and smoked his cigarettes.  After a while, he got up, and went back inside, and walked to her bedroom. There, curled up with a blanket, she lay. So quiet, so peaceful. Did she know how he felt? Did she feel the same way? He looked at her in the pale light of her room, and she looked up at him and smiled. So he took off his shoes, laid his clothes on the floor beside hers, and slide into her bed. Taking her in his arms, he decided that right now, tonight, this is all that mattered at this moment in time. His head raced momentarily, then stopped. He closed his eyes, squeezed his girl in his arms and drifted off to sleep.                  Patrick woke up early, but still lay in bed, his arms wrapped tightly around his girl. The moment quickly slipping by. Soon her alarm clock would go off and she would be gone. He layed there awhile in her bed after she left. He could still feel the warmth of the bed where she lay. He could still smell her on his skin and taste her on his lips. Her kiss lingering like warm shot of bourbon, sweet and full of aroma. When the bed began to cool, and he knew she was gone, he pulled his tired body from the bed, put on his crumpled clothes, gathered his things and went back out to his car. His car was much like him, but it wasn't even his car. It was a friends that he was driving while he fixed his old bike, but it suited him well. A little worn around the edges but still completely road worthy. It had a certain style that was hard to describe, but it did have style. As he started the car, he lit a cigarette, tuned in his favorite radio station, and then roared off down the road. His cigarette smoke mingling with the exhaust and blowing down the road on the melody of the radio."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"just a real quick post today. i was washing my hands and noticing that my feet hurt. since i have started working  in the bar biz i have noticed that i don't really get much time off. i was thinking it would be nice to go to the beach walk around in the sand and put my feet in the ocean. now for me this is pretty odd. when i was a child you couldn't get me outa of the water, but the older i get the less and less time i spend being submerged. now i have heard the phrase before from other people that they need to go put their feet in the ocean and get grounded. i for one have never felt this way. but for some reason this morning that thought went thru my head, and for the life of me i can't seem to know why i would say such a thing. it's sucha  suz thing to say. hmmmmm, however i do remember i enjoyed going to myrtle beach and walking around inthe sand all day. when i got home all my calloses would be gone and my feet felt renewed and rejunvinated, but when i went to cabo, even though i felt rejuvinated as a whole my feet still were my same old feet. i'll think of this today and see what i come up with."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"he drove into the west Texas sunset. she sat next to him in the truck. it was late July. hot, sticky and just plain grueling. the old truck had no A/C and with the chopped top the windows only hinted at the breeze blowing past the windows at 70 miles an hour. the truck rocked and creaked as the open header pipes bellowed  their arrival on the road to points unknown. where were they going? she didn't know and neither did he. he knew that where ever it was it wasn't where they'd been the night before. before the fight. before the whiskey. before it all went terribly wrong. Patrick had the day off. a rarity these days. he was trying like mad to pay his bills and rebuild his broken bike. it had broken a long time ago and the stream of broken hearts and broken whiskey bottles had left him in debt and with out his beloved chopper. he sat in his home watching TV occasionally staring out the window to the garage. the padlock was beginning to shown signs of weather, and the leaves were piling against the door from un-use. he decide he needed a drink. not just any drink would do. it had to be a good one. not one could make himself. but one that was made just for him. a drink that would take his breath away and absolve him of all his fears. so he combed back his greasy hair, dusted of his cowboy boots and headed out the door to find his solace in the bottom of a glass.  when he got to the bar it was just the way he wanted. loud, dirty, ugly punk rock made it's way from the stage and filtered through the patrons souls and out in the night. the doorman gave him a handshake and smile and let him on thru. he went straight to the bar and waited for the magic elixirs to be handed him in the grim dark light and swirling noise. that was when he noticed her. she was standing next to the jukebox as if she knew, and purposely stood there to bath in her personal spotlight. her black hair rolled and cascaded off her shoulders. her eyes sparkled. her lips followed the words to the music. or so he thought. but instead of watching the band,she turned to him and smiled with a come hither grin and Patrick knew this girl was going to be the death of him. he could see death in her eyes and lust on her mind. they both stood for a moment and just stared at each other. then she turned back around to dance and sing along to the band. Patrick ordered up a second drink and strode over to say hello. when the band was over he asked her name and they began talking. suddenly there were no others in the bar, and the music fell off into background noise. the once blaring jukebox was no longer filler between bands, it became the soundtrack to lust and sin. she told him things he wanted to hear but was afraid to ask. she whispered in his ears things that took his breath away and made his skin fit funny. she turned and nodded towards the dark corner behind the stage. the band was unloading their gear and they would just be another couple in the mass and disappear for a moment. she reached out and took his hand and his breath away. she led him to the dark corner. her eyes glowing in the shadows. she pulled him close to her, brushed her cheek against his as she drew back for a kiss. her lips met his and the world stopped. the music stopped. his heart stopped. then it raced out of control as it came back to life. her lips were soft and inviting. she tasted of bourbon and cigarettes. her hands pulled him closer to her and comforted his broken heart. that was when it happened.  Patrick didn't realize it when it happened. it was just a dulled thud on the back of his head. but he'd work in bars for so long he knew the sound of glass breaking over a skull. his knees buckled slightly. he wasn't sure where the slight dizziness was coming from. the long remorseless kiss he had just been given or the bottle broken over his head. he spun around to find a young man puzzled as to why he was still standing. he heard her call out to the man who'd hit him, asking why he couldn't leave her alone, why he wouldn't let go. why he'd would not let her get on with her life. the first punch brought Patrick back to reality and he responded in kind. the mans eyes rolled but he stood his ground. the second punch caught Patrick in the shoulder, third was deflected. Patrick's second hit connected right below the mans left eye, his cheek split and spilled blood as he fell to the floor. in the few seconds that it took, the entire bar staff was rushing towards him. he spun around grabbed the girl, and ran thru the guitars and amps spilling on the floor from the scuffle out the back door and to the truck. he never asked if she wanted to go with him. he just took her along. he was just as scared as she was. did he have friends, was someone hot on his heels in pursuit? he never looked back. he just ran to his truck, threw her in, fired the old beast up and rocketed out of the parking lot and out into the streets. after leaving the club she never said a word. she just held on to Patrick's hand as they ran. once in the truck she just sat there, looking at Patrick, looking at the blood on her hands, looking out the window.  he didn't know where to go, so he went home. she cleaned the broken glass from his hair and washed the blood from his face and hands. they didn't speak much, they didn't have to speak. there was not much to say. there was not much that wasn't being said in a glance, a nod or a touch of the hand. they slowly undressed. Patrick was beginning to get sore as his adrenaline soaked muscles relaxed. they laid down together, they embraced, and kissed as they drifted off to sleep. the next morning over coffee and cigarettes she told him her life. of how she knew that if she didn't leave then she would never be able to relax. he would always be there, he would always find her. Patrick didn't really have that much worth staying for himself. his debt would never be paid off and he needed a reason to leave as well. to start fresh. so it was decided, they would start out together. he packed a few clothes, put his tools and broken bike in the back of his truck. left a note for his land lord to sell what he could and throw the rest away. he asked if she needed anything, she replied no. there was no place to go and all she needed was already in the truck. if anything else came up, they'd find it on the road."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"what a weekend. live music, Hot Rods, bikes, and a ton of rain. i'm hurting like hell today. i've got bruises all over my body, a black eye, and huge gash across my nose. i was told that i fell down more than i was standing. fun stuff. this may be the incentive i need to stop drinking. i don't know if can do it or not. i know i can go a shift at the T, with out drinking, i can work with out drinking. i but i don't know if i can go out without drinking.  oh well. i didn't go to jail."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Well here's  pic of my computer. last week sometime i saw 'One Hour Photo'. first off i'd like to say, creepy. secondly the character that robin williams plays make a statement, i think in voiceover, that people only take picstures of things they want to remember. nobody takes pics of everyday things or bad things only happy things. more people should take pictures of everyday life. i have also begiun to read 'reverse cowgirl' who more often than not has picutes of mudane things on her site. so with that in mind, and armed with a digital camara, i have begun to take more documertary pics of my life. some will be posted here, some will be posted elsewhere."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"Sex , lies and  horny drunks             So a customer at the bar made an interesting observation in his drunken stupor after the conversation at the bar turned to sex and masturbation. Another drunk was making the argument that it's ok and that both men and women do it to ""take care of business "" the observation was that if all the horny men and women are going home alone and masturbating because they are horny, wouldn't the world be a better place if everybody got together and made the masturbation issue a non-issue.  It got me to thinking, yup there are a lot of horny folks going home alone at the end of the night. But I guess not all of the right people are not in all of the right places at the same time. Of course this brings up the topic of causal sex and that I believe is a topic for another day. Of course as I have mentioned before there are a lot of ugly or not so attractive folks out there and for some ingrained reason most horny folks have a higher standard for the folks they want to have sex with than they have for themselves. I know most people do there best to look their best when they go out on the town, or maybe not. Maybe the horny folks have resigned themselves to be lonely and don't make an effort to get all dressed up when they go out for a beer or a show.  What scares me the most are the guy and gals who obviously look like the put some time and effort into their appearance and still manage to miss the mark arbitrarily set by society. I remember one time at the bar, kicking back and having a beer or three, a young woman walked thru the door. This girl was the poster girl for a white trash whore. She was wearing a skirt that was too short, tattered and worn, not to mention about 10 years out of style. (do short skirts really go out of style?) ugly cheap shoes that should have been sent to the trash bin years ago, black torn fishnets and a shirt that was way too tight. Bright red lipstick and cake hair from the late 80's. Her whole outfit screamed I'm looking to have sex with the band, the whole band and nothing but the band. But when I noticed what she was carrying I almost fell out of my chair giggling. A bag of Doritoes. I turned and looked at one of my friends and in the straightest face I could muster, I said, ""she's all that and a bag of chips."" we laughed about that thru most of the night. And the young girl oblivious to our amusement stood dutifully at the edge of the stage and stared mournfully at each band that played. And I digress.         So horny people? Put on your best clothes, wash your hair, brush your teeth, ask a friend how you look, then go out at give it a go at not going home alone or at least getting a number for later.  Now I'm not saying that everybody in the club is single and horny, but you never know, that pretty young thing that you've been looking at all night, might be just like you. Looking for love in all the wrong places."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"the maker of magic,  the birth place of freedom. today i am pondering the corrulation between a countries military might and coffee. After the first war with Iraq i heard many stories of soldiers not wanting to take prisoners due to lack of coffee.Us soldiers did not want to give there coffee to the Iraqi POWS. which would lead me to believe that Iraq did not have any coffee to provide their troops with. so this i give you to ponder. Had the iraqis had good coffee, would the drive to Baghdad have been so short? Would Naploeans troops been able to withstand the hard russian winter that fatefull year had they had good coffee? not just any coffee, but real good, to die for Coffee?(pun intended)"
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"all the things you had to say are now the things you take away empty beds and lonely dreams lonely nights and hollow screams misunderstanding miscommunication separation i misunderstood your communication i thought things were resolved, demarcation you tell me not to let go as you run away, slow miscommunication yelling screaming talking holding caressing moaning a first kiss and a last embrace shining eyes and broken hearts faces with smiles now just miles of separation hold me now touch me now too close now too tight now time to go now"

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"more from the road   She and Patrick arrived in the driving rain. the wipers could not keep up as the rain poured from the heavens in large sheets. water was coming in everywhere into the old truck. from around the doors and through the windshield seal, running in ribbons down the inside of the glass dripping off of the dash only to pool on the rusty floor then finding its way to holes and back out on to the road. out of the rain storm they saw an oasis of light, a shining neon beacon of safty in the night. they pulled in the parking lot and parked, looked at each other and ducked out into the rain. they came out of the rain into the motel office. a man shuffled out from a back room, lit on by the light of a television. he was short, squat and balding. his once white undershirt now grey and stained from years of washing his own clothes and spilling his food while he ate. he wasn't there to make money, he was there because there was no where else to go in this town. he had worked for the motel since he graduated high school, just for the summer, but he never made it away. now years later he was not just the night shift manager, but he was the manager, and maintenance man. the exposed skin spilling from his shirt had a greasy sheen that matched his greasy hair, what little was left. he didn't speak to the them when they approached the counter, he just stood there with a blank expression, waiting for the ritual to continue so that he might get back to more important things. like watching sports and drinking his last beer for the night. Patrick asked for a room and the man flatly replied, 35 dollars while sliding a check-in card towards them. Patrick filled out a the card while the man fumbled to find a key and then handed him the money. almost as an afterthought the man gestured over Patrick and the girl's shoulders and grunted, second building on the left, check out is at 12."
TA0Q1LV,male,34,nuthing to say today
TA0Q1LV,male,34,"OK, so i had another wierd dream last night. this time i rented a truck, a big flat bed truck, which is not all that wierd in it self, but was weird is that it looked like a regular truck, but the sleeper compartment was the size of a small mobile home, but it was like a maze almost. for some reason we parked it on a college parking lot. when we came back the next day, it was like a party had taken place , there were cans and bottles everywhere, and lots of trash. it looked like some one tried to steal the whirlpool tub. yeah weird i know, what's a whirlpool tub doing in a truck! there was also some sort of kids party, at like a game center or something, and there was a game where i could drive a big truck, but all the kids wanted to play it and i scolded by parents for hogging the game. but there was another party going on in the building, but it was in the back somewhere, and i had to go thru a maze to get to it. then driving home there was wreck on the freeway and we couldn't get on were we wanted so we had to navigate the myriad of roazds and ramps in dallas traffic to get where we were going. there was alot of ""mazes"" to navigate last night. just plain weird. there was lots of bright colors too"
