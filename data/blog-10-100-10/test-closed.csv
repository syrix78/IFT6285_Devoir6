G04W97J,female,34,"How did that happen…? I show up to this seminar and the whole thing was like a scattered deck of cards! Lots of shuffling and reshuffling going on.  Scene work shifting.  I no longer have to get “intimate” with my scene partner! YAAAAAAAAA! That was bugging me.  I wasn’t sure what was the worst part of that since I’d see my partner’s gf at work and she seemed noticeably uncomfortable.  Lots of odd things around them and their discomfort, it was just screwed all the way around.  Then SK was just overseeing everything while one guy headed off DOM and another for the Shakes work.  And the guy teaching the DOM work told me, (once SK took off), to not bother with the whole piece, to cut it short, so I wouldn’t have to get physical with my partner, YAY.  It wouldn’t have been a big deal without all the other odd factors about it.  Not to mention the text was weird - My character is supposedly so noble as a duchess that no one can approach her, so as a widow she’s alone.  So, she decides to approach her man-servant to marry her.  All the words were about how great she is and now that she’s accepting him as her husband, he can now feel free to say what he likes & blah blah blah.    So, I am only doing a 1/3rd of that now! And since I am done with my shakes monologue, that guy instructor gave me another monologue to do, so I’ll be starting the opening of the performance as well.  Now I have 4 pieces but it’s better!  Though still not excited about… Sonnet No. NINETY-ONE.   *     *     *    *     I love my friends.  I am really lucky that I have good choice people in my life.  Went out with D last night.  Before we went out we talked and planned it and I suggested this one place and she said uh, there aren’t older men there? I said what do you mean? She said you know… (‘cause it was a nice place) like those 50 year old men smoking cigars.  I said maybe a couple but they should keep to themselves.  She said good, the last thing I want is to worry about old men trying to hit on me.  I said no kidding, maybe I could look at a 50 year old man when I’m 50.  She said not me! When I’m 50 I’ll be looking at 30 y.o.’s  WHEW. I wanted to jump through the phone receiver and give her a hug. She is one of a few friends I have who can relate to where I am coming from.  Granted, it ISN’T exactly common.  Though I’ve always had younger men.  Even back over a decade ago, being with someone just 3 years younger was enormous to people and I got a lot of shit for it.  She’s a year younger than me and her husband is about 8 years younger than she is! So I asked her how she deals with the heat.  I am pretty sure they met when he was 21 and she 29 or something like that.  She said at first it was hard for her.  Then, her best friend’s mom told her you have to be true to whatever your life is, because that is what will make you happy.  So she backed it up.  And when people try to opinionate over her, she says you WISH you had someone younger, it’s better.   I was laughing so hard because it’s rare I can talk about that with someone I know.  It’s just not common.  I almost wondered for a moment…is this similar to how gay people felt/feel? Like they’d get so much shit from people because it’s not what everyone sees as normal (or, at least the way it used to be)?  All I know is that I am NOT attracted to older men at all.  My age is good if workable, and I get along better with younger men, I just do.  So that’s that.  I am not even going to think about dating older men anymore ‘cause it is not for me."

Coming under the influences of Pisces, water and religion or spiritual matters are likely to have an untold influence on you.   Pisces means or symbolizes what is naturally, or by its very nature, representative of influences of the higher soul or higher spiritual level.  Hence those things of the spiritual nature should preferably be the way in which your judgments are drawn, as to whether this or that activity should be your impelling influence.  Not that you should become lost in motives or in influences impelling your actions: just use those things of the spiritual import as the measuring rod of your activities and experiences.   In light of this, T, the period around the birth and ministry of Jesus, the Christ, is the clearest past life for you to recall and build upon in the present.  You may even remember a lifetime as part of Roman culture, where priority was placed upon position in society and in the military."

And sweet as heck!  *****   PROGRESS REPORT   Name:  bully  Grade:  NTI (needs to improve)  Comment:  the bully mentioned in my entry 2 weeks ago is in my Shakes seminar.  I am convinced he was ON something when he was harrassing me and others 2 weeks ago, for GODS sake I don't even know him and he tried to forcibly keep me from closing my car door! freeeek.   He avoided coming into the group until the very last minute.  And, during the whole 4-hour seminar he kept his eyes mostly on the floor, he kept quiet.  I had decided if he was at all beligerant toward me at this seminar I'd reduce him however I saw fit, hopefully nothing will come to that.  He did look a bit ashamed, but when I left I turned around to say bye to someone and I saw him staring at me with the weirdest, grossest smile.  Of course, I might be biased.  He may now look GROSS through my eyes after what he'd managed to accomplish in his first impression just 2 weeks back.  I'd rather he not be in that course, but like with everything else in life, I will deal.  My weakness.  CHOCOLATE.  It's under control, but I can't seem to get over it! I eat like 1 or 2 chocolate bars a week.  A small vice at a small price. My newest choco bar is  DAGOBA -organic chocolate (I wrote 'chololate'... Is that like a Mexican coffee dessert?)  It says on the wrapper mint~rosemary ... rustic grown organic dark chocolate infused with mint and a hint of rosemary essence.  Cacao content: 59% Theobroma - food of the gods Dagoba - temple of the gods Chocolate is sacred. There is an art to the alchemy of flavor infusion, as art we explore with mystery and integrity.

AXNX7FB,male,44,"By the end of next week we hope to have a Recovery House up and running for women.  The program is the same, just a seperate location.  It has been more than a year since we first identified the location as a possible site for women, but it has taken a year to get things together.      Credit must be given to Jim Georgias, who has been steadfastly distributing applications and keeping the volume of the aide in his big hairy ears, turned up for conversations of women in need.   The house is not as large as the house at 1016, so we are going to avail the common areas of 1016 to the women 24/7.  That includes the downstairs, kitchen bath and laundry.  For the most part, men in the program will be discouraged from hanging out at the women's house, but women will be encouraged to come over and enjoy the men's space.        Call me sexist, but I think women are entitled to a bit more privacy and security than men, and I do not want any man to even be accused of lurking around the gals' pad.   It is just a prudent thing for the men to pretty much stay away, and for the women to stay off of the second floor of 1016 where the men have bedrooms.  Accordingly, the first floor bath will be designated as a guest bathroom.  Obviously we are not going to tell any woman that she cannot use the second floor bath, but then we are not going to expect the guys to keep it up to the same standard.  So start getting used to treating the downstairs like it is the womens, and try not to mess it up.    The other essential ingredient in all of this has been to identify the first gorup of women to go in the house.  More so than the men, I am concerned about the dynamics between the women and that we start the place with ones who can get along and establish a house ""culture"" that is supportive of women who have been struggling through recovery while lacking any real recovery support in their home life.   Truthfully, much of the support will come from 1016, but these women especially need to experience that support first within their own home and with women, and secondarily from men who will treat them as sisters, rather than as 13th step targets, with bullseyes on their bottoms.    Like the men, the woman can know that they will be blogged and that now expectation of privacy is expressed or implied, and is in fact explicitly denied.  Trust me, this will become an issue as Girltalk on Glendale will trickle over to Madison's Men and hurt feelings will arise.      Okay - that is enough for now, I'm having an Odie moment here, thinking about how much fun this is going to be to just sit here and watch.    Welcome aboard ladies.......    Chase Ingersoll"

AXNX7FB,male,44,"Does this mean that I can have one? A fish I mean. I was not involved in the decision to pull this prank at first, but when Greg asked me to post a comment about him getting a dog, I knew that a pet of this kind would not be allowed to happen. He does have a plan to get this little puppy, but it will be bought from Wal- Mart.   Yes, this puppy is stuffed, but not with my foot. He wanted me to post it, and I did. He wanted to have a little fun with the board, at the same time, an issue that was bound to arise, has been nipped before it ever came up. What what you do with out me?  Just so that you know, Greg is in the process of painting the kitchen. ""GO GREG""."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"You have no obligation to attend to, or even hear every little gripe that a resident might have.   You need to firmly establish boundaries with the guys that come in, and they need to dump this sort of stuff on somone outside the house.  First they accept and follow the rules and do their Recovery Program.  The ones that do that - you listen to those guys concerns. They are the ones making the effort to be functional.  The rest, tell them to go to meetings, take it up with their sponsor and then and only then, bring it to the house meeting on Sunday.  Then on Sunday the way they get played, is.....I'll hear their beef, and then I will ask them, what their sponsor thought about it......  The idea is not for everyone that lives there to dump their crap on everyone else that lives there.  They need to go to a meeting and dump that crap.  And that is the point regarding Matt Y.  If he is not using meetings and his sponsor for that function then what he is doing is hiding from the people, (myself, his sponor, Jim F, etc.) and then whining to you.  The only way to handle this for your and his benefit, is for you to give him the same response that we have given him - cut him short and send him back to step #1.  As long as someone around there will listen to his same old obsessions, he will continue to serve them.  You may or may not have noticed, but he has stopped whining to me.  This is because I take him right back to the crux of the matter, that he is angry at G O D and shutting God out of his life, particularly in his decision making process.  The boy wants to get up in the morning and begin doing things the way he wants to do them.  He is still neither desiring to do things God's way, nor is he seeking to know what that way is.  Until he does, he can just stew in his own juices, and we should feel no compunction, if we should respond to him with mockery about the fool with big plans and no serenity.   Being blind is no excuse for not doing the first things first.  He knows better.    Remind him that I think his speaking career is going to be a big joke, until he gets his butt into meetings regularly, shuts up and starts acquiring some more wisdom to share.   I have not heard his actual speach, but I'm gathering that it is a ""Just Say No to Drugs"", I had a bad life, but then I had something and I lost it all because I used.  Sorry, but I've told him, that doesn't do a hill of beans for kids.  They all know the dangers of drugs.  What they really need is to be shown how to question and analysze why they do them anyway, and practical behavioral tools as to HOW to say no to drugs and HOW to build their life and character despite bad influences, so that they can be a person that will say no to drugs.  I told Matt last week, he is NOT doing a program that is enabling him the self analysis, or the HOWS, so his is just another tragic story of obvious consequences, that the addict ignored.  And who needs to hear another one of those stories?  It's kind of like the old people that get together and talk about their various madical ailments.  That doesn't do me any good.  I want to hear from the 100 year old that is still hopping around, and I want to hear how HE DID IT!  Feel free to print this and have Matt's wife read it to him.  It will be blogged.  Chase"
AXNX7FB,male,44,"That was a lot of stuff in a short time. You guys must have been storing it up. Haven't heard from whoever is working at 1214.  Does anyone know who this is? I would like to personally thank you.  Matt did you get the link to check out the Big Book on CD?  As far as I know, this is a democratic house? So, the issues such as television programming shouldn't be an issue if the house collectively votes and is aware of the pro's and con's of the matter at hand. Obvoiusly,  X-rated movies are probably going to fall into the non-votable category, but normal cable channels should be up to residents. If I don't like BET, I can go to a meeting, for a walk, to my room, work on my steps, ad infinitum.  What you said about choosing what is best for us is true, Matt, but you might also consider that we don't always know what's best for us, or we wouldn't be where we are. Being open-minded to others' suggestions is the best route for me. I might not like it, or agree, but I can take an honest look at it, and decide for myself, HONESTLY.  Some of those with many 24 hours sober may try to suggest things based on what worked for them, or based on their opinion. Take a look at everything people say to you and bounce it off those you trust are working a good program.  Everyone that is sober or clean is not necessarily in recovery, and their behaviors havent really changed, as much as their circumstances have. You will be able to detect these people, if you already haven't, based on their ability to listen and humbly accept opposition occassionally from others. Someone who has truly surrendered to this way of life will be visible by their actions. None of us are perfect, but it is apparent who is becoming a humble, open minded, honest person, and who is a self-righteous, opinionated, word twister.  I'm sure you hear these people at meetings.  You needn't expend the energy required to combat this type of behavior, should you come across it,  just accept it, pray for them, and talk to those you trust."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Sherese has brought it to my attention that she would like to move in. She is struggleing to stay clean because she has no choice, but to live with her currently using alcoholic grand mother. There other still active in using drugs living in that house such as her brother. I am not sure, but I think that Jim has brought it to the attention of the board of being able to use a ""House Mom"". Someone to cook meals for the entire house- clean. I think that I am not alone when I say that every house could use a womans touch unless the house is inhabited by a same sex couple, and even then one of the two picks up the feminin trait. Further, Sherese has expressed an intrest in this position. However, cooking for several people is a tedious task, and would like to be compisated for her labor. Basically, she wants to move in with some sort of a subsidized rent. I think that Sherese would be a valuable asset to the Peoria Recovery House, not just for the time being, but in the future as well. Especially when the guys from Sheridan come along. I also beleive that this will also help work out the feeding situation that was discussed at our in- formal house meeting that took place this past saturday morning. One main issue that was brought up was the different work schedules. Sherese would eliminate this problem, and would be greatful for being allowed to. In turn, this would also help pull a fellow addact/ person out of a bad situation.   Thanks for listening."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"I totally disagree with that statement. In my opinion biting the hand that feeds me would be....  Remember that day when those people from placement services(IDOC) came here. Do you remember them asking me how long I had been here, and how it was going? Do you remember the two weeks before that day, and how you treated me? You cannot deny it because there are months of blogs to back this claim entirely.. Maybe you would like to take a minute to review. Regardless of how much I hated your guts, I appreciated that you let me live here with the circumstances of my financial situation. Weather you know it or not, I still am. Every staff in IDOC knows who I am. They know what happend to me, and where I came from. They all know the people in DOC that witnessed the Matt Yeater that came in to prison, and the Matt Yeater that came out. They know that they are two different people. When I first went inn they never would listen to a thing that I said, when I left they would take me outside to smoke a cigarette while we carried on a conversation. You may not want to believe this, but I am going to put it out there. If I wanted to bite the hand that fed me, I would have done it then. No, I didn't. I lied to those guys.  When they asked how things were going, I responded with ""Honestly?"". I heard your heart jump into your throat. It was just two days before then when you got in my face and challenged me. Do you remember? Yes, you remember. Despite all of that bull shit that went on that night, and the week before when you acted like a complete asshole when that refridgeerator door fell on my foot, I told them that things were fine. Why? I knew what you were attempting to do as far as that contract is concerned, and I was completely greatful for you allowing me to stay here. I could have asked them to have a seat, and told them of the shit that really went on here, but I didn't. Why? That would have been biting the hand that fed me.  I can sit here and think of all kinds of spiteful ways to ""Bite the hand that feeds me"", but I am not going to waste that time. I am not going to waste that time because I am not that kind of person today because of this program. I don't have to run around and fuck the person that has done wrong to me. Don't get me wrong, I will defend myself, but just because he said this, I don't have to say that.  I understand your position on the blasting of the music. No one planned to. What was being argued was the fact of King Chase coming into our home, and saying that we couldn't watch B.E.T. A channel that edits all of which music it plays. That is all, but you took it to a whole different level.  You speak of serenity, and how much you supposedly have. You speak of being at our grandmothers and blasting this music. I took offense to that. Who the fuck are you to make an assumption like that about me. How do you come up with all of this horse shit. Do you discuss all of this shit with your sponser? I am certain that you do not. Iff you did, if he was any type of a decent sponser at all, he would stop you from making an ass out of yourself. I cannot believe some of the things that you say.  You need to back up the truck, and take a good look at yourself. You won't though. You have a wife, home, truck, rental properties, and a heart that wants to help. You are on top of the world. A God fearing man with a boatload of morals.. There is nothing wrong with attempting to push some of those morals off on your fellow man. But that is the problem. You do not make us feel like you feel like we are your fellow. Most people feel like you look down on the rest of us. Maybe not everyone in the world, just the ones that came from a wrecked back ground, and now experiencing the consequenses of which we were raised, and have lived. There are two people that I know that says that you can do no wrong. The rest of the people that I know (many in Peoria)  that has not one good thing to say about Chase Ingersoll. Not all of them are in the recovery program. Most people deal with it accepting the carachter defect of arrogance. Then there are people like me that deal with it long enough to get to know them, then try to show them their own shit to let them know that it stinks too.  Maybe I am wrong for that, but my dad taught me a couple of things that stuck with me. ""Treat people the way that you want to be treated."" I think that I do. So when you feel like that I need to be called on my bullshit let me know. I appreciate it, and will look at my behavior, and do the best to change it.  There is not one person one the face of this earth that has not messed up at one time or another. We all have. Even you Chase. My mistake was getting involved with drugs. As a result, I am a drug addict who lost his vision, and chased the dope all the way into the penial system. I must live with the decisions that I made in my life. The only difference between two and half years ago, and now is that I have been sober enough to know that I have a choice to stay sober, and live a life as a free man, or get high and go back to prison, or possibly die. I choose to stay sober one day at a time. I have to ask myself one question though. Is listening to 50 cent rap about cell phones, and bullet proof vest going to trigger a relapse. No, it wont. Do I live in a house where someone may not want to hear that? Yes, I do. Do I need to respect that? Yes, I do. Will I? Yes, I will. But when no one is home will I blast the T.V. and shake my ass in the middle of the living room like I was auditioning for a Ludachrist video? Yes, I will."
AXNX7FB,male,44,"Other notes on the house meeting:  THe only person that was against the Rap station on the T.V. was Sir Chase. He claimed that he felt as though it was offensive, and that it should not be played on the T.V. As so that I doo not mis quote anyone, I will leave room for him to comment on this issue.  Classical music: Could be considered as a direct gift from God to some people. TO other people, complete waste of time that the composer could have spent polishing his 24 inch crome rims.. Cal ming, and soothing to some people. To others one more minute of listening to this crap could be a logical reason to commit suicide. SOme people claim that classical music helps with the devolopment of the brains of infants. To others it could be the reason that that infant is slamming his/ or her head off of the floor.  Rock/ heavy metal:: Well I was intending to go through all types of music and pull positive and negitive points out for each area of interest, but that would take more time than I am willing to spend on this topic. My point is that with all types of entertainment there are going to be both positive, and negative views on that specific topic. That goes with M.T.V., C.M.T., Rated R films, to simple cartoons. So why is B.E.T. being targeted?  I understand why we have the rules that we do, but I cannot understand your reasoning for this nonsense on B.E.T. Something that you may want to consider, You are the land lord. You do not live here. You are the only one that brought up your dislike of B.E.T. and that it should not be played. How are you going to push your dislikes off on everyone in this house. We are not here to be converted into the next Mozart, but a clean and sober person. Is music going to affect that? You might say yes, but we say no. We as residents ask that you keep your likes, and dislikes at your house, and we'll keep ours at ours. B.E.T. hasn't been an issue thus far, but when it is we'll blog you..."

It was fun. On the way home Amanda was driving, and I see a stop sign coming up, and Amanda isn't slowing down...so I'm like ""isn't that a stop sign?"" Amanda then slams on her brakes just in time and was like ""yeah, good job"" I found it to be funny. Also, a Cher song came on (we were listening to the 80s channel) and Amanda totally starts singing along, and me and Patty just quietly laugh. It was amusing to say the least. Hmm....other than the events of tonight, today was pretty uneventful. Hopefully this weekend will be better."
GM24J1X,female,17,"I temporarily forgot about my blog. Oops...that darn Erica! On Friday I went to Hooters with Amanda, and later I hung out with Marty, Sam, Frank, and Eddy. Both things were fun. On Saturday I went to Marty's house, and that was fun as well.  Sunday and today I did nothing. Tomorrow my favorite aunt is coming over, so that should be fun. She's cool. Hmm...not much of anything exciting has gone on, or else I would blog about it. Until next time..."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a sun-filled fun day. I woke up at 11, so that right there was nice. I never sleep in that late. Holli and Alex came over. It was nice seeing Holli because I haven't seen her since school got out. It was also nice seeing Alex since I haven't seen her since Tuesday. My dear Chubbs! We just hung out and went swimming. Good stuff. Alex and I showed Holli the ""fort"" as well. I think Holli liked it. It was fun. Other than that, I really didn't do too much today. Tomorrow will be boring tho, but oh well."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Ok, me and chubbs planned on going to the play at the high-school. well, we were 20 min late, so we decided to go next thursday. steven and caitie were late too...so me and alex got into her car and were joking around about following them. me and alex were just driving around (well alex was doing the driving), and we decided to go to the park. after awhile, who shows up?!? steven and caitie! it was really funny. but then me and alex realized that we should get home soon, cuz my parents might wonder why it took us so long to get back. so we go to my house, and tell my parents how we were waiting at the high school for awhile cuz we thought the play started at 7:30, not 7. they bought the story, so that was good. then me and alex just hung out at my house for awhile. it was fun. well, that was my evening. it was actually somewhat eventful! score!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a fun day. Once again I hung out with Alex and Amanda. I also got a really bad sun burn. Oh well. Tomorrow I'll be doing something with Mika, so that should be interesting. I'll have to blog about that later. Oh....today at Hollywood Video, I saw Jory! Mmm....so hot! haha."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Today was a good day. I woke up at 11:15, and then at 11:30 Alex called me. We decided to meet up in the field to discuss things and what not. To make a long story short...me and Alex hung out until about 5:30. We watched Along Came Polly, had a water fight with Nikki and Noah, got some ice cream, and just had a fun day."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Yesterday I spent the day with Alex, and a little portion of it with Holli. It took six hours for Alex and I to watch Silence of the Lambs, and to acquire some sushi. In the evening we hung out with Marty, Sam, and Frank. Interesting times, let me tell ya. On Wednesday, Marty came over to my house. Oh! Amanda can now drive people again! Yay! Other than that, not much has been going on. I need an exciting life."
GM24J1X,female,17,"Hmm...well today is the last day of spring break for me. Oh well, I'll be glad to go back to school tomorrow. I'm tired of just staying at home. It will be nice seeing all my friends again. Hopefully this will be a good week. I think it will. Prom is this weekend, so that will be fun - I hope. Yesterday I was talking to Josh and he asked me what my favorite love song was, and that inspired me to create a top 5 list. Here it is: #5- Total Eclipse Of The Heart by Bonnie Tyler #4- I Wanna Know What Love Is by Foreigner #3- At Last by Etta James #2- Take My Breath Away by Berlin #1- Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers It was hard deciding between the Berlin song and the R.B. one to be at the top of my list. Haha. This is probably really boring to read. Oh well, only like 4 people probably read it. Speaking of boring, Martin was being an ass to me last night. We were just talking and then he called me a ""library girl"" and said that I ""am boring and no fun, and find fascination in the most simplest things."" What the hell is his problem? oh well. (Oh yeah, and Josh...I figured out what 143 means.) Well, that is it from me for now!"
GM24J1X,female,17,"Another day has almost come and gone, can't imagine what else could go wrong. Sometimes I'd like to hide away, somewhere and lock the door. A single battle lost, but not the war.....good ol' lyrics to my one and only country song I will EVER like. Hehe...I've shamefully admitted it once and for all! Oh well...Today was a pretty good day. School was okay...I got all my homework done before 4:15, so that was nice. Today in spanish I gave a presentation, and like the whole class laughed because I talked really fast or whatever. That is kind of good tho, that I talk fast, because it works to my advantage in spanish. Or not - that may just be some wishful thinking. In math class Tommy decided to create a list titled  The compiled wisdom of Erica Gerstlauer , basically it is just a page of ""quotes"" that I say, and he finds worth saving. He's funny. Within just 3 hours, he was able to get about 30 quotes from me. That is about one quote every six minutes. Then he asked me for my number, and said he wanted to hang out something this weekend. I told him I didn't know, but he still made me give him my number. Oh well. Today Ethan made me mad. I was talking to Chubbs, asking her something, and then he's like ""hey, this is my time"" and pushes me out of the way and starts talking to her. He just thinks he can do whatever he wants, and it really makes me mad. Whatever. Oh, I am now Chubbs' secretary. I get to keep track of her life. Score! Well, that was my day!"
7DEUROP,female,37,"The wind started to gust pretty hard right around dinner time yesterday and if you've ever lived in Port Coquitlam....as soon as the wind breathes we have a power outage (probably due to all the trees around....or maybe it's all the idiotic drivers plowing into the posts and it's just a coincidence).  Anyways sure enough, about an hour or so later we had a power outage.    Tony took Teddy to deliver his papers, Aleks and Krystina went into the backyard to play....quietly.  Have you ever noticed just how quiet things get when there's a power outage?  We live in a fairly quiet residential area...away from a whole lot of traffic, so when the power goes out....it gets quiet. But it's not just traffic that gives off noise.  There's a tonne of humming from other power sources that we are unaware of until the power is cut.  So where am I going with this????  I don't have a clue.....except that we have a fairly noisy family...my daughter has a good set of lungs, Aleks can be heard a block away and I've been told that my voice ""carries"" at times.  Put it all together.....we can be loud.  And I love peace and quiet....so I took advantage of it with everyone out of the house, the sun poking through the trees as they stood tall and silent and nothing else going on.  What I would give for more of that...but then I'm told I'll miss all the noise and commotion in a few short years...ah well, I'll take it in bits and pieces."

7DEUROP,female,37,"Nothing in the world could have prepared me for the pain that I'm feeling today.        My workout yesterday at the gym, was intense to say the least.  My trainer showed me how to do ""chin-ups"" and ""pull-ups"" properly (without any support)...of course, I was not able to lift my own weight, so he says....""let's do it backwards"".  And so I did...all 6 sets (3 and 3) of 5 each and there was no ""slacking"".  Chris said I was going to ""hate"" him after this....I think I really do!?!?  :)        Today...if I can pick these arms off the keyboard, I'm taking the kids to the blueberry farm to do some picking....maybe I'll just ""supervise""???

7DEUROP,female,37,"I'm so glad that today was a little bit cooler!  Okay, so I have this birthday party happening for Krystina, this Saturday.  There will be 12 adults and 10 kids in my house....can we say ""psycho""?  Krystina is turning 3....and has yet to be pottie trained!  She has no interest whatsoever, but demands that she wears those ridiculously over priced ""Princess Pull-Ups"".    Today....she's freaking because she started to take her pull-up off, to change for the 100 millionth time today and she discovered little poo poo balls rolling inside.  Well, she's screaming for me and yelling ""pee pee, pee pee"" and I look at her and tell her to calm down....we'll change the darn thing.  And then........a little poo poo ball falls out and rolls on her new laminate flooring.  Well, if I've never seen a child go ballistic, I certainly did today!  In the end, we managed to change the pull-up, round up the ""get away poo poo ball"" and all was quiet once more!  Oh and on another note.....why do little boys have this obsession with their penis'???  I am constantly telling Aleks, ""Aleks, get your hand off your penis"".  He says to me, ""But mom, it's standing up"".  ""Well yes Aleks, of course it is....because you're always holding it!"".  Sheesh.  No my kids aren't bizarre, they're just ""interesting""."
7DEUROP,female,37,"So I was up with the birds this morning....had to meet with an architect (new client) in GasTown.  Meeting went well and he passed me over to another major Accounting firm in the city, to possibly get more leads!  Stopped at Costco on my way back and spent $300.00 on groceries and then another $90.00 on flowers for my yard.  Came home, put the many bags of groceries away and then off we went to Tae Kwon Do.  Dinner and then to the gym for a brutal leg workout.  And now....I'm ready to pass out.  Tomorrow Teddy has an appointment to get his mouth ""measured"" and ""photographed"" cuz there's a possibility that he'll need braces?????  I have 4 loads of laundry staring me in the face across the room.

Now, this may shock you, but making a nuclear weapon isn't as much of a cake walk as Hollywood would make it seem; there's more to it than sticking a fuse into a rod of uranium. Now, let's get cracking!   Phase One    Stop worrying and love the bomb, goddammit! ""Radiation sickness"" is just a myth created by wimpy test subjects who didn't want plutonium injected into their veins.   Phase Two  (Optional) Tell everyone you know about your aspiration to become a nuclear power. Watch as the simple minded proles dismiss your ramblings and continue their meaningless, pathetic lives.   Phase Three  Gain access to a high grade uranium, the more the merrier ( that is, if you measure merriness by the amount of hair that falls out). A good spot to look for this is the neighborhood weapons research lab. There are several stratigies that can be employed to retrieve the said uranium. a) Get a younger brother of sister between the ages of 3 and 7, the years of peak cuteness. Use your adorable little munchkin friend to distract the guards whilst you covertly sneak 'round the back and pop a few rods of the weapons grade stuff into your jacket. b) Obtain a sharpened stick ( urlLink fig. 1 ) and, in a Ramboesque rage, storm the facility, shivving all that moves. Once in possession of the uranium, work your way back out and hold a last stand with your now dulled weapon. Just as you're about to make it out alive, you trip on your boot lace that became disheveled during the intense fighting and get hot uranium spilled all over your crotch (this stuff is worse than coffee).

4VSEFM9,male,34,"At lunch today, I was continuing in the book ""When Anger Hurts"".  One chapter, Anger and Children, may have been the most important thing I have ever read in my life.  I totally see everthing that they are talking about in my problems with the kids, especially Nikki.  My past mistakes are the major source of her anger, and in part why she acts the way she does toward me and others sometimes.  She has learned how to be angry from me.  I feel horrible for this, but I will not beat myself up about it.  I am not the same person I was six months ago.    What I will do is take action, starting TONIGHT, by explaining as best as she can understand what this means and how I will work to make sure I do not do any more damage.  She is only 7, but a very smart 7, and she has very little problem putting her feelings into words, even when she knows they are hurtful to herself or others.  Instead of trying to control her, I need to convince her to be a partner with me, to help establish reasonable limits, and to make sure she doesn't blame herself for my problems and actions.  Finally, I just need to shower her with love instead of anger.  I love my little girl so much it hurts.  She has such potential and freedom and creativity inside, and if I can learn how not to stifle her growth, she will be a spectacular person.  (Not to overlook my son, I love him just as much, but in a different way.)  I have been given so much, it's time for me to appreciate it and make sure I don't miss out on feeling happy for and proud of my kids."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"We had Nikki’s birthday party and sleepover this weekend.  We had seven 7-9 year old girls in the house overnight.  Girls are different than boys, I’m pretty sure.  The group of girls had three arguments and make-ups, interspersed with screaming, playing in the wading pool, talking about horses, snacks, movies about horses, screaming, playing with toy horses, chasing Dan, screaming, and pretending to be horses.  They were loud until about 1:30 am, then finally went to sleep.  I was out at 12am, but Anne stayed up until about 1 am.  We got up about 7 am and cooked bacon and pancakes for all the kids.  Nikki slept latest, waking up at about 9:30, after one girl had already gone home.  So after everyone went home, I am exhausted, another migraine setting in, just thinking about relaxing for the day, maybe take care of some small tasks at home.  Anne and the kids suddenly decided to go to the fair, but I didn’t want to go, so they went without me at about noon.  Since then, I have been on the laptop writing blog stuff, e-mail, my therapy journal, while keeping track of the Arena Bowl (San Jose wins, 69-62, who really cares?) and eating.

However, the officials did not account for leap year when they made their spreadsheets with Excel (good 'ol Bill Gates!).  So on race day, Dan got lumped in with the Senior division (11-14 years old).  We did not find this out until after the race had begun, and he was basically stuck.  He had to swim 200m, bike 6 miles, and run 1+ miles, rather than half that effort as he thought he would be doing.  So at the beginning of the race, you are prepared for your race, your distances, etc., then you start and realize you have to do twice the work - how many people (not just 11-yr-olds, but adults also) would quit, give up, mot make it, or make excuses?  Dan did not quit, he ran the race and knew the error the whole time, but he just did it anyway!  Afterward I know he was proud, although he was trying to downplay the whole thing.  The officials even gave him an inspiration award for not quitting after their mistake.  His time? 51:20 (approximately).  He (and all the other 11-14 kids) had to work for almost an hour.  I know I couldn't do it in that time!  I am very proud of my son for working so hard."
4VSEFM9,male,34,"It is very painful going out to the mall and seeing happy, content, confident people walk around, seemingly without a hint of concern about anything.  God, I want to be one of those people, I always have , but I never will be.  I am at once happy for them, jealous of them, and resentful toward their perfect little lives (despite the fact I actually know nothing about them and their own problems).  I actually was watching one young woman, probably no more than 22 or 23, too long, and she looked back at me.  After an instant, I quickly looked away, pretending to be very interested in a window display but actually being embarrassed.  She probably thought I was checking her out, when in reality I was just noticing how her confident walk and pleasant expression made her look painfully beautiful.  Looking back, I remember kids in high school who I thought were in the “in” crowd but in reality I think they were just as miserable as me, only they hid it better.  I am relatively certain one girl, Shannon, had as dismal an outlook on things as I did.  I was somewhat attracted to her, but we different circles of friends, so I rarely talked to her.  When we did talk, though, she was nice to me.  I remember her voice always had a brittle melancholy to it, except when she was socializing (or possibly putting on a façade) for her friends, the popular people."

I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it, but until it presents itself, then I'm going to blame the ageing hunk of junk that passes for a computer currently sitting on my desk.  As a result of this, I don't expect I'll say too much. Each time I tried to come here, I had plenty to say, but it's not so fresh in my mind, and so won't be as long winded (OI! No cheering!).  So anyway, went out on Wednesday night to New Flesh, and had a surprisingly good night. Musically, I only danced once, but that was due to the troublesome left knee of doom - sorry, OF DOOM! - giving me pain again. The songs were great though, a whole bunch of them that I really enjoyed. Was good to see some folk out (at NF) for the first time in a while, and I generally just had a damn good time.   Also on Wednesday, I bought a ticket to go and see Dream Theater in Manchester in the new year. 16th January, to be precise.

Best of all, the shows are billed as 'An Evening With...', which means that there's no support. i.e. Dream Theater'll be on stage for close to 3 hours. It just does not get better than this.  Moving on to Thursday, we end up in the Cathouse, and we're sober. Actually, no, we aren't, I am. Most others are fantastically drunk. Again, an absolutely off-the-charts night out. For some reason, it wasn't too busy (well, not by Thursday's standards anyway), and there were a good amount of decent people out. Dave and Eilidh were both pretty blitzed, and chaos ensued as dave ranted about how the Cybermen were made entirely of jam, and wore silver boiler suits to try and disguise this. He the told the guy in Riginals that he wanted jam on his whatever-he-had, rather than salad and sauce. But it was a comedy sight, and eye pokings abounded.  Friday was soemwhat dull. Went to the cinema to see Jeepers Creepers 2....and once again I'm glad I have an unlimited card. Whatever critic that the advert quoted as saying it was 'The Horror movie of the year' must clearly have watched it on January 1st, since it's an awful, awful film. It's too slow, it's too predictable, it's too long, the shocks aren't shocking, the horror isn't scary, the creeper himself is proof that what you don't see is scarier than what you do (especially when what you do see is laughable), and the special effects aren't very special. If you have 2 hours of your life where you're looking to do something less fun than stapling your head to a wall, then this is truly the movie for you.  Tonight (Saturday) I covered another shift in the Victoria. Despite the odds being stacked against us (there were only 2 of us on, and we had next to no change - which became actually no change by the end of the night) we still got through it pretty pain-free, and the bar took a decent amount of money. Had to get a taxi home since the buses all seemed to be full and weren't stopping at the stop I was at, but hey, shit happens. And one customer found out the hard way (by not getting served for some considerable time) that my name is not 'big fella', and attempting to get my attention with those very words will fail. Catastrophically.  Not gonna be up to much tomorrow (technically today). Shall probably drop into the Clutha and see Eilidh for a bit, and give her the tapes I made up. (She asked me to make up some tapes of music that I think she should be listening to - what has she let herself in for?). So she's got some Tool, Led Zeppelin and Dream Theater to be getting started on. Probably Cattying at night. Might drink, depends how I feel in the morning.  On that note, I shall head off to my bed, since I'm tired in extremus."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Was out last night at the Catty, was somewhat of a weird night.  Not very many folk out, which meant at least that musically, there was a lot more variety. And the whole night went by with absolutely no nu-metal at all. Which is always nice for a change.  Nothing of any great note happened overall, and the whole night seemed somewhat subdued.  Still, bag it and bin it, and move on.  Next Sunday should be a good one, it's Eilidh's farewell night out."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"In work the other day, GTX crashed. For the uninitiated, GTX is the program that controls the people who dial in, amongst other things.  This meant that we had to use manual login, which is a good thing. Because when GTX goes down, no-one can tell how long anyone is online, how long we take between calls, and most importantly, the system that records all the calls. So we can do whatever the hell we like. Cheek to the customers? Check. Sarcasm and arrogance? Check. Laziness and general arseing around? Check.  Got in this morning, and GTX was working. Bah! The tech dudes had said it would be Monday before it was back. So I had to actually monitor my skiving."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"For many years, there have been two philosophies on how to motivate someone to achieve a goal. The carrot approach has argued that you should dangle the prize in front of the subject, so they can see what they aiming for, and this will drive them forward to achieve their goals.  The stick approach is harsher. It is designed to punish the subject for even the simplest failure, so that fear is what forces them to succeed, knowing that pain will greet them if they don't manage. Aversion therapy, if you will.  It turns out that this is not the true definition of carrot and stick theory. The Carrot and The Stick have been working in conjunction all along.  The carrot dangles in front of the subject as before, urging them to try harder. Not too hard, it says. It's not too difficult to get some carrot. Go on, you know you want to.  And then, once the subject has decided that yes, he does want some carrot, and is going to pursue it, that's when the stick joins in. The stick appears out of nowhere, and starts bludgeoning the subject upside the head, screaming maniacally all along. ""Wanted some CARROT? Are you mad? What made you think you stood even the slightest possible chance of getting carrot? Go on! Get back into your miserable carrot-free life! Hah! Feel the power of the stick! Shattering dreams since the dawn of time! BWAHAHAHAHA!""  The stick then slinks back into the shadows, and a new carrot starts to appear on the horizon. The cycle repeats. Every. Fucking. Time."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"In work today, I return from my lunch break to be told that I have to phone home urgently. I'm instantly filled with a palpable sense of panic, as it's almost unheard of for me to get such a message.  So I call home, to be answered by my mum telling me that the Inland Revenue had called me to offer me a job, but they could only hold it open until 2.30  So I call the IR, and they tell me that although it was a clerical post that I'd applied for, a job had come up in security, and would I be interested? About a nanosecond of thought later, and I realise that it's not BT, so yes, I would be interested.  Transpires it's a 3 month contract initially, but there's the possibility of extension. Still, it's away from BT, and it's 9-5, so my sleep pattern may return to some semblance of normality.  Start on Monday."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Prior to the showing up of everyone last night, Jeff came up and we removed my E drive from the computer, for the simple reason that it was misbehaving. Although it insisted on working fine while I tried to demonstrate the fault. Wiped my old HD and put that in as an E drive for a temporary measure. Noticed also that it was getting pretty hot inside the case, so I may invest in an exhaust fan soon, just to try and keep stuff cool.  Also suggested to try and keep the heat down was replacing the 2 Hard Drives with a big fuck-off 80 - 120gig effort, thus giving it a bit more breathing space. That's a story for another time (and more money).  Off work the rest of today, it's all good."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Well, not hell as such, more BT.   Got sent home early today (one of only 2 people in the centre to get away like this) because, to put it bluntly, no-one was phoning in. And those that were soon found themselves getting hung up on most speedily. Not by me, I hasten to add. Ahem.  That's me now off until Hogmanay, which is a nice break."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Saw this movie this afternoon. It's not perfect by any means, but I still liked it. Indeed, the only Tim Burton movie I haven't liked was the Planet of the Apes remake.  The film is about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), who's dying. His son (Billy Crudup) tries to make sense of the myriad of stories that he told during his life, told in flashback with the younger Bloom played by Ewan McGregor.  The stories are varied, but most of them feature an element of fantasy. They basically tell of the adventures of Bloom during his younger days. They are definitely a stronger part of the film than the bits set in the present, which seem like little more than turning the page to get to the next chapter of the past.  It's an inoffensive film, though, and the ending more than makes up for the faults earlier. It's perhaps a bit sickly, but heartwarming nonetheless. I won't spoil it, but it is only the 3rd film in 15 years to make my eyes well up.  Worth watching."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"Went out last night for Heather's birthday, which was pretty fun. Bunch of us in Otis', which has some rather natty new furniture. (well, might not be new, but it wasn't there last time I was)  Some good banter and such like, although I bumped into someone I haven't seen in a while, and it was commented on that 'your hair got big'.  The rest of them went to New Flesh afterwards, but I headed back home due to a need for sleep.   And that's about it. Sister now has her car, so I do indeed have control of the dentmobile."
BGTGOOS,male,24,"So I got offered extra hours at work this weekend, and normally I'd have refused point blank, but for some reason I made further enquiries as regards why they asked.   Glad I did, as it was for the offline team. Don't know what I'm going to be doing, but I do know I won't be dealing with customers. This makes me pleased.  So I'm on Saturday 10-4, Sunday 10-4, and Monday 10-3. If this goes well, then I'll maybe try and see about getting myself moved to an offline team full time. That would rock."

TA0Q1LV,male,34,"My grandmother died yesterday. The hospital screwed up and did not put her Do Not Resuscitate order on her chart, and they brought her back. Now she is on life support. it is not at all what she wanted. now the children have to make the decision to ""pull the plug"". good thing they don't ask me, cuz i'll tell them to let her go. I'm supposed to go to the hospital today, but I don't know if I'll make it. The petty bullshit has already started. my aunts are already arguing on how to divid stuff up. my sister is hurt because they are only dividing the estate 4 ways, when she had five children. al  my sister wants is a piece of jewlry.   update: she's actually getting better. i've been told she is responsive and is being taken off of morphine. so we'll se what happens........"
