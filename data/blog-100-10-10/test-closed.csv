QN9H8H1,male,34,"Holy macaroni... today was kinda harsh.  I'm blaming it on the incredible heat and humidity.  That plus the fact that since today is Friday, my legs are weak (having been beaten all week long).    I got a  urlLink Nike Dri-Fit shirt  from  urlLink Champs  last night.  The idea behind the shirt is that the material it's made from will wick the sweat away from your body keeping you dry and cool.  That's either a) a load of crap or b) scary to think of how my run would have been without it.  I was pretty dry on my body but the sweat was POURING off my balding head.  Ick...  Anyway, considering the head/humidity and the state of my weary legs, it was another decent run.  I'm thinking there might be something to the  urlLink Powerbars ."
QN9H8H1,male,34,"I am back into it.  I start running... well actually, my training program starts today, but Mondays (and Fridays) are a day of rest.  So my feet hit the pavement tomorrow.  I found a great outfit called  urlLink TrainingBible.com  where they have a service you can subscribe to.  That service will send you daily emails telling you what you're supposed to do today and what you can expect for tomorrow.  Giddy up."

QN9H8H1,male,34,"I swear... the rain started the moment I stepped out the door and stopped the moment I got back in.  How does this happen?!  Anyway, today's run was MEGA-CRAP, however I have multiple excuses you can pick from.  First of all, it's Friday.  Fridays are always rough since it's the last run of the week.  Speaking of runs this week, I have also been doing that new route which has really taken a toll, so on top of it being Friday, the runs this week have given me a double whammy.  To add to all that, I went to the Verona Dog Park with Cedar last night and went for an additional two miles on top of yesterday's run.  Add all that up and today's run sucked."
QN9H8H1,male,34,"Sorry I haven't posted in so long.  Last week, we were at  urlLink Disney World .  We got back on Thursday and I was in no condition to run on the Friday afterwards.  Then I took the usual weekend off.  Yesterday I had an appointment to get the 15,000 mile service done on my car.  So today was my first run in quite a while.  I decided to go on a new route.  The old route is about 2.6 miles.  I leave from  urlLink Full Compass , head down Terrace, then down South to Park.  Up Park to University and then down to Parmenter.  Parmenter to Terrace and back to  urlLink Full Compass .  This new route is much closer to four miles.  I leave Full Compass, and head up High Point all the way to Old Sauk.  Turn around and come back.  It's nowhere near as flat as the other route and it's much longer.    Just remember.... slower and farther, slower and farther, slower and farther.  So considering that it's been so long since I ran and it's a hillier, longer route; it wasn't a bad run today.  Overall, I didn't run as much as I would have liked, but it'll come.  I'm afraid I really will need new shoes soon.  My feet were in pain from the pounding.  My overall sucky fitness was the (usual) bottleneck, but my feet really did hurt."

ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Okay, I just totally admitted to my BFF, who I like practically am in love with. No, it wasn't that snotty Kate who almost exactly after I finished typing to you was a complete jerk to me. Nope, it was my twin sister, Nicole. Now, I don't understand what's the big deal of having your twin sister as your very best friend. Everyone always looks at us weirdly because we are so close. They just don't understand, Cole and I have been through so much together. When the entire fourth grade, including our teacher, picked on us terribly, we were the only friends that eachother had. When my mom tried to kill my dad and all, Nicole (and Nick) was there for me and I was there for her (and him.) Is it such a crime these days to have a family member as your best friend? My school is quite against twins spending time together. They put you in completely different classes. In soccer last year, my coach forbade Nicole and I to pick one another for partners. That was like totally UNFAIR. I mean, come on, all the other girls got to pair up with their best friends.  Why couldn't we? Besides, I hated a lot of the girls on our team. Half of them were stuck up and the other half were mean...   Anyways, back to the subject... I had been avoiding telling my sister who I really, really like or in other words who I have a little bit of love for. Shh!! Pretend I didn't say that last part, okay? Anyhow,  Nicole totally knew that I was trying to edge away from the subject. So, she started guessing. She said my crush's name like a thousand times, but each time I said no, I didn't have any feelings for him at all. (OMG, I really need to work on telling the truth for once.) Today, after weeks of endless questionings, she found out... Okay, we were in a secreted place where no one can really hear us and she was asking me a million questions all at once. She kept asking me things about him which I totally avoided answering. Finally she got fed up with me and said that she wouldn't speak to me at all until I told her who I liked. Well, I couldn't stand the silence so I gave in. She got really, really excited and happy... She kept saying over and over again on how she thought that was who I liked (or loved). She was like OMGing every few seconds. See, she was totally OMGing 'cause I really liked this person beforehand, then I didn't really 'cause I thought he was a big prat, and now I really, really like him... Do you have any idea on what I'm talking about? No? Well, it's one of those love/hate thingys... One minute I disgrace the land that he walks upon and the next moment I practically worship him. Uh, well, it's not exactly like that... I don't really ever truly hate the land he walks upon or worship him totally... You know what I mean, right?    Anyhow, it feels wonderful, having someone know who I like. I've kept this secret bottled inside of me for like a year or two. It's a huge relief to finally tell someone, you can say... Oh, I really hope he likes me... He used to like me, at least that's what my sister said. My sister and I haven't seen him in awhile so we couldn't exactly tell if he likes me now. Oh, I wish he did. I like him  SOOOOO  much; just don't tell him that. What happens if he hates me? I bet he doesn't like me... I don't think he even realises that I exist. AH!!!! That would be such a nightmare... He's seen me before, uh, at least I hope he has... Wait, what am I typing? He's seen me before. Honestly, I am such a liar. I really need to work on my honesty. On here, I haven't lied to you yet. Well, except just a few lines back, but I admitted I lied so that's not the same...   Ah, I wonder if he likes me. Does he like me? Does he even know that I exist? Should I ask him out? (What am I thinking with that one? I'll never ask him out, I'm such a wimp!) Will he ask me out? (I don't know where that one came from either...)    Well, I've got lots to wonder about at the moment. I'll be leaving you know.    Austa!"
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I go see my doctor this Wednesday for a physical. My feelings on this, you may ask... Well, let's just say I'm not exactly looking forward to it. See, I've been trying to lose weight for a little while, four to five weeks to be precise, and I'm afraid my mom will tell the doctor that I'm not eating. I AM eating, just not as much as I used to. I cut some things out of my diet, like chocolate and soda. Basically my changing has only improved my health status. I've lost probably about ten to fifteen pounds by restricting my day's calories to under 1700.  My mom is freaked out by this. She says I'm getting too skinny. Ha, I wish I was skinny... Yesterday, I broke my rules and had a Reese's and a Coke. See, I'm not totally restricting myself... I still indulge every once and awhile. If she tells my doctor that I'm not eating then they'll make me eat a lot for months and I'll gain back all the weight I lost. I think that I can deal with the weight gain but I actually like my meal plan. I don't want to have to change it. I've gotten so accustomed to it.     Anyways, let's forget all about weight loss and eating... Let's get moving onto my physical appearance. Rather regretfully I'm not all that pretty. The only physical attributes that I have ever been paid a nice compliment on are my hair, my smile, and my eyes. My sixth grade reading teacher, before I got glasses, said that my eyes were hypnotizing and that once I got a boyfriend he'd love looking into them. Ha, what a laugh. Anyhow, for my smile my cousin, Donna, said that it was very cute. I have no clue on what she's talking about. I've got partially yellow teeth for goodness sakes! Lastly, the comment that I recieve about my hair is that the color is beautiful. Whatever... Like I believe that.  I am no beauty. I'm five foot five, hazel eyed, brown haired with awkward red and blonde highlights, glasses wearing, zit faced, yellow teethed thirteen year old girl. No wonder why I don't have a boyfriend. Not only am I antisocial, but I'm ugly too...     Ugh, I'm gone..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Last night, unlike most nights, was full of dreams. When I say full, I mean FULL. Usually I never dream and when I do I dream about every night for a week. Every night during that week I usually have one to two different dreams. Well, last night was much different. I had several dreams. I only remember bits and pieces of most of them but my very last dream I remember much more clearly. It was really weird. It wasn't as crazy as some of my other dreams but it was definitely different.   Okay, it all started with Nicole, Kate (who is my ex-friend now), Alex, some other unidentifiable people, and I. We were in this big, deserted mansion. Honestly it looked more like a five star hotel then anything else. Anyways, we were all in the lounge, sitting around a warm fire on these comfortable, scarlet chairs and couches. Kate had just told a joke and Nicole and I were laughing hysterically. I took a sip from some fancy glass with an umbrella in it. Alex, who had been listening and staring at the fire, got up. He said some words to us, that he was heading up to bed or whatever, and playfully tossed a book at me. I didn't think much of it. After he left Nicole, Kate, and I continued talking. I sort of leafed through the book, but I wasn't really looking at it... I was just glancing at the pages. Well, it started getting late so Kate and Nicole decided that they were going to bed. I decided I'd go to bed as well, as I began to get up from the chair. I realised something in the pages of the book that I hadn't seen before. I waved Nicole and Kate off and they went up the wide, concrete stairs that led to the bedrooms. I opened the book up and saw half of a purple heart. On it, was a message to me. It was three sentences long. I don't remember what the first two lines said, but I remember the last one. The last sentence was,  I love you.  Underneath that was a crossed out A. The note was written to me from Alex. He loved me. Suddenly I couldn't breathe, or so it felt. It was a good feeling though. I stared into the embers of the fire, contemplating on what I should to do. With no decision made, I headed up to bed a couple of hours later.  There was something that happened after this but I don't remember it at the moment. I woke up with a good feeling. Usually when I wake up from weird dreams like this, I feel puzzled. I am confused now, but when I woke up I was happy and almost hopeful... Though it may sound stupid, I wonder if this dream has any specific meaning. Is it trying to tell me something that subconciously I know but mentally I don't? Hm... It sounds like a load of crap, doesn't it? Oh,well... What else can you expect from me?  Far, far away..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"You have no idea how bad I feel right now. You have absolutely no idea how terrible I am feeling. I feel positively awful. I think I have never felt this hurt in my entire life. It's not about death, illnesses, or anything like that. No, it is about something that most people would consider trivial. This is about my  EBGF.  Hard to believe, huh? Well, you better believe it, 'cause it is all about him and this time it is not his fault, no, this time, and every time before that was entirely     MY    fault, and there is  NO  way to fix what I have done... No, nothing actually happened... No, nothing important occurred... Well, yes, something important did occur. I just happened to realize why my  EBGF  is so angry with me... I was so stupid beforehand... God, I'll never be able to fix this.       Just today, I learned that his favorite band is Linkin Park. I know about four or five of their songs, and love them all, but I decided that I'd check out some of their other songs. Well, I searched for Linkin Park lyrics on the Google search engine and eventually found all of their songs that they have. After reading several of the ones I hadn't ever heard of, I realized something, and what I realized made me almost want to cry. Almost every single one of their songs pertains to what is going on between  us ... I'm being totally serious here. Oh, and that's not even the worse thing about this situation. No, the majority of the songs are angry, angry at a someone who has created lies in a relationship, doesn't understand why someone could be mad at her or him, expects the other one to beg for forgiveness, etc... Well, honestly, that is  EVERYTHING  that I have been doing to my  EBGF . I've been wondering for months on how he's been feeling towards me... Well, now I know, don't I? He doesn't put his feelings into regular speech or facial expressions but drowns them in music. I hurt him more then I ever thought. The songs are simply wonderful, I will say that... Yet to me, they hold much more meaning. They're my only way into his heart, his feelings, his everything, everything that I lost. Once I lost his trust, I lost everything. What's a girl to do after this situation? Oh, I've got that figured out now... Yes, I've been wondering on how I'm supposed to act around him for months and finally I've found it. Though it totally and completely breaks my heart, I have to let him go. I have to walk away. I can't torture him. I've got to let him live. I've been hurting him for so long. God, I feel like such an idiot... Why didn't I see this before? How could I have not seen his pain? I'm walking away now. He doesn't need me. He doesn't want me. He  HATES  me. He'll always  HATE  me... I'll always love him though. He was the first  real  friend that I've ever had and I'll forever be grateful for all of the good times he brought into my life... Unfortunately, the good times have ended and it is time that I let go of him. He deserves to be happy. I've been holding onto him for way too long.     I was so selfish before. I was stupid, insane, pathetic, etc... I feel incredibly terrible and hurt. What do I mean by hurt, you may ask me. Well, I guess I should replace it with the word hateful. I hate myself completely, right now. I'm ""hurt"" that I could have let this happen. None of this should have ever happened.  Nicole , my  EBGF , and  I  should have all grown up as best friends... I can imagine what things would be like if we were still best friends. First of all, we'd call  Nicole, Cole,  my  EBGF, Al,  and  me, Kel or Kels . Honestly, I believe that we'd be inseparable. There are just so many memories... There are just too many times that we'ved shared together... Things would be SO different now if I hadn't hurted him. Yes, everything wouldn't be the same.  My life, his life, my sister's life,  they'd all be different... I often think of the times that  we've  shared together. They're just so great. I can remember the pranks we pulled, the places we explored, the games we made up, etc., as if they were only yesterday. It's wonderful, looking back at them. It makes me feel like singing, I enjoyed them very much... Rather regretfully they also cause pain. I've felt it, and I imagine he's felt it. It's time to let go. He'll hate me until the end of time itself and maybe long after that, but I'll always love him. He was my first best friend. He was the only best friend that I ever got the chance to actually be myself with. Nowadays, I'm actually afraid of showing myself to even my very best friends. Well, at least I'll die having the pride of at least one true friendship that occured in my life, even if it was in my childhood. It's too bad that it ended horribly, but, hey, that's life.      Goodbye  Alex.  Thanks for the ride but now it's time for me to go. Maybe one day we'll meet and become friends again, but until that day,   au revoir   .    You were an awesome friend. You knew every trick of the trade. You were always there for me, through thick and thin. You were terrific. I'm sorry that I wasn't that great of a friend to you. I'll see you in the next life... Bye...     Yes, I'm probably dramatizing this situation, but I seriously don't care. I feel like I've walked through hell, for the fiftieth time. You know what, this isn't the end. One day, we'll be friends again. It may not be in this life, but it will be someday...     Do you know what I'm imagining right now? It'll sound silly, but I've sort of got a version of  heaven  that I like to believe that I go to after I die. My heaven is Camp, basically. It's full of the booming  thunderstorms ,  the crackling  bonfires , the same twinkling  stars ,  the unknown  mystery , the feeling of sheer joy, the everything... However, it's not just my   Camp   that's in my  heaven . No, it's WAY more then that. It's my  Camp  and the muddle of my favorite memories. In my  heaven , you can revisit your favorite memories... It's like a scrap book in a way. I've already got a few memories saved for my  heaven . Now, I'm officially adding another one. This one concerns  Alex . The one I'm saving is on the Fourth of July in the last summer that we spent together as friends I believe. It's the moment in which I'm laying right next to him (after  Nicole  moved to lay next to  Kate ) on the top of his roof top.  We're  not really talking,  we're  just lost in the moment. You see,   we're   watching the fireworks going off in the night time sky. The sky is star studded so it makes the entertainment level increase greatly. It was postively beautiful, it was  magical . Call me insane but it was probably one of the best moments that I've ever had with him. So, I'll save it for my  heaven . He'll never be officially gone then. Even if I grow old and forget about him, he'll never be forgotten. He'll always be in my  heaven .     Always."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Kate, my BFF, is driving me completely INSANE! I swear to God that she is being increasingly annoying and will never ever leave me alone... For the past few weeks all she has ever done is bug my sister and I to either go get ice cream, go to the Dollar Store, catch a movie, browse shops at the mall, play outside, go swimming, hang at her house or our house... We can't go anywhere without getting a phone call from her, an AIM from her, or her knocking on our front door... I swear, we have a stalker... It's creepy walking into her room sometimes. She writes our names all over her tissue boxes and stuff...     Today, she asked Nicole and I to go to the Dollar Store to buy fake NAILS with her... FAKE NAILS? Who buys fake nails? They're a complete waste of money... Anyways, I told her that Nicole and I wouldn't go, we seriously didn't want to. She called me a bad friend just because I refused to go with her. Honestly, what does she need fake nails for? Anyways, I'm all like whatever and she's all like don't whatever me and I'm sick of you... I told her that if she didn't like me for who I am then fine,  we didn't have to be friends. She wrote that it was my choice to be a witch and that I should go ahead and block her. I told her that she wasn't worth blocking over.  Next she threatened that she wouldn't take Nicole and I to some amusement park sometime in August because ""the way I was acting."" She said she'd take someone that is nice to her. I'm all like, you do that.   Kate responded with that she would and it would most certainly not be me. I responded with ""like I care."" She tells me that I probably do care, I just won't admit it. I tell her that before she even asked us Nicole and I had actually planned going to the same amusement park over the summer...  Anyways, she got a little more angrier and said that she didn't give a shit about my life. ""That's nice,""was my reply. Then she sunk even lower and said that at least she had friends. With much more anger than I had beforehand, I typed in that I didn't want any friends if all of them were going to act the same way she was acting then. Ouch, that was a low blow. She definitely deserved it though. Unfortunately, seeing as she isn't too great at reading plain English, she didn't understand a word of what I was saying. What a bummer... The one chance I get to tell her how I feel and she doesn't even comphrehend what I'm saying...     I know what I said was a little harsh... It's just that she's been really irritating me these days. If she doesn't get what she wants, she throws a hissy fit. And when she gets what she wants and after hours of doing whatever she wants to do, she won't let us stop. I think she has seperation anxiety or something. Anyhow, we're all better now since she just called and apologized. She still wants me to go but I won't... I REFUSE TO GO! She can't make me!!! Great, now I sound like a toddler having a temper tantrum.     And I'm out."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Okay, I hate to admit it, but the conversation that I had with my EBGF, which I posted yesterday, totally hurts. I mean, I know I'm a loser. The freaking kid doesn't need to tell me that for heaven's sakes. I've known that I was a loser, or a ""fag"" as he put it, ever since I left my old school, St. Johns.  I just wasn't born to be popular, like him, okay? Nope, I was born to be who I am right now, an anti-social freak that barely has any friends or a life.  I've never wanted to be in with the ""in"" group. When I was younger, before all that shit happened with my then best friends, I just didn't really care about popularity. I wanted people to like me but I wasn't like obsessed with being the coolest kid in my grade. I was always fine with the number of friends that I had. Popularity was NOT a big issue with me. Well, in the fourth grade, to everyone else but Cole and I it seemed, became overly obsessed with being in with the ""in"" crowd. My best friends of then, Keri and Bridgid, were especially obsessed with the subject. They always talked about popularity and kept asking why we couldn't be popular. This really annoyed Nicole and I, and I mean it REALLY annoyed the hell out of us. So, we always joked around that we were the misfits of the school and crap like that. Well, Keri and Bridgid couldn't take it anymore and tried to become ""popular."" They started dressing more ""in"" and acting more ""popular."" They ditched us. Keri also made fun of us every chance she got. She, along with Bridgid, completely ruined the life that I had, had at St. Johns. She made our other friends think that we were backstabbing, losers... Oh, it was terrible. I used to cry myself to sleep every night... Eventually Cole and I switched schools. It wasn't only because of Bridgid and Keri though. A little part of it was because of my ex boyfriend named Seth.  In the fifth grade I was totally Anti-Popular. If you were popular, there wasn't anyway that I would be your friend. I made friends with Katelyn and Chloe that year... During the sixth I was almost completely over with my Anti-Popular attitude. I finally began to understand that not all popular people are stuck up bitches, just some. However, I became Anti-Social... Several things just happened all at once which made me distrust people even more... When my mom tried to kill my dad, is just one of them...  So, it sort of annoys the hell out of you when your EBGF is telling you that you're a pathetic loner/outcast that will never have any friends because you're not updated with the current version of ""cool."" Since when have I ever wanted to be popular? Since when have I cared about having friends? Honestly, I don't need friends. This upcoming school year, all I wanted to do was to actually be myself around people. I don't need friends. They're nice to have and I love the ones that I've got, but I don't need twenty friends and/or admirers to make me feel special or whatever. I don't need popularity in order to live... All I need to know is who I am. Why should I be ""cool"" if it ruins who I really am?  Gone..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I know I over the top dramatized the entire thing with my EBGF, but how can you blame me? I just realised something that was standing right in front of me for months... It was quite heartbreaking, and it still is. I mean, it sort of sucks, realising that you practically broke someone's heart, threw it on the ground, and then jumped on it a million times. The worse thing is, I didn't even realise I was doing any of that to him!  Oh well, everything's resolved now. I'll butt out of his entire life, forget our past together, and let him live a little... Oh, god, but it's going to be SO hard. Well, doing all of that isn't going to be that hard, at least I think it isn't... No, it is going to be SO hard not looking for his face when I'm at school and everything... It's going to be hard to not search for him wherever I go... Ah, yes, it's going to be really hard.     Fortunately, I'm not the only one in the same situation. I've hurt Alex, and my twin sister has hurt Mindy. I turned Alex into the unhappy person that he is today. Nicole's place is sort of like mine. See, her friend Mindy is insanely jealous of Nicole. Well, James, Nicole's ex best guy friend, was in love with Nicole. Well, the problem was, Mindy really, REALLY liked James. Anyways, James called Mindy fat. So, Mindy turned anorexic for a week or two in hopes of becoming like Nicole. Unfortunately, this situation isn't exactly like mine. This only lasted maybe two weeks at the latest. (Mindy almost fainted and then turned back to food.) My situation has been going on for about two years! Well, not any more... I'm changing everything, yup, everything... Now, all I have to do is unclench my claws from him...     Er, how do I do that exactly?"
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Confused, that is what I am. Everywhere I go I don't know how to act so I just either don't say anything at all or I remain sarcastic and cynical. Usually at school I am a mime during any given social situation that includes people other than my very best friends. I have no clue on what to say or how to act so I just don't say or do anything. I just sort of stand (or sit or lay) there, blinking at the person. God, I am SO clueless on how to behave around other people. People take this as good manners but that truly is not it. I don't know how else to act, I wonder what rude manners looks like... I suppose I don't want those, but for once I just want to be known other than quiet, smart, and polite by the general public... I mean, I don't want to loose my intelligence (though sometimes I've thought about it) nor my ""good"" manners, but I just don't want to be known as quiet. I want people to say things about me like, ""Oh, she is SO much FUN to hang out with..."" Or ""She's got some seriously cool ideas..."" Or ""She's very opinionated about certain subjects but she's also very open minded about whatever you've got to say..."" Seriously, that would be AWESOME. If only I weren't such an anti-social, paranoid, freak! I don't mind being a freak and paranoia doesn't hurt all that much but sometimes my anti-socialness gets to me... I mean, when I look around there are tons of kids hanging out with at least ten friends, doing crazy things... Ah, being different, sometimes sucks..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Okay, I am seriously confused about things dealing with my EBGF. Alright, I did say that I wasn't going to mention him in this blog but give a girl a break, I can't be perfect!!! Anyways, this entire situation with him is like completely puzzling. You see, my twin sister and his little sister (my best friend) got into a big fight in which my EBGF was mentioned. My sister told her that she was sick of being tortured and tormented by her brother to which she replied that he was probably treating us badly because he felt we were treating him badly. Treating him badly? I don't even talk to him anymore!    Alright, I know that not ever telling my EBGF that I had a boyfriend hurt him but I didn't think it would hurt him so much that he HAS to find revenge... I mean, I have NEVER said anything about him to anyone at school, at all... Hm... Maybe that's issue... Do you think that's so? Do you really believe that he misses me at all? The chances are slim but oh, how great would that be, 'cause I miss him a lot too... Well, er, sort of... I miss the friendship we had with one another... If we ever start talking again, would things EVER get back to the way they used to be? Do we have anything in common anymore? I know that he shares the same love for the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the same passion for the computer game, The Sims; but do we have anything else in common?    Honestly, I'm a little nervous about reinstating our friendship again. What if he sees the real me and hates me? I don't know if I could deal with that. I don't open myself up to others... How would he react to my expressions, my words, my thoughts, my everything? I'm scared that he'll see the real me and completely dislike me for who I am... Then I'd lose him, forever. I know we're not friends anymore but I know that in a case of emergency that I can go to him if I really have to. I know he won't turn me away, 'cause he saw me once, the real me and he liked what he saw... And I know, despite all of his mean, crude, and self-absorbed jokes, that the guy that was my best friend when I was little is still in there...    I'm hopeless, aren't I? I'm always trying to look for the good in people, don't I? Well, I believe that everyone has at least a small portion of good inside them... Some may just need some help in finding it... Oh, well...    I'm outie..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Sometimes I have things that don't fit into the subjects of my other blogs... So, I recreated Koala Peace, my first blog on this site which I deleted a couple of months ago or so... Anyways, there will be no mentions of my weight, my Camp, my school, or my EBGF... Well, at least I don't think there will be... I can't really control what my future self will do in the future...    I don't really understand my life right now. Everything is just so confusing. I mean, sometimes, there are a hundred different things that run through my mind every minute it seems. Other times there are moments where it seems like I have no thoughts at all, like my mind has gone completely blank.    Whenever I can't stop thinking about something(s), I always force myself to think of something else. That something else is usually a fantasy story that I create inside my head. It's a build on story where I can make anything happen. If I'm in the I'm-So-In-Love mood, then I make the main characters or whoever, in my story, fall dramatically in love... If I'm in an angry mood I can make my characters undergo some serious, traumatizing events that will make them cry their eyes out. It may sound incredibly weird or whatever but it makes me feel better.    Lately I have been seriously frustrated with my love life... I know I'm only 13 years old and therefore can have no love life but I'm just going to call it that, okay? Anyhow, I don't really feel like telling you about why I'm so frustrated... Am I even making any sense? No? That's great!    Anyhow, I'm gone..."

I think manga is more fun than anime. maybe, its because i've read some wonderfully drawn manga, and then i get the anime of that manga, and it look so...messy! I think thats quite rude towards the mangaka/'s. Hisaya Nakayo is one of my fav mangaka. Clamp is just SO great too. They've made so many hits. Like Shirahime Syo, Lawful Drug,Magic Knight Rayearth, Card captor Sakura, X/1999, Clamp school detectives, man of many faces, Angelic layer...and so much more those I can't recall right now. ^.^ But they are so good. I dont know many other Hisaya nakayo's doings than Hanazakari no kimitachi e, and Inuyasha doujinshi. She must have strated her career with doing doujinshi...I went to a pet store and on the way there, I saw a snake O.O my dog was about to eat it until i realised it. I'm so BLIND x) I also saw a dead rat. (eww) Well anyway I hope they wont make a hanakimi anime! If its gorgeously draw...I dont mind, but I think hanakimi should stay as a manga.

KEM72EH,female,26,"One of my co-workers thinks I'm obsessed. She might be right about it, but that's not going to stop me from collecting the movies and music I enjoy. I'll call it my ""de-stressor"" because I really do feel much better when I can put in a fun flick or play great tunes. It's who I am, and everyone's just going to have to accept it. ;)  So, speaking of movies, I saw  urlLink ""13 Going On 30""  and loved it.  Added a couple  urlLink Jennifer Love Hewitt  songs to my ever-expanding music collection, and found one or two by  urlLink Newsboys  as well. :)  Now it's time to work on a short story while the tunes flow!"
KEM72EH,female,26,"I doubt that anyone who reads this will have seen the movie, but I enjoyed ""New York Minute."" I thought it would a cheesy kids' flick 'cause it's got Mary-Kate and Ashley, but it turned out to be funny and entertaining. At least to me, that is. Maybe I'll watch it again this weekend, when I try to catch up on a bunch of other shows I wanted to see.  I'm making some herbal tea. Wanna join me for a cuppa?"
KEM72EH,female,26,"urlLink Facing the Challenge  has great insight on living the Christian life in a world of unbelievers. There are sections detailing just what it is that Christians believe (so we know and can explain it to others) and also articles and info on movies, books and television shows.  I spent most of my time at the site in the section on movies (the TV one wouldn't load that day) and appreciated the willingness to look for positive messages in films produced by non-Christians. God can show us great things through different methods, if we'll keep our minds open and receptive to the truth.  Check it out!"
KEM72EH,female,26,"Someday, I'd like to have a  urlLink laptop . Not just because I've drooled over them for years, but for those days when I'm sore or tired and would love to put my feet up, yet still be online.   Until that magical day in the future, I'll find ways to get around the fact that my desktop doesn't allow me to fully rest my back and legs. Yesterday, I realised I could print out some emails and type up responses later - not everything online must be read or replied to as soon as it hits my inbox (though that's my natural urge).  So, anyway, the plan worked last night, and I got another chapter edited while resting. ""Brava!"" for me. :)  I'm waiting for a phone call this morning, but I'm sure I could find something to accomplish at the same time. (I'm awfully good at wasting away my days, and I don't even want to excel in that area.) Off I go to clean or organise!"

KEM72EH,female,26,"My guest post on the  urlLink Master's Artist blog  didn't format as I wished, so here I go again, simply for my own peace of mind:   Silence is golden   I spend much of my days filling the air with the sound of TV shows, movies or music. I'm not very good at being quiet, a fact my mum could confirm. ;)  I've learned over the years that this isn't necessarily a bad trait, my love of noise. It was through the noise that God comforted a devastated teenage Rebecca who'd been dumped for the first time. He brought me back from my days of ""I'll run my own life, God, until I'm ready to hand over the reins"" and spoke to me through music. That's why my Christian music collection includes praise and worship, pop, and a bit of rock too - there's a spiritual message along with the pleasing tunes. And something for every mood I'm in.  Granted, there are times when I must seek a bit of quietness for my soul. I have to be sure that I'm not just making noise to avoid thinking,  seriously  thinking about life. There's a need for balance, and I admit that I probably see-saw back and forth rather than remaining in the optimum spot. But don't we all?  For all those who love to make some noise, I submit lyrics from Rich Mullins' ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"":   Sing your praise to the Lord  Come on everybody  Stand up and sing one more hallelujah  Give your praise to the Lord  I can never tell you  Just how much good that it's  Gonna do you just to   Sing anew  The song your heart learned to sing  When He first gave His life to you  The life goes on and so must the song  You gotta sing again  The song born in your soul  When you first gave your heart to Him  Sing His praises once more   From the rising of the sun  To the place where it sets  The name of the Lord is to be praised  The Lord is exalted  Over all the nations  His glory above the heavens  Who is like the Lord our God  The One who sits enthroned on high  He who stoops to look down upon  Down upon this earth and its skies   Sing aloud  The song that someone is dying to hear  Down in the madd'ning crowd  As you once were before you heard the song  You gotta let them know  The truth is a light to shine upon the way  So maybe they can go  Sing His praises once more   Let the name of the Lord be praised Both for now and evermore Praise Him, oh you servants Give your praise to the Lord"
KEM72EH,female,26,"Okay, there are more exciting activities than hanging out in a mall, but I don't do it often and so it's still really fun. :)  Two of my mum's friends were in town on a tour of Eastern Canada, so I showed them a bit of Fredericton. They expected it to be a bigger city, but were less disappointed than glad the day would be quieter than the rest of their trip. (They came from my small hometown,  urlLink Castlegar , so it's not like it was the tiniest city they've encountered.)  Being ladies, we had to hit the mall for a bit. :) I found a bargain on a couple items that have been marked down a few times, so I now have a new skirt to wear to church tomorrow - it's almost 12:30 am but I'll still count this as Saturday night - and I have a new carry-on suitcase as well. (I love to travel!)  I meant to do some editing tonight but slacked off instead. I saw ""Van Helsing"" (okay for a Dracula flick) and ""Timeline"" (awesome, IMHO).

DRMG6T5,female,23,"Dammit, I overslept again, and didn't make it in until like 10:30. I don't know how my body expects me to make any money if it keeps doing this to me. Maybe it's mono, or maybe I'm just really depressed. (Ok, bad movie reference. I know. Hey, could have been worse, I could have said ""Maybe it's a tumor, It's not a tooma"") But anyway, Steve said he was in a good mood when I got there, so that's always a good sign.   My first call of the night was 2 chicks from Denny's just going to Chain O' Hills, they had the cutest little black boy I have ever seen with them. As he's getting out of the car he puts his little hand up and says ""high five, high five"" it was just adorable.   Next, I pick up this stripper a few blocks away to take her over to Charlie's Angels. She has these humongous boobs, I'm not sure how she walks. She tells me the whole way that she is so fucked up, she's been smoking blunts and drank 3 bottles of champagne. She can't believe she's going to work this fucked up... as she continuously sniffs coke in the back seat.   Then I take this dude from Krauzer's to Michael Court, he was pretty quiet. He does this often enough, and he tips well so rock on.  I sit in the office for a little while, and Steve asks me to go get him some McDonalds. He always has these Entertainment Book coupons so he gets 2 meals. At 5 bucks, why not? (That is if you aren't one of us people trying to avoid being obese.)  Next, the guy who works at Poor Billy's home to Clark. Poor Billy's has the worst parking lot in the world in my opinion. It's all brick, and there's like this circle carport type dealie where people pull up for valet parking, (Which they won't let you into the club without using.) and it is ALWAYS backed up. The only good thing about this parking lot is one of the valet attendants is rather cute, and tends to flirt with me.   From there I take one of the Mexicans home from Red Lobster to Carteret. If you are not familiar with Woodbridge, there are about 5 houses in the area that the Mexicans live in. And they ALL live in 1 of these 5 houses. (about 40 per house it seems) Some drivers bitch about the Mexicans, personally I don't mind them. They always pay for their rides, they usually tip (even if only 50 cents),  they don't really cause problems (well with us anyway... they stab each other, but they are very quiet about it), and they work REALLY hard for their $2 an hour. They do all the jobs that you or I certainly wouldn't want. So I figure let them be.   The next girl I pick up is a freakin mess. She's going on a drunken booty call to her ex ex ex ex-boyfriends, as she puts it. She asks me to stop at 7-11 so she can pick up some condoms, which unfortunately she gives me a way too descriptive explanation as to why she needs them. She also tells me all about her evening getting drunk and puking on her front porch. (again, one of those things maybe I didn't need quite so colorfully described)  I run over to grab the Irish chick from O'Hallorans and she regales me with the story of a baby bird she saw dying on the ground this morning and how it reminded her of a human baby struggling on the ground. Really uplifting, if you see no other movie this year...  From there I run to Poor Billy's and wind up with these 5 drunk screaming kids. Not a one of them could have been even close to 21. The one in the front seat insists that they go ""to the black guy"" while the small blonde in the backseat sings ""yay-ya yay-ya yay-ya"" over and over again. He was unsuccessful in collecting money from his friends so he decided not to go. I was glad, he didn't seem to have any idea where he was going... all he knew was ""it's in the hood"" and a few random lefts and rights.   Next was a guy going from one mexican house to another. Just as I was getting ready to tell him ""cinco cincuenta"" ($5.50, the only spanish I know, and their usual fare) he shocked the shit out of me by speaking almost perfect english. I felt almost a mothers pride for him! He was pretty cool though.   The next guy I grabbed from the train station was freaking gorgeous. Total pretty boy with bright blue eyes and spiky blond hair all dressed up in a suit and tie. While on route some drunk ass drove his Blazer up over a curb and practically flipped over. I said something along the lines of how everybody seems to be drunk tonight, and the guy in the back says ""tell me about it, me too"". He tells me he had just 1 too many bong hits in the city before realizing how far from home he was, and now he just wants to put the covers over his head and die. Hope he didn't actually die, he was way too pretty.  Back to the train for some dude to Careret, who insists on asking me my life story, but doesn't seem to like it when I ask him questions. He tells me I ""seem"" too cute to be driving a cab. Whatever that means.   A very small Puerto Rican girl sneaks out of a house in Port Reading, and goes to Perth Amboy. She didn't say a word other than the address she was going to.   A regular chick to work at Shop Rite, usually this one is never ready, and you always have to wait. But she was pretty quick this morning.  The last guy I take is a garbageman in Newark. He had a very strange accent (almost sounded like crackhead-ese), and a horrible stutter. I guess the guy who normally drives him to work blew him off today. He gave terrible directions there, but excellent ones to get back. His job paid for him to come in, and they actually tipped. Let me tell you it's a lot of fun to sit in a Public Works parking lot at 5 am with all the garbagemen circling you like vultures. Not.  As I was in the office booking out I heard about another driver who totaled a car pulling out of the shop parking lot where we get our cars serviced yesterday. Hope he's ok. Supposedly the airbag saved his life. He was in the new 25 car, they just aren't having any luck with that number as I wrecked the last 25 car in February. Whoops. Still dealing with the traffic ticket on that one.  Anyway, gas up and go home."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Let me just get this off my chest. Steve is a fucking jerk. He treats everyone like complete shit and thinks it's funny. ""Yeah I'm a dick, so what. Everyone is below me anyway."" He treats the fares horribly, and us drivers even worse. It's not right, and it's not fair. I'm sick of getting screamed at, both by him, and the fares that are pissed because he yelled at them, or hung up on them or whatever. He is a greedy selfish pig-headed egomaniac and the rest of us suffer because of it. He needs to realize that he is not the only person in the world who has problems, and gets tired or irritable, and there is no need to take it out on all of us. He may be able to talk to his wife that way, but I am not fucking him, and therefore I am not going to take it much longer.  PS - I am really angry this morning, (can you tell?) so I apologise for the cursing rant.  I am pretty tired, and can't really keep my eyes open, (and I still need to drive home) Plus with as angry as I am all my writing will be jaded. So I will write about the night later when I wake up. 2-ish or so. Sorry."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"So I switched to the day shift. Sorry I've been slacking on posting, as a result I seem to have lost Monday's trip sheet, so I can't tell you about it. But I will do today & yesterday in this post. I'm really not digging the hours the money or the traffic, but I guess I have no choice.   Tuesday:   First I went to get Jo-Jo & take him all over the world. He needed to go to the bank first, then he wanted to stop at Krauzers so he could call his guy, then we wait for the guy to walk down the street. Jo-Jo gets out, gets his shit, then we need to stop at the liquor store because he is buying Paulie some booze as a tip. Stop at the office to drop it off, then finally take him home. That was an entire hour.   Then I get an address over on Leesville. The girl comes out with a million bags & suitcases. I ask her where she's going, and she says Stamford. I incredulously ask her ""Conneticut!?!"" Yup that's where she's going. I call it in and Paulie says ""Shit, see ya tomorrow"" She is going to the train station there and has no idea how to get there. Paulie can't tell me either. His suggestion is stop at a gas station for directions once I get there. Great. So we head off, and she is screaming into her cell phone in Indian for half the trip. She insisted on sitting in the front seat right next to me, so this LOUD conversation is going on in my ear. Finally she gets off the phone and wants to talk to me. This actually turns out to be pretty cool, because she has only been here from India for like a year, and has never actually talked to anyone from here, and I have never really spent any time doing girl-talk with someone from India. It was very interesting to talk about the different views we had, as she had never dated anyone, and her marriage was arranged. She never even saw her husband before her wedding, and I could barely fathom this. They have been married 4 years now and are making things work because they have to. But overall very interesting conversation, she thought so too which she told me ad nauseaum. (She did make mention that she likes to talk a lot.) I ended up finding the station very easily (it was right off the exit) but I had to wait for her husband to arrive to pay me. It was $125 fare plus the tolls. I made it back in ok time, and had a fare 3 hours after I left. I did extremely well considering I was making my way back through NY between 4:30 & 5 pm.   I ran a Carteret to Woodbridge.  An ex-driver from Pathmark to the mall. (Whom I also went to thigh school with)  King Chef to the Sheraton. Some Chinese guys who wanted a receipt, and didn't tip.  Then a very bitter woman from Parsonage Road to Plaza Drive.   Then I'd had enough and went home.   Thursday:    First I had a Woodbridge to Metro. Pretty quiet guy. I was very unhappy with the daytime traffic at this point as I was very very tired and not in the mood to be here.  I was sitting at Metro for a little while when Paulie sends me to Hoes Lane to pick up the total bitch that everyone hates getting. She comes out a half an hour late. Then she was a complete bitch about it. When she was getting out I said have a good day, and she looked at me like I was nuts for talking to her, and slams the door. You're Welcome!  You know what this was the only interesting thing that I can recall happening all day, so I'm gonna end this here. Sorry.   (I am writing this up on Saturday) Tomorrow is Sunday, and I will be working my long night shift with Carmello, so tune in then for some real fun."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Unfortunately, I don't have too much to report tonight. It was pretty slow, and (thankfully for me, sadly for you) everyone was pretty quiet.   My first dare   Some dude went from the mall to Carteret.   This guy from Riffy's I think he's some kind of owner or manager there. Everybody but me knows who he is, all I know is he hands you $10 for a $5 fare.   Next is some woman going to Bunns Lane with 2 massive laundry, I think she was moving in there. Also quiet.   Howie to the bar. Even Howie's quiet tonight. A guy jumps in with Howie goes to Carteret. Again not a talker.   Someone to work. No tip.  One of the Mexicans from Chi Chi's. He tips.  Now I get sent over to Dunkin Donuts in Fords in search of someone going to Jersey City. Naturally there is no one there. Gotta love the ghost calls. For some reasom I tend to get tons of these when Carmine's on the desk.    I pick up this couple from Moby's to Perth Amboy. The alcohol coming off of them is enough to get me drunk. At least the weren't obnoxious. The next guy however...  This dude is way too hyper. As soon as I think this, almost in explanation he offers me a line. Thanks but no thanks. I did accept a lighter from him though. I asked him for a light and he let me keep it.   Then I head for this kid whom I take all the time. He goes from Woodbridge to Fords. He never talks, and when I try to say anything to him I usually get a grunt if anything. Tonight he actually has me drop him off by his house, usually it's the corner.   I was on my way to get Annie when my direction changes to the airport. It begins to pour. So I hydroplane my way up there and find a woman going to Iselin. She was staying in a resort in Pheonix on buisness. It must be nice. She tipped very well though, for the weather she says. Hey, no complaints from me!  Strange guy who works at Wendy's. Lives in Fords.  And finally an old driver who now works at UPS calls & requests me. His car broke down in the parking lot. D'oh. So...  Gas up and go home.   PS - again, good for me and bad for you, not EVERY night is crazy. (just MOST of them!)"

DRMG6T5,female,23,"Ok, so it's freakin POURING!!! Yuk. (Tuesday & Thursday's posts are drafted on my computer at home, so I will put them up tomorrow.)  As soon as I pulled up at the office this morning & put my car in park the skies opened up. Figures. Then there were no cars for an hour so I sat around  & waited.   Finally a car comes in, and I take an Indian woman her daughter to Carteret. On the way I pick up these 2 little boys and drop them in Port Reading. The thing about it that bothered me was they couldn't have been a day over 12 if that even, and as soon as they got out of the car they both lit cigarettes. I smoked young too, but seeing it just bothered me.   Then I get a woman in Carteret to the food stamp place in Perth Amboy. She has ""skinny bald Puerto Rican Carl"" (her words not mine) pay for her.   Next the Hess Plaza building to the Ramada by the airport. This ride sucks!! It's past the airport on 1&9 south. No one could tell me if it was past the airport or not though. So I take the Turnpike up through exit 13, and fight my way over to Rt. 1 through Elizabeth. Rt. 1 is a fucking mess, it's absolutely torrential rain. So I see the hotel, but it's on the other side of the road right by the 1&9/21/22 split. So I need to go into Newark, find a place to turn around, & then get back on 1&9 south. Grr. I get him out of the car, and start to head back. The Turnpike has an accident at exit 12 & exit 10 southbound, so that's out, and Rt. 1 is moving at 25 mph the whole way because it's mostly flooded. Dammit.   Finally I get back, and Carmello sends me to the Sheriton for another airport. But they seem to be gone already. Instead I find 2 guys going to the mall, and a guy going to Metro.   I shoot down to Fords, and grab a waitress from the Menlo Diner. She's pissed she's been waiting over an hour, but I'm in a good mood (somehow) and I manage to smooth her over.   From there back to Metro area, Wood Ave corporate guy going to Iselin. He was cool. From LA originally, and very laid back.   Then I get this huge Indian guy going to the mall, I can barely understand him, and he can't decide whether he wants to go to Woodbridge or Menlo. I dump him at Woodbridge and practically toss him out of the moving car.    Applebees, a couple gets in the car and want to go to the Commerce Bank, then to Metro. I slam them for an extra $4 in waiting time. Traffic at Metro now sucks. Bad.  Hilton. To the Sheraton. Gorgeous. Accent. Athlete. This British guy (with great teeth too!) is here to play in the world championship Cricket tournament. But it's rained out. It was supposed to air on Pay-Per-View. I tell him that I have never seen a Cricket game before, he tells me it's the most boring thing in the world so they had to soup it up, and this was like Cricket meets the WWFE. With pyro and everything. He tipped really well, and I didn't want to let him out of the car.   Menlo Mall a woman & her daughter to Village Drive.   Then it's quiet, so I head back to the office & Jen is headed home. I take her to the Forge.   Then a nice little triple. 2 different guys going to RJ's (strip club) & a girl going to the Galaxy. They all tipped. YAYY!  Then I sat in the office & bullshitted for a while, and gassed up since it was slow.  When I got back to the office Danny convinced me to do 2 locals, so I ran them really fast and here I am. Like I said, the last couple of days will be up tomorrow."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"I had a really bad night. See, politics in this job are a big thing. Piss off the dispatcher and you ain't makin any money. I must have done this somehow. Granted it was very slow, but there were calls going out there. Thankfully I managed some decent tips or I'd be starving today based on what I booked.  My first call of the night was from Sweethearts (strip club) all the way to the top of Wood Ave. past Inman Ave. (PS - I HIGHLY suggest not EVER hanging out at that club. Nasty.) He is completely wasted. So he tells me he has no money on him (I wonder why) and needs to go in the house to get it. I tell him ok, but I have no change on me, you are my first fare of the night. He says this is fine. So we get to his house, he takes his sweet ass time coming out and asks me for $10 change. Grr. So now we need to go to Quick Check. He gets out of the car, goes into the pizza place & comes out eating a slice of pizza, he says ""ok, I ordered my food it will be a few minutes"". WHAT!! Ordered food? You bastard. So he gives me the money, and wanders into Quick Check. 10 minutes later, I called Steve and explained what was going on and can I leave his ass. Steve proceeds to freak out. ""What do you want me to tell you, do whatever you want Carmello gave you the call I have no idea what's going on. I have calls coming in that will make me money."" Click. Only wanted to let him know what was happening when the guy inevitably called him. Oh well. I tore ass out of there for sure.  A regular from the train home from work.   Green Street, these bastards. A group of kids stood on the corner looking like they had nowhere to go for 10 minutes finally come sauntering over to the car. When they got in I asked them what the hell was that for, and they replied that the dispatcher told them 15 minutes, and I came in 5 so they waited till 15 minutes to get in the car. The balls on these kids today I swear.   Few more quiet regulars from the train home.   An airport call. I drove through the terminal 3 times, each one getting out of the car & yelling ""Checker"". Almost get a ticket for stopping traffic. Finally on the 3rd time I find the guy. He gets in and sighs ""finally"". I tell the dude I drove through 3 times and he tells me I'm bullshitting. Whatever. So now he's mad that I don't remember him and where I picked him up to take him to the airport 2 weeks ago. Ok dude I have seen like 300 people since then, please don't act so incredulous I don't remember what kind of wallpaper you have on your walls or whatever. He only has a $100 bill which I can't break. Yes it's been slow. I'd booked less than $50 by then. So I stop at one gas station who can't break it either. Dude is now officially freaking out. Finally I get to a gas station who can break it, but he makes sure to pump gas into all 4 cars in the lot before helping me. Fine.  Mary is going home. She kind of makes me feel better & worse by telling me the shitty night she had finding out her ex is having a baby with some crackhead. Mary complains a lot, but there is something in her voice tonight that makes me truly feel bad for her. Sorry Mar.   Then I pick up one of the most talkative guys EVER. I tried to ignore him a few times but he just kept going till he got me to talk back to him. He needed to strap a bike into the trunk, then he starts telling me he graduated 4 hrs. ago, and his girlfriend is camping in her friends backyard, and he needs a car but insurance is too expensive, and he wants to buy an old cop car, and his friend works at an auto shop that services cop cars, and his friend can get him a new engine, and all about how engines work, and I look young to drive a cab how old do you need to be?, and maybe he'll do that, he needs a job at night, and he's gonna take the civil service test, and he wants to be a cop and, and, and... Told you he was talkative.  Yayy a great Type-O song comes on the radio. A looooong Type-O song which I spend pretty much all of waiting for some dude to get in the car. He looks to be about 50 and tells me to ""Turn this shit up!!"" Ok, no prob! This is my last official call for over 2 hours.  Another driver comes back from AC, and needs a ride home with his son & junkie (seriously) girlfriend. She won on slots, they broke even on poker. This guy & his son are major gamblers. His son's only ambition in life is to be a professional gambler. He has no other job.  So now I finish reading the entire paper cover to cover. (even every classified ad) Complete the crossword, the jumble, and the word search. I told you it was slow.  I get a call in Iselin that turns out to be a kid who grew up around the block from me, and we have a pretty intense discussion about Tool for 5am. I let him know that my little bro is going to be here this weekend for his 21st b-day, and he promises to come out.   Last call is a guy going from Fords to the old soldiers home. He was the sweet little old man type. Very cute.  FINALLY Gas up & Go Home. Hope tomorrow is better."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"But man I wish I wasn't. Grr.  So my first call was with the 4-9 dispatcher, that's why it was a decent call. It was 2 Indian guys going from Best Buy to the Edison Family restaurant. They weren't very eventful, however what I passed along the way was. There was some guy who had JUST gotten hit by a car. I didn't see too much on the way to the restaurant, but as I passed by on the way back I could see that this guy was bent in ways the human body was never meant to. (I saw Final destination 2 the other day, have you seen it? Or the first one for that matter? It was like that.) The worst part of it was as I drove by, I had no choice but to run over the sneaker that was in the road, due to the police now beginning to arrive. I really hope his foot wasn't in it. Eww.   Then Steve arrived for the night. Yay. He chases me from Oak Tree Road to Ideal Trailer Park. (Which is far, for those of you who don't live here.) For a $5 fare. (Chasing is when they send you from 1 end of the world to the other and then back to the first side of the world for crappy fares)   Then I went to the train and grabbed a very soaking wet (but good natured) guy to Aspen Manor.   Sit in the parking lot. (Good thing I brought a magazine today.)  The crazy asian broad from JC Penny's to Bergen Street. She must have been able to tell I was in a bad mood tonight because she seemed to (thankfully) have toned down the lunacy.   Back to the parking lot.  P.C.'s brother called for a ride home to the hotel they live in together. Usually the dispatchers will say ""Let him take care of you"" which means ""Don't write it down, put what they give you in your pocket."" (This is reserved for other drivers and the like) Steve knows this guy always hands you a $5 bill, so he insists that it be a $5 fare. Jerk. I know that 50 cents was really important to his night. (Dispatchers make 10%) He is always the guy to nickel & dime anyone.   Now he sends me to pick up Aldo at the airport. (I knew this was coming, the earlier dispatcher told me to make sure to take the only van we have on the road right now specifically because this call was coming in) Aldo is returning from his vacation in Florida with his wife baby another chick, and about 20 suitcases. This is a $120 fare as Aldo lives in south Brunswick. It rained all day here so a lot of flights were delayed until just this minute apparently. The traffic leading into the terminal pickup area was backed up to infinity. It took me 14 minutes to get there, and 1/2 an hour to find him. Finally I get him in the car and get some good bitching about Steve in. At least put some bug in his ear about all the fares & drivers we are losing at night. I get him home, and he tells me to put the $120 down as a charge, and he will call Steve and let him know so I don't get yelled at. He also hands me $40. Thanks Aldo! There's my Ozzfest ticket! On the way back Steve tells me to add the 15% gratuity to it as well. No Problem. This brings my pocket to an even $100 for that fare. Thank god, this is just about all the money I'll make all night.   Parking lot again.   He sends me to an address on Green Street that I know is next door to a blacklisted house. I mention to Steve that this is the case and they seem to be coming out of the bad house. He yells at me and tells me to take them anyway. So glad we have that blacklist. They come to the car and tell me that their drunk friend has prank called us and is not coming out. Again I tell Steve and get no response. I hear the address go out again about 20 minutes later. He is still sending drivers there. (And he calls us stupid!) I am wondering if some address was blacklisted for like robbing and raping a driver, if he would still send us there anyway.   Back to the Parking lot.  Howie goes home from the bar. He goes on in his normal monotone drone about all his family problems. Honestly I didn't hear a word.   Now I don't get a call for over 2 hours. I hear others going out, but whatever.   Next I think he gets strapped because I hear him asking someone else how fast they can get back. (We can only hear the dispatcher side of the conversation over the air) He sighs and sends me to get an airport.  (BTW this airport and the Aldo call are the only calls I get over $5.50 while he's on.) These people got REALLY mad at me for taking the turnpike instead of the Parkway. The parkway goes 10 miles out of the way, and takes a lot longer. I tell them this and they bitch that now they have to pay for the tolls. I can't win, I save them money by taking Route 1, they want the faster (not really, but it seems to them) Turnpike (no lights), I save them time (or so they seem to think) and they want to save money. Whatever. I do what I feel like now, as I'm gonna get bitched at either way. When they ask me how much for the tolls I tell them $2.40. I hear her whispering in the back that I only gave the toll collector $1.40. I freaked her out by saying: ""Yes, it's $1.40, but you pay round trip tolls, which makes it $2.40. So yes, your total is $32.40."" She shut up really fast.   I came back and took one guy to work at Lowes, and gassed up. I said ""See you tomorrow"" to Steve on the way out the door, he said nothing. Oh Well."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Hey guys, I just wanted to pop on and let you know that there definitely will be a post today regarding last night's adventures, but it is going to be a little later than usual, as the forementioned adventures are currently sharing space with the 2 nights previous. I haven't slept in a really long time, and my body has decided now's definitely the time. So I promise you I will write as soon as I wake up. Hopefully not for at least a month! Maybe I will also awaken to find I've won the lottery... (It will absolutely be today though I promise!)"
DRMG6T5,female,23,"I did pretty decently last night pulling $70 in tips on a $265 book. Tim was dispatching when I got there, then I left for the hour or so to watch 6 Feet Under with my mother, and carmello was there when I got back. Tim should be on the next 2 Sundays though Carmello needs off.   First call was Michael court to Carteret. The kid talked to me like we were best friends who haven't seen each other in years.   While I had him in the car, Tim called my cell and told me to jump on the Turnpike and go to the Marriott in Raritan Center. I get there, and it's 2 woman and one of their daughters going into NY to see Chicago. It's now 5:50 and the show starts at 6:30. They asked me if they could make it. I answered ""no."" Plain and simple there was no way. They seemed pretty cool with that, and we set off. They were really sweet middle america type people. I managed to get them there by 6:45 and they were happy. They asked me if we could come back and pick them up, and I told them ""Look, we can come pick you up for another $100, but you are nice people and I'll be honest with you, when you come out, there will be cabs here jump in one to Penn station and take the train back to Woodbridge. It'll only cost like $20 that way, and we'll pick you up there."" So I guess that's what they did. I heard later that they called but kept missing stops (I have no idea how) and we eventually got them in Edison.   I got a welfarian that goes from Perth Amboy to Avenel every day. She wanted me to stop at a liquor store for her. They always want all this extra shit, and it's not like they ever tip or anything. C'mon people you are getting this ride for free. How much more do you want? Since I cleared right there, I just went right over to my mothers.   A couple from LA goes from Walgreens to the Hilton. I don't know how they ended up at Walgreens with all their suitcases.  Hilton to Fridays. This guy was a total jerk. I can't quite explain how, he just was. He called later and gave Carmello a bunch of shit cause he was drunk. So Carmello left him there, and we didn't pick him back up.   New Brunswick Ave to Port Reading. When I stopped in front of his house some guy behind me almost hit me cause he was FLYING up this little residential street. He had plenty of room to go around me but didn't have time due to his speed. Then he was pissed at me. OK.   The bartender from the Legion went from the REO to Carteret, on the way I grabbed a woman from the Development Center also. He was uneventful, she insisted she was only paying $8 since that's what Carmine charged her last night. She is a regular, and normally pays $10, but now all the sudden she wants $8 all the time since Carmine is an idiot and fucked up. Great.   I was sitting in the office while a newer driver came in to book out. He turns to me and pretty much demands I ""run him around the block"". Then he can't tell me where the hell he's going. He keeps saying ""by Main Street"" when I keep asking him what that means he gets all pissy, and says the Main Tavern. Why he couldn't say that to begin with is beyond me.   Then I take a hooker from the Gem motel back to Elizabeth. She didn't say she was a hooker, but she says when she gets in the car, ""I don't like coming this far away, I get scared ya know?"" Plus I dropped her off on a corner with a bunch of other girls. Do what ya gotta do lady.   The Markowitz guy goes to work.   Danny goes home to the Star.   I pick up a Mexican dude on Minna and take him to a bar in Perth Amboy, he keeps asking me if I'm married, and if I have any ""babies"". I have picked him up before, and he always asks the same questions. On the way I grabbed a guy out of the City Tavern, and dropped him in Fords.   My stripper from Breathless goes home to Port Reading. It's always a nonstop tirade of bitching the whole ride, this time about how her boyfriend is cheating on her. She used my cell to call his when we got there to ask him to come down and help her carry stuff in the house. He didn't answer, and later on that night I got a missed call from that number. I'm waiting for another phone call from her soon flipping out and asking me why I'm calling her boyfriend. I guarantee you she forgot she used my phone to call him and called the number to find out who it was. (I have Britany Spears on my voice mail she must have loved that!)  A case of beer and a pack of cigarettes to the Mexicans. While I'm standing in the bar pulling the beer out of the cooler, the bartender walks by me and I guess he was going to poke my stomach, but somehow he ""tripped"" and grabbed my boob to catch himself. He's like ""Oops sorry"". Yeah ok dude. Thanks.  1 1/2 hours in the office reading a book and listening to Tommy & Chris talk at the top of their voices. They also lost a bunch of money to Carmello playing poker.   Last official call is a family of 6 to the airport in the van. I piled all of the luggage in, and they go to get in only to find out the doors don't open. Apparently the van was in an accident last week, and they haven't bothered to fix it. I had no idea. So the whole family had to climb in for the other side, I apologized my ass off, and they seemed ok. I drove nice & safe & slow, pulled them right up to the curb, and dragged all the bags out again for them. It payed off though, they tipped me $25. Woo Hoo.  Then I got gas and drove Tommy home. The bastard didn't even bother to offer anything when I got there. We don't get charged to ride, but it's only courtesy to give the driver something for their time. Bastard, it's not like he lives right on Main Street, he live in freakin Metuchin.  Oh Well.   Finally time to go home yayy!"

Yah if u didnt know derek is a nosetackle for Roncalli, and he said that before every game the guys would name who they wanna fuck and shit, and me and krissy got all the juicy shit lol Then we all started talking about like who we liked and what we look for in a rship.

HEY KRISSY, MY EYES ARE BLURRY! lol yah her and i actually got into a fight bc i said something then took it back! good times! we were yelling at each other in the middle of a street in Austria! lol And u know ur bad off when ur best friend takes the shaving razor away from u... lol well n e ways back to what i was saying is that, when u go to europe and u see so much culture and things that are 1000's of years old, then u make ur way back to Good Ol`e Indiana, u realize what ur missing. I mean in Indy we treasure the Circle, and omg watch out for the Farmers Market, EVERY WED! i mean come on, these arent things to be excited over folks! People might think im just talking about nothing now and maybe laugh at me, but until u go there and realize how big of a joke the US really is, u wont understand.

GO7CF9V,male,26,"Another George Bush blunder.  And this comes from someone who has seen firsthand the jobs in question.  GB wants to give  urlLink illegal alien workers legitimacy .  But one of his arguments in support of his plan is actually much stronger an argument that this is indeed wrong.   “Illegal entry across our borders makes more difficult the urgent task of securing the homeland,” he said.   But wouldn't the act of ENCOURAGING more of them to come be multiplying the problem?  The only encouraging part: the intent to  provide incentives to entice those workers to go back to their homelands.

GO7CF9V,male,26,"After today, I've lost all respect for human nature.  When leaving a department store today, I came upon a child in the parking lot who had become seperated from his mother.  His name was Shana, and was no more than 4 years old.  He was in the parking lot, crying that he wanted his mommy.    After talking to him for a moment, I took him inside the store in order to help find his mother.  I approached the cashier, and asked her to page security because I had found a lost child.  She shrugged, and then went to complete a personal conversation she was having.  I became insistant, and she finally complied.  Security came, and we talked with the child and comforted him.  Eventually, the mother was found, and this part was worst of all.  The mother was less concerned about the child than we were.  She didn't even ask the child if he was okay or what happened.  I would have done the same thing again, no matter what, but it hurt me a little that only the head of security said ""Thank you"".  The mother did not say this to myself or the security staff.  That child deserves better than this woman as a mother.  But I am grateful for the chance to help this child, if only for a short while."

HGD57YO,male,38,"The first votes of the Democratic primary are being taken in Dixville Notch, NH. Does anybody realize that our electoral process in both the primary and November elections originates in this one snowmobile town? Apparently, this burg's one claim to fame is that it's founder, Neil Tillotson, owned the patent to the toy balloon. Apparently, all 26 of their registered voters pull the lever for their candidate at the same time and then close the polls so they won't be late getting home for their flapjacks and beer. Residing only 13 miles from the Canadian border, one has to wonder what kind of influence our northern friends have brought to bear on these influential first voters in the past. Just think, the Prime Minister of Canada threatens to limit the export of Moosehead beer to the U.S. and these woodcutters would vote for Jerry Springer if he told them to.

When you find those pesky menus, put them in the appropriate letter slot. When you have a half-dozen or so, just take them along with you when you go out for a stroll. If you happen to walk by the offending restaurant, step inside, politely say to the cashier that you think their delivery boy may have left these in your hallway by mistake, and toss them messily onto the floor.

HGD57YO,male,38,"I was on a city bus the other day going up madison from 31st to 50th and I saw something that seemed to me to be slightly off. As we got to about 38th street, the driver came back to activate the handicap ramp to allow someone in a wheelchair get on the bus. Now, anybody who has ever sat through this process knows that it takes some time. First the driver has to come back and ask whoever is sitting in the handicap spot to please move. Then he lifts the seat into a locked position, proceeds to open the door and then lower the lift to allow the person to wheel onto it. Then he raises it, positions the wheelchair into the correct spot and remembers to buckle the person in. The reason I took the time to write out this event is so that the reader can gain some appreciation for the long, drawn-out process that takes place. Just as the last half paragraph seemed tedious, so does getting these people on the bus. Now, before you start muttering that I'm a complete asshole for not having compassion for the handicapped, let me tell you that there is a big transition coming up. And besides, my brother lived as a handicapped person for 18 years before he passed away; so screw you and keep reading. Now, as I was saying, it does take a long time to get handicapped people on to a city bus, BUT, no one ever minds because it's only fair that the handicapped get to ride the bus like everyone else. So, imagine the look on our faces when the lift gets to the top of the stairs and this woman backs her motorized scooter into the handicapped spot and settles in. Let me repeat some key words from that last sentence-- her MOTORIZED SCOOTER. Not a motorized wheelchair like the kind you see puttering around, this was a four-wheeled vehicle which can travel at a speed of 5.25 MPH for a distance of 25 miles. (That's right, I did some research). Hell, Manhattan itself is only 13 miles long and a total of 23 miles square! Now, here's the thing-- and remember, I have some experience with this-- the woman didn't even look handicapped, she just looked heavy. But then, when the driver goes back to get us on our way, she delivers the coup de gras and informs him that she's getting off at 67th street. Just under twenty blocks away. Let me tell you this, in the time that it took to get her into that bus and get her strapped in, she could have covered half the distance to her destination. And no matter what her condition, I think the small exercise of driving that scooter for twenty blocks could have done nothing but good. Okay, so what's my point? It's this...Yes, there is a lot going on in this city to concern ourselves about. Some big and some not so big. New Yorkers accept that as part of living in this great city. But I think that it's the  little  things that drive us really crazy not the big things. Now, did it kill us to wait 5 minutes to let this woman get on the bus? No. Was it a crime that she stopped an entire city bus full of people in its tracks just so she could extend the battery life on her scooter? No. It's just that I believe that all of us on that bus, including the woman herself, would have benefited a  little  bit more if she had kept scooting to 67th street. Which, in turn, would have left us all a  little  bit more time to concentrate on the bigger things. Things like how much would it cost the city to get us all one of those scooters."

There's obviously a lot of money to be made out there creating medicine that will disguise the fact that what you're throwing down your throat isn't actually eating a hole in your stomach. I thought, if you eat it, and it hurts... don't eat it any more of it. No, now you can take a pill and swallow some gasoline if you want. You'll never feel it. Steve"
EKE4P6J,female,24,"Two nights ago when I was going to bed at about midnight, I started going up the stairs, which were almost completely dark, and I thought I saw a moving shadow. My heart started racing and I almost screamed and then it bumped into me and it screamed. Naya had gotten up and was coming to look for me. It took a couple minutes once she knew it was me to get her calmed down, and then she wanted a cup of water. Luckily once she drank the water she went right back to sleep.  Yesterday when we were out playing in the pool, Naya was walking around with Raina's dish and tripped and fell. She kept putting her fingers in her mouth so we thought she had bitten her tongue or bumped her teeth so I gave her a popsicle to take her mind off the pain. It wasn't until about 15 minutes later when we saw where she really hit. She cut the outside of her eye and was beginning to get a nice lump. I posted a couple pictures from just after it happened. It doesn't look to much worse today, I will try to take more pictures as it heals.  Today was the first day this week that our neighbors pitbull Ruby hasn't come to stay with us. Ruby has been trying to tear through our neighbors garage door for months now and she finally got a hole big enough that she could fit. The first day we saw her out she was just wandering the neighborhood so we put her on our porch. After paying almost $200 to get Raina out of the pound 2 years ago we didn't want that to happen to anyone else, and I think unlicensed pitbulls are just euthanized in the Portland area. But anyways, everyday since then Ruby has come over to our gate and barks and whines until someone lets her in. And then her and Raina spend all day ignoring each other. The owners are quite embarrassed that their dog keeps coming over, but Naya loves it. She was quite upset that Ruby wasn't here today, she kept saying ""where drudy"" and looking out at the porch."

It is still 85 in the house at 10pm.  It is supposed to get over 100 for the next couple of days.  ugh!!  Well, Ari had his 2 month check up today. Here are his stats-  weight:  10#14oz - 50%  height:   22 3/4 in - 75%  Head:     38cm - 25%  ( it appeared that the nurse wasn't measuring his head properly, he was in the 75% at his last check up)  And he is doing very well developmentally, he can do a push up and roll from stomach to back (as you know if you read the earlier post) He is smiling more and more and is talking (cooing a lot) as well as starting to reach for objects and noticing that he is batting his toys around. In other words he is starting to be more fun.   We have been struggling with nap and bedtime lately so Naya has been a little less perfect than usual.  And I think her teeth have been bothering her as she has been biting a lot, though for some reason she only bites herself.  But, she now has 11 teeth, 6 on top including 2 molars and 5 on bottom, 2 molars as well. This has made eating a little easier on her since she now has some grinding teeth. Though she would live off of cheese if we would let her.  Now that she knows the sign for cheese that is all she asks for.  speaking of eating, Uncle Erik would be happy to here that she eats with a spoon with her left hand.  I believe she is still right hand dominant though.   She is still in love with her new shoes. We did 3 shoe changes today.  Including my favorite pink socks with her red Tevas. Eric did it, I don't think I would have let her get away with it.  She was showing off her shoes to everyone she could at Starbucks again today.  Also at starbucks, she spilled Eric's Passion Tea Lemonade and Raina started licking it up, so Naya leaned down and was trying to lick it up as well.  It was quite funny."

Oh Well. Our 6 year old computer is completely outdated anyways.  Maybe we will look into getting a new one. Eric has been longing for a laptop.   On a more fun note Naya has started singing songs. Well she hums the tune and then says a few of the words that she knows. Like row row row hm hm hm hm hm mony mony mony hm hm hm hm. she says mony instead of merrily. She also kinda sings twinkle twinkle little star and old McDonald and she thinks it is hilarious when I sing bingo. Jewel is very impressed with her ability to sing to the right tune. I personally can't tell the difference.   We were given a new double stroller from my Creative Memories upline.   Naya loves it. The first time we used it Naya wouldn't get out and so we brought it inside with her in it and left it there for a couple days.  Don't worry Uncle Erik we still use BOB, it is a much better stroller, in fact we were just noticing the other day that we might have to rotate the tires since the front tire is starting to wear out."

HACER8E,female,26,"By alexa kocinski   I had studied under the supervision of Frygate for several months after I graduated from college, and so I decided to interview the man whom I admired and who had showed me how to be productive while waiting in bank lines. Frygate was a man of repose—so different and disturbed, and yet he could still carry a tune while whistling and humming simultaneously. At first, this great playwright, author of astonishing works like  The Aimless Entrepreneur  and  Buttermilk!  , objected to the interview, insinuating there’d be trick questions he couldn’t answer, possibly involving two trains heading from ports on opposite sides of the United States at the same time, traveling at various speeds and carrying weighty cargos. If the line of questioning went as he imagined it might, one of the trains would invariably be a ghost train, so which one would reach Topeka, Kansas, first? Or would the immaterial train simply pass through the real train, and then, who would know the difference anyway? I assured him I would not ask queries of this kind, but I had to cross out a few on the list. For over an hour, I diligently thought of new questions while Frygate whittled a toothpick into an ornate depiction of a penguin in distress. However, after much pressing and hemming and hawing and eventually the overdue mending of some under shorts, I was able to secure an entire day with this fantastic homme de grand chou.  Frygate grew up in the ritzy section of South Side Chicago, and as a child, he was diagnosed with a phobia of cures, which abruptly ended his hobby of being in therapy. At the age of 23, he submitted a collection of poems about a mole overcoming a sinus infection. Random House refused to publish it on the grounds that it lacked any reference to the mole’s family medical history. After a series of debilitating falls, Frygate swore off writing and said that he wouldn’t submit another thing until somebody published him. He later suffered a heart attack, and it was then that decided to have cosmetic triple bypass surgery. “That was a low point in my life,” he maintained. “I was young and vain.”  After the two of us sat down in his grand chateau, Frygate immediately apologized for his last play  God’s Silence is Constitutional  but also said that he was not responsible for it. “I wrote it while blindfolded and typed it with my toes,” he said, a technique he had honed while writing his first play  The Stitching of a Troubadour’s Pants , which received extremely poor reviews. Many literary magazines, including The New Yorker, cited “illegibility” as a problem with the playwright’s first attempt. “I worked diligently and was hard pressed to find a small theatre company that would even fund it. That hurt because of the hours I had spent typing the five-act tragedy with my head to the side using two pencils stuck in each ear.” Frygate noted what a failure his first tragedy was and then realized he had written a tragedy in the first place, so irony took its place, and he was able to laugh and wheeze into a paper bag about the blunder. “I’m asthmatic,” he explained.  The Ortway Ensemble, an off-off-Broadway agency, produced  God’s Silence . The show was Frygates’s attempt to stage a silent play where no one said anything or moved around a lot. But the plot twist and the surprise ending (which will be revealed in a television production of the play) eased audiences into its structural absurdity. Frygate was pleased with how quickly the cast, selected by longtime friend Shelley McBride, learned their lines. “Overnight” was his word. “I wanted to do a silent play because I got tired of people saying the stupid things I had written. I thought, if I can tell a story quietly, then I have made it. Of course, I didn’t think this aloud,” he winked cleverly. Frygate admitted that his first draft didn’t quite meet the requirements of silence. “People were talking in a regular-pitched voice.” Then he decided to employ the wartime tactic of whispering, which was first used during the battles of the Civil War by Confederate General Robert E. Lee. “Whispering was a great idea, but it didn’t capture the essence of my story, which was about God and how He got to be in the respectable position He is now by knowing just when to shut up. These days, people talk incessantly, making ignorant quips, ranting and raving about their opinions, backing up those opinions with opinions of friends who agree with them, talking, squawking, blah, blah, blah, Let’s go out to lunch at Trader Vic’s, I got the sushi last time, it was great, yes, but don’t you remember when we were there, I choked on a pineapple, yeah, but it was your fault, you tried to swallow it whole—and people are doing this all the time; they don’t even know it, yapping away their lives, wasting time with slight anecdotes and irrelevant comments, and it’s like they’re trying to hear themselves go on and on, and do they ever stop? Of course not. It’s a wonder that there are any productive moments in the world today. Speaking of productivity…” As the reader may have guessed, I had a hard time with Frygate’s tight-lipped answers and curt descriptions. It was like pulling teeth to get anything out of him. Maybe he was trying to eschew silence, as only a genius can.  Frygate inhaled. “I initially wanted subtitles so people could comprehend the conversations, but that didn’t work, because it wasn’t a film. And the actors got tired of carrying around large, wooden cue cards. We didn’t know about less dense materials back then, like fiberglass.” He finished by exhaling into a balloon, which he housed thousands of in his trophy room to save the air expelled from his lungs. “If the world ever runs out of oxygen, I’ll be one of the few people left with balloons in their home,” he commented.  Ambivalent about change and any negative criticism, his fifth draft was just a copy of the fourth until a former colleague suggested that he try turning a few of the less dimensional characters into orangutans. Frygate recalled thinking to himself during this hour of self-doubt, “Maybe if I handwrote the plays instead of using stenciled letters, I could write more than one play every ten years.” At this juncture and feeling creatively cramped, Frygate moved into the Soho district to a subsidized area for aspiring artists and writers, but once he thought of the section as a giant writers’ block, he was unable to come up with any fictitious character names. “I couldn’t even think of the name ‘Dave’ without feeling I was plagiarizing somehow.” He wrote two lesser-known works (eventually published under the pen name “Frigate”) that, according to the Times, made good use of the letter G. At this watershed and with nothing to lose except his integrity and self-worth, Frygate really began to grow as an artist. His run-on sentences were interrupted by hyphens, and he stopped using three or more commas in a row. “Yeah,” he laughed inappropriately, “those were my spring chicken days.”  Tired of the anonymity that tends to haunt most Broadway and Hollywood writers, Frygate also chose to put his name on the playbills. “I found I got more credit that way. Also, I put my picture next to the name.” He revised the fourth act, wherein a stud poker game ensues in typical Frygate silence. Superimposing some dialogue, Frygate carefully omitted words, such as  deal, draw, card/s, I,  and  bingo . He also expected the players to adlib communication by gyrating frantically while maintaining a believable poker face. Finding the right actor to play the character of God, though—and here, Frygate envisioned an omniscient being who creates the universe and then takes a day off for Eternity—was rather difficult as attested by the nine-week delay of production that had Frygate and his associates hunting far and wide for the perfect person for the role. “I wanted someone who, when He walked into the room, displayed charisma and had a certain swagger, maybe somebody who could goosestep just like the Almighty could.” He found God in Mao Chin, a Buddhist atheist-turned-model-turned-actor-turned butterfly (in the following life). Auditioning for the main part, Chin exuded all-powerful Greatness and read the lines just the way Frygate had imagined them read—without stuttering. “When God gave Man free will and saw what he did with it during the 70s, He was tempted to take it back,” marked Chin’s opening lines and the actor’s first brush with fame.  The first act entitled  Italicized  featured an aging prophetess who had once, in her private heyday, been able to prophesize 30 to 40 years into the future, but because of the onset of glaucoma, she could only see 2 to 3 years in advance. “Fortunately,” Esmerelda explains directly to the audience—quintessential Frygate in-your-face-drama—“I used to see the big picture, but my peripheral vision has deteriorated. I can still envision where people will be in the future, but I can only see the tops of their heads.”  His next production, put on by the Tisane Community Theatre in Hoboken, New Jersey, entitled “Abbr.”, was much shorter than a standard three-act play, but went over well with the hard-to-reach narcoleptic demographic. “I blinked twice,” raved one audience member, “and missed two-thirds of the play. Reading the playbill took up more time. I was really impressed by Abbr.’s pithy nature.” Frygate, known for his rambling soliloquies, had his characters speak in monosyllabic tones, sometimes supplanting long speeches with simple gestures. It was also the first time he incorporated hand puppets.  To this day, Frygate remains dedicated to the alcoholic and promiscuous lifestyle of a writer, but he feels that writing plays is just a jumping-off point for his real ambition: designing and editing medical pamphlets on contagious diseases. “I think my real calling is to write eloquently about herpes and investigate the artistic potential of STDs. No playwright now or way back whenever has ever ventured into this unsightly territory before. I see myself someday using adjectives, such as  inflamed, oozing, open sore-like, itchy , and  burning , in a free and uninhibited manner.” Frygate, who will reveal his middle name to the world during the Democratic National Convention in Pittsburgh, is still optimistic about the past and nostalgic about the future, even though he’s nearing the age most people turn after 68. But he is lucid, candid, and revealing and shows no signs of dementia, infirmity, or senility. After the interview was over and with a glimmer in his eye, he bade me farewell and hurried me out of the door into the foyer. Still learning to decipher his infamous subtlety, I ascertained he wanted me to leave. Either that, or pick up his dry cleaning tab. After all, Frygate the man was and still is one of the most comprehensible enigmas of our time. And I am honored to pay him this tribute."
HACER8E,female,26,"They (committee of hypothetical people) say that religion is the opiate of the masses. But I (committee of one) say that horoscopes are the real opiate (or narcotic or barbiturate). This morning, I looked at my Excite! horoscope, and it said that my finances would greatly improve, which coincided with yesterday's personal forecast: ""You will fall on financially easy times."" Then it gave a detailed analysis of my personality that put my mother's intimate knowledge of me to shame.  Of course, I bought it all. I ate it up. And then I got queasy, for I realized I had been duped into not worrying. How could I, an intellectually gifted yet cosmically challenged person, believe that these printed words pertained to my own destiny? It made me wonder how many other credulous people out there had fallen for these fortune-cookie self-help predictions, neatly published into uncompromising vignettes, categorized according to arbitrary dates set by them (committee of unknowable hypothetical people). Who else follows this painstakingly unsolicited advice about their lives and then decides, based on frivolous warnings, to go on a shopping spree because they think their financial situation will greatly improve? Or what about the unlucky sap who decides to test out his daily horoscope, which states that he should wait until the afternoon to make any business transactions, and leaves his phone off the hook while, unbeknownst to him, the Minnesota Zoo repeatedly calls to inform him that he has won a free pass to the monkey exhibit?

After one achievement, it's always, ""So what are you gonna do next?"" When is it enough? When do people stop asking me? When I exhibit signs of mental deterioration? I'd really like to break down my childhood in terms of goals met. I'll start with my birth, which was cruel and unusual. But, hey, I survived. Within three years of my grand entrance, I learned an entire language with its structural nuances, grammatical functions, and verbal inflections. And nobody has ever considered that to be amazing. In that same three years, I also learned how to eat solid foods, walk, run, and clean up after myself. I learned that crayons can be used on paper and as well as on walls. I learned the rules of baseball and hockey. I learned to count to 100. I learned simple arithmetic. I categorized the world according to two important groups: edibes and non-edibles.

I have to admit, since my days as an infant, things have slowed down quite a bit. All I can say for myself in the past few years is that I've learned tact and diplomacy to an extent. While I lack certain traits admired in highly effective business people, I feel that the neurotic behaviors and quirky habits I've amassed in my pursuit to remain in denial have given me an edge. While I'm not as likeable as some, I'd definitely recieve an ""honorable mention"" at my own funeral."
HACER8E,female,26,"My day always starts off really great. I have my cup of coffee with some cream, a smoke, maybe another smoke, I read the daily paper, I spend some quality time with the cat, sometimes I eat breakfast. The day continues to go well. I'll have a hearty bowel movement. The kind where I feel lighter and healthier for having had it. Then it's off to do some chores. Some errands. And I'm not really certain when it stops being a good day. Somewhere in the middle, I think. There's a point in time where I lose all of my morning ambition and delusions of grandeur. I don't know if it's after I watch the 112-pound two-year-olds on ""Montel"" or when I realize that half the day is gone and I've done nothing except secured myself a third or fourth cup of coffee. The dishes are still in the sink. I catch myself daydreaming about colored bath suds and being the lead bass guitarist in a blues band. And then it happens. I lose all of my energy and drive to conquer and then play with the world. Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"About once a month a bunch of us go for a pub lunch on a Friday afternoon, from 15:00 onwards.  I suppose it's really just taking the afternoon off, but hey, not much gets done on a Friday afternoon anyway.  We've been doing this now for a good 5 years or so.  Time sure flies when you don't pay attention.  The guys have been doing this for much longer than me, but they were smart enough to realize having only men together drinking is slightly boring.  This is where I was invited along. For the last 2 months no pub lunch was organized for some reason or another.  Most likely because the guys couldn't sort out their schedules.  The theory about women being bad at time management is a lie!  Trying to organize a publunch usually starts with N sending out an email asking when and where.  This is followed by a barrage of emails from all involved.  The emails consist mainly of ""I'm on holiday for the next 3 weeks"" and a few ""I'm working then"".  If you really want to sow confusion, just mention that the chosen pub is not to your liking.  Add to that the fact that some email servers are slow and the emails only get delivered the next day.  It sure brightens up a dreary day.    Invariably one of the guys will mention sex.  I'm never quite sure how the connection is made, but I accept the fact they are the male of the species.  T & L are the big culprits in this.  Both of them are married, not to each other of course, but they definately have a fixation on shagging in public places.  Of our little group only two of us are single and strangely enough we get ripped of about being sexually frustrated.  I don't quite understand that.  All of us met years ago while working for the same employer in some form or another.  Playing computer network games the whole day doesn't necessarily constitute working but with budget cuts and projects being cancelled there wasn't much else to do.  I'm not being defensive!    It's nice having a bunch of people to reminisce with and about.  It's cute when the guys try to clean up their language around me.  Hopefully we're all set for this Friday, as long as nothing breaks, crashes or panics."

MYIDXUK,female,35,"Everyone would have friends & family visit, this was usually why the food went missing and the dirty dishes piled up.  There always seemed to be a food issue in the house. The issue being that the cupboards were bare most of the time. Those of us that bought food soon realized that those with money problems would snack on whatever was in the cupboards and share it with their visitors. Coming home in the afternoons looking forward to having a bite to eat, just to find the bite to eat missing in action.  Then there was the time that someone came up with the idea that everyone should get a turn to cook in the evenings, for everyone else. After all, everyone eats dinner. Seven evenings, seven women. Makes sense right? The deal was that everyone would be responsible to buy food for one meal and cook it. As time went by the term meal were defined as consisting of meat, vegetables and starch. A meal is not a meal when there's only vegetables to eat. ""I don't care if you think you want to be become a vegetarian, the rest of us are not"".  If someone wouldn't be home in time for dinner a plate of food would be put aside for them. The only problem was the dedicated snackers in the house. Two hours after dinner and the plate of food was reduced to just the vegetables. This whole exercise in cooking lasted about a month. Being a woman does not automatically enable you to cook. I've seen grey pasta and I still don't know how that was done.  Parties were the best, and the worst. We had some kick-ass parties and our fair share of the police showing up and telling us to quiet it down a bit. Our one neighbor always complained, the old fart. The parties were generally along the lines of a ""bring and barbecue"". Everyone was supposed to bring their own food and drinks. Some friends conveniently forgot to bring anything and would just eat and drink whatever was there. This is where I learnt that true friends are the ones that stay behind and help to clean up.  Some visitors would also just use the phone. We had detailed billing on our phone bill so that at the end of the month Petra would work out to the last cent who owed what. Time and time again there would be these long distance phone calls that no-one claimed. I started to think that our house was the place to make free phonecalls and provide free food.  At one point each of us had responsibilities around the house. Abby and Mandy were responsible for cleaning the kitchen. After a while they started refusing since they would leave the house with a clean kitchen in the morning, just to get back to a mess in the afternoons due to the amount of people that had been traipsing through the house. I always wondered if the concept of cleaning up after yourself had gone out of fashion.  Family visits were something else though. All of us would get fair warning when a parent was sighted on the horizon. Everyone cleaned up without complaining. This worked, most of the time. I remember getting home one afternoon to find Mandy's dad walking in the garden and I couldn't understand why. Turns out Cathy had done her laundry that day, and since it was raining outside she thought it would be perfectly ok to just drape her intimate apparel all over the place to dry.  Cathy was also the one that would not pick up her dirty undies in the bathroom. I have a perfectly good gag reflex and there is nothing as gross as finding a piece of dirty underwear with period stains still fresh on it.  One afternoon I got home and my TV was gone. No-one knew where it was. Turns out one of the guys we knew had organized an afternoon of watching soccer with the boys. They just had one problem, they had no TV. So they came over and ""borrowed"" my TV. I did the wicked witch of the west impersonation when he brought my TV back. ""You could have left me a note?"" ""You have my phone number?"" ""There was a phone where you watched the soccer?"" ""Where did you learn that you can just take stuff without asking?"" ""Will you ever do this again?"" At this point his answers were limited to ""yes, ma'am, no ma'am""  Never a boring moment! Especially when you mix cats and dogs .... more on that later"

MYIDXUK,female,35,"My brother was kind enough to come over for a visit to take away a bit of rubble.  This rubble has been laying around since I moved into my new house about a year ago.  Long overdue.  I didn't know where the dumping ground is so I asked one of the guys from work for directions.  Yesterday I went looking for the dumping ground, drove past it at least 3 times but eventually found it.  As I drove back home this nagging little voice asked ""double check the times they are open"".   I ignored it since dumping grounds are usually open on sundays, right?  Today we drove to the dumping ground with a full load just to find it closed.  Big sign on the gate saying ""closed on sundays and public holidays"".  When do most people do gardening?  That's right, on sundays and public holidays.  So we're sitting there, fresh out of ideas when we noticed there was a garbage truck inside loading up.  We approached the driver and asked if there's any other dumping grounds we can go to.  This man was kind enough to say we could follow him.  He then proceeds to drive at top speed.  We thought we had lost him, but once again he was kind enough to wait for his.  I was suitably impressed.  As we are following the garbage truck we're pondering where this dumping ground can be since we kept on driving and driving and driving.  I saw a side of the suburbs I've never been to.  We ended up at a huge dumping ground.  A real one, not just the relatively nice ones with garbage containers to put your stuff in.  This was a big heap in the middle of nowhere.  Did I mention the smell?  We made 3 trips there today and there's still at least another 2 loads left to be taken.  There's actually people that go to the dumping grounds to pick up stuff! I was amased.  We saw at least one such person on each trip loading stuff up.  One man's garbage is another man's treasure?  My brother's son found a little solar charger for batteries that absolutely fascinated him.  I told him to throw it away, dammit, it's garbage!  He just ignored me and came up with some lame story that he wanted the magnets on the inside.  I took a well-deserved and prolonged shower this afternoon."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"I visited my brother & his family today for my long overdue furniture shopping. As I drove back home this afternoon I thought about the differences in our lifestyle.   I can just pack and go, literally and figuratively.  In contrast, my sis-in-laws day started with taking her mom and aunt to the hairdresser, at 8!  I was still fast asleep as is normal for me on a saturday morning.  I arrived at their house and only their son was there.  After the hairdresser my sis-in-law picked me up from their house, then we went to drop off her mom and aunt.  We were already running late at this point. On the way to the furniture store her daughter phoned to be picked up from the mall.  We first went furniture shopping though.  Then off to the mall on the other side of the suburb to pick up her daughter.    At this point my brother phones to say he's on his way home and what's for lunch.  So off to the shops we go to buy something to eat.  This turned into a mini monthly shopping event with everything from 5 types of breakfast cerial to all the ingredients for soup being bought.  The plan was to just have hot dogs for lunch.  Then I looked at the time and realised I need to get home to let the cleaning lady out.  It was already 2:30!   At no point had my sister-in-law done anything just for herself. I also know that her afternoon was most likely spent preparing food, cleaning the house and doing the laundry.    Being a mom is hard work!  It's not just the 2 teenagers and the housework, but my brother can be a bit helpless at times as well.  He sometimes can't find his pants/car keys/tennis racquet then she has to find it for him.  Oh, I did spend a goodly sum of money at the furniture shop.  The new coffee tables look marvelous in my lounge.  I just need to upgrade the rest of the furniture in the lounge to fit with the coffee tables.  The dining room set and big coffee tables are hopefully being deliver late next week :)"

MYIDXUK,female,35,"I recently moved into my house.  Recently being 18 months ago.  There are still rooms that lack furniture, like the dining room, and my study contains mostly opened up and rummaged through boxes that are covered in dust and cat hair.  So this weekend I'm planning to go shop for furniture, with my sister-in-law, because she knows all these interesting and out of the way shops that sell the most stunning furniture.  I've tried this before about 6 months ago, but that was more a non-bying event.  My sister-in-law firmly believes in ""looking for the best deal"".  This meant that we ended up going to about 10 shops and me not bying a thing.  I wanted to buy, but my sis-in-law was sure the next place would have something cheaper/better/nicer.  Her kids were with us, for some reason.  At about the 3rd shop her son says ""when are we going home?"" to which I replied that we're not even half way. He opted to just sit in the car and get on his sisters nerves. Teenagers!  My usual shopping sprees involve walking into a shop, seeing something I like, and buying it.  ""So, that bed costs R4000? That's ok, here's a cheque and the delivery address"". Nevermind that for the rest of the month I live on bread and water and sleep on a really nice bed.  I will rather not mention the results of my desire to have a DVD-player.  My sis-in-law has agreed to take me back to the very first shop we went to the first time around.  Hopefully they still have the same dining room table I wanted originally."

YLF0EHZ,male,23,"urlLink Paradigm Shift  - by LVX23   [via  urlLink Future Hi ]   ""I had a vision last weekend concerning cultural/technological evolution and the concept of the Singularity (what follows is a rough outline of a larger paper I'm working on). The Singularity is alternatively imagined to be some apocalyptic transformation through fire which will purge the planet of the Old Ways and sweep the pure of heart into the next phase of existence, or it is a sudden shift in perception as technology is accelerating so quickly that life is indistinguishable from imagination. I tend to lean towards the latter, though I question how much of the Old Ways will disappear in the new paradigm.  But the vision I had was somewhat more mundane, acknowledging some of the current threads which will irrevocably necessitate a fundamental shift in the way we humans relate to each other and our world. Such a shift will undoubtedly call into question the entire edifice of western culture.""   This is a prescient article much aligned with my own vision of the times to come, and what we can do as individuals in the interim to smooth the transition.   My personal research for the past two years started as an independent study project in Subsymbolic techniques of Artificial Intelligence.  These include artificial neural networks, evolutionary computation (aLife, genetic algorithms), and swarm intelligence.  The term ""subsymbolic"" is derived from the paradigm shift to viewing intelligence as emergent from lower-level interactions in connectionist systems in nature, as opposed to the traditional view of ""symbolic"" AI which relies on explicit logic/rule-based abstractions derived from the assumption that human intelligence is inherently symbolic manipulation (and deals with techniques such as path-finding, heuristic searches and knowledge representation).  ""The first current is the shift from classical Newtonian Mechanics and Cartesian dualism which has laid the foundation of human logic for at least the past 400 years, producing the economic, industrial, and political theories which now rule the planet, to the emerging logic set informed by Relativity and Quantum Mechanics...  Binary classification of nature is failing. Yes or No, right or wrong, black or white - these are increasingly becoming more and more fuzzy as the western mind grasps the gradients between such polarities.""  Symbolic AI and Subsymbolic AI fall along the fault-lines produced by the classical/Cartesian POV and the relativistic/quantum POV.  But the revolution that marks these paradigm shifts is not a clean break.  It is more of an evolution that takes what has worked from the theories and models which came before and incorporates them into those new models which shore up the rotting foundations.  For example, the idea from heuristics of winnowing a search space to a smaller field of inquiry is incorporated into genetic algorithms by having multiple agents explore a large sample of the entire search space in parallel, through variations and permutations on their digital DNA that serves as the ""solution"" to their problem of survival.  The use of binary logic for information representation in computer systems was inspired by the  I Ching  system of centuries ago in ancient China.  From combinations Yang and Yin, 0 and 1, the entire universe can be represented (to some precision...).  This very formula is now in the throes of growth like a cicada nymph shedding its husk.  Fuzzy logic does not require the complete abandon of a binary system, merely its revise.  In artificial neural networks, the activation function for a neuron can be of two types: binary or bipolar.  With binary there are only two values: 0 or 1, off or on.  WIth a bipolar activation function, there is a continuous spectrum of values between 0 and 1, a Real number line with a virtually infinite number of values (given the finest degree of precision).  But the binary system still exists in the bipolar, as vectors for changing values to become greater or lesser within the spectrum.  At the same time, this is a return to the I Ching as a foundation for computational logic.  For Yin and Yang may represent the entire universe, but it is their interplay, the spectrum of hexagrams (or beyond) which falls out between them which gives the real representation of nature.  Modern digital signal processing would be nowhere without this concept; if every sample could be a 0 or a 1 with no intermediate values, the mp3s I am listening to right now would not sound so great.   This is all well and abstract, it is easy to lose myself thinking about these things, but applying them to my life often escapes me.  I have started doing yoga and meditating regularly, it is the first time in years I have intentionally spent some part of the day not thinking about something or other.  And I've been spreading out.  Two years ago I roomed with a psychology and government student, now doing environmental law, who was not well versed in the physical sciences.  I had him read books about quantum mechanics and chaos theory, and his world view was changed.  He borrowed those books and has read them several time since.  I visited my twin brother in Pittsburgh a week ago.  We talked about these abstract theories, we share the same interests along these lines.  But he is more practical, hands-on, where I am prone to abstractions.  He taught me to play the game Go, and in just two or three games my own views were changed drastically by watching those black and white pieces form patterns of space and tension on the board.  The evolution of classical ideas to these relativistic and quantum ones will take more than abstract science.  It requires the hands-on moments, the emotional moments that bridge the gaps between individuals, just as fuzzy logic bridges the gaps between binary opposites with a full spectrum of possibilities.  Just as subsymbolic intelligence relies on the bottom-up interactions of so many individuals' interaction with each other through their local environment as opposed to formalized top-down rules prohibiting information into narrowly specified channels.  This paradigm shift that restructures the fabric of society will be paid in blood, and that is why we have to come together as people, as bipolar creatures of flesh and guts instead of hiding behind our abstract ideas and words.  A singularity that embraces such things as nanotechnology and cybernetics will not occur without embracing its own opposite in the momentary experience of each individual, beyond the technology."

But mitochondria are not part of our bodies.  They have their own DNA.  They are another species living in our bodies that needs us for shelter while we need them for energy.  Mitochondria have their own replication cycle independent of the host-organism's, yet they regulate that host's own DNA replication cycle. [ urlLink Mitochondria: Architecture dictates function ]  The video game  Parasite Eve  for PS1 suggests that mitochondria have significantly evolved and have even begun to take control of their host organisms.  While this is only a video game, the idea is compelling: We have a foreign organism living in every cell of our bodies that we depend on for our own cellular reproduction.  A significant number of forces in human society are externalized communication from the DNA-RNA feedback system (i.e. awareness of the necessity of reproduction for continuing the species, whether as conscious analysis or intuitive urges).  How many of these forces are tied to the necessity of mitochondria reproduction, for which we are merely vehicles or vessels?  What memes have we developed solely for the benefit of these organisms but not necessarily our own?  As is said on the homepage of the  urlLink Mitochondria Research Society : ""Mitochondria Means the Most to Us"".   urlLink In study , it appears that mitochondria are also drivers of information processing in neurons, that is there is some link between neural activity and the mitochondria energy production cycle.  I can only surmise there is some link between our thought patterns, our bio-survival urges, and the reproductive necessities of the mitochondria we house.   Whose DNA are we competing for the successful evolution of anyway?"

RSS is a form of syndication; in fact, it means “Really Simple Syndication.”  (Is that the best acronym you’ve ever seen, or what?!) So if you’re smart, you’ll want to get a good understanding of syndication first. Then come back here and tackle RSS.    RSS – May The Best Content Win   Upfront lingo clarifications ·	Aggregator = portal  ·	A “feed” contains a list of items, each identified by a link  ·	Blog = web log, used to be personal diaries of sort, now business potential is being realized      What is RSS?   RSS is the acronym for Really Simple Syndication.  RSS can increase traffic to a site by gathering and distributing news.  RSS is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, “including major news sites like Wired, news-oriented community sites like Slashdot, and personal weblogs. But it's not just for news.”    Pretty much anything that can be broken down into discrete items can be syndicated via RSS: the ""recent changes"" page of a wiki, a changelog of CVS checkins, even the revision history of a book. Once information about each item is in RSS format, an RSS-aware program can check the feed for changes and react to the changes in an appropriate way. http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html      Um . . . come again?  RSS is a means of content distribution.  It’s a mini database maintaining headlines and descriptions of what’s new on your site.  It is a form of syndication, hence the name.  If you look at your morning paper, there are articles from various different news sources, AP, Boston Globe, NY Times, etc.  RSS works the same way.  RSS is a format that allows specific content (like headlines) to be added to other sites.  Your specific content (of which you have full control of what or how much) is instantly distributed to other sites.  RSS can sort content by topic, time, date, and other specifics.  RSS allows peoples' computers to fetch and understand the information, so that all of the lists they're interested in can be tracked and personalized for them. It is a format that's intended for use by computers on behalf of people, rather than being directly presented to them (like HTML).  To enable this, a Web site will make an RSS feed, or channel, available, just like any other file or resource on the server. Once a feed is available, computers can regularly fetch the file to get the most recent items on the list. Most often, people will do this with an aggregator, a program that manages a number of lists and presents them in a single interface. http://www.mnot.net/rss/tutorial/   Originally, blogs were a primary market for RSS.  Readers would subscribe to a blog, and the RSS would allow the readers to receive up-to-the-minute headlines about the topics that interested them.   When blogs first began, they seemed to be a form of online diaries, but the idea of blogs has really grown.  Now there are blogs on almost every topic, and it is a cheap and easy market savvy businesses are discovering.  The RSS feeds are a wealth of information:  hourly, daily and weekly updates, new information, new products, product updates, company changes, company specifics, and the list keeps going.      How is this relevant to publication management?  RSS is a way of getting content out to the right people at the right time and in the right format.  RSS makes it easier for your users to keep up with the content they want.  It allows immediate notification when something that interests them is available on your site.   With thousands of sites now RSS-enabled and more on the way, RSS has become perhaps the most visible XML success story to date. RSS democratizes news distribution by making everyone a potential news provider. It leverages the Web's most valuable asset, content, and makes displaying high-quality relevant news on your site easy. Soon we'll see RSS portals with user-rated channels, cool RSS site of the day, build your own topic-specific portal, and highly relevant search engines. A collective weblog would be another intriguing possibility. May the best content win.  http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/3.html RSS is not limited to your computer screen.  RSS feeds can also be sent to PDA's, cell phones, email ticklers and even voice updates. Email newsletters can easily be automated with RSS. “Even more compelling, affiliate networks and partners of like-minded sites (say a collection of Linux sites) can harvest each other's RSS feeds, and automatically display the new stories from the other sites in the network, driving more traffic throughout.” http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/    Technical information that seems very important but is way over my head, so I’m not even going to attempt to paraphrase it Each RSS channel can contain up to 15 items and is easily parsed using Perl or other open source software. If you want more details on creating RSS files see Jonathan Eisenzopf's excellent article in the February issue of Web Techniques. But you don't have to worry about the details, we've made it easy to create your own RSS channel with free open source scripts, all Web based. More on these later. Once you've created and validated your RSS text file, register it at the various aggregators, and watch the hits roll in. Any site can now grab and display your feed regularly, driving traffic your way. Update your RSS file, and all the external sites that subscribe to your feed will be automatically updated. What can be easier? (http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/)   Here are the basics of RSS (no matter what the version – there are currently 7 versions)  1.	It is XML. This means it must be well-formed, include a prolog and DTD, and all elements must be closed.  2.	The first element in the document is the   element. This includes a mandatory version attribute.  3.	The next element is the   element. This is the main container for all RSS data.  4.	The ""title"" element is the title, either of the entire site (if it's at the top) or of the current item (if it's within an  ).  5.	The ""link"" element indicates the URL of the Web page that corresponds to the RSS feed, or if it's within an  , the URL to that item.  6.	The   element describes the RSS feed or the item.  7.	The   element is the meat of the feed. These are all the headlines (""title""), URLs (""link"") and descriptions that will be in your feed. http://webdesign.about.com/cs/rss/a/aa052603a.htm   Examples Below are just two examples of the thousands of sites who use RSS.

39X1EJI,male,40,"Not a rock group, not a geology database, but “data about data”. Are we allowed to say “data about data”? Find out in Jeromy Caballero’s extended definition:   The term metadata is most frequently used in connection with technology. However, its most general definition is simply data about data. Mark Taylor, an editor with the Global Spacial Data Infrastructure Association (GSDI), has said: ""Metadata is the term used to describe the summary information or characteristics of a set of data. This very general definition includes an almost limitless spectrum of possibilities ranging from human-generated textual description of a resource to machine-generated data that may be useful to software applications.""1  Library Trends offers this definition: ""Metadata is the value-added information that documents the administrative, descriptive, preservation, technical, and usage history and characteristics associated with resources.""2   In this sense, metadata is anything from the name and address on a stamped envelope to special tags describing a packet of information traversing the Internet. Metadata could even be background information providing context for an article or a story.  Taylor also describes metadata as something that allows knowledge about data to persist from user to user. For example, as people leave an organization, knowledge about certain data might be lost if that data is undocumented.1 But if metadata—additional information describing that data—is attached to the data, knowledge of the data’s use and value can be preserved for future users.  Therefore, metadata can be defined as an interoperability enabler, providing an environment in which two systems can work together by making data from each system usable by the other system. The metadata is the common context in which the systems can cooperate and work with the same data. ""The application of metadata is critical in the digital environment,"" observes Library Technology Reports, ""because it allows a digital object or collection to be understood by both machines and humans in ways that promote interoperability.""3  However, not only does metadata create context for interoperability, but it serves as a transmission/communication enabler that facilitates packaging, transmitting, routing, receiving, interpreting, and applying data over the Internet. Metadata accompanies all the data that crosses the Internet, allowing it to be correctly transmitted and correctly used when it reaches its destination, wherever that destination might be.   Because of the wide variety of data that crosses the Internet, and because its potential destinations are often unknown, the metadata that accompanies data transmitted over the Internet is complex and must account for a large array of possible uses. This metadata is difficult to incorporate into an information system that expects very specific, tailored metadata. ""The metadata required to describe the highly heterogeneous, mixed_media objects on the Internet,"" observes Library Trends, ""is infinitely more complex than simple metadata for resource discovery of textual documents through a library database.""2 According to InfoWorld, the data that crosses the Internet is being collected by data stores at its destination, but the metadata is often being discarded as unuseable by those data stores. New methods of creating metadata that serves both to transmit the data and to effectively catalogue it in an information management system are the inevitable result.4   This is the type of metadata that ""provides the underlying foundation upon which digital asset management systems rely to provide fast, precise access to relevant resources across networks and between organizations.""2   Not only do organizations need data to be transmitted, they need data to be efficiently catalogued and easily retrievable. Information Management Journal offers this definition of metadata:  ""Traditionally, the term `metadata' has been widely used to characterize the descriptive information that will support search and retrieval of both paper and electronic material. Over the past three or four years the use of the term metadata has expanded to include additional information that must be acquired and retained in order to effectively manage electronic records over long period[s] of time, including permanently.""5  Metadata is a storage and retrieval facilitator that enables organizations and even groups of organizations to catalogue, archive, and access data accurately and effectively in information management systems. Data entered into a database, for example, is accompanied by metadata describing that data in many different ways. This metadata allows the data to be searched and retrieved in a variety of contexts.   Finally, metadata can be defined as a supplemental resource for data.   ""Metadata is needed to describe both external and internal characteristics of the resource,"" explains Library Journal. ""External metadata explains and maintains those critical relationships among different versions of the same content.... Internal metadata allows for the description of the content of the resource at the desired level of granularity.""6  When a video camera records a segment of footage, for example, it might also record supplemental information such as the time, the pan, angle, amount of light, and so forth. This information is metadata by dint of its accompanying the actual footage and being data about data. In a book, supplemental data is often gathered in an appendix, and data about the overall contents of the book is gathered in an index. In these cases, the data establishes the context in which the metadata has value, not the other way around.      Sources:  1 http://www.gsdi.org/pubs/cookbook/chapter03.html  2 Hunter, Jane L.

39X1EJI,male,40,Blogging is new thing to me.  Just thought I'd take it for a test dive.
39X1EJI,male,40,"An old boss once told me I was “extensible”, I was thrilled.  Didn’t that mean he thought I was forward compatible, able to be extended beyond my current abilities? Wow! What a compliment! Later on, I realized he actually meant to say that I was “expendible”.  Oops. Now that’s a horse of different color. Maybe I’ll suggest that my old boss read the following definition by Tim Carter (which I find not at all expendable):     Extensibility seems to be a uniform idea. As I researched this term, I didn’t find different definitions. Most applications of the term were the same in nature. What was different were the strategies and the approaches as extensibility was applied to computer programs or coding by various programmers and application producers.  From the TechWeb Encyclopedia, I found this definition which seemed to be consistent in each of the other resources. (http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm?term=extensible)  “The capability of being expanded or customized. For example, with extensible programming languages, programmers can add new control structures, statements or data types.”  Basically programmers can create the code for applications and operating systems to accept adaptations from third party programmers who wish to extend or diversify the original code. The reasons for extending the capabilities of original code are wide and varied, from adding software to making small ‘personality tweaks’ that can change from programmer to programmer. It is the strategy for implementing extensibility that differs from party to party.  From his Architecture of the World Wide Web, First Edition Ian Jacobs writes, “Designers can facilitate the transition process by making careful choices about extensibility during the design of a language or protocol specification. Language designers SHOULD provide mechanisms that allow any party to create extensions that do not interfere with conformance to the original specification.” This seems to be a holistic approach and one that, in the community of pure programming, exists – flying in the face of free enterprise. For example, Bill Gates and Microsoft do not allow extensions to their software except in a very narrow and controlled capacity because they need to protect the bottom line for their organization. Again from Ian Jacobs, “Application needs determine the most appropriate extension strategy for a specification. As part of defining an extensibility mechanism, a specification should set expectations about agent behavior in the face of unrecognized extensions.” These extensibility agents are either allowed at the factory or denied as the strategy of the original programmers dictates.  http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-allow-exts  Utilizing another definition and strategy for implementation, Brian Bershad, et al. in the SPIN Operating System show the need for extensibility not only in applications but in the larger environment of operating systems. “Extensibility needs to be introduced to the extent that allows applications to safely change the operating system's interface and implementation. Extensions allow an application to specialize the underlying operating system in order to achieve a particular level of performance and functionality.”  Bershad, et al. go on to elaborate on operating system extensibility. “The need for extensibility in operating systems is shown clearly by systems such as MS-DOS, Windows, or the Macintosh Operating System. Although these systems were not designed to be extensible, their weak protection mechanisms have allowed application programmers to directly modify operating system data structures and code [Schulman et al. 92]. While individual applications have benefited from this level of freedom, the lack of safe interfaces to either operating system services or operating system extension services has created system configuration ""chaos"" [Draves 93].  http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:riW5fu6hH-gJ:www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/papers/SOSP95/sosp95.ps+extensibility&hl=en  From a global or open perspective, in The Object-Oriented Database System Manifesto Malcolm Atkinson, et al. write that programmers need to write their applications using extensibility “… in the following sense: there is a means to define new types and there is no distinction in usage between system defined and user defined types. Of course, this requirement strengthens that capability by saying that newly created types must have the same status as existing ones.” In other words, programmers should expect extensions, and the programmers doing the extending should respect the original code.  http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/People/clamen/OODBMS/Manifesto/htManifesto/node10.html  Now contrast that ideal, open society to the mandates and licensing of Microsoft products. For Microsoft Visual Studio, a developer tools suite for Windows and Web applications, consumers can purchase this software to create extensibility in other Microsoft products. In the Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 documentation, extensibility and the rules for its use are laid down in no uncertain terms: “Extensibility is the capacity to extend, or stretch, the functionality of the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). The IDE provides you with a programming interface known as the Extensibility object model, a set of powerful, easy-to-understand interfaces for customizing the environment. It allows you to hook into the IDE to create extensions known as add-ins. There are two types of extensibility: built-in and user-designed.   ·         Built-in extensibility features are already contained in the development environment. They're conveniences such as keyboard rebinding, customizable command bars, docked and tab-linked window configurations that you can name and return to at any time, new templates that you can create for the Template wizard, and so forth.  ·         User-designed extensibility features are constructed with code. They take two different forms: add-ins and wizards.""   In addition to these rules, Microsoft also lays down a series of best practice ideas for the use of extensibility. Clearly, Microsoft products are extensible; however, the extensibility is controlled by Microsoft and the consumer must pay to achieve it.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csext/html/csconExtensibilityOverview.asp  The Object-Oriented Database System Manifesto  Malcolm Atkinson, University of Glasgow; François Bancilhon, Altaïr; David DeWitt, University of Wisconsin; Klaus Dittrich, University of Zurich; David Maier, Oregon Graduate Center; Stanley Zdonik, Brown University  SPIN Operating System  Brian N.

39X1EJI,male,40,"Everybody knows that scalability is the rating system used by mountaineers. Or is it a measure of my willingness to check my personal poundage each morning? Nope. For techies like us, this seems like an easy one: scalability basically refers to how well (or not) a computer system can handle increasing loads. But there’s a lot more to it…    Definitions    1.	The ease with which a system or component can be modified to fit the problem area (http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/indexes/glossary/scalability.html).  2.	The capacity of a system to handle increasing load or demand (evolt.org website at http://www.evolt.org/article/Scalability_s_New_Meaning/21/238896/).  3.	The capability of increasing the computing capacity of a website or a computer system—and the site’s or system’s ability to process more operations or transactions in a given period, in particular—by adding more, or more powerful, processor (Computerworld website at http://www.computerworld.com/hardwaretopics/hardware/story/0,10801,46308,00.html)  4.	Scalability is about reducing the time to solution for critical tasks (SAS website at hppt://support.sas.com/rnd/scalability/intro/index.html)  5.	Interface scalability is probably the most relevant to technical communicators.   According to Jeff Freund at CMS Watch (http://www.cmswatch.com/Features/TopicWatch/FeaturedTopci/?feature_id=92) “just as your content management infrastructure must scale to meet your growing web publishing needs, the interfaces to your web content management system must scale to meet the ongoing needs of your organization and editorial team.”  Content and content management needs are growing at astounding rates. Rather than wait for a problem to occur, businesses should invest in scalable systems that can expand with and accommodate their growing content management needs. In order for content management systems to be “scalable,” they must be able to handle any type of and high volumes of content. Content includes not only text but digital media (audio & video) and objects in XML applications.     The traditional way to increase scalability is to add large multi-processor servers. A newer way to increase scalability is to add many small servers. Either way, the term “scalability” usually conjures up images of lots of servers. Even though scalability usually refers to hardware, the data explosion of the information age has forced software developers to make scalability a priority and build applications that can be easily adapted to meet growth demands. Some computer languages (Java, VB, C) are more scalable than others. The reason for focus on hardware rather than software to improve scalability is that it costs less to buy big machines than it does to build efficient programs.        The concept of scalability is further broken down into two types referred to as vertical (scaling up) and horizontal (scaling out). Scaling up is achieved by adding large servers, multi-processors, or even a mainframe computer; and scaling out is achieved by adding many small servers. Vertical scaling (large servers) is most effectively used for back-end databases because database transactions work better when ran from a single application—think here of the powerful processing needed to run financial transactions for large banks. Horizontal scaling (small servers) is usually easier and faster to implement than vertical scaling and can be effectively used to run multiple copies of Web or application software because these transactions work when ran from different applications.   Windows new COM+ component architecture that comes with their 2000 operating system handles multiple transactions by balancing the load through distributed computing (multiple servers). It can be set to allow multiple transactions for Web applications or require separate transactions to maintain data integrity in high-volume databases.  	 Whether to scale up with large powerful processors or scale out with small servers depends on how large a company’s database is and the number of transactions that occur on their web applications. As a rule of thumb, when a company’s data storage needs exceed four processors, it’s time to consider scaling up.    The task of assessing scalability usually falls to engineers who are responsible for the company’s technical infrastructure. Engineers assess not only how well their existing applications respond to increased data storage and retrieval demands but how well their applications run with added resources (servers, etc.). Linear scalability means that with fixed resources performance decreases as demand increases, and when server resources increase with demand performance improves. Because people want information on demand, scalability is also about speed.    Many Content Management System (CMS) interfaces begin to break down when content demands increase, but interface scalability problems are harder to identify than technical scalability problems. Web-based interfaces are especially prone to problems. Common web-based interface scalability problems are: limited bulk operation options so that operators are forced to perform the same tasks over and over again, collaboration features that allow usage to grow beyond system scalability, content is difficult to find because it’s not separated into functional units, and lack of behavior-based filtering which would eliminate content hunting problems not solved by permission based filtering. So, to keep editorial teams productive and satisfied, decision makers need to consider interface as well as technical scalability needs."
39X1EJI,male,40,"WORKFLOW   I’ll give you three guesses on this one.  How about “Workflow is the flow of work”?  Fork please, my job here is done.     Definition provided by Gary Hernandez     Workflow   Last week I read an article from ASTD’s magazine, T&D, which addressed workflow in terms of learning while working.  The article spoke to the efficiencies of employees learning while engrossed in on-the-job activities.  The efficiencies are realized when employees do not have to remove themselves from work to attend learning events about work.  Hence productivity improves and, perhaps, the knowledge is further embedded through kinesthetic means.  When I saw workflow in the list of terms for us to define, I jumped right on it thinking I was at least on article ahead of the game.  Alas, much like granularity, semantics, and life cycle, workflow is yet another term that has a differential meaning in the context of content management than it does in other fields.      Rockley on workflow   “Workflow, as its name implies, is the way tasks flow through a cycle on their way to getting a job done” (Rockley 228).  According to Rockley, workflow in its simplest form articulates the path from the first task of a work plan to each successive milestone and task through to completion.  Workflow could be illustrated in a traditional flowchart or swimlane diagram.  One would presume a PERT chart and Gantt chart could be used as well. The importance is that players, tasks, and process are clearly delineated.   The players are people and roles that complete each task, the tasks are discreet units of work, and processes indicate the flow and interdependencies of the tasks.  Workflow can also be automated.     “Workflow 101,” Jim Miniham  Jim Miniham states that workflow is not a definitive term.  Miniham points out that the term originated in the manufacturing industry where it had organizational implications.  In the manufacturing world workflow referred to the flow of a product through its entire production life span: how long the product spent in each stage of production, how many items moved through a given work location, and even where specific products were at any given time.  In the software industry, workflow came to mean the “routing and distribution” of documents as well as everything that happened to it along the way, including who touched it, how long it spend in what location, and its status at any given time.  With such a wide span of functionality, the word workflow began to be applied to any number of applications that approximated any stage production.  In addition, workflow began to be applied with production-class tools as well.  In this realm workflow expanded its influence from tracking products to being critical in managing the production process.     “The Wild, Wild World of Workflow,” Molly W. Joss  Molly Joss, similar to Jim Miniham, indicates that workflow is terminally ubiquitous and can stand to mean any number of things depending on the context.  Postmoderm implications aside, workflow principally means the configuration of work processes.  From this standpoint, all organizations engaged in work are in engaged in workflow.  How one manages workflow is perhaps what people are really talking about when they mention the term.  To help in that management process, of course, is quite a plethora of computer applications.  Joss cites three types of workflow tools available in the graphic arts industry:  ·         Task-oriented workflow tools which “automate or simplify a specific prepress task” (62).  ·         RIP-centric workflow systems for a full system that address the entire workflow paradigm  ·         Workflow analysis tools to help “capture and calculate data on various prepress processes” (67).    Joss concludes that the ability of workflow applications to improve productivity has given rise to a world of workflow vendors, giving would be organizations wishing to optimize workflow through automation the blessing of choice and curse of choice.    “Why Workflow Works,” Robert B. Segal  To the relatively flat discussion of workflow, Robert Segal adds a refreshing twist.  The benefit of automating workflow is, yes, improved productivity through efficient use of resources, but the beneficiary of that productivity is the customer.  Segal notes that “Workflow automation systems are designed to ensure that information is processed efficiently, all activities are monitored and measured and expectations are reported” (94).  The key for Segal in workflow is the monitoring and reporting functionality that gives the line manager the ability to respond to and correct workflow deficiencies that often directly effect the customers.   With this in mind, the marriage of workflow management with customer insight data produces Customer Relationship Management (CRM).  Segal sees workflow management as the foundation to CRM.           “Workflow,” Tom Singer  Tom Singer quotes Workflow Management Coalition as “the automation of a business process, in whole or part, during which documents, information, or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules” (34).  Singer notes that workflow optimization is not only about managing productivity and maximizing efficiencies, it can also help manage maintenance issues.  The point is that maintenance is also driven by workflow processes and hence can reap doubly—1) by improving efficiencies and 2) as maintenance becomes more efficient, the benefits of maintenance can be brought to bear more quickly on the organization.      Conclusion  Workflow principally focuses on maximizing efficiency in the processes embedded in a work plan.  Though originating in manufacturing, it can be applied to any environment which has work processes but perhaps reap more benefit in an automated work stream.  The benefits of workflow management can be felt in productivity, customer service, and even in some collateral areas such as maintenance and training.

39X1EJI,male,40,"EPPS (ELECRONTIC PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEM)     And now, ladies and gentlemen, the  Lord of the Blog  is pleased to present . . . the EPPS, the Web’s hit system.  Or, at least it’s one of the systems that can be used electronically, anyway.  An EPSS key features are its electronic nature, immediate accessibility, and. . . hey.  If you want to know more, you’ll just have to read extended definition.       What is an Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)?  If we simply look at the words “Electronic Performance Support System” we can begin to form an idea of what it means—an electronic system that supports performance.  Of course this is almost too simple a definition, and a bit more detail is needed in order to fully understand what EPSS is.    Starting with the root of EPSS, we will begin our discussion with a definition provided by Gloria Grey, the individual given credit for originating EPSS. According to Grey, EPSS is “an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate, individualized on-line access to the full range of information, software, guidance, advice, and assistance, data, images, tools, and assessment and monitoring systems to permit job performance with minimal support and intervention by others” (Sleight, 1993). I’d like to point out several key words addressed in Grey’s definition because they will be reoccurring themes as we move on to further discuss the definition of EPSS. The words “electronic,” “immediate” and “permits job performance” typify the essential elements of EPSS.   The definition above mentions “electronic;” however, the broad term electronic leaves much open to interpretation. The following definition taken from Hyperdictionary differs from that above in that it further defines “electronic” by listing the types of information EPSS’s display such as text, graphical displays, sound and video. EPSS is described as “A system that provides electronic task guidance and support to the user at the moment of need. EPSS can provide application help, reference information, guided instructions and/or tutorials, subject matter expert advice and hints on how to perform a task more efficiently. An EPSS can combine various technologies to present the desired information. The information can be in the form of text, graphical displays, sound, and video presentations.”   Following closely with Grey’s idea of EPSS, the following definitions also explains EPSS as an electronic system that provides the user with instant information needed to efficiently perform a task. According to HPT Quick Reference Guide, “The Electronic version of Performance Support Systems is one of numerous tools of the technology age that provide workers with almost instant access to information vital to do their jobs.”  Similarly, a source sited in an essay by Tony Mostek defines EPSS as “An integration of artificial intelligence technologies, hypermedia, and computer-based training to produce a system whose components include embedded training, hypermedia help, artificial intelligence based coaches, and adaptable, model-based user interfaces.” (Mostek)   Although most of the definitions of EPSS specifically stress the electronic portion, the definition below takes a more generalized approach in describing EPSS in that no mention is made of electronic or technologies used. In fact, the definition is so broad that it could even apply to a paper-based system provided it offered problem solving and learning opportunities immediately available to the user. Another source identified in Mostek’s essay describes EPSS as “A human activity system that is able to manipulate large amounts of task related information in order to provide both a problem solving capability and learning opportunities to augment human performance in a job task by providing information and concepts in either a linear or nonlinear way, as and when they are required by the user.” (Mostek)   What can we discern from the definitions we’ve discussed? In short, EPSS’s consist of or perform the following: •	Are Predominantly Electronic •	Are Immediately available to the user •	Assist user in performing tasks •	Present information in forms such as software guidance and assistance, data, images, tools, computer based training, subject matter expert advice and assessment and monitoring tools •	Utilize technologies such as hypermedia, text, graphical displays, sound, and video      Resources  Albert Sleight, Deborah, (1993).

39X1EJI,male,40,"ASSOCIATIONS (HIERARCHY & TAXONOMY)     “Isn’t taxonomy the art of stuffing dead animals?” you might ask.  Well, not quite, though your characterization of the word “taxonomy” can serve as an association with the term taxidermy.  In this extended definition by Ms. Alison Leyda Straquadine, associations are discussed in detail from their origins to their present-day well, associations with hierarchy and taxonomy.    There are many definitions of association. Following are the definitions of association I consider most relevant to a discussion of content management.  Something linked in memory or imagination with a thing or person  the process of forming mental connections or bonds between sensations, ideas, or memories Empiricism, a theory that all knowledge originates in experience, started with Aristotle. Aristotle accepted the concept of association (connection between ideas/events) as the process through which experience is converted to knowledge. When people associate ideas and/or events, one triggers the other.   Taking association beyond the knowledge stage, the theory was further developed by philosophers and learning theorists to become one of the two main behavioral learning theories. Association is a behavioral theory because it holds that memory and behavior are stimulated through associative ideas and events.  Association as a connection between ideas and events is related to connectionism, contiguity, and situated learning theories. E Thorndike created the theory of connectionism which holds that we learn by forming associations between stimuli and response. E. Guthrie’s contiguity theory gets into the behavioral domain. Contiguity theory holds that a stimulus accompanied by movement will result trigger the same movement when it recurs. (The stimulus response theory led to Pavlovian research and the behavioral tradition).  James Mill defined contiguity as complex ideas made up of simple sensations that have become association with each other. Because the more we experience contiguous (close together in time or space) events the more strongly we associate with them, contiguous events can change behavior. Consistent with contiguity theory which holds that learning involves the conditioning of behavior, instruction must present specific tasks ( urlLink http://www.educationaau.edu.au/archives/cp/04b.htm ).  J. Lave came up with situated learning theory which holds that we learn through social interaction. The focus of situated learning theory is on “learning by doing”  urlLink (http://otec.uoregon.edu/lerning_theory.htm) . On this website, I found Greg Kearsley’s discussion of Jean Lave particularly relevant to the social interaction and learning that takes place in our online discussions in this class. In it, Kearsley states that learners become involved in a community of practice which embodies certain beliefs and behaviors to be acquired. As the beginner or newcomer moves from the periphery of this community to its center, they become more active and engaged within the culture and hence assume the role of expert or oldtimer. I found Kearsley’s statement relevant to class community because I can see myself moving from the periphery to the center as I become more familiar and comfortable with how the online seminars work.    Also related to association theory are hierarchy and taxonomy. Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs which evolves from physiological, safety/security/protection, belonging/love/affection, and self-esteem to self-actualization, can be applied to learning theories and teaching strategies. A humanistic orientation to Maslow’s hierarchy holds that as people fulfill each subsequent need on the hierarchy, the are motivated to fulfill th next. Therefore, people who have fulfilled the lower level needs of security and affection are motivated to fulfill the higher level needs of self-esteem and self-actualization through learning.    Taxonomy is defined as the study of the general principles of scientific classification. In Benjamin Bloom’s famous taxonomy of learning domains, he classifies learning into three domains (cognitive/mental, affective/emotional, and psychomotor/physical) which he further divides into hierarchical step staring with the simplest and progressing to the most complex. The cognitive domain begins with knowledge (recall of data) and moves from comprehension (interpretation), application, and analysis, to synthesis, and finally to evaluation. Bloom developed the classification and hierarchy of the cognitive domain, and his buddy David Krathwohl developed the classification and hierarchy of the affective domain. The guy that was supposed to develop the psychomotor domain with Bloom and Krathwohl didn’t do it, but others have developed it since.     In Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals, Handbook 1: the Cognitive Domain, Bloom devotes an entire chapter to defining the difference between taxonomy and classifications and discusses the problems with hierarchies. Bloom decided to go with a hierarchy to develop the cognitive domain because each area tended to build on behaviors from the previous class.   Familiarity with the theories of association (connections between ideas), hierarchy (information that builds from previous information) and taxonomy (classification schemas) may become more useful to us as we get into the content reuse, maps and information architecture aspects of our content management plan."

We go back to a party FULL of nut ass dudes trying to fight.  Apparently, roid rage is waaay cool in the Ville.  I have to mention the rowdy motherfucker in the black wifebeater last night who stood and screamed in me and Obeazy's face for a full 5 minutes. That boy was kind of insane hahahahaha. About 2 or 3 my man Cotten takes a header off the top stair and plummets to a neck cracking near death and splits his HEAD open. Blood everywhere.  Mama Bears is mad. So kids are fighting, puking, passing out, funneling, hooking up, and cracking their heads open.  Obviously, this was the best party I have been to in a loooong time. The boys kept some weird old ladies warm for the night, and Luke was bullied into asking for her number. Way to go boys!

I added some background fireworks but they were kind of annoying so I took them out. I also added this popup when you enter the blog that says welcome to my blog and make sure to sign my guestbook and other stuff like that.

In the morning, we went to Lost Island for the Cedar Valley Medical Specialists picnic thingy. It was really fun but it started to get boring after a while because Lost Island only has like 8 slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool. We spent about 3 hours there. Then, I went to Ben, Andrew, and Alex's Eagle ceremony. An Eagle is the highest rank of boy scouting. Later, there's another Indian party thing. That's about it."

This was my 3rd year at CY-TAG. CY-TAG was awesome this year. Sam and Shrikar were the only people I knew from last year. My roommate was Kavin. I knew him before CY-TAG so that made things easier. I took Chemistry this year. Weekends were the most fun. We could sleep in whatever room we wanted. I liked this year of CY-TAG better than last year. A ton of people came back from last year for the last dance. Emily, John, Abby and some other people came back. Besides class, CY-TAG was great. I never wanted to leave. I hope a lot of people come back next year. After CY-TAG, I had Order of the Arrow for Boy Scouts. I couldn't eat or talk for 24 hours. I didn't mind the eating or the talking part. In the morning, we had to do like 8-10 hours of service. It was waaaaaaaaaay boring and there were a ton of mosquitoes. After Order of the Arrow was over, they gave us a ton of food. After Order of the Arrow, I haven't been doing much. I've just been playing a lot of tennis with Dev and seeing some pretty good movies. I had a tennis tournament on Thursday and Friday. I did horrible. That 's pretty much my summer so far."
U5YQQW4,male,13,"I just figured out that as soon as I get a blogger it seems like everyone now has a livejournal or a xanga. Kate has a blogger, too so I'm not all alone. Yesterday was pretty boring. I didn't do much all day. Towards like 5:00 I played tennis with Dev, Nina, and Jasmine. Then Dev came over for a little bit and we set stuff on fire. Then, I had Karate at 8:00. I didn't do so well because I ate right before and I realized that you probably shouldn't eat right before you exercise. But anyways, it started out pretty good but there was a ton of way hard exercises. Then, we had to do break faults. Break faults is where we learn how to fall. It's how you land so you don't get hurt. I was doing pretty good at the front, side, and back break faults but I stunk at the ones where we were thrown. It took me forever to finally get it right. I felt kind of embarassed because I'm a brown belt and even blue belts could do it. That's pretty much it for karate. It was a boring day as usual. I think I'm going to Lost Island (a water park) tomorrow, though. So I'm looking forward to that."

U5YQQW4,male,13,"I didn't wake up until 10:00 today. Jasmine had some people come over at 1:00 for dance practice and they didn't leave until like 7:30. I had to do the music because they couldn't or wouldn't do it themselves. Can you imagine? 6 hours of indian songs. It's a nightmare. So then, when they left, Jasmine told me that she needs a file splitted, converted, and burned by tomorrow (or today since it's after 12:00). So I spent an hour doing that. That's pretty much it for today. Tomorrow (or today) there's a karate kamiza. It's where a black belt get's promoted. They're not boring it's just that your feet fall asleep when you sit down forever. It's supossed to be unlike any we've seen before because the black belt getting promoted is like a 7th dan (degree). So I guess that's it."

4AN3082,male,37,"I am a fan of George Monbiot and saw this on Znet also: http://zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=40&ItemID=3318  One Rule For Them... Does The US Support The Geneva Convention Or Doesn't It? by George Monbiot; March 25, 2003      Suddenly, the government of the United States has discovered the virtues of international law. It may be waging an illegal war against a sovereign state; it may be seeking to destroy every treaty which impedes its attempts to run the world, but when five of its captured soldiers were paraded in front of the Iraqi television cameras on Sunday, Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, immediately complained that ""it is against the Geneva Convention to show photographs of prisoners of war in a manner that is humiliating for them.""1      He is, of course, quite right. Article 13 of the third convention, concerning the treatment of prisoners, insists that they ""must at all times be protected ... against insults and public curiosity.""2 This may number among the less heinous of the possible infringements of the laws of war, but the conventions, ratified by Iraq in 1956, are non-negotiable. If you break them, you should expect to be prosecuted for war crimes.      This being so, Rumsfeld had better watch his back. For this enthusiastic convert to the cause of legal warfare is, as head of the defense department, responsible for a series of crimes sufficient, were he ever to be tried, to put him away for the rest of his natural life.      His prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba, where 641 men (nine of whom are British citizens) are held, breaches no fewer than 15 articles of the third convention. The US government broke the first of these (article 13) as soon as the prisoners arrived, by displaying them, just as the Iraqis have done, on television. In this case, however, they were not encouraged to address the cameras. They were kneeling on the ground, hands tied behind their backs, wearing blacked-out goggles and ear phones. In breach of article 18, they had been stripped of their own clothes and deprived of their possessions. They were then interned in a penitentiary (against article 22), where they were denied proper mess facilities (26), canteens (28), religious premises (34), opportunities for physical exercise (38), access to the text of the convention (41), freedom to write to their families (70 and 71) and parcels of food and books (72).3      They were not ""released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities"" (118), because, the US authorities say, their interrogation might, one day, reveal interesting information about Al Qaeda. Article 17 rules that captives are obliged to give only their name, rank, number and date of birth. No ""coercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever."" In the hope of breaking them, however, the authorities have confined them to solitary cells and subjected them to what is now known as ""torture lite"": sleep deprivation and constant exposure to bright light.4 Unsurprisingly, several of the prisoners have sought to kill themselves, by smashing their heads against the walls or trying to slash their wrists with plastic cutlery.5      The US government claims that these men are not subject to the Geneva Conventions, as they are not ""prisoners of war"", but ""unlawful combatants"". The same claim could be made, with rather more justice, by the Iraqis holding the US soldiers who illegally invaded their country. But this re-definition is itself a breach of article 4 of the third convention, under which people detained as suspected members of a militia (the Taliban) or a volunteer corps (Al Qaeda) must be regarded as prisoners of war.      Even if there is doubt about how such people should be classified, article 5 insists that they ""shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.""6 But when, earlier this month, lawyers representing sixteen of them demanded a court hearing, the US Court of Appeals ruled that as Guantanamo Bay is not sovereign US territory, the men have no constitutional rights. Many of these prisoners appear to have been working in Afghanistan as teachers, engineers or aid workers. If the US government either tried or released them, its embarrassing lack of evidence would be brought to light.      You would hesitate to describe these prisoners as lucky, unless you knew what had happened to some of the other men captured by the Americans and their allies in Afghanistan. On 21 November 2001, around 8,000 Taliban soldiers and Pashtun civilians surrendered at Konduz to the Northern Alliance commander General Abdul Rashid Dostum. Many of them have never been seen again. As Jamie Doran's film ""Afghan Massacre - Convoy of Death"" records, some hundreds, possibly thousands, of them were loaded into container lorries at Qala-i-Zeini, near the town of Mazar-i-Sharif, on 26 and 27 November.7 The doors were sealed and the lorries were left to stand in the sun for several days. At length, they departed for Sheberghan prison, 120 km away. The prisoners, many of whom were dying of thirst and asphixiation, started banging on the sides of the trucks. Dostum's men stopped the convoy and machine-gunned the containers. When they arrived at Sheberghan, most of the captives were dead.8      The US special forces running the prison watched the bodies being unloaded. They instructed Dostum's men to ""get rid of them before satellite pictures can be taken.""9 Doran interviewed a Northern Alliance soldier guarding the prison. ""I was a witness when an American soldier broke one prisoner's neck. The Americans did whatever they wanted. We had no power to stop them.""10 Another soldier alleged, ""They took the prisoners outside and beat them up and then returned them to the prison. But sometimes they were never returned and they disappeared.""11      Many of the survivors were loaded back into the containers with the corpses, then driven out to a place in the desert called Dasht-i-Leili. In the presence of between 30 and 40 US special forces, both the living and the dead were dumped into ditches. Anyone who moved was shot. The German newspaper Die Zeit investigated the claims and concluded that ""No one doubted that the Americans had taken part. Even at higher levels there are no doubts on this issue.""12 The US group Physicians for Human Rights visited the places identified by Doran's witnesses and found that they ""all ... contained human remains consistent with their designation as possible gravesites.""13      It should not be necessary to point out that hospitality of this kind also contravenes the third Geneva convention, which prohibits ""violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"", as well as extra-judicial execution. Donald Rumsfeld's department, assisted by a pliant media, has done all it can to suppress Jamie Doran's film,14 while General Dostum has begun to assassinate his witnesses.15      It is not hard, therefore, to see why the US government fought first to prevent the establishment of the International Criminal Court and then to ensure that its own citizens are not subject to its jurisdiction. The five soldiers dragged in front of the cameras yesterday should thank their lucky stars that they are prisoners not of the American forces fighting for civilisation, but of the ""barbaric and inhuman"" Iraqis.      www.monbiot.com      References:      1.

4AN3082,male,37,"ZNet | Terror War  Good Wars, Cold Wars by Mickey Z; March 24, 2003      On Feb. 10, 2003, the headline of my hometown tabloid, the New York Post, was a single word: SACRIFICE. Below was a photo of the American Cemetery in Normandy, France. To the right (in more ways than one), columnist Steve Dunleavy began his discourse: ""As I gaze out at this cemetery-the final resting place of nearly 10,000 American kids who made the ultimate sacrifice to save France from Hitler-my heart fills with rage. Where are French now, as Americans prepare to put their soldiers on the line to fight today's Hitler, Saddam Hussein? Talking appeasement. Wimping out. How can they have forgotten?""      In one short paragraph, Dunleavy had managed to tie together a wide swath of tried and true propaganda tactics. The dead are "" kids who made the ultimate sacrifice."" They weren't drafted into a war to kill other humans; they set out to ""save France from Hitler."" Since Saddam Hussein is ""today's Hitler,"" the mistake of ""appeasement"" could only be made those who have ""forgotten"" old lessons. ""Comparing the leader with Hitler is a good start because of the instant images that Hitler's name provokes,"" explains historian Phillip Knightley.      Vanquishing the epitome of evil has granted Uncle Sam and his boys the freedom to intervene practically at will across the globe ever since. After all, who could question U.S. motives when it saved the world from Hitler? This humanitarian spin, forged on the battlefields of the Second World War, cloaks U.S. policy in the benevolent robes of ""The Good War.""      Another current similarity to WWII is the patronizing and racist presupposition that the Iraqis are either unwilling or unable to challenge American might. After a day of ""unexpected"" setbacks (March 23, 2003), however, General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff changed his tune, admitting: ""Clearly they are not a beaten force. This is going to get a lot harder.'      This brings to mind U.S. attitudes towards the Japanese before Pearl Harbor. With clear signals that Japan was planning what Dubya might dub a ""preemptive war,"" why were the Americans caught with their pants down on December 7? Never underestimate the collective power of arrogance and bigotry: ""Many Americans, including Roosevelt, dismissed the Japanese as combat pilots because they were all presumed to be 'near-sighted',"" writes Kenneth C. Davis. ""There was also a sense that any attack on Pearl Harbor would be easily repulsed.""      Anti-war protestors in Germany took notice of a third Good War parallel when they held up signs that compared Baghdad to Dresden. The terror bombing of large cities (Dresden, Hamburg, Tokyo, etc.) is nothing new. The U.S. engaged in ""shock and awe"" campaigns long before the term was coined. As Huxley said, ""The propagandist's purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human."" Once your opponent has been demonized, such behavior is not only accepted; it's demanded.      After WWII, the much-ballyhooed Marshall Plan served to line the pockets of U.S. corporations through lucrative reconstruction contracts. Europe was provided with over $12 billion in loans and grants between 1948 and 1951. In 1949 alone, one-third of U.S. exports to Europe was paid for with Marshall Plan funds.      A March 23, 2003 New York Times article entitled, ""Which Companies Will Put Iraq Back Together?"" brought us back to the future as reporter Diana B. Henriques declared: ""War began last week. Reconstruction starts this week. That, at least, is how it looks to government contract officers, who in the coming days plan to give American companies the first contracts to rebuild Iraq, a task that experts say could eventually cost $25 billion to $100 billion... The United States plans to retain control over the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq, allowing the administration to decide how it will spend the money needed to repair the country... The companies that have been invited to bid on the work include some of the nation's largest and most politically connected construction businesses. Among them are Halliburton, where Vice President Dick Cheney served as chief executive from 1995 until mid-2000; the Bechtel Group, whose ranks have included several Republican cabinet alumni; and Fluor, which has ties to several former top government intelligence and Pentagon procurement officials.""      There is one more1945/2003 connection I'd like to end with:      Since 1989, we've lived in a one-superpower world. While pining for the Evil Empire-its fail-safe excuse for foreign entanglement-the United States has predictably intensified its already prodigious rate of military interventions. Eschewing the standard M.O. of secrecy and disinformation, post-Cold War presidents have become increasingly bold in detailing their war crimes before they are even committed. Such arrogance can only be chalked up to a feeling of invulnerability that comes with being the only muscle on the block.      Concurrently, the unfortunately-named ""anti-globalization"" movement has taken center stage, forcing corporate heads to re-think where and when they meet. Also, as the build-up in Iraq commenced, peace rallies of astonishing size have been held in cities across the globe. The largest peace movement in the history of mankind is in full effect...today.      The U.S. came out of WWII in a position of unprecedented power but soon found itself butting heads with a second superpower. Post-Iraq, American leaders and their corporate owners also have a superpower to contend with-the people-and this Cold War will be much different.

4AN3082,male,37,"urlLink On the edge of lunacy.   British foreign aid is now targeted at countries willing to sell off their assets to big business   Teaser: Aid has always been an instrument of foreign policy. During the cold war, it was used to buy the loyalties of states that might otherwise have crossed to the other side. Even today, the countries that receive the most money tend to be those that are of greatest strategic use to the donor nation, which is why the US gives more to Israel than it does to sub-Saharan Africa. .... But foreign policy is also driven by commerce, and in particular by the needs of domestic exporters. Aid goes to countries that can buy our manufacturers' products. Sometimes it doesn't go to countries at all, but straight to the manufacturers. A US government website boasts that ""the principal beneficiary of America's foreign assistance programs has always been the United States. Close to 80% of the US Agency for International Development's contracts and grants go directly to American firms.""  .... What we see here, in other words, is a revival of an ancient British charitable tradition. During the Irish potato famine, the British government made famine relief available to the starving, but only if they agreed to lose their tenancies on the land. The 1847 Poor Law Extension Act cleared Ireland for the landlords. Today, the British government is helping the corporations to seize not only the land from the poor, but also the water, the utilities, the mines, the schools, the health services and anything else they might find profitable. And you and I are paying for it."
4AN3082,male,37,"April 10, 2004,   ... The 160,000 occupation forces, backed by mass destruction technology, are now deemed insufficient in the fight against the Sunni diehards and the Shiite unrepresentative extremists. Furthermore, many thousands of foreign fighters have indeed come ""flooding"" into Iraq - not terrorists sent by bin Laden but mercenaries hired by the occupation authorities. Their role is to carry out dangerous tasks, to help reduce US Army casualties.  This is in addition to the Pentagon's Israeli-trained special assassination squads. Iraqis now believe that some of the recent assassinations of scientists and academics were perpetrated by these hit squads. A similar campaign of assassinations in Vietnam claimed the lives of 41,000 people between 1968 and 1971.  The unleashing of F-16 fighter bombers, Apache helicopter gunships and ""precisely"" targeted bombs and tank fire on heavily populated areas is making the streets of Baghdad, Fallujah and the southern cities resemble those of occupied Palestine. Sharon-style tactics and brutality are now the favoured methods of the US-led occupation forces - including the torture of prisoners, who now number more than 10,000.  Opposing Saddam's tyranny was never the same thing as welcoming invasion and the tyranny of occupation.  There is little doubt that the resistance will spread to new areas of Baghdad and the south, with the intense anti-occupation feelings of the people turning into more militant forms of protest....  .... many Iraqis have decided that the peaceful road to evict the occupiers is not leading anywhere. They didn't need Sadr to tell them this. They were told it loudly and brutally a few days ago by a US Abrams tank, one of many facing unarmed demonstrators not far from the infamous Saddam statue that was toppled a year ago. The tank crushed to death two peaceful demonstrators protesting against the closure of a Sadr newspaper by Paul Bremer, the self-declared champion of free speech in Iraq. The tragic irony wasn't lost on Iraqis.  Nor did they fail to notice article 59 of the new US-engineered constitution, which puts the new US-founded Iraqi armed forces under the command of the occupation forces, which will, in turn, be ""invited"" to stay in Iraq by the new sovereign government after the ""handover of power"" in June. This occupation force will be backed by 14 large US military bases and the biggest US embassy in the world, tellingly based at Saddam's republican palace in Baghdad....."

4AN3082,male,37,"And another good article from John Pilger. Published on ZNet.   Six Days Of Shame by John Pilger; March 26, 2003      TODAY is a day of shame for the British military as it declares the Iraqi city of Basra, with a stricken population of 600,000, a ""military target"".      You will not read or hear those words in the establishment media that claims to speak for Britain.      But they are true. With Basra, shame is now our signature, forged by Blair and Bush.      Having destroyed its water and power supplies, cut off food supply routes and having failed to crack its human defences, they are now preparing to lay siege to Iraq's second city which is more than 40 per cent children.      What an ignominious moment in British history. Here is an impoverished country under attack by a superpower, the United States, which has unimaginable wealth and the world's most destructive weapons, and its ""coalition"" accomplice, Britain, which boasts one of the world's best ""professional"" armies.      Believing their own propaganda, the military brass has been stunned by the Iraqi resistance.      They have tried to belittle the militia defending Basra with lurid stories that its fighters are killing each other.      The truth is that the Iraqis are fighting like lions to defend not a tyrant but their homeland. It is a truth the overwhelming majority of decent Britons will admire.      The historical comparison Tony Blair and his propagandists fear is that of the British defending themselves against invasion. That happened 60 years ago and now ""we"" are the rapacious invaders.      Yesterday, Blair said that 400,000 Iraqi children had died in the past five years from malnutrition and related causes. He said ""huge stockpiles of humanitarian aid"" and clean water awaited them in Kuwait, if only the Iraqi regime would allow safe passage.      In fact, voluminous evidence, including that published by the United Nations Children's Fund, makes clear that the main reason these children have died is an enduring siege, a 12-year embargo driven by America and Britain.      As of last July, $5.4billion worth of humanitarian supplies, approved by the UN and paid for by the Iraqi government, were blocked by Washington, with the Blair government's approval. The former assistant secretary general of the UN, Denis Halliday, who was sent to Iraq to set up the ""oil for food programme"", described the effects of the embargo as ""nothing less than genocide"". Similar words have been used by his successor, Hans Von Sponeck.      Both men resigned in protest, saying the embargo merely reinforced the power of Saddam.      Both called Blair a liar.      And now Blair's troops are firing their wire-guided missiles to ""soften up"" Basra.      I have walked the city's streets, along a road blown to pieces by a US missile. The casualties were children, of course, because children are everywhere. I held a handkerchief over my face as I stood in a school playground with a teacher and several hundred malnourished youngsters.      The dust blew in from the southern battlefields of the 1991 Gulf War, which have never been cleaned up because the US and British governments have denied Iraq the specialist equipment.      The dust, Dr Jawad Al-Ali told me, carries ""the seeds of our death"". In the children's wards of Basra's main hospital, deaths from a range of hitherto unseen cancers are common and specialists have little doubt that up to half the population of southern Iraq will die from cancers linked to the use of a weapon of mass destruction used by the Americans and British - uranium tipped shells and missiles.      ONCE again, the Americans are deploying what Professor Doug Rokke, a former US Army physicist, calls ""a form of nuclear weapon that contaminates everything and everyone"".      Today, each round fired by US tanks contains 4,500 grams of solid uranium, whose particles, breathed or ingested, can cause cancer.      This, and the use by both the Allies of new kinds of cluster bombs, is being covered up.      Once again, the British public is being denied the reality of war.      Images of bandaged children in hospital wards are appearing on TV but you do not see the result of a Tornado's cluster bombing.      You are not being shown children scalped by shrapnel, with legs reduced to bloody pieces of string.      Such images are ""not acceptable"", because they will disturb viewers - and the authorities do not want that. These ""unseen"" images are the truth. Iraqi parents have to look at their mutilated children, so why shouldn't those of us, in whose name they were slaughtered, see what they see?      Why shouldn't we share their pain? Why shouldn't we see the true nature of this criminal invasion?      Other wars were sanitised, allowing them to be repeated.      If you have satellite TV, try to find the Al Jazeera channel, which has distinguished itself with its coverage. When the Americans bombed Afghanistan, one of their ""smart"" bombs destroyed the Al Jazeera office in Kabul. Few believe it was an accident. Rather, it was a testimony to the channel's independent journalism.      Remember, it is not those who oppose this war who need to justify themselves, regardless of Blair's calls to ""support our troops"". There is only one way to support them - bring them home without delay.      In 1932, Iraqis threw out their British colonial rulers. In 1958, they got rid of the Hashemite monarchy.      Iraqis have shown they can overthrow dictators against the odds. So why have they not been able to throw out Saddam?      Because the US and Britain armed him and propped him up while it suited them, making sure that when they tired of him, they would be the only alternative to his rule and the profiteers of his nation's resources. Imperialism has always functioned like that.      The ""new Iraq"", as Blair calls it, will have many models, such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, all of them American conquests and American ruled until Washington allowed a vicious dictatorship to take over.      Saddam only came to power after the Americans helped install his Ba'ath Party in 1979. ""That was my favourite coup,"" said the CIA officer in charge.      Keep in mind the cynicism behind these truths when you next hear Blair's impassioned insincerity - and when you glimpse, if you can, the ""unacceptable"" images of children killed and mangled in your name, and in the cause of what the Prime Minister calls ""our simple patriotism"".      It's the kind of patriotism, wrote Tolstoy, ""that is nothing else but a means of obtaining for the rulers their ambitions and covetous desires, and for the ruled the abdication of human dignity, reason and conscience."""
4AN3082,male,37,"Amid the carnage, questions By Paul McGeough Baghdad March 28 2003  The six cars, bumper-to-bumper against the curb in Al Sha'ab, are carbonised - charred metal now, devoid of all colour and fabric. The power of the blasts flipped another; all that remains of its tyres are the wire coils that ran through the rubber.  Yes, we are in a war zone. But Al Sha'ab is a civilian quarter, a maze of hard-working, hole-in-the-wall mechanics and electricians. And the attacking US-led military promised it would spare civilians.  The Pentagon says that it did not target the marketplace and has left open the possibility that two bombs that fell here on Wednesday morning could have been either American or Iraqi.  But there is no way around the grotesque in this story. There is no nice way to write about how 28-year-old Hisam Madloon, a guard, finds on the pavement the severed head of his boss, Sermat the electrician. Or of how one of his workmates thinks that a gnawed hand, severed at the wrist, might belong to Tahir, an expert on hot-water systems.  How can anyone tell whose are the brains found lying just near the door into one of the workshops? Or be able to recognise the remains of the mechanic who was working under one of the cars when it became a fireball?  How will the news be broken to relatives that two bombs have obliterated a family of five because fate had them driving through this part of town at 11.30am on Wednesday?  People like Sermat and Tahir keep going to workin Al Sha'ab, on the road north from Baghdad. Madloon was asleep, but 55-year-old Salah Yousif was walking up the street. He says: ""I heard the planes overhead and then, two bombs, four seconds apart.""  In the city, I heard two short booms. By the time I got to Al Sha'ab, the last of the dead and injured had been taken away. Blood ran in the muddied street and the facade was ripped from many of the shops. Buildings and cars on both sides were charred black and there were two shallow craters on and next to the roadway. A dozen charred cars lay amid the rubble. Most of the 17 people who died were in cars in the traffic; many of the 45 injured were pedestrians or local workers and residents.  ""Welcome, welcome,"" I'm told by Yousif the witness. He says: ""The Americans always claim they are defending us, but they do the opposite. That is why Saddam is on the right side, fighting this evil. He gives us strength and we give him strength.""  Madloon says that the pregnant woman who lives in this apartment is dead and that the pavement was littered with body parts. ""They said they would attack the army, but this is a civilian area. Why do they do it? Do they know that Iraqis don't change, that we are Iraqis and that we will not change for America?"" he says.  The law of averages says the US was always going to present Iraq with a propaganda gift. But such has been Iraqi impatience that journalists have come away from some civilian damage tours around Baghdad with more questions than answers.  Most of the patients in the hospital they took us to after Baghdad's first night of bombing seemed to have been injured by Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. The orphanage they took us to before the Al Sha'ab bombing did not add up. The Iraq Family Village, home to more than 500 orphans of all ages, is a huge sprawling place, with walled and wired compounds and one building that stood apart from the rest because of what looked like inordinately large air-conditioning units on the roof. Five days ago, its laundry was bombed.  But the Al Sha'ab bombing is the sort of mistake that will play on the minds of Iraqis who might be on the verge of breaking with Saddam. They expect brutality from him - if they step out of line. But they were all minding their own business yesterday when they got it from the US.  Army Major-General Stanley McChrystal, vice-director for operations for the Joint Staff, told a Pentagon briefing: ""Coalition forces did not target a marketplace, nor were any bombs or missiles dropped or fired"" in that district. ""We don't know for a fact whether it was US or Iraqi. We'll continue to look and see if we missed anything. Another possibility is that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery or an Iraqi anti-aircraft missile falling back to earth was responsible.""

4AN3082,male,37,"A drive straight into death     April 2 2003  As an unidentified four-wheel-drive vehicle came barrelling towards an intersection held by troops of the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division, Captain Ronny Johnson grew alarmed. From his position at the intersection, he was heard on the radio to one of his forward platoons of M2 Bradley fighting vehicles, alerting it to a potential threat.  ""Fire a warning shot,"" he ordered as the vehicle kept coming. Then, with increasing urgency, he told the platoon to shoot into its radiator. ""Stop (messing) around,"" Captain Johnson yelled into the company radio network when he saw no action being taken. Finally, he shouted: ""Stop him, Red 1, stop him.""  That order was immediately followed by the loud reports of cannon fire. About half a dozen shots were heard.  ""Cease fire,"" Captain Johnson yelled over the radio. Then, as he peered into his binoculars from the intersection on Highway 9, he roared at the platoon leader: ""You just (expletive) killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough."" So it was that on a warm, hazy day in central Iraq, the fog of war descended on Bravo Company.  Fifteen Iraqi civilians were packed inside the Toyota, along with as many of their possessions as the vehicle could hold. Ten, including five children who appeared to be under five, were killed, Captain Johnson's company reported. Of the five others, one man was so severely injured he was not expected to live.  According to the Pentagon, the vehicle was fired on after the driver ignored shouted orders and warning shots. A statement said the vehicle was a van carrying ""13 women and children"". The statement claimed seven were killed and two injured.  In Doha, Qatar, US Central Command issued a statement, saying: ""In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life."" The shooting is being investigated.  Back at the scene, Sergeant Mario Manzano, 26, a medic with Bravo Company of the division's 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, said: ""It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, and I hope I never see it again."" He said one wounded woman sat in the vehicle holding the mangled bodies of two of her children. ""She didn't want to get out of the car,"" he said.  The tragedy cast a pall over the company as it sat on this stretch of Highway 9 at the intersection of a road leading to Hilla, about 20 kilometres to the east, near the Euphrates River.  Dealing with the gruesome scene was a new experience for many of the soldiers. They debated how the tragedy could have been avoided. Several said they accepted the platoon leader's explanation to Captain Johnson on the military radio that he had fired two warning shots, but that the driver failed to stop. And everybody was edgy since four US soldiers were blown up by a suicide bomber on Saturday at a checkpoint much like theirs, only 30 kilometres to the south.  The soldiers of Bravo Company had their own reasons to be edgy. The Bradley tank of the 3rd Battalion's operations officer, Major Roger Shuck, had been fired on with a rocket-propelled grenade a few kilometres south of Karbala. Throughout the day, Iraqis lobbed mortar volleys.  It was in the late afternoon after this day defending their positions that the men of Bravo Company saw the blue Toyota coming down the road. After the shooting, US medics evacuated survivors to US lines south of Karbala. One woman escaped without a scratch. Another, who had superficial head wounds, was flown by helicopter to a US field hospital when it was found she was pregnant.  Lieutenant-Colonel Stephen Twitty, the 3rd Battalion commander, gave permission for three survivors to return to the vehicle and recover the bodies of their loved ones. ""They wanted to bury them before the dogs got to them,"" said Corporal Brian Truenow, 28.  To try to prevent a recurrence, Captain Johnson ordered signs be posted in Arabic to warn people to stop well short of the Bradleys. Before the signs could be erected, 10 people with white flags walked down the road and were allowed to walk around the Bradleys. And the war continued.  - Washington Post  This story was found at:  urlLink http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/01/1048962756979.html"
4AN3082,male,37,"Published on Friday, April 9, 2004 by the Los Angeles Times  BAGHDAD - April 9, 2003, was the day this city fell to U.S. forces. One year later, it is rising up against them.  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld claims that the resistance is just a few ""thugs, gangs and terrorists."" This is dangerous, wishful thinking. The war against the occupation is now being fought out in the open, by regular people defending their homes  an Iraqi intifada.  ""They stole our playground,"" an 8-year-old boy in Sadr City told me this week, pointing at six tanks parked in a soccer field next to a rusty jungle gym. The field is a precious bit of green in an area of Baghdad that is otherwise a swamp of raw sewage and uncollected garbage.  Sadr City has seen little of Iraq's multibillion-dollar ""reconstruction,"" which is partly why Muqtader Sadr and his Al Mahdi army have so much support here. Before U.S. occupation chief L. Paul Bremer III provoked Sadr into an armed conflict by shutting down his newspaper and arresting and killing his deputies, the Al Mahdi army was not fighting coalition forces; it was doing their job for them.  After all, in the year it has controlled Baghdad, the Coalition Provisional Authority still hasn't managed to get the traffic lights working or to provide the most basic security for civilians. So in Sadr City, Sadr's so-called ""outlaw militia"" can be seen engaged in such subversive activities as directing traffic and guarding factories. It was Bremer who created Iraq's security vacuum; Sadr simply filled it.  But as the June 30 ""handover"" to Iraqi control approaches, Bremer now sees Sadr and the Al Mahdi as a threat that must be eliminated  at any cost to the the communities that have grown to depend on them. Which is why stolen playgrounds were only the start of what I saw in Sadr City this week. At Al Thawra Hospital, I met Raad Daier, an ambulance driver with a bullet in his abdomen, one of 12 shots he says were fired at his ambulance from a U.S. Humvee. At the time of the attack, according to hospital officials, he was carrying six people injured by U.S. forces, including a pregnant woman who had been shot in the stomach and lost her baby.  I saw charred cars, which dozens of eyewitnesses said had been hit by U.S. missiles, and I confirmed with hospitals that their drivers had been burned alive. I also visited Block 37 of the Chuadir District, a row of houses where every door was riddled with holes. Residents said U.S. tanks drove down their street firing into homes. Five people were killed, including Murtada Muhammad, age 4.  And Thursday, I saw something that I feared more than any of this: a copy of the Koran with a bullet hole through it. It was lying in the ruins of what was Sadr's headquarters in Sadr City. A few hours earlier, witnesses said, U.S. tanks broke down the walls of the center after two guided missiles pierced its roof. The worst damage, however, was done by hand. Clerics at the Sadr office said soldiers entered the building and shredded photographs of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the top Shiite cleric in Iraq. When I arrived at the destroyed center, the floor was covered with torn religious texts, including copies of the Koran that had been ripped and shot through with bullets. And it did not escape the notice of the Shiites here that hours earlier, U.S. soldiers had bombed a Sunni mosque in Fallouja.  For months, the White House has been making ominous predictions of a civil war breaking out between the majority Shiites, who believe it's their turn to rule Iraq, and the minority Sunnis, who want to hold onto the privileges they amassed under Saddam Hussein. But this week, the opposite appeared to have taken place. Both Sunnis and Shiites have seen their homes attacked and their religious sites desecrated. Up against a shared enemy, they are beginning to bury ancient rivalries and join forces against the occupation. Instead of a civil war, they are on the verge of building a common front. You could see it at the mosques in Sadr City on Thursday: Thousands of Shiites lined up to donate blood destined for Sunnis hurt in the attacks in Fallouja. ""We should thank Paul Bremer,"" Salih Ali told me. ""He has finally united Iraq. Against him.""

Y8NGFE2,male,26,"so i'll explain why this is necessary in the next post, but i found this hysterical.  when cars go in reverse here, they play music.  i was in the office, and i hear an electric fur elise.  so i figure it's a cell phone.  i ask gaj if it's his.  he tells me, it's some car going in reverse.  so i notice that cars have a wide variety of reverse music.  gaj's car just has a boring beep.  i'm going to see if i can change it to some puccini aria.  that or the theme to batman."
Y8NGFE2,male,26,"i'm almost at the end of my 9 hour layover in singapore.  singapore is really weird.  first of all, the airport is extraordinarily elaborate.  even more so than hong kong.  it's elegant, packed with shops and restaurants, but it also has all sorts of lounges to make people comfortable while waiting.  they have reclining chairs, lounges with tons of TVs, internet just about everywhere, and in general, it's very comfortable, unlike american airports where they intentionally put dividers between all the uncomfortable seats so you can't lie down. i took the department of tourism bus tour thing.  basically all they want, is to tell you where you can come back and spend money.  they point out every food court and row of shops, usually right across the river from each other.  every bridge is a landmark.  my feeling is that since they don't really have much history or landmarks before 1860 something, they're trying to pack them in as fast as possible.  one interesting thing the bizarre tour guide said is that 90% of the population lives in high rises.  they're also reclaiming land all over the place to make the city bigger (they're filling the sea in with dirt from indonesia).  so the tour was kind of boring, as alan had said, but we did get to go on a boat ride on the river, which despite the smoke from the engines was rather pleasant. hong kong was a short layover.  there i didn't leave the airport.  the airport if not as large as the one here, was a lot more fancy.  the only interesting thing that happenned there was that i went outside.  it was incredibly humid.  after 5 years in houston, i've never felt anything like that. that's about it.  nothing very interesting.  hopefully i'll have more interesting tales from india."

MGYZ2KU,female,23,Almost was.
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Well I went out and purchased myself some new deadbolts tonight (Home Depot was closed, by the way, when did they start closing? The last time I wanted home improvement crap in the middle of the night they were there for me, I'm disappointed, and may stop going there altogether, it's just not the same now that it's not 24 hour) fully intending to just go ahead and install them myself this evening. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Once upon a time, I was good at this sort of thing, I could've just looked at all the pieces and then put them together, and gone about my life. Those days are no more, I fear. I had thought that my inaptitude was merely a technological issue, but it seems it's spread to mechanical objects as well. (to speak nothing of my social skills) 5 years ago I installed an entire doorknob (the house I was living in at the time, in the backyard of my Mama's house had no lock, and my roommate had just broken up with her boyfriend, and we'd been having issues not unlike my current circumstances [the more things change, the more they stay the same]) using only a Swiss army knife, and a butter knife. Mind you this may have been the most tedious process I have ever intentionally put myself through, but that was predominately due to the amount of whittling that had to be done. So naturally I figured, if I could manage that, a couple of deadbolts, with the proper tools at hand, should be a piece of cake. I sure am wrong a lot. Seems like half of what I post is me talking about the way things should have worked out, and the other half is me talking about how they didn't. Maybe I need some new hobbies. Something simple, like fingerpainting. The worst part is I didn't even get to the part where I get to fail to install the new deadbolt, I got stuck at the part where I fail to uninstall the old one. This should be simple, I got all the big pieces off, leaving me with that little doodad (technical term) in the middle, by all rights the darned thing should just slide out, or twist out, something like that, but the infernal object WILL NOT MOVE!! I tried pulling, pushing, twisting, I looked for hidden screws, I tried it will the bolt in, and with the bolt out, I put my left leg in and I shake it all about, I do the hokey pokey and I turn myself..... So sometime soon, I'm gonna take someone up on their offer to help me change the locks, and they're gonna take one look at it, and magically remove it, no muss, no fuss, no problem, and then I'm gonna scream. Really loud."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Wow, who knew? (I guess lotsa folks did, just not me) I had more fun last night, completely sober, than I have in, well, in too long.  I have an icky scratch on my arm, I think I twisted my ankle (nothing serious it's just a little swollen) and my legs are REALLY sore.  I wanna do it again!  I knew there had to be some sort of physical group activity out there that I would like. (get your mind out of the gutter)  I got exercise and I didn't hate it!  Yay!  Oodles of thanks go out to Aaron for making this happen, you made my weekend hon."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Starting the winter I was 3, Daddy and I went skiing every Thursday of ski season.  He scheduled his classes so he had the day off, and I got to play hookie from school.  I don't even remember learning how to ski, I know I had to have learned, it isn't the sort of skill that comes naturally, but I guess I was just too young to remember. (probably a good thing, as I'm not terribly fond of falling down)   If you're going to go skiing weekdays are the time to go, no waiting in line, and if it's snowed lately, often there is still powder on the ground.  On the weekends the slopes get packed down due to high traffic, you can get going a little faster, but you don't have the same kind of control, and it hurts more if you fall.   It's been years since I've been skiing, we stopped our weekly trips when I started college, and I couldn't get away with skipping school anymore  (we also took a year off when Daddy had his first batch of heart attacks) the last time I went was with my church youth group when I was 13, but if I close my eyes real tight and imagine it, even standing here in my too-warm workplace (the air conditioner on my side of the building is broken, grrrr) I can still feel it.  The cold wind biting my face, the way my stomach would do a little flip-flop when I'd go over a jump, the rush of adrenaline when I got going too fast, and I knew I couldn't stop if my life depended on it.  Heck, even falling could be a rush if it was a good one, the kind where you roll end over end and then have to spend 15 minutes getting all your stuff back together, because your skis, poles, sunglasses, and hat are scattered every which way.   We started taking my step-brothers with us when I was about 10, and it was one of the few times when I didn't resent having them around.  You see, I was better at it then them.  I know that sounds awful, but it's true, I could and did ski circles around them, and it drove them crazy.   They were always a lot bigger than me, Matthew was 2 years older than me, Jesse 8 days younger (a fact I never let him forget) these days Matt is 6'2, Jesse 6'3 and both of them are well over 200 lbs, back then they weren't quite that big, but still just as physically intimidating to yours truly, and they didn't like me any more than I liked them. The good news is I can take a punch.  But put us on a mountain and I had the advantage.  I was faster, more agile, and by the time they started coming along I thought I was pretty much invincible on a pair of skis.   I continually tried to get them killed, and they fell for it every time. (pun intended)  I knew the paths between the slopes that had all the jumps, as well as all the trees (not a good combination) and I'd lead them to certain death by telling them they shouldn't follow me, they could get hurt.  I was right.  Matthew broke his arm twice, and his leg once, Jesse never broke anything, but had his fair share of sprains, and one concussion (I felt pretty bad about that one) I never got hurt skiing. In hindsight I probably would've gotten beat up a lot less off the mountain, if I hadn't baited them so much on it, but I think it was worth it."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Last night I dreamt about sex.  (if you didn't want to know that I suggest you stop reading, the weather is nice, go for a walk or something) This is highly unusual for me, I understand that men have sexual dreams on a semi-regular basis, but this was only the 3rd sexual dream I've had, ever, and the first one was just kissing, but it was really satisfying kissing, so it counts. This is the first time I've known the person I was, uhm, sleeping with (err..you know what I mean) and it's disturbing me.  This is someone I like and respect, honestly he's someone I would date, were I single. How do you look someone in the eye, once you've dreamt about them in this fashion, the next time I see him I'll probably turn bright red and start stuttering, I mean this is embarrassing shit.  It wasn't just the sex either, it was the whole thing, this was a very in-depth dream, and it was nice, I mean really nice.  There was hand-holding, and cuddling on the couch, there were conversations, I even remember thinking at one point ""so THIS is what I've been missing"" and everybody still had their clothes on.  (it got better from there, but I'm trying not to embarrass myself too much here)  And I really have no business thinking this, much less typing it, so forgive me, but I can't help wondering if the real thing would live up to my little fantasy.   Now you all know I'm a good little girl, and I'm not gonna act on my wild fantasies, so if you're hoping I'm talking about you (yes, I really AM that self-absorbed) don't try to corner me, I'd probably just kick you in the shin. You're wishing you'd gone for that walk now, aren't you?"
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"I like to go back and forth about my Daddy, I love him, no doubt about that, but he was far from perfect, and that's kinda tough for me to reconcile. In my life he plays the role of both super-hero and villain. Today he gets to be a villain. Just so you know, though, I can talk shit about him, you can't. I've heard a lot of people say things about him that were less than complementary, and regardless of whether or not what they're saying is true, it still both hurts and angers me. That said:   My Daddy was a bit of a ladies man, he did his best to hide it from me when I was little, and me being a little on the slow side, he mostly succeeded. By the time I was 13 or so I figured out that all those ""naps"" he took with Eva, Suzie, Renee, Jeanie, Susan, Pam, and the rest of his ""friends"" (Daddy didn't ever have any of his male friends over, in fact, the only men I can remember coming to our house were the husbands of the women he was sleeping with, how uncomfortable!) probably didn't involve a whole lot of sleeping. But by then, he was married again, so all of his extracurricular activities had to be done outside of the house anyway.  As far as I know, he met all of his girlfriends at school; most of them were students who had come to him for counseling. In his defense, he was a single father, and he didn't really have a social life to speak of, so that was pretty much his only opportunity to meet women, but still, he was their COUNSELOR, and it's just bad form to seduce troubled young women who come to you for help.  He had charisma coming out his ears, I don't really see that he was that attractive, at least by the time I was born, but what he lacked in brawn, he made up for in brains, and all these poor tortured souls who came to him, asking for advise on their love lives just ate that shit up. He'd counsel them for a month or so, and then he'd start inviting them to go places with us on the weekends. Nothing special, if they had kids of their own, we'd all go to the park, or go out for pizza at one of the places with a playground, otherwise we'd just go out for lunch, or feed the ducks. They were all really nice to me too, at least at first. I'm not sure what gene makes women go gaga over the children of the man they're involved with, but it's definitely ingrained. After a couple of weekend outings I always started getting little presents, books mostly, although a few of them tried to buy me little dresses (I didn't really start wearing dresses until I was a teenager, I was a bit of a tom-boy, and it's really hard to climb a tree in a dress) and one (she didn't last very long) bought me a Barbie, I don't even remember her name, but I remember that stupid doll, I was about 8, and it was my first Barbie, I just couldn't figure out what the appeal was, in fact I still don't get it....Anybody know what you're supposed to DO with Barbie’s???  Generally a few weeks after the presents started, the girls started coming over, if they were single there were sleepovers, the married ones just took naps. The amazing thing to me is that I never questioned that as a kid, it was normal to me, and I never even considered the idea that something more could be going on. I did know that the naps especially weren't to be talked about, and I was even given cover stories to relate to the husbands in the event I was questioned, (it's not lying if you repeat what your Daddy told you to say, it's just not) usually the cover story involved me, like they were teaching me how to knit, giving me piano lessons, and my personal favorite, tutoring me in math (I was better at math by the time I was 8 or 9 than at least half of the girls Daddy dated, and occasionally, just to keep up appearances they would actually try to teach me something, I was under strict orders not to embarrass them)  For the most part I saw these girls as temporary distractions, I knew they wouldn't last, they never did, but occasionally, I would really hit it off with one of them, and that always made the break-ups hard. One in particular hung around for the longest time, and then kept coming back every year or so, until Renee (that's the evil step-mother, of all the girls, why'd he have to marry that bitch????) finally threatened divorce if she wasn't declared persona non grata. Her name was Suzie, and she was a real sweetheart most of the time. She got a little crazy when it came to Daddy though, I guess she was really in love, bless her heart. Daddy broke up with her for the umpteenth time when he started seeing Renee seriously (Renee was still married at this point, but what're you gonna do?) They had a HUGE fight, that led to Daddy being hospitalized, (he had 3 heart attacks that day, we didn't have a phone, and I had to run down to the neighbors house to call an ambulance, all the while, Suzie was still screaming) I remember Suzie coming into my room, in the middle of the night, and trying to explain to me that she loved me, but wasn't going to get to see me anymore. I'd heard it before, but then she started talking trash, I remember her saying, ""you know how your father can be"" and for some reason that just set me off. I was fiercely protective of him, I'd been listening to her scream at him ad nauseum for hours, and I'd begged her to stop yelling when he'd been laying there, almost dying. I told her I never wanted to see her again. Strangely enough, she's actually the only one of the women in his life that I still keep in contact with, but I've still never quite forgiven her for that day.   OK I don't have a neat ending for this post, but I think I'm done now."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"I saw ""Jersey Girl"" yesterday, I'd seen previews for it, and I was expecting it to be more touchy-feely than the rest of his movies, but I had no idea what I was in for.    For the record I'm not the kind of girl who cries in sad movies, in fact I'm not the kind of girl who cries in public at all.  I'm the kind of girl who blinks repeatedly until the urge to cry passes.  You see, there are women in the world who look beautiful beyond compare when they cry, the tears make their eyes sparkle, their bodies tremble ever so gently.  At the first sign of a tear these women become irresistibly kissable, their vulnerability heightening their beauty, these are the women that romantic movies are made of.  I am not one of these women.  When I cry my face gets red and blotchy, my nose runs, and my eyes become bloodshot.   This movie was the exception to my rule. (I suppose it could be argued that a movie theater isn't exactly ""public"" what with the lack of light and all, but still it's too public for this little girl's taste)  I think I started crying about 20 minutes in, and I don't think I made it more than 10 minutes after that without at least a sniffle.  There are a number of factors involved in my overly emotional response to this movie, including, but not limited to:  1) A strong bond between a single father and daughter. (this shit gets me every time, normally I avoid movies like this like the plague) 2) I hadn't yet overcome my gloom surrounding Father's Day.  And 3)  The leading lady (played by Liv Tyler)reminded me of myself in a huge way. I'm glad I saw it, and chances are I'll buy it when it comes out on video, cause what the hey, any movie that can evoke that strong of an emotional response is worth owning.  If you haven't seen it yet, wait til it comes out on video, and keep a box of tissues handy. (if you don't at least tear up at some point you have no heart)  ******* On a completely unrelated topic, those of you who know me may (or may not) have noticed that I have studiously avoided mention of a certain someone in my life.  He doesn't know about this blog, and ideally I'd like to keep it that way.  Please don't bring it up, should he for some reason be around.  Also I'm delighted that a couple of you have chosen to share this with your readers, but if you'd be kind enough to leave my name out of it I'd be forever in you debt.  I'm sure this sounds a little on the paranoid side, but humor me."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"This may be the most interesting insult I've ever received. (and let me tell you, err nevermind, you don't need to know) Now what exactly do you suppose he meant by that?  Is pondwater worse than tap water?  How about ocean water or pool water?  Is he inferring that I'm a floater, or a fish? (those of you familiar with my drinking habits can kindly refrain from commenting on that last bit)  Maybe it's some sort of roundabout way of telling me he thinks it my ""time of the month"" (water retention and all.)   In any event, it makes a girl's life difficult when people come up with insults this amusing, do you have any idea how hard it is to stifle a giggle when someone says something so inane?  The problem is, if you don't manage to stifle the giggle, folks tend to get a little more creative with their insults (or possible less creative, and more mean)  So, if you're on the phone with a customer service representative, and feel the need to attempt to belittle them (this won't work, we don't care what you think)please stick to old standbys like:  You're full of (insert poop word here) Go to (insert bad place here)  anyway, you get the idea"
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Well, Sunday night/Monday morning my estranged husband tried to take his own life.   I don't know how seriously he tried, not sure if it was an attempt to get me back, a desperate cry for help or a real desire to end his life.  In any event it hurt me more than it hurt him.  I was a teenager once (not so very long ago) I remember having suicidal thoughts, but I can't imagine actually tring to go through with it.  I can't imagine life seeming that bleak at this point.  Additionally I don't understand how someone could put their friends and family through something like that.   I lost my Daddy (to natural causes) when I was seventeen, I know how much it hurts to lose a loved one to death, what on earth could inspire someone to intentionally put their loved ones through that ?  Alright, next time I post I'll have something amusing and inane to say, I promise."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"There were a number of little hoops I had to jump through, in order to go to college.  My favorite was having to go to both the teacher and the department head for every class I took and having them sign a stupid little form before I could register.  This was annoying on a lot of levels.  First of all, it was kind of insulting, I had to go up to these teachers and say, ""Hi, my name is That Girl, I'm (12-15) and I'd love to take your class, please sign this stupid little form"" now if that was all I had to do, it wouldn't have been so bad, but no, they all wanted to  talk  to me.  They wanted to know how I was doing, was the stress of being a college student at such a young age wearing on me, (no, but the stress of having to listen to all these people ask the same questions in the same patronizing tone was) and they all wanted me to know they'd be there for me if I needed someone to talk to.  There were variations on this theme, of course, all the teachers in the social science department covertly tried to get good gossip on my Daddy,  and for some reason or another the guy who was the head of the mathematics department the first year I was there refused to see me at all, luckily his liked me.   Now the first term this wasn't so bad, but as I started taking more and more credits, this process became more and more annoying.  You see, I had to have back up plans, in case I was unable to get my first schedule choice, and I had to get these things signed  before  I could try to register for the classes, one term I think I had 30 or so of them to fill out, and I had to get this done the week before finals week, when I had too much crap to do anyways.  Grrrrrr...  At least the teachers were usually easy enough to find, the department heads, on the other hand, I had to make an appointment to see, an appointment that they almost invariably broke, rescheduled, broke again, and then eventually signed the darned forms when I tracked them down in the cafeteria.  Then there were the actual classes, having skipped middle and high school, I had a lot of catching up to do in a number of different areas.  I took a lot of really basic classes, learning how to type, writing skills, (all of which I've either forgotten, or choose to ignore) and computer science. (basic computer science is possibly the least useful class ever, I actually had to learn to count in binary and hexadecimal, skills that have yet to prove themselves useful)  I also took all the social science classes I could get my hands on, Psychology, Sociology, History, Neural Linguistics Programming.  I stayed away from the ""real"" sciences, Daddy was afraid I wouldn't do well, since I didn't have any science background to speak of.  I  wanted to take ""fun"" classes so bad, but Daddy said that would be ""a waste of an opportunity"" so I was allowed to take piano, and music fundamentals, (this was the kind of compromise my Daddy was famous for, you see, I didn't want to take either of these) but no singing, acting, art or (god forbid) dance classes.   Basically Daddy wanted to ensure that I kept my 4.0 GPA, and he wasn't confident that I would excel in the arts.  I know everybody feels like they were under oodles of pressure as a teenager, and while my story isn't exactly normal, that part definitely is.  I still went through the typical gambit of teenage emotions,  the desire to please and impress your parents, coupled with the fierce determination to be your own person, and all of the intriguing identity crisis that go along with it.  Good enough was never good enough for Daddy, nor was he a ""just do your best, honey"" kind of guy, he was more of a ""my way or the highway"" (a quote he was always quick to interject) sort, and his way was perfect.  I grew up hearing encouraging words like ""if you can't do it right, don't do it at all.""  One experience sort of symbolizes my relationship with him during those last couple of years I lived with him;  I had just found out what my final percentage in math 111 was, and I was very excited to report that I had finished the class with a 104% average, (I had done a few extra credit assignments, and had gotten all of the bonus questions on the tests correct) now I should have known better, but I was expecting an excited ""good job"" or something of the sort, but instead he calmly replied, why didn't you get 106%?  You see, Daddy believed that I would rise to his expectations, and rise I did, right up until I didn't.  Another great lesson I learned during that time frame:  Nobody likes a smart girl.  My darling father, with the best of intentions, I'm sure, sat me down one day, and said ""sweetie, the day is going to come when you start being interested in boys, and I just want you to know, they're going to be intimidated by you, if you don't tone down your intelligence""  he went on to tell me that I should let them win, if we played games, be careful not to use words they wouldn't understand, and never, ever, under any circumstances let them know that I was going to college.  Now the truth of the matter is, sadly, this isn't bad advice.  I can't tell you how many guys quit calling after the first time we played Scrabble.  (Scrabble is my favorite board game, but it's a tricky one, cause not only do you get to kick their ass, but you also get to show them you have a good vocabulary)  And until very, very recently when people asked me where I went to high school, I still responded ""I didn't"" or (my favorite) ""I didn't go to high school around here"" without elaborating further."
LGJYAXE,male,17,"this weekend is rocking my pea green socks off  so i was talking to mike today and he asked me what i was going to do for the prudes. So we went through about four bad ideas and then it was decided. I dressed like a golpher and putted on stage, it was pretty funny, at least to me. And diver carlos brokedanced! I love that kid and ive met him twice. Then me and jackie hung out at cookie dough with bill and matt and some others, i am now in love with brown sugar cookie dough shakes. Prudes: you rock, Minogue an I: i couldnt beleive how great you were tonight, Jackie i love you. That sums up the feelings for tonight.  keep chasin that rainbow"
LGJYAXE,male,17,do you want to learn to fly? would you like to see me try?  i feel like i go through this ritual every month where i freak out at life in general. I just start demanding all these things to happen from myself and everyone around me. Pretty sure its unhealthy.  you can only hold that kinda thing in for so long. I ended up venting meaningless pent up feelings to someone close tonight and i feel bad.  SERENITY NOW!
LGJYAXE,male,17,"All you gotta have is a little faith in yourself  Poker tonight. And i tottaly came out ten bucks ahead! BOO YAH! I found myself down to 50 cents and rallied myself back to $18.50 and i came in with nine. I rock, and everyone said id lose again.  Saw jackie again today, its looking like i might pull off a full weekend of seeing her which would be so great im trying not to get my hopes up. I read her blog and she was talking about the dance. I'm really excited, but see, im a very awkward boy and dancing isnt exactly my strong suit. I try hard to dance well, and maybe thats the problem. But im kindof up against the likes of swanberg in the past taking her to a dance and theres no way im even near his league. Then again, shes a good enough dancer for the both of us.... ill just follow her lead.... if i can....nervous.....but excited.  I've still got adrenaline going from winning poker three hours ago. Prolly never go to sleep."
LGJYAXE,male,17,"so mikey Swanberg has been telling me to listen to alkaline trio again. I wasnt going to but then i remembered. When mike tells me to do something i either do it and am very pleased with the results or i don't and wish i did. So i did, and i completely forgot how good radio is. Thanks mike.  Ive got another poster to do for a girl going to state. I don't think ill do a funny thing on it though cause last time it made kelley kryzmenski cry and her dad tracked us down and yelled at us. So ill play it straight.  Keep chasing that rainbow"
LGJYAXE,male,17,"lets hear it for wanting sleep  So today I was talking to bill and jak walked over. I didnt think anything of it since thats the usual and i was in the middle of saying something so i didnt have a chance to say hi. I didnt know anything was wrong until bill starts making really distressed jerks of his head and frowns deeply at me. I look down and i see just about the sadest jackie imaginable, really bent out of shape. Turns out she got a saterday. Ouch. So i feel really bad she feels bad. Does that make sense? And i couldnt get her to laugh either which i know is a bad sign cause she laughs at pretty much everything.  But she seems ok now. And its not like saterday detentions are all that bad, you just sleep through them, id know.   If you havent read chris's blog you need to (deanhayes.blogspot.com). After you read it you can join me and mike in slapping him around for being a dumbass about girls. I mean who the hell just gives up without ever making a real effort in the first place? Its tottaly his decision and all, but come on man, grow a pair. But he did use my tittle to describe his feelings, so that makes me feel inspirational and therefore warm inside. I guess i wont hit him as hard as i was origionally going to. And in the spirit of hitting dumb people, Austin cant figure out blogger and joined the dark side. aka ujournal. So im going to have to take care of his cute knife weilding morman ass.  god im so in love i don't even pay attention in my classes anymore. I need to not have jackie on the brain all the time, its bad for grades.  keep chasing that rainbow."
LGJYAXE,male,17,"somehow sitting here doesnt feel right.  i wonder how ill deal with not being constantly busy anymore. Right now i feel like a waste of space, but Liz is coming into town today so thats exciting.  I don't really understand how i feel. I saw jackie last night which was great cause i missed her a lot. But right now its just weird.  It's like i finally got time to give a big sigh and sit down, but i pushed all the air out of me and am gasping for breath. I am really happy to be home with the people that i love to be around with but there are so many strings attached. School and stuff.  I think i really am happy just a little tired and bored right now since im so used to running around by now. And i dont get to see her for the rest of the weekend. one day out of 18 isnt that bad. Right?  ok"
LGJYAXE,male,17,"Eureka  I figured out this morning why my writings flowing again. I have recognized the fact that i am not sad or angry, but i knew that all along. What i did not know is that its impossible (for me) to write about BEING with her, only about how i feel after i see her. Im pretty sure this is because i dont think poetically when im with her. I dont really think at all, i just kind of be and its the greatest thing ever. So really all i can write about being there is the lame ""your so beutiful"" creep stuff, and there is so much more to love than that. Don't get me wrong, im pretty convinced shes the most beautiful girl i know, but thats not even close to her strong point. It has to do with auruas, and i cant explain it further because that would be writing about it and i cant figure out how to do that. So im sticking with what i can describe and thats when im not in this daze around her.  so there. I said it."
LGJYAXE,male,17,"This is the delayed, but should have happened yesterday blog about being happy and christmas  Wow, i got to sleep in on christmas morning. It was great, there was a little awkwardness though cause my sisters planned on running in my room and shaking me awake, only i was in the act of putting on boxers when they came bursting through the door. I laughed pretty hard about it, they got a little red, no one told mom and dad.   I got a couple of good books which is awsome cause i havent been reading lately. This one called ""A heartbreaking work of staggering genius"" is really good. Its kind of like the perks of being a wallflower with a grown up guy and its all true. Plus i got this book of poetry by Billy Collins, he is the man.  My sisters were awsome this year with gifts too. Carolyn gave me this awsome wilco shirt, and liz got me a barry white album seeing as he died this year and i dont have any soul in my collection. What was really funny was my grandma liked barry a whole lot and was groovin on the couch to it.  there, happiness makes everyone feel better"
LGJYAXE,male,17,"turn  I let go of a bunch of my worries since last post. Worked out pretty well. i should reguarly get rid of worries, maybe the i wouldnt freak out.  i guess im going to the university of Iowa tommorow. I'll be gone thursday night and back by friday night. I'm really curious to see what an official tour will be. Cause my only college experience so far has been hanging out with my sisters and thats educational in a different sense.   I will see you all soon"
LGJYAXE,male,17,"This in from nequa: ""you have to be physically attractive to have a chance with the opposite sex. That personality stuff is bullshit""  Now, im not sure what kind of people they have over at the richer part of naperville. But that is a terrible statement. First off, its shallow. And i really expected a lot more from such an intelligent person. Secondly, nobody wants a relationship with someone like that. Because people who think like that run out of conversation topics a good five minutes down the road. And finally, you start thinking like that and you change yourself. I used to be a rather large kid myself until eighth grade, then i adopted that philosophy. Only once i got to be ""attractive"" which i know doesnt matter now its just about being comfortable with yourself. Anyway once i got to the point i wanted to be at i found myself stripped of personality. I was a boring person. Luckily i ended up with some very charismatic friends, but if i hadnt found those people i would end up as a gym rat and do nothing but work out. Nobody likes that.   But seriously, thats terrible. Im not going to say looks dont matter, but they only are an attention getter. Kindof a way to ""reel em in"" thats where personality comes in. What im trying to say is drastic changes to ones appearence have drastic consequences and when your changing yourself to just look better, you are sacrificing what makes you an individual."

835XWJW,female,17,"wow, my parents crack me up and annoy me at the same time.  my dads been bugging me all summer for dressing too ""casual""-as in shorts and a tshirt.  well ok, lets take into account that this is NINETY degree weather.  not exactly a good temperature for dressing up.  now lets look at the fact that i am SIXTEEN.. and most (normal) people my age wear shorts and t-shirts daily.  like today, for example, i was going to alyssas house, and i'd been shopping, at the pool, and at the gym all day.  so i came home, showered, and i put on my light blue comfy shorts with my blue lax tshirt.  besides the fact that i was just going to her house for like 3 hours, i was tired and just in the mood to be comfortable. of course my parents were like freaking out and having cows bcuz i wasnt wearing a prom dress.. my dad was like ""you dress like you dont own anything better..."" and im thinking ooo no alyssa will think all i own is some comfy shorts and a tshirt, bcuz thats OBVIOUSLY what kind of fashion statement I'M making.  so i just kind of ignore it and wear it anyway.  lol, i thot it was funny cuz alyssa was like ""you look really cute"" about my outfit, so i told her about my dad wanting me to dress ""elegantly"".  (geeze...) well when i came home both parents were here and got into the whole dress nicer thing, so i told them alyssa thot my outfit was cute, and they roll their eyes an go well alyssa dresses like you. and i think thats the funniest thing ever bcuz their attitude was like ""what does SHE know? her opinion doesnt carry too much weight"" umm, except between what THEY think and what she thinks, i'd take her opinion.  i mean no offense to them, but considering shes my age and actually knows what looks good nowadays... AND she does realize that pants pulled up to your waist are not too cute.  but if i ever do need advice on dressing like they did back in the 80's (which wouldn't be too surprising, considering ive been a cat, madonna, and captain jack sparrow in the past year...lol) ill be sure to listen to all of my parents brilliant comments on fashion. till then, ill take the advice of someone who knows more about fashion in '03..."
835XWJW,female,17,"WOW...I'm like so wasted right now.  And all I had was junk food.  We are so good, we went to sleep at like, 8, 8:30-ish!  We went outside and watched the sunrise too.  OK here is how the night went.  I got to Island's after everyone else cuz of my crazy insane day I talked about already.  So I get there and had my BIG WAVE BURGER i had been craving like FOREVER and wow we had some problems figuring out the bill but thx to allison our smart math person we did alright.  then we walked to starbucks (with kate talking about random things making me crack up ""i dont eat pumpkins...they dont fit in my mouth"") and then we got frapps and my daddy picked us up.  then we came back to my house and just hung out and had all these ""deep"" talks not rele deep hehe but more like just talks but it was kinda ""stuff i only say in a close group of friends"" talk but yeah it was just weird but interesting.  i found out lots of new info yay go me.  then we went to watch DUDE WHERES MY CAR (kate thx so much for taping that!) and I AM IN LOVE WITH ASHTON KUTCHER meg can totally have Sean william scott ill take ashton over him any day. (""...all rugged like ASHTON KUTCHER..."" Meagan on Wakeup Wakefield-SNL).  Well that movie is like hilarious but incredibly strange.  Then we just hung out for a while, watched the MTV performances (avril!) and looked at magazines, went online, all that good stuff.  Then my poor kitty ran out of the room and I realized that him being the biggest scaredy cat ever he must have been terrified with 6 screaming girls in the room so I went and got him and put him in my sweatshirt and just hung out with him for a while.  poor little boy!  and then like i went back to the room and they were like ""oo its 11:54!!"" and i was like no that clocks ahead its not that late (cuz we have a clock thats an hour ahead) and theyre like no this is the tv clock and i was like WHOA how did time fly so fast?  so me and diane went downstairs to get the Martinelli's (pshh can u say trouble opening a bottle?? lol) and she served it up being the excellent bartender she is and we took it upstairs and counted down like the dorks we r.  then we screamed HAPPY NEW YEARS (feeling rele stupid, well i was neway) and ""kissed"" and YES the quotes r there for a reason. then we watched tv a little more (THIRD ROCK!) and all that good stuff until my parents company left and my parents went to bed, so we went downstairs.  we talked like forever, and then got bored and started playing things like monster chase, piggy back and horsey back races, watch diane pretend to be a guy and hit on arleen (haha we had a good time with this one), and all these random things.  ok so by now its like...4 maybe?  so we're like ok its late but were rele not sleepy so we start playing charades and its like were so insane and we're horrible at it! (sleepy sh!t, haha) like we wud say things that wud make NO sense and it was...rele entertaining.  so around 6:30 we decide to head out and see the sunrise but its pretty much already risen so we just froze and huddled under one blanket and watched the sky get brighter.  we came back in and decided to ""chill"" a little but by then laying down felt good.  so diane, kate and allison keep on playing charades and me and meg and leslie r watching some of them and guessing and sometimes just laying there, and around 8:30 i fell asleep for a couple hours but from what i hear, kate, diane and allison had a BIT of fun while we were asleep...lol. so then we wake up and them 3 r coming downstairs and theyre all ready to leave :( so i say byebyezies to them and we decide to head on upstairs.  then meg and leslie got picked up and that was the end. ooo..and SO much eating went on last night...im hungry but i feel too sick too have breakfast.  so yeah, now we were sitting around like all stoned and wasted (from sugar haha) and like my voice was SO deep and i was so like expressionless and out of it..wow. ok the end...happy new years guys.  i havent had a chance to try out my resolution but i already know one person im going to try it wth...so yeah.  i will let the blog know what happened so he can tell all of u :).  well this is like way long and u r all bored to death so yeah...i will let u ppls go. *STONED*"
835XWJW,female,17,"well its wednesday and its been a while since i wrote in here so heres whats been going down.....lol well me and sarah have this list of movies we needa watch, and we're about halfway thru.  friday we watched monty python, and zoolander (SOOOO FUNNY). saturday we watched just married and then ferris bueller's day off.  sunday we watched old school and the princess bride. monday we did a lil jim carrey night (the grinch, liar liar, and dumb and dumber). tuesday we watched how to lose a guy in 10 days and 8 mile. tonite we watched corky romano. yesterday was allisons bday (HAPPY SWEET 16!!!!) and we were gonna hang out at the park and it was funny cuz me and sarah took sooo long to get ready that since i was ready before her i went to vons to get ice cream (for allison) as she got ready. i was paying at Vons when i got a call from meggie letting me know that TB was at the park and i had to get my ass down there right away, so i picked up sarah and we hauled ass.  it was kinda lame tho, we didnt rele talk but o well hes still nice lookaying, lol. then we ran thru the sprinklers and got soaked. lol. today we went to the park today again and had a water balloon fight and got soaked again, and then came home, and went to Vons and Rubios to run some errands, omg it was so funny, sarah picked up some guys, lol. i wanted to turn into a lane (or wutever its called) to park, and they were coming out of it, but they wudnt go ahead of me so i cud turn in, so im giving them this horrible look and like muttering wut mother effers they are, while shes busy smiling and waving at them. well, i ended up having to go into the next lane to park and they followed us and parked nearby.  then we got out and they came over to talk and this guy like introduced himself to us and then introduced his friends to us, and then was like o well can i contact u guys? but sarahs leaving in like 3 days so yeah. she just cracks me up cuz when random guys wave i just look at them like wtf...lol. it was so funny, they were kinda old too, like 19ish (by old i mean not high skool).  im so amused, u all probly think im rele dumb but i never pick guys up so i think its great, lol.  well, thats wut ive been up to since i last blogged im sure u all give a crap but yeah if u dont then u probly shudnt b reading this eh? night all"

835XWJW,female,17,"Hmm..I finally got a blog. I always thought these online journals were pretty cool and now I have one. Gooo me.  Thats ONE good thing this weekend.  This weekend has been pretty crappy, but I'm not getting into to much detail with that..just family stuff.  And its not even big problems, so if I say why it will be a big waste of time and everyone will think I'm a spoiled brat.  But I'm really not, just when a ton of little things build up and I'm already in a crappy mood I just feel like life sucks.  Well, my cousins were visiting last week, which was fun, except that my younger one tries to act like shes way older an she duz sometimes but then she's really immature a lot of the time.  My other one is my age but he always hangs out with my bro...he's still super cool though.  My cousins are all pretty great except that younger one, and thats because she's done stuff to me.  But thats all in the past so I'm not getting into it either...I've just learned not to trust her.  Well but then my cousins left and my brother went with them (to my other cuzins house for the next week), only I'm not allowed to go bcuz theres too many guys over there and my parents are weird about that, so I'm the only one on that side of the family whos left out.  Well, me and a five year old...but that doesn't make it any better.  And my parents are treating me like the servant girl or somtin today, so that just did not help at all.  And ok, my mom asks me whats wrong, why I'm in a bad mood.  I tell her, and she refuses to believe its her fault...somtin must have happened to me.  Of course mom, cause youre the all knowing one and im just a stupid little girl.  I mean if youre going to ask me then believe me, if not dont ask!  And my parents always do that.  OK, I said no detail but it's a little late...sorry but that's what the blog is here for i guess.  So yeah, like I said it's not a big deal, just a lot of small things making me feel like I dont really matter.  But you know what I realized?  My cousins are fun, my parents are OK usually, but my friends are the people I can really count on.  I mean this week I had fun with cousins and all, but a lot of the time I felt left out and like I didnt belong, and they were all leaving without me and it was like they didnt really care.  And then yesterday I went out with my friends and it was like...coming home. Like I was where I belonged and they never make me feel like left out or anything.. Geeze, I sound so corny, I've been kinda emotional lately...i guess.  I just wish people could understand what i feel...especially the ones making me feel that way.  Well...I think I'm done for now but I can bet I'll be back later today...or very early tomorrow (aka after midnight) so until then, have fun reading... *ME*"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"My brother thinks that he looks stupid in the picture below, but I refuse to take it off.  In fact, I printed it off and it is hanging on my desk a work. Muuuhhh hhhaaa  hhhaa haa haa!"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"before I forget, I have a complaint to voice.  I am just gonna smack the new neighbors.  About a month or so ago my family was staying over at my house and the boys upstairs decided to smoke pot.  Now it was soo strong that I knew they were smoking in the house, and furthermore I knew that they were smoking in the basement.  This presents a problem for me because only a door separates the basement area that they use and my apartment.  At the time, I tried to downplay it with my parents, but I was a little embarassed.  Later that week, I talked to one of the three who swore that it was their friends smoking and that they were not in the house.  So last night, 7 pm, I am in my house with Dione and I start to smell it again.  Strong too because it was close.  We were about to leave to see a movie, so before going I went in the back to see if they were outside.  They weren't.  No lights were on in the house, but the basement lights were on.  Hummmm...what am I supposed to think?   After the movie, we came home and my house reeked.  I just did laundry yeasterday too, and now everything smells like pot.  So I go storming upstairs and ask the guys upstairs not to smoke in the house ever again.  Oh course they played dumb, ""ahh, no one was smokin' in the house..""  but when I mentioned that the smoke started at 7, they started to have this guilty look on their faces.  Then they promised that they wouldn't smoke in the house anymore, ""anymore""  meaning that they had been and that they had lied to me about it before!!!!!!!!!  So now my house smells like stale pot, and the smell is cycling around the ventilation system so that every time the heat kicks on I can smell it again.  Candles don't help, either does incense, and I am not sure that they have made a bottle of frebreeze large and strong enough to take away the smell.  can you see why I am a little upset."

B0IRWHX,female,25,"Blah blah One of those days at work already.  I come in and there is an empty tissue box on my desk...why you ask?  Because Debra who is operating under the assumption that I am her personal secretary and not the OFFICE secretary, couldn't find the energy to walk over the supply closet and get herself a new box of tissues.  Then she  wanted to have them moved over to this office.  Why?  There is no room for them,  that is why we have a storage closet. Duh. Just get off of your skinny ass and walk.  Last night Libby and I went on a condom search (she and Colin are out again), the trip was successful, but also reminded me that the condoms I bought forever ago will expire next March...the 4 year celibacy anniversary is looming... after our search we went over to the bar and had a beer, because we could. Normally we play pool, but decided against it--so we just ""hung out"" in our nerdy way and made plans to have a study day at the bar.  Forget going to the coffee shop and reading over a cup of joe, a pitcher of beer would be better. Hell, I have had a study drink forever, I might as well make it public.  Set up a web tracker for the Center's website.  It's addicting.  I can sit and watch in realtime everyone who visits the site.  The power is scary, but my boss thinks that I am a genius for setting it up.  I'm not, but since the girl that was here before was such a slackass I appear to have superhuman secretarial  powers...muhh haa haa"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"So the stupid server kept giving me these error messge saying that there was a faulty template, so I would keep coming back to the site hoping that it would work and then it wouldn't, until this evening when the bright idea hit me-----if I change the template it might work right.  and... viola!  I am writing to you once again.         Last Friday was a pretty cool day at job number 2 (SWCA), see whenever anyone builds anything across BLM land they have to have an Arch. firm survey the area.  Then after the survey is completeing they have to have a representative from that firm moniter the construction workers to make sure that they don't dig through a site.  Well, last Thursday our current big project was working on a pipeline out near Nephi.  No sites had been found for miles around and there was no evidence in the baulk that there was any cultural remains, so they were digging away...until the backhoe operator noticed something odd sticking out of the back fill pile.  Upon investigation they found it to be a human femur.  Somehow they had managed to go through an entire burial without any evidence in the baulk.  There was no coffin or cultural remains to be found either.  So my firm has a crew out there now sifting through a pile of dirt 10 meters by 4 meters and about 2 meters high.  But back to Friday morning, they needed to know how many bones they had collected so far, but they didn't have time to wait for Chick to sort them all out-----so they let me do it.  :)  It has been forever since I took my bone class, but I did ok.  I was just so excited that they let me do it---they trusted a lowly lab monkey!!!   small things make me happy.      also speaking of small things making me happy, I got my DSL line hooked up today, this also makes me happy because I can check the email and talk on the phone at the same time, not to mention the amazing internet radio oppurtunities now available to me.  good day ..."
B0IRWHX,female,25,"bit of gossip, apparently when Ann left last Friday (her last day) at the Bookstore, she left Paul's birthday card, which apparently was signed, but never given to him, torn in a hundred little pieces on his desk.  Yeah, he was mad.  Went to Earl the store director, who was equally as mad.  They wrote a letter to be added to her file at Human Resources and to her new bosses at the Registar's Office.  I hope that she doesn't find out about it, that would be awful to know.  But then again, I am kind of disappointed in her childish behavior.  When Paul told me I was in such shock that I couldn't think of anyway of defending her."
B0IRWHX,female,25,"Someone once remarked to me that the bravest thing that I have ever done is go to a movie alone.  Which sometimes, you have to do because you can't find anyone who wants to go with you.  I went and saw the movie  urlLink  Control Room   last night, it was wonderful!!! And everyone should see it!  It is about how Al Jazeera covered the Iraq war and how they handled being objective and the struggles that any news stations goes through in their attempts at being fair and balanced.  You should definitely go.  In other news, they found the head of the guy that was  urlLink beheaded   in Saudi Arabia.  They had kept in a freezer, and they don't know where the rest of the body is.  It makes me sick, those militants call themselves Muslims, yet they can not even respect their victim's bodies once they are dead. Bastards that they are."
B0IRWHX,female,25,"ok, ok...I know that I am bad at this, I said that I would post more often.  Humm, so the majority of this week has been spent to reading this really good book, instead of readying myself for Turkey.  So since I am now in those last days of getting ready I am beginning to panic, just a little.  But this week has been fun, Tuesday night, I hung out with Dione and saw Scooby Doo, Wednesday night Anne, my house-sitting savior, came over to see the house, Thursday--um...I oh, I hung out with Dione, and then tomorrow I went out with Bryce.  I feel like I neglected Steph though, sorry hun.   So now, I am working on the last bunches of laundry before I start to pack.  Tonight I am at my parents and we are going to see a movie.  So even though I haven't been posting anything, at least you know that it hasn't been too interesting. Gotta go, dinner is ready.  I'll write later and give everyone my address in Bismil, if anyone is interested."

B0IRWHX,female,25,"All right, it is official.  Well I guess that it isn't totally official until ""I"" says it is, but since Mandy called me and told me I can say that it is Debbie official. But Mandy isn't coming back.  She was really worried that we were going to be upset with her but of course we aren't, we all understand that she wants to stay at home with her baby. This makes me sad.  But it is good to know what is going on. JB on the other hand is floating on air and already pancing around like the job is hers...over my dead body is all I can say."

09O854L,male,17,"Woof.  What a long freakin day.  Worked from 2-10.  Sucked major balls.  I made barely any money too cause the owner decided there would be no deliveries today since it was so busy.  So I ran around the place doing everything that needed attention.  I hate that place so much.    Tomorrow they want in me in at 10am, which is odd, cause I usually do the 2nd half of the day, not the opening.  So they better not be expecting me to stay until close.    I really have nothing else to talk about.  I miss being able to hang with friends.  I feel like I haven't done anyting social in so long, even though its only been a week. Still, in the summer, thats a long time. Hopefully tomorrow I can see anchorman, unless they want me working the whole day."
09O854L,male,17,"Andy IM's me after him, me, shannon, mike, and zak saw anchorman  lektorspectre: Jessie8448 (10:17:29 PM): i cant believe u went to go see that movie....its so sexist Funnyboy88: is...she....serious lektorspectre: lol lektorspectre: thats wut i said  so....  Funnyboy88: hey Jessie8448: heyy Jessie8448: u like the movie? Funnyboy88: nah, it was too sexist Jessie8448: lol Jessie8448: yea right Jessie8448: u liked it Funnyboy88: yeah it was amazing Jessie8448: lol i didnt want to go Funnyboy88: whhhhhhhy Jessie8448: too sexist for me Funnyboy88: its not sexist!!  if anything, its anti-sexist, because the woman comes out on top by the end Jessie8448: great now i cant go see it cuz u told me the end Jessie8448: lol Funnyboy88: haha Funnyboy88: but u didn't see HOW she got there Funnyboy88: u didn't see all the bj's and sexual favors she gave to get there.   Funnyboy88: seriously though, anchorman was verrrrrry good.  sooooo funny Funnyboy88: u should see it Jessie8448: nah Funnyboy88: aww Funnyboy88: if i watch passion of the christ, will u see anchorman Jessie8448: lol the only ppl id want to see anchorman with have already seen it as of tonite Funnyboy88: i'd see it again....unless ur only referring to andy, mike, and shannon haha Jessie8448: lol we'll see Funnyboy88: anchorman Funnyboy88: there we made a sentence  So as it says, Anchorman was very good.  I LOVED it.  Best comedy I've seen in a while.    In related news...I have money.  By having a job, I have recieved it.  So, feeling generous, I treated friends to ice cream.  The half-jew inside of me was against it though.    Work wasn't so bad today.  Sure, ther was some usual suckage, but I got so tired, I think I was a little delirious, so I was much more interactive with customers and co-workers.  And theres this new girl megean who was my partner at the counter.  I put the pizza in the oven.  She rang up at the cash register.  She seems like a nice girl, and its always awesome to have another normal person who speaks english clearly and doesn't act like an asshole."

09O854L,male,17,"On Tuesday, Andy took me to hang out with some of his Earlton friends at the swim club.  I met them before a month or so ago, in hopes of meeting some new women.  Well this was round 2, however, no magic.  The girls seem like nice people, however, there just wasn't any natural clicking, ya know?  The first time we went out with them, there was this girl Laura, who was my favorite of the bunch, but she didn't come this time.  She seemed the most personable.  And we really didn't do anything that special with them this time.  We got to the swim club, talked by the pool, played ping pong, played Mafia (which was really lame), and then we were gonna go to somoene's house or see a movie, but we didn't have a house to go to, and then the movie idea fell apart too, so it was just like ""ok, bye then"".  I had a lil fun though.    Today, I went over to the pediatric center to see if I could sign up to volunteer.  They gave me an application, so I gotta return that tomorrow.  I really need volunteer time.  Its the only thing keeping me from having a good college resume.  I got the grades, activities, sat scores (1330), awards...but the community service part is weak.     Tonight I saw the controversial Fahrenheit 9-11.  I thought it was very good.  Moore brought up a lot of great, scary points.  Tons of things made me go ""Wow, I can't believe they got away with that.""  So I am glad that Moore is bringing these things to a mainstream audience.  A lot of people complain that F911 is too onesided, it doesn't give the other point of view enough attention, etc.  Well here is my reply to that.  Do the government and Bush himself tell both sides of the story?  Of course not.  That's why we need Moore to let us know about this stuff.  So now we have both sides.  Bush can tell us his story, Moore can give us the other side.  It works nicely.  Also, there is tons of manipulation of editing in the film, and although thats technically a negative, if it means convincing more people not to vote for Bush, then its ok by me."
09O854L,male,17,"I'm back, everybody!  I was on some vacay with my family in Massachusetts from sunday to thursday.  It was quite fun and nice to kick off the summer.    sunday - we stopped at my grandpa's in new york on the way to massachusetts.  Had a nice dinner, some famous Ralph's water ice (a traditon for whenever we go).  Then it was back on the road.  We got at the  urlLink Red Lion Inn  at about 10:30pm.  We had a nice big room and I slept in a cot.    monday - Breakfast at the inn; then we went to  urlLink Jiminy Peak .  There, I did some really fun things.  First, I did this thing where you are strapped into these bungees and you jump on a trampoline.  It really started to hurt after like 45 seconds though because all your weight is on your crotch.  I hope I can still have children.  I also did this rock climbing thing.  It is soooo much harder than it looks.  I could barely do it.  I felt like such an ass as these little kids went up it right away yet I couldn't get past 7 ft above the ground.  I learned that my dreams of rock climbing are not going to happen.  The last activity there was alpine sliding.  Imagine a water slide with no water, and you sit in a sled. That's basically it.  Once and a while, people do go off the track and get injured.  Well, I was really pushing it with the speed and I started to lose control, so the only thing I could do was grab the cement track and ended up gettin g a pretty bad burn, but I luckily regained control.  So I have this huge nasty thing on my arm.  Marc made a great joke that it looks like I tried to slash my wrists using sand paper.  Or is it the hicki from jess...hehe.  After Jiminy Peak, we went to see the terminal, starring Tom Hanks.  It was pretty good, a lot better than I thought it was gonna be.  I recommend it.    tuesday - We drove an hour to this museum only find out it is closed on tuesdays.  shit.  It was quite a good laugh.  I have a good pic of that I'll have to post.  So we drove back and went to the  urlLink Norman Rockwell museum , and I'm not much of an art lover, but his illustrations were atleast entertaining.  That night, dad, ash, and I went to see ""blue skies over alabama"", a play.  It was very good.  Funny, yet it had some very dramatic, serious parts dealing with abortion and homosexuality in the 1930's.    wednesday - one word:  urlLink llamas .  Yes, we went hiking with llamas.  What an experience.  It felt so surreal walking along these star wars creatures.  Lots of great pics and video.  You go out to this guy's farm, you each get a llama, and you walk through the woods, receiving a nice tour.  One of the most unique things I've ever done in my life.    thursday - departure.  Outlet shopping on the way back.  I got a couple shirts and a pair of shorts at the Gap outlet.  Dayum cheap shiz.    As soon as I got home I headed over to Andy's for our ""Good-bye Alex Willemin"" party.  Alex and I have been friends since around 1st grade, and he's moving to somewhere in Pennsylanvia.  He's leaving on Saturday, so tonight was our last real chance for a celebration.  We watched wayne's world, a george carlin special, hung out in the backyard, had pizza, cake, etc.  He drove me home and we said farewell.  It's hard to believe I won't see him again, or I will, but it just won't be for a long time or often.  I've known him for so long, and even when we weren't close friends, he's always been in the picture somehow, ya know?  Plus this year we got real close cause he was in my media class in school, and formed a partnership that eventually became titled  urlLink Mush-Min Productions .  We made some real good movies together.  And we got even closer outside school, as we were both part of the same social group, with ""movie nights"" every weekend, etc. GOOD-BYE ALEX!  I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK!"
09O854L,male,17,"I got up early today.  11am.  What the hell?  And I just woke up naturally too.  I usually need an alarm for 11am.    Tonight I went with ash mush to the free Phantom Planet concert in philly.    It was a pretty ghetto set up.  It was outside, with the kind of stadium seating where the stage is lower than the audience.  And then there was a concrete break for walking, and then more seating.  So if you weren't in the first seating section, the next best spot was at the top of the 2nd section, and by there, you are so far away from the concert, I felt like I was watching a concert rather than attendning one.  But hey, I got my money's worth.  The setlist was good, and PP put on a great, energetic show.  Alex, the lead singer, used to prance around and make chaos, but since their 2nd guitarist quit, he's had to take on guitar duties, so its really changed their stage show, but everything sounded fine.  It was kinda sad when there was a massive exodus of people during their set.  I guess more people were there for Sugarcult, which is a crime.    I got hungry and bought this pretzel.  It was so nice and warm, like a BUTT.  We parked soooo far away it was reDUNKulous.  We parked at the lot that the venue recommended, but we didn't realize the lot was soooo far from the place.  We walked and walked and walked, and then when we got there, they weren't letting people in, so there was this maaaaassive line to get in.  I called it the Trail of Tears.    Family friend Julia selznick also attended, but we couldn't find her.  I kept my eyes peeled though.  And I finally saw y100 morning dj's preston and steve in person.  Steve Morrison is a hilarious hilarious guy, and I've been listening to him for 7 years.  I've also discovered up close why they are on the radio."
09O854L,male,17,"Andy and Amit came over and we watched Pulp Fiction.  I've never seen it start to finish.  Damn good movie.  So funny.  So bizarre.  So many good quotes.  And andy and amit are hilarious people, so we had a many good joke.    I'm on a Beatles kick.  In the past week, I've gotten a hold of mp3's of the white album, please please me, abbey road, the original let it be, and sgt pepper to add to the 85 mp3's I already had.  There is soooo much beatles stuff out there its insane.  But I gotta take my time and learn the songs I have before I go get more.  13 fuckin albums plus 2 cd's full of songs that were never on albums.

09O854L,male,17,"So, it finally happened. I just got back from Pittsburgph, PA, where I met my internet pals Alex and Kiersten, although they are now more than that (*sitcom audience awwws*).  They were sooo annoying. I'm kinda glad they are 6 hours away. Ah Kiersten was so weird and alex was a total nerd. What a disappointment. I kept telling them ""oh I wanna come back"", but I just wanted to sound nice.                          [/end of joke]  In all seriousness, it was AMAZING. I had sooo much fun. LIKE A BUTT. Now a summary of the trip.  I got up at 9ish on Friday morning, and by 11am, I was sitting on my bed ready to go, however, my mom's boyfriend Tom had to make some conference calls, and we didn't end up leaving until...gasp...1:30pm. It kinda ruined the plans we had for that night, but hey, it was nice enough for Tom to make this trip and he needed to do some business, so I have nothing to complain about. The ride was alright at first. I brought my 20 gig Rio Karma mp3 player with 1900 songs at my disposal for entertainment. So I was entertained pretty well. However, we ran into some trouble when we got to Pittsburgh...we got lost. The MapQuest directions were misleading and semi-wrong, so an extra 90 minutes was added to the trip trying to figure out where we needed to go.  FINALLY we got to the Comfort Inn Hotel at 9:30pm. When I stepped out of the car there, my cell phone vibrates. It was Alex.  A: Guess where I am? J: Uhh I have no idea A: The Comfort Inn  *!!!* = my brain. I got so excited and started looking all around. So we stayed on the phone trying to locate each other. ""Get out of your car, ""I told him, I still didn't see him. I even got to the point where I was yelling ""HELLO"" in the parking lot...then we discovered...he was at a different Comfort Inn. HAHA! Boy, that was funny.  So finally Alex got to the right Comfort Inn. I saw a car approaching with a teenager (or peenager). Alex waved. I walked up his window. We shook hands. First contact was established. I then called down mom and tom and introduced alex to them.  I must say, it wasn't as weird as I thought it was gonna be. It's probably cause of the times on the phone or when we would glophone, so I knew what it was like to talk to him. The first couple minutes in the car felt a bit odd, like ""holy shit, i'm in the car with acewepeel"", but I got used to it kinda fast.  We proceeded to Kiersten's house. It was kinda funny, cause when we pulled into her drive way, there were all these other kids walking down the street, so we joked that they were here to see my arrival. I saw Kiersten coming down the steps and I experienced more *!!!* feelings. So we had another whoaahh this is it kinda moment and we went inside her house to meet her parents. Her parents were pretty nice and welcoming. I tried to be a responsible and friendly kid and apparently I suceeded. I felt like I was on 20/20 being interviewed. We talked about everything from them seeing my movies to the chairs they got 20 years ago. They seemed like normal people, so its kinda hard to imagine all the horror stories about their strict rules are true.  In Peensylvania, their jr. driving license has a curfew of 11pm, which is hella dumb. Ours is 12am. So we didn't have time to go out to eat or anything. Alex drove me back to the hotel, and he picked me up the next morning at 10ish to go to  urlLink Kennywood , the amusement park alex works at. We had some good bonding time together, getting used to each other and such. We arrived there 11am and by the time Kiersten got there after 3pm, I felt pretty normal. None of the roller coasters went upside down, which was kinda disappointing, but the rides were still very fun anyway. We went on the Phantom 4 times, but the 2nd time was absolutely amazing, cause we had the front row and the wind was incredible.  We went on the log jammer twice...here is a pic of that.     I was trying to look at the camera, but oh well.  Then...we DID THE SKYCOASTER. It's basically a bungee swing. Here is a corny pic I found on the internet.      We were all sooo nervous, especially Kiersten, who had this gut feeling that we were gonna die. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. The initial 2 seconds of the drop are pants-shitting scary. You get to discover what you sound like when you think you are about to die. Then as soon as the wire catches, it is tons of fun and not really stomach dropping.  The 2nd time we ate was really bizarre. We were literally high on life, acting extremely goofy. We played spit-your-ice-into-your-cup, and at the moment, it was the funniest thing in the world. Kiersten even told us a story about how she peed her pants last October. LOL! I doubt she would have told us that story if she was in any other regular mind set. Later that night, we actually almost got her to pee her pants from laughing, to the point where she let go a little and had to crouch down hahahahaha. Aw man, CLASSIC. Sorry Kiersten :)  Now for the really cheesy part. All good things must come to an end. After we did the sky coaster at 10pm, it was time to go. The walk back to the car was depressing. On the ride back, Alex and I sang along to obscure Weezer songs, revealing our awful falsetto skills. It was so much fun doing that with another Weezer nerd haha. Poor Kiersten hehe. We arrived back at the Comfort Inn. It was a tough good bye.  That day I truly learned why Alex and I have been able to keep contact for 2 years and with Kiersten for 1 full year too. They are just like my friends here in Voorhees, and they would fit in perfectly with my group. The transition from internet friend to real life friends was completely easy. I can't say that about the other internet friend I met. They are cool, hilarious people whom I had BLAST with. I only hope they felt the same way, and judging from all the fun we had and the painful goodbye, I know they liked me in someway, hehe. Alex hasn't blocked me on aim yet, so that's a good sign. But its painful to thing that these people that I am so compatible with are 6 hours away, no easy trip. With no one else can I make both an extremely obscure SNL reference and then an obscure Weezer reference within 60 seconds. Ok, now the corny part is done.  I shall post pictures soon. They are currently at rite-aid being developed."
09O854L,male,17,"So in case anyone noticed, my blog has a title now.  Before it was just ""Justin's Blog"" cause I couldn't think of anything.  But I decided to hunt for a good title, and going through my vast mp3 collection, I found the Rooney song ""Oh what a day.""  and BAM, I had it.  Cause basically, all I do hear is talk about my day.  So there we go.    You can download the song on the right side bar thingy.    Last night Mike and I watched Starsky and Hutch.  Originally we were gonna get Men in Tights, but Mike was like,  ""Hey, just wanna see starsky and hutch?""  ""er ok sure why not.""      HORRIBLE.  I thought it was gonna be atleast kinda funny, but it was severely disappointing.  It did have some really funny bits, but the jokes were soooo far apart it was insane.  For like the first half hour of the movie nothing funny happened.  Usually comedies have a big intro with a huge laugh that pulls you in, but the movie just kinda...started without anything special.  So avoid this movie.  It has a couple good laughs, but only a couple, and lots of dead space.  It's like watching River's 5...ZING.    During the movie, Mike and I would make comments that made us laugh a lot harder than the movie itself.   For example, I started to say something about the oovie: ""Wait, did Husky...""  *pause*  *enormous eruption of laughter that the movie never gave us*    And I know maybe you don't care, but Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of weezer,  is going back to Harvard and he posted an  urlLink essay  he wrote for a class on his myspace.    JAW DROPPING.  Rivers talks about everything that he has been doing the last couple years and it is simply a gigantic wower.  fasting.  volunteering 6 days a week.  living in an empty apartment outside rick rubin's house.  studying and studying his craft.  If you are a minor or major fan of weezer, you should read that essay."

1RFEQHW,female,26,"Is there such a thing as being too transparent? Possibly. We are about to find out. ha!    So I've been a little ""down"" lately. I don't know. For about a month now I've been battling the ""blah's."" Typically it's nothing chocolate can't fix or a good time in the bible with the Lord won't remedy, but lately, even those two common relief's haven't been working.     I don't like it when ""grown up's"" whine and act like babies so I will spare you the drama but this is something that is hard to describe.    I don't think I am typically a ""depressed"" person. I have gone through real depression only once in my life and it was when life brought about a lot of changes. God brought me out of it with time and His goodness but it sure isn't anything I ever want to endure again.    Like I said, I can't explain it. It's not as if anything disastrous has happened to me but just general ""life"" disappointments and some stress that has been building up over time I suppose. I'm not sure.     I wouldn't say I am in ""depression"" per say, more like I am in a ""funk."" Regardless... anytime God puts me in  uncomfortable, painful situations and circumstances, He uses it to prune away some unfruitful things in my life and heart. It's possible I am just going through the pruning process right now and since He's not finished working, I can't see the end result.. which I am sure will be a good thing.     So hopefully He will continue (but quickly Please God) with his pruning shears in my life and then He'll take a few steps back... admire HIS work and say.. "" yes.. this is good.""      And I'll wipe my forehead and say, "" Shew..thank you Lord but glad that's over with.""  :)"
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I apologize for not writing the past 4 days. We've been busy babysitting my in laws dog, horses, and fish. And for this lady (who is NOT an animal lover), it is quite a task. I was even given instructions to ""pet and talk to the dog."" Oh my.    We spent Friday in Seattle with Ben. It was a nice day. We went to the Experience Music Project, which we all thought was pretty awesome. My favorite part was probably the Elvis displays, I admit this Alabama girl is an Elvis fan. I'm not a fan of the life he led by any means, but I believe he was talented, charismatic, and deep down had a longing for God but had a very weak flesh. His life is a good reminder that fame, money, achievement, sex, and world acclaim will leave you just as empty as when you started. A man who had a very ""full"" life died an ""empty"" one. So sad.   Josh took Ben back to the airport on Saturday. We were all sad to see him go. Jacob insists that we adopt Ben and make him his ""new"" brother but considering he is my cousin and only 8 years younger than me, I think that would be hard to do.       Remember that disorder I was suffering from last week ( also known as PMS). Well, I failed to mention another disorder I am suffering from. I have suffered with this one most of our marriage but had thought I was in remmission. I've had a relapse (or two) lately and need to confess.     I call my disorder ""NWS"" or Nagging Wife Syndrome. It seems to lay dormant until I spot crumbs on the counter tops, pants beside the hamper, or socks in the bathroom floor. Then suddenly, I feel my disorder resurface and take over my body. I forget all about what a wonderful husband I have, how much he loves me, how much he loves our children, and I seem to suddenly forget about all the wonderful things he DOES DO. My memory is erased and suddenly all I recall is the garbage can that is overflowing or those pesky counter crumbs.   Dare I say this next part? When NWS kicks in to full blown disease, I sometimes even find myself slamming my kitchen cabinets a little harder, shoving bowls and glasses in them a little louder as if to say, "" SEE ALL I DO AROUND HERE."" I breathe and sigh out loud and think of my poor little self as nothing less than a martyr for my family.       AND THEN, God smacks me on the bottom and lovingly says, "" WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??"" And as much as it hurts to be disciplined, I'm so glad He does it or else I would be one horribly rotten bratty kid of His.      So this week, I have been challenged over this NWS disorder. I realize there is no magic pill for me to take that will humble me or make me kinder to this wonderful man I married. BUT, there is a remedy I have found that does work.     I've been reading over the word of God and finding scriptures of what a woman with NWS really is like... I found one in Proverbs that says, "" A nagging wife is a like constant drip."" OOOOUCH! You know when your sink faucet just DRIPS, DRIPS, DRIPS, and it drives you absolutely insane??? That's what I am like to my husband when I get a NWS flareup. OOh, the poor guy. There is nothing more annoying than a constant drip.     God also reminded me that none of those stupid little things that I allow to get to me, are ""character"" issues. So what if he occasionally forgets to pick up his socks? Or his pants? Or wipe off the counter after he made a sandwich? Really and truly, if that is ALL I can find to complain about with my husband (and it is!), than I am one truly, truly, deeply blessed woman. And I AM!    My husband prays for me, prays over me, reads his bible every day, he always wakes up in a good mood and treats me kindly, he loves our children, he even helps change diapers for a 9 year old without complaint (that alone SHOULD SHUT ME UP!), he is full of integrity, he works hard, he is honest, gentle, and most of all, he looks past SOOOO many of my faults without ever making note of them (at least outloud! ha).    So, as I concentrate on all the things that DO matter, it seems I can feel my disorder begin to fade away like an old rash. I realize it's still there (and probably always will be), but whether or not it surfaces and takes over my whole body (and MOUTH), is really up to me.     So my prayer this week is to appreciate, love, respect, honor, and cherish this wonderful man I have. To be his cheerleader and not his critic, to encourage him not discourage him, and to be a bubbling spring.. NOT a constant DRIP."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"Well, having two kids home all day makes my life sing to a different tune! So I am realizing there is no way for me to update this every day (unless someone out there wants to adopt two boys', ha), so I will attempt to write at least every other or every 2 days!         I have to give a quick praise before I begin my usual ""rant."" ha!    Austin has been talking up a storm lately- making sentences like never before. So yesterday, he was playing with Jacob and they got into an argument (surprise, surprise!), and Austin says, "" You stop it right now! GOT IT?!"" It was so funny considering that is my LINE to my kids. Makes you realize they really do listen to you afterall. ha! But Austin was talking so much yesterday that Jacob said, "" MOM, would you please make him be quiet?"" I realize to most of you this is not a big deal, but it made me cry. I remember BEGGING God to give Austin just ONE word, but never in all my wildest dreams did I imagine he would talk so much he would annoy people. ha! I, then of course told Jacob, "" Nope Jacob, remember how we prayed hard that Austin would talk? Well, mommy isn't going to shut him up now!""  So then Jacob says, "" well mom, could you at least make him talk in the other room?"" ha!      He still has far to go but God is really doing an amazing work here in this child's life. What a blessing!!     We also survived the 4th of July. Austin did great ALL day long despite the fireworks but towards 10 p.m. people were shooting them in all directions around our house. It was almost scaring me! ha! He got upset for about 15 minutes crying and saying he was scared, so I just took him into his bed, turned on every fan in our house, played some praise music, and rubbed his back until he fell asleep. It was much more tolerable than the years before so a HUGE thank you to everyone that said a prayer for him. :)      Other than that, I am just in several situations right now in my life that are requiring me to trust in the Lord. We had been promised something 4 months ago that would've changed our circumstances tremendously and 2 days ago, that promise was broken. There are a few other life altering situations going on in my sphere of reality right now that I have absolutely NO control over. These aren't little ""broken nail"" issues either. I have NO idea how any of these things are going to turn out or what our lives will be in 6 months from now.     This morning as I lye in bed (trying hard to go back to sleep), I felt the Lord tell me that this place I am at right now in my life is a beautiful, sweet, and precious place to be. I have no options or alternatives right now but to trust the Lord. I don't have the slightest idea what the future holds but I know the one that holds my future. And that same promise He made to me years ago came back to mind.. "" I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord.""      I really just have to take comfort that God knows already what will become of all these situations, how He will walk us through them, and where He will lead us.     Right now, I am learning to have Jesus be ENOUGH for me. Not knowing can drive me insane but if I just focus all my energy on loving Him.. "" Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you."" Matthew 6:33    It will all work out on the end because God is in control of my life... I'm not in control (thankfully!), my circumstances aren't in control... God is!     So this week I am focusing on that truth and finding peace in it."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"This week seems to have brought about many highlights!     * VBS and Music Camp are over with!

This kid is part fish.. I am convinced.     * Another ""lady"" hit on my husband this week, the interesting thing is that it was RIGHT in my home. She asks me, "" Do you think Josh still loves you?"" I replied, "" Yes!"" and she said, "" ooooh.. because I think he's pretty cute.""  Nevermind the fact she is 6 years old! :)    * I drank Green tea 3 days in a row.

1RFEQHW,female,26,"This has been a tough few days. My dad's health problems continue to get worse and it's breaking my heart to see my family go downhill. I don't know how to describe the pain I'm carrying over my parent's other than a deep ""gut ache.""     I know God has been preparing me for some of this and as grateful as I am, it is still hard.     In my heart I believe my dad probably won't be on this earth much longer and although on one hand that brings a sense of peace (knowing he will be out of his misery- physically and mentally), and on the other hand, it just hurts.     I hate facing death. It's not as if it won't come to us or it won't touch everyone of our lives... we know it's always there and there is always that possibility of it arriving into our lives at any moment, but when the concept of reality actually IS reality... it's hard to grasp.    And yet, I know this is what faith is all about. It's easy to preach you trust and believe God but what about when the rubber meets the road?     I think I'm beginning to smell rubber.     4th of July is also upon us and it's always something I dread every year. Austin is horribly terrified of fireworks and he actually had to be sedated a few times because of his panic attacks from hearing them.    Today I took the boys' to the park and somebody nearby was shooting fireworks. Austin started screaming "" I'm scared"" and ran to the car. He cried and held his ears, yelling "" NO Pops"" (that's what he calls them becuase of the POP sound, ha!). It breaks my heart to see him so scared. It's not as if I can reason with him like you can a typical child... he only knows something is loud and terrifying.     The whole ride home he says, "" I'msorry I was scared."" Bless his heart. He doesn't even know why it sets him off like it does.    So I am praying God covers his ears over the next 4 days and fill Austin's heart with peace.      I am praying God cover me as well.... and feel me with peace. I definitely need Him today."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I ask that you all be in prayer for my family.     My dad's health continues to get worse but now my mom is in the hospital. She is hemorraging from her colon. They need to do a colonoscopy but have to wait because her blood is so thin and her blood pressure is too low.        Pray for God to touch and heal her, encourage her, and show Himself ever faithful through this trial."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"After what I wrote yesterday, God must be testing me or something.       On the way to take Austin to physical therapy, our car died twice (cut out). Thankfully, I made it there and back but who knows what's wrong with that thing now. This is the 4th time this has happened in the last 3 months.      My advice to anyone and everyone is to avoid purchasing an American made vehicle or at least a Ford. We've had nothing but problems with this car and just about everyone we know that has one, has the same problems.      So I realize I have a choice here-- okay, I actually have TWO choices. I can either trust God and know He will work this ""car"" thing out for us, or I can whine, complain, stress out, and get sick over something that I can't change.     You would think it would be an easy choice but this stubborn daughter of God often choses the latter for reasons' unknown.           Another thought on all the whole ""prayer and faith"" issue. A few weeks back, Jacob said to me, "" Mom I wish I had a real brother that could talk to me and play with me."" Of course, he was referring to his 9 year old brother that has autism.      It broke my heart. I said to him, "" well Jacob, we can just pray that Jesus will continue to help Austin do all those things.""      This next part REALLY got me.. He said, "" Mom, I do pray everytime but it's not working.""      OUCH.. OOOhhh... Woeee...      How do you respond to that one? Especially when you understand completely how he feels. I too pray ""everytime"" and have yet to see the full answer of healing that I am seeking. And maybe I never will. God never did promise us that in this life we would have perfect health, cars that don't break down, or trials. Actually, Jesus was pretty honest about the reality that in THIS life we will face many hardships, trials, struggles, and temptation. He never sugar coated life on earth. But He did tell us that, "" Take heart I have overcome this world."" And He promised us a much better, happier, healthier place for the rest of eternity if we just stick it out on this earth and serve Him will doing that.       So... whether or not God heals my son, fixes my car, allows for that tummy tuck (ha!), or does any of the other numerous things I desire... He is still God. He is still good and He is still worthy of my praise.       My conclusion about the whole prayer issue is not profound but I think it's true:        Sometimes God answers our prayers, sometimes He doesn't (at least not the way we wish), and sometimes He has us cling to Him until He does act and answer."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I read this today... and wow, did it ever speak to me.     This is about brokeness before God. I was thinking about how I often I pray for the Lord to give me strength, not that asking for strength is a bad thing. But I can't recall a time I prayed to God for brokeness. So maybe I should be praying for strength a little less and brokeness a little more. Strength seems more acceptable and comfortable... brokeness seems a bit more uncertain and uncomfortable. But maybe that's exactly what I need to mold my heart to please God.     This just made me think...    Are You Perfectly Broken? ""When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves."" Job 41:25 God uses most for His glory those people and things which are most perfectly broken.  The sacrifices He accepts are broken and contrite hearts.  it was the breaking down of Jacob's natural strength at Peniel that got him where God could clothe him with spiritual power.  It was breaking the surface of the rock at Horeb, by the stroke of Moses' rod, that let out the cool waters to thirsty people.  ....It was when Jesus took the five loaves and broke them, that the bread was multiplied in the very act of breaking, sufficient to feed five thousand.  It was when Mary broke her beautiful alabaster box, rendering it henceforth useless, that the pent-up perfume filled the house.  It was when Jesus allowed His precious body to be broken to pieces by thorns and nails and spear, that His inner life was poured out, like a crystal ocean, for thirsty sinners to drink and live.  It is when a beautiful grain of corn is broken up in the earth by death, that its inner heart sprouts forth and bears hundreds of other grains.  And thus, on and on, through all history, and all biography, and all vegetation, and all spiritual life, God must have broken things.  Those who are broken in wealth, and broken in self-will, and broken in their ambitions, and broken in their beautiful ideals, and broken in worldly reputation, and broken in their affections, and broken ofttimes in health; those who are despised and seem utterly forlorn and helpless, the Holy Ghost is seizing upon, and using for God's glory.  ""The lame take the prey,"" Isaiah tells us."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I have returned from sweet home Alabama.. it's good to be back. I realized when I was there, that I can never truly be happy again. When I am home here in Washington, I find myself missing my family in Alabama and missing the familiarity of ""home."" When I am back home in Alabama, I miss my husband and my home here in Washington! My grandfather said it to me best; "" your heart will be where your husband and kids are, but your home will always be here ( Alabama)."" There's just something about being able to drive by the home you grew up in, the neighborhood you rode your bike in as a kid, and see all the familiar buildings that bring back so many memories. I told God that if not for my love for Him and my desire to be in His will, I'd be back in Alabama in a second (with my husband and kids of course!). You just can't beat the south (or Chick Fil A and Sonic of which I had both last week!). A HUGE thank you to everyone who prayed for me and Austin on our flight. He was wonderful. We didn't have one issue and we had a very long day on our journey to Alabama. The trip back wasn't quite as long-- the only problem was that I was a bit ""apprehensive"" about flying back because of the terror level being raised. I know, I know.. I should trust the Lord a little more and use my imagination a little less but sure enough, as I sat down for my 4 and a half hour flight, a man of Middle Eastern descent sat down right next me. I tried very hard not to jump to conclusions, I tried making conversation with him and it became evident after I said, "" hello"" that he didn't speak English. I sat there anticipating him to yell out, "" Allah is great"" but he fell asleep 45 minutes into the flight so that enabled me to keep my eyes on him the whole time. I already figured out all the ways I would tackle him to the ground if he decided to ignite a suicide bomb. Thankfully, I had just been watching WAAAY too much Fox news and the innocent man was probably just as scared of the little blonde woman next to him that kept staring at him, as I was of him. So in a nutshell.... No... I never jump to conclusions. *smile* My mom was feeling quite a bit better by the 2nd day I was there. She actually does well until she eats- unfortunately, most people typically do that a few times a day. I was able to go with her to her doctor appointments and they had to reschedule her procedure for this coming Tuesday (Aug. 10th). There was no way I could stay that long since I had left Jacob here with his daddy so I won't be able to be there during the procedure. Just continue to pray for her. They believe they will be removing part of her colon, they just aren't sure how much just yet. Seeing my dad in the shape he is in broke my heart in a million pieces. One day he was asleep in his chair and I just stood there looking at him crying in disbelief that my young, strong, funny dad is the way he is. It hurts so much to see someone you love suffer and yet there is nothing you can do but pray. It gives me a whole new respect and concept of what God must've felt watching His Son suffer- the only difference is that He could've spared His son from the pain, but chose not to because of His love for me. There are people in my life that I love enough to die for, but I can't think of a single person that I love enough to allow one of my sons' to die for. So if you ever wonder if God loves you, think about that. I was able to see some of my wonderful family (and friends) while back there. My Aunt Pat sure looks great with all the weight she has lost.. She always was beautiful but wow, look out world! She is beginning to wonder if there is more to life than just being "" really, really, really good looking."" ha ha! ( yes, a little inside joke but trust me, it's funny) I am catching up on sleep and laundry now that I have returned. I have found that if I were to die, although my husband would be an excellent father, my children would be raised on cereal, corn dogs, and Pepsi Twist (at least they would get fruit from the Lemon). So I will be headed out shortly to buy REAL food. ha! I will try to be more faithful about updating this blog.. I had a few people ""on me"" about that so I will work harder on writing more often. Afterall, I am here to 'serve.' :) Have a great Thursday and whatever you do, don't fry bacon while naked."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I realize it's been 3 days since I've written in this blog. I apologize. We've been busy and I haven't had any quiet time to think and sit at this computer.      Yesterday we made a trip to Mt. St. Helen's with Ben (and our boys). It takes a little over an hour to get there- the drive is beautiful and amazing.       Ben was in awe of the mountains, especially Mt. St. Helen's. We drove right up to the base of it and were able to tour that visiting center. We watched a movie in there about the erruption and then walked around a bit. It was very warm outside but she was still covered in snow. It's really amazing to see God's handiwork up close and personal like that.     I was sitting there looking at the mountain wondering how anyone could look at something so awesome and not believe that there is a Creator. It just makes no sense without God in the equation.     Later on last night, Tyrone and Amy (our youth pastor), came over again for our movie night. We watched the Lord of the Rings 2 towers. Which means only one left and I have viewed them all. I think the second one was even better than the first. I can't wait to see the next one but I have to wait until they return from Mexico (missions trip).           Today I went out alone and did a little birthday shopping for my husband. He will be 30 years old (OUCH!) on Monday. The weirdest part of it is that I can remember when my parent's turned 30 and it doesn't seem that long ago.      Right now Josh and Ben are out with a bunch of guys from church playing paintball. They were all dressed in camo, they had on their masks, their guns were loaded, and they were ready for "" all out war.""      Men are funny.        I have been sneaking in (does that sound bad?) my time with the Lord but it hasn't been as consistent as it usually is. It's harder to do with company around and both the kids home from school. But I still relish the time I do have with Him.      I realize He is always with me and I continually talk with God throughout my day, but I'm talking about the time where I can just sit in His presence, enjoy His company, and stay a while. Those are the moments that feed my spirit and change my heart. And the Lord knows, it needs changin'!      *sigh* I just told Him today that I really am grateful for His grace and patience. I see so much about myself that isn't up to par, I am painfully aware of my ""flesh and sin nature"" and I pray that one day, this ""dying"" to it, will be easier for me. I haven't been feeling very successful with that lately, especially where my attitude is concerned. But, I know God is patient, loving, and merciful. Thankfully He is or else He would've given up on me a looong time ago.       So thank you God for loving me despite myself. Than you for knowing my heart and still loving me to the core of my being.        You truly are an awesome God."

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I was sitting here wondering how best to address the differences between Brett and myself on the question of religion.  I condsidered a lengthy point-counterpoint post with plenty of erudite references and high-falutin' language, but I have decided that that would serve no purpose, and would likely confuse matters even more.  I have settled on the following, then.  Our disagreement on the dating (and the importance) of the Epic of Gilgamesh called up a Sufi story I had read.    THE RESTAURATEUR  A man once opened a restaurant with a good kitchen, attractive tables and an excellent menu.  One of his friends came along soon afterwards and said:  ""Why have you not got a sign like all the other eating-places?  I suggest you put on it ""RESTAURANT: FINEST FOOD.""  When the sign was painted and put up, another enquirer asked: ""Why are you not more specific?  You could mean any old restaurant.  Add the words ""SERVED HERE"" and the sign will be complete.""  The owner thought that this was a good idea, and he had the signboard duly altered.  Not long afterwards someone else came along and said: ""Why do you put ""HERE""?  Surely anyone can see where the food is served?""  So the owner had the sign changed.  Presently a further curious member of the public wanted to know: ""Do you not know that the word ""SERVED"" is redundant?  All restaurants and shops serve.  Why not take it out?""  So that word was taken out.  Now another visitor said: ""If you continue to use the phrase ""FINEST FOOD"", some may accuse you of arrogance, others might not agree.  To avoid criticism and contention, remove the word ""FINEST"".""  And so he did.  Now just the word ""FOOD""  was to be seen on the sign, and a sixth individual put his head through the doorway.  ""Why have you got the word ""FOOD"" on your restaurant? Anyone can see you serve food here.""  So the Restaurateur took down the sign.  As he did so he could not help wondering when someone who was hungry, rather than curious or intellectual, would come along...   I suppose I'm trying to say that I'm hungry.  Does the relative chronology of the book of Genesis and an Akkadian epic matter much to my faith?  Not really.  I see most of that as ""changing the sign"" without bothering to try the food.  This of course brings up the wider issue of ""faith vs. reason"".  You mentioned in the commentary on the Gilgamesh post that I was ""operating from faith rather than reason.""  While I may disagree with you on that specific point (I'm not sure that you have proven that the Genesis account is a ripoff of the Gilgamesh account--have you read them both?), I will readily agree that there are  many  instances where I may believe something that is ""irrational"".  Religion is not a math equation.    So what's the deal?  We will likely touch on this issue over and over again over the course of our collaboration, so I will satisfy myself with a very brief gloss:  Olivier Clement once wrote that ""history, including the history of Christianity, is littered with chariactures of God.""  In my studies (and I'll say again that I have spent a great deal of time in my ""search""), I have found that most of these chariactures arose and currently thrive in the West.  From the social God of southern culture, to the ""buddy Jesus"" of mealy-mouthed Protestantism, to the cold God of the ""philosphers"", I've been forced time and time again to reevaluate what I've been taught, what I thought I knew, and what I  can  know.    I am finding myself more and more drawn to Orthodox Christianity.  Christianity, after all, is an EASTERN religion.  Suffice it to say that the difference between Eastern and Western Christianity is much larger than I initially suspected.  The Orthodox have retained the ""inner"" Christianity.  They adhere to Tradition, they manifest Tradition, they practice the ""faith of the fathers"".  When confronted with literally thousands of shades of Christianity, it became important for me to identify the Church that Christ founded on earth.    ""But he didn't found a church! He was the ultimate anti-institutionalist.  How DARE you suggest that there can POSSIBLY be a valid AUTHORITY in matters of religion?""    My studies have confirmed me in one thing:  I don't know anything.  And I certainly don't know enough to ascribe to MYSELF any sort of religious authority.  Do I trust my own uneducated and tentative interpretation of the scriptures?  Hell no.  Do I consider myself holy?  Quite the opposite.  Does holiness even exist today?  Sure.    ""But institutionalized/organized religion is CORRUPT.""  Sure it is.  It is human, and things mixed up with humanity tend to come out the worse for it.  I don't need perfection.  That's a pipe dream.   ""What about the suppression and systematic censorship of 'early Christianity'?""  Pick an issue and we'll explore it.  Deal?   In my visits to Father Elia, one of the first things he said to me was burned very vividly into my memory.  ""Being of the opinion that Jesus is the Son of God is not enough to be a Christian"".   I like the exhortation in Luke:  ""But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade me cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.  For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted (14:10-11)."

On Exactitude in Science ...In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters.

2XYKSTV,male,35,"Okay okay okay... I got the word secondhand from a friend who saw it on ""I Love the 90s"".  Apparently the Alanis Morissette song ""You Oughta Know"" is about Dave Coulier.  That's right.. Uncle Joey from ""Full House"".  The link above takes you to snopes, the Urban Legend busters.  The site lists the status of the rumor as ""undetermined"", but supposedly the news was all over the airwaves yesterday (I don't watch much TV so I cannot verify).   IF this is true, I have two questions.   1.  UNCLE FUCKING JOEY!?!?!?!?!?!  Dave Coulier, the lovable goofball who nauseated me every afternoon with his Bullwinkle impressions (ugh) and his wholsome humor (mygod) is apparently a BORDERLINE PEDOPHILE.  Alanis, bless her heart, was nineteen when big Uncle J dogged her out.  Assuming that the song's lyrics are accurate reflections of what went on between them,  we learn disturbing things about Coulier's sexual proclivities.  To be precise: Uncle Joey was fellated in a movie theater by a girl who was fifteen years his junior.  ""Cut it out"".  This brings up a second question:   2. Who the hell cast ""Full House""?!?!?!  This show was a sappy family affair that featured ""ouch""-inducing jokes and ""cute warfare"".  It always ended with some sort of life lesson and a big hug.  So when the producers were sitting around preparing to launch, I want to know who the hell suggested Bob Sagat, a pervert who has made many references to masturbating in his trailer during shoots and ""banging"" Kimmy numerous times, for the lead role?  And not only Sagat, but Mr. Dave ""I Was Fellated By A Little Girl in a Movie Theater"" Coulier.  Irony has never been so.... ironic?   Note: the above was designed to be hyperbolic for comedic purposes.  On the off chance that Mr. Coulier reads this entry (he has nothing better to do):  ""Go get em Dave!

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I've been working on some articles to self. One is called ""the anomaly factor"". I've been a party to many discussions about the origins of humans, the religious giving all the credit to the largest thing they can think of, an all knowing, omnipotent being & the science minded giving credit to the tiniest of particles. The religious give a compelling argument that pulls at the very heart, all stirring the emotions. The science minded gives an equally compelling theory, one that has the mind reeling with possibilities. Both seem to have one thing in common, an agenda. I've tried VERY hard to not have an agenda so, I argue with both sides just to see how deep their waters run.  An atheist friend of mine said ""It was not his job to disprove a god, any more than it was to disprove the existence of peter pan. It was, instead, the job of those who made up such an obnoxious being to prove it."" I told him, ""I don't know about proving, but..They are doing a great job at convincing."" I went on to tell him, breaking down a form to the tiniest particle of it's make up & then noting the function of each tiny particle is not a good argument AGAINST a god. (Which is his method of arguing his side.) It's rather like, taking a great painting, dissecting it in a lab, telling us what chemicals made up the paints, what fabrics were used to make up the canvas and then once you have it all broken down to it's tiniest of particle, you still have no answer when one asks, ""But what can you tell me about the artist who painted it?""  On the other side of the fence, I've noted that not one person has ever argued with me about the pro-existence of a god with out using ""Order"" as the foundation of their ""proof"" argument. Just like the non believer uses chaos & random theories to prove no one is in control, there for, there is no god. The Godless man points to the injustice of dying children, successful criminals, career murderers, lying super powers, that rule both the political & religious worlds. And just as you are starting to see it his way, you think... That makes since, but what is since? And isn’t something qualifying itself as ""making since"" in itself subject to some form of order? I mean, if he’s speaking against order & I can easily follow the order of his thought flow, isn’t it all self defeating? Wouldn’t his anti argument work much better if he simply stated, ""aluminum sulfate is the highest quantum material known to the paraplegic giraffe and this has been proven in a quart of lard, further more, all of this talk of god has given me a terrible case of the claps and if I had a safety pin... I could prove that there is no such thing as geese and that’s the way that cookie bounces, so...go on now.. You’ve buttered your bread, now go on & lie in it!"" ..?  Back to the pro-creation ilk. To them, God wants order, when things get out of order then it must be destroyed, or manipulated, in order to maintain order. These people will point to order in nature as proof that their must be a god, for without something orchestrating nature, how can order happen? Some even get poetic with it, claiming, ""to understand the language of nature is to speak with god. To be able to interpret the brave heart of a lion, the cunning of the panther, the nobility of the willow or the wisdom of the serpent, is to begin to understand the nature of god all mighty."" That's all very lovely but, what about the other side of nature. What about the sliminess of slugs? the hideousness of cockroaches? the pointlessness of love bugs? or even more, what about the lying, greedy, egotistical nature of the being that claims it self the most god like of all in nature? the human being?! What does this tell us of god? Oh yea & what about toe jam, schmegma, genital warts, pee, pee & poo, poo, boogers & snot and last of all Jimmy Buffet! ""Forget all of that! Products of sin!"" Says the holy man. Christ says ""Consider the lilies of the field..."" If I had been there when/if Christ said that, I would have said, ""Yes, JC, let’s consider them shall we... Note how they do nothing but bring beauty to the fields, yet still they will fold and die in the blistering winds of your winter, some will be trodden under foot or most unjustly, ripped from the ground in their prime, by some testosterone driven, pimple faced oaf and handed clumsily to some unsuspecting, ditzy, nymph, as if it were some pre-payment for acts of passion, that in most cases, never takes place. Especially if she’s allergic. ... Now, what were you going to say about the lilies, before I so rudely interrupted you...?""  Well, just like the atheist, the religious man most often fails to see the contradictions that unfold in the garden of his own speaking. When you point out that the reason order is so compelling in nature, is because, it can be argued, that it’s so rare an occurrence & that chaos doesn’t rule out the anomaly factor that is order. If you take a hand full of feathers and fling them in the air, they will all land at random. It's chaos in motion! Yet, some will land simultaneously. Is that order? Or synchronized random event? In other words, synchronized chaos?!! A stream of order, jetting stream line through a great chaotic mass.  More later on the anomaly that is order.... Now I must organize my CD collection ;-)   (Which leads to an ""off the subject"" question, just how many artist do you have in the ""Q"" section of your collection? Quasi & Queen is about all I have at the moment.. )"
2XYKSTV,male,35,"Finished that biography of Jack Kirby. Although i have a deep respect for the man, when before he was just a name, i am absolutely disgusted with the comic book industry. The bits where the book related who created what, how ideas and characters evolved, which companies made which innovations, and Kirby's time in World War 2... all of that had me hooked. However, a lot of the book was about the numerous ugly disputes over money and ownership. Comic books are deeply ugly and exploitative. I'm not sure if i want to learn any more about this subject, as it leaves everything i like about the medium tasting of ashes. I don't know how people like Alan Moore, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, and all of these slavish homage payers can stomach the mess.

Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth end up together as do Jane and Mr. Brigley so it all turns out.  I have book club tonight at Emily's.  I went shopping today for my senior portrate outfit.  I got this really cute knee-length white skirt and a sky blue top an Ann Taylor.  I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure and I also got these cute black sandals that will go with it.  The new premium outlet mall is awesome.  Yall should check it out.  I'm so excited for book club.  Every month we switch off, last month I had it and we read Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya sisterhood.  Tonight we decide who has the next one and what book we should read.  Any ideas?"
A3ZYG05,female,17,"I just spent an hour writing an account of what happened yesterday when I went to the movies with Catie, and then my computer crashed right before I clicked publish post. I'm so frustrated with technology, supposed-to-make-our-lives-easier bull crap.  Grrr.."
A3ZYG05,female,17,"Today I went on a website and realized I had outgrown an old friend.  Let me explain. When I was in middle school, my favorite book series was not the critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, although both are entertaining, clever and written extremely well.  I loved going on adventures with Frodo, Sam, Harry, and Ron, but I never felt like their magical world actually pertained to my mine, their problems, while thrilling, never were mine.  I loved their lives, but knew I could never live in their fantasy existence.  Alice McKinley was a girl who had a life I could relate to.   The Alice series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor posed the same dilemma's that I had.  Asked and answered the same questions that bothered me. There must be about 10 or 11 books out and I have read them all.  They start when she's in sixth grade and I think she's now a sophomore.  6th grade is time when you're outgrowing the junior section of the library but not quite ready for the teenage section.  Alice, a book  about  a 6th grader was my bridge into new territory.  I avidly read all of her books wishing she was real and I could be her friend.  When I heard they were going to make a movie, I knew I was perfect for the starring role.    But I am fast outgrowing Alice.   There are 3 books to every year of Alice's life, and while at one point we were the same age, I have finally surpassed Alice.  A sad thing, like losing a close friend.  She got me through some tough times and for that I'll always be thankful.  And while I'll still probably read the Alice books, they aren't quite for me anymore.  They are for the thousands of others yet to discover her, and in doing so, will discover themselves."
A3ZYG05,female,17,"It's really late at night and I'm super tired but I don't want to go to bed.  See I have work tomorrow, and besides putting off that, I'm hiding from the fact that I'll have to say goodbye to Tom tonight, since he won't be awake when I leave, and he'll be gone when I get home.   Already gone to Texas.  Forever.  Lord, I'll miss that kid."
A3ZYG05,female,17,"My morning was luxurious, I didn't wake up until 10:48, which may not sound like much to you, but I think it beats my previous record of 10:30.  I come from a family of early birds, it's uncommon for my dad to sleep past 5:30.  So when I get up at 8 he always jokes that the day is half over, that I may as well just give up and go back to bed.  I wonder what I'm going to do today.  Sundays always seem to drag by..."
A3ZYG05,female,17,"So I just spent a night with some of my nearest and dearest, Catie, Kathryn and Kelly.  Kelly is our driver most of the time because her mom bought her a car.  We were hanging out at her house and when it was time to go home she pulled her car out of the garage and smashed into her Mom's car.  Her Mom's car just had a little scratch but Kel's car is scrunched in the back with big scratches.  All in all, its not that bad, but you know how traumatizing a first fender bender can be. Her mom took it pretty well considering but their insurance is going to go up now. Poor Kelly, she was crying and we were all trying to make conversation to keep the mood light, but it wasn't really working.  Finally I just tried to be quiet, knowing that nothing I could say would make her feel any better. I gave her hug and told her I loved her when I left.  I know there are much much worse things in this world, but its hard to keep that in mind when something happens to you--and I feel Kel's pain. (I got pulled over 2 weeks after I had failed my drivers test for not stopping completely on right on red.  I almost hit the cop car, can't understand what he was so upset about)  I think we were both wondering why stuff like this always seems to happen to people who don't deserve it.  As much as I hate to admit it, the answer is that there really is no answer.  There is no higher reason for why Kelly had to hit her Mom's car tonight.    I hope the girl feels better, since she doesn't read this, I'm just going to ESP her a message. FEEL BETTER, FEEL BETTER, FEEL BETTER, WE LOVE YOU KELLY!!!!!!!!!"
A3ZYG05,female,17,Isn't it weird to think of the millions of people who pass through our lives unnoticed?  The potential friends  never even seen as they are passed by.  How many friends do we lose from those we've never met?
A3ZYG05,female,17,"Today work did not, I repeat,  not  make me want to shoot myself.  In fact I might go so far to say it wasn't bad at all.  In fact,you might even say I was  content !  I know this comes as a surprise to my readers that I could ever put ""content"" and ""work"" in the same sentence, in fact it came as a surprise to even me.   ""Life is funny with it's twists and turns, as everyone of us sometimes learns"" that's from a poem called  don't Quit  and I think its really true.  Have you ever had something really unexpected happen?  I mean something that was  absolutely   hopeless  and somehow, it all worked out in the end?  You do a double-take and think ""wow, did that really work out? How did that happen?""   ""Everything will work in the end, if its not working out, its not the end""  Take it from a 67 year old man in my church, for every thing there is a reason, and in the end, all of your inconveniences and troubles, turned out for the best."
A3ZYG05,female,17,"I really wish that I didnt have to move in the middle of high school.  I was cleaning out my closet, flipping through old year books from middle school, and thinking how unfortunate that I didn't get to go to highschool with the people I grew up with. Or grow up with the people I went to High School with. Not that my friends in here aren't great, in fact they're wonderful, and I'm blessed to know most of them, but I don't have that history that they have. Its sad (but necessary) to see your old best friends move on and make new ones.  Even though you've done the same. People always say they'll keep in touch, but its never like it was.  (Sorry Tom I miss you hun, and we all think of you and wonder what you're doing) Its annoying though, to make the transition in the middle of high school. Once in awhile (these times are far and few between) when I go back and look at old memories I feel like I'm straddling two lives, one in Gurnee and one in Naperville. My past is there, and my present here, and who knows where the heck my future is? For all those who were the new kid at one point, you know what I'm talking about. Most of the time it doesn't bother me, but now and again I wonder what if.  What if my dad hadn't have gotten transferred? What if I had gone to Carmel or Warren? Who would my friends have been? Would I have turned out as a different person? What if we had moved into another school district? What if what if what if. All these doubts. And then I remember. Life in Naperville aint that bad. My school is fun, my problems workable, my friends and family--always interesting. And the memories?  Irreplaceable."
A3ZYG05,female,17,"Writing in this thing while waiting for my Dad to get out of meetings on our lunch break is really working out.  He said to come back at 12:30 and we would eat then but he's stuck in a phone meeting with some guy.  He's actually right in the office next to this so I can hear them talking.  If he stays too late we won't be able to go to the park for lunch.  Its really lonely when you have no one to talk to at lunch time.  Today I went to a seminar on what exactly title insurance is. It was ok, ate up all of my morning.  Last night I hung out with the clan.  We always go to the Meadow Glens parking lot to meet, and from there we went to caribou. I got a free cup of coffee because Tom ordered it without whip cream and they put it on, so they made another one and they gave us that one for free.  Then we went back to the parking lot where we met up with Jeremy who had just got back from work and we test drove his mini-van and Amits.  I had never driven a van so it was good times.   Jer told us there was homicide near our house.  A few weeks ago we had seen this house that had yellow tape all over it and like 10 cop cars and we asked what was going on but they wouldn't tell us.  Jer's Mom works for the police dept. And that's how she found out what really went down.  Apparently the victim was found half-naked in a pool of blood, curiously enough she was found by the ex-husband who called the cops.  Hmmm ...That doesn't look incriminating.    My dad still isn't back.  Its now 12:49. I'm going to finish my lunch.  Well hope all you guys out there are finding life enjoyable. Au revior."
0CAT92G,male,24,"Be wary of statistics. For a long while now, I have noted with amusement various statistics meant to frighten, cajole and persuade. At first glance, these statistics are frightening, but a dose of cynicism and a little bit of thinking will go a long way.  Sensationalism runs amok at eDiets.com: ""Now here's some scary news: Harvard School of Public Health research indicates women who drank at least one sugar-sweetened soda a day were 85 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who drank less!""  Well, yes, I don't doubt the veracity of the study. Upon cursory glance, it seems quite legitimate – isn't heavy sugar consumption linked to diabetes? Yes and no. People who consume a lot of sugar are generally overweight, and obesity is definitely a cause of diabetes. But simply consuming a lot of sugar will not, in itself, cause diabetes.   Then, it is very likely that ""one sugar-sweetened soda a day"" will not cause an 85 percent jump in the diabetes rate. One sugar-sweetened soda a day, coupled with an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, will. This Harvard study found a correlation, not a causation.  Not convinced? Look at this snippet from an  urlLink AP article :   ""According to [the] study, the women most prone to gaining weight had increased their consumption of sugary soft drinks from less than one a week to more than one a day. On average, those women gained nine-10 pounds in a four-year period. But women who cut their intake of soft drinks gained an average of three pounds or less.""    Honestly, I am not entirely sure what this means. Did the study organizers pick the women most prone to gaining weight and ask them to increase their soda consumption more than seven-fold? In any case, it is clear that there is a very fundamental question here: What caused the increase in diabetes – the increase in sugar consumption or the increase in weight?  In a nod to fair and balanced reporting, the AP quoted a press release from the National Soft Drink Association that responded to the study. The soft drink makers called the study ""unconvincing and inconclusive"" because it raises questions over ""factors that could create inaccuracies."" The article stopped there, but a quick skim of the  urlLink press release  provides the needed details:   ""It is unknown whether or not this study adjusted for all of the above risk factors for type 2 diabetes or for other risk factors sometimes referred to in the medical literature such as high salt intake, high blood pressure, alcohol intake and high fat intake. If this study were adjusted for all of these confounding factors, it is doubtful it would show any risk for developing type 2 diabetes from soft drink consumption,"" said Dr. Richard Adamson, vice president for scientific and technical affairs for NSDA.    The moral of the story? It's easy to fall victim to scary statistics. Respond with your mind rather than your fears. Always look at both sides of an issue. And don't believe everything you read."
0CAT92G,male,24,"I feel really bad for Darryl, the 13-year-old black kid who was  urlLink brought up on criminal charges  after he finally fought back against bullies who had been picking on him for years. (Can I say ""black kid?"" or is it rude? Oh well.) Apparently the kids used to hit him, pee on him, call him gay, and so forth.  But what I find interesting is this quote from a news piece about it:  Daryl, who cried at his sentencing hearing Wednesday, says kids at his school are still making fun of him daily even after all that he's been through.  ""Most of the time they call me white,"" said Daryl, who is black. ""It's better than what they were calling me before. But I've learned not to deal with them."" So apparently ""white"" is better than ""gay."" I think I'm happy to hear that? Still, I don't like the fact that ""white"" is an insult to a black guy. I wouldn't be insulted if somebody called me ""black."" I guess the spectrum, then, is as follows:  Gay --> White --> Black  Okay. I'm glad we got that straightened out."
0CAT92G,male,24,"Challenge 2, Week 3, Day 7   I'm not sure this is working. It seems I can only be enthusiastic about one or two things at once. Fitness may have fallen below the breaking point. I'll keep you updated."
0CAT92G,male,24,"Feelin' good  Okay, so I went to the gym tonight and did chest/triceps/shoulders. I didn't have a lot of time, so I worked my chest most, followed by the latter two. I did pretty well on dumbbell bench press, doing:  12 reps at 15 pounds each (warm-up) 10 reps at 25 pounds each 8 reps at 35 pounds each 6 reps at 50 pounds each 12 reps at 35 pounds each  That really taxed me out... I could barely get the last rep in... then I tried to do 12 dumbbell flyes at 20 lbs each but found myself dead after 3 reps. I switched down to 15 lbs and was able to get up to 12 total.  You know, it's funny -- when I was putting together the ""About Me"" section of the web page, I came to the ""Hobbies"" line and thought to myself, what do I like to do with my free time? Besides vegging out in front of the computer, that is... And I put down ""reading"" ""writing"" and ""working out.""  I wasn't so sure about working out -- could I consider it a hobby? Am I that into it? Well, I realize that I AM into it. A few years ago I was this dork who had hardly set foot into a gym in his life and disdained all things physical... and now I actually enjoy it. And when I'm on, I really get into it! I've read all about exercises and proper form and nutrition and all that -- I probably know more than 4 out of 5 people about that stuff now. I try to get enough protein and I drink lots of water daily and at the gym I wear tank tops and I even grunt on the heavy sets!  I also cut my hair kinda short and am growing a pseudo-goatee, so with the tank top on I actually look somewhat rough and mean, which is neat because I am in reality smooth and nice.  Anyway, enough workout-talk tonight. I am going to *try* to get up in less than 5 hours and do some cardio. I highly doubt I'll make it out of my bed, but at least I will try. Oh yeah, that's the thing... lifting is tons of fun; cardio can be kind of a drag. Cardio's much more fun when it's part of a game like basketball... just sitting there pedaling in place can be tedious and hard. But that's what I have to do to melt the fat. So that's what I'll do (no use having muscles if they're buried under a layer of flab)."
0CAT92G,male,24,"On track.   So this is how it's playing out: On lifting days, I end up going to the gym pretty late, and pushing it hard. Then the next morning I'll do cardio before work. It's only been 4 days but this seems like an easy routine to maintain, as compared to my previous ""Get to the gym every morning at 7 a.m."" delusion, which left me tired for the rest of the day. Never enough sleep with that one. With  this  plan, however, the rest comes naturally.  I like it!"
0CAT92G,male,24,"Damn   Wow, my biceps are already tired from last night. Actually I don't think they ever regained their energy after last night!! And now they are big and tired and will soon be pretty sore. SWEET.  :-D"
0CAT92G,male,24,"Challenge 2, Week 2, Day 3   ""We no other pains endure Than those that we ourselves procure."" -Spencer Dryden   On Monday night, during my lower body workout, I pulled a muscle in my lower back. It wasn't during a set itself, but between sets. I had just finished 12 reps of 210 lbs. on the leg press (relatively light for me), and as I twisted my torso left and down to pick up my log, I felt an excruciating spasm in my lower back. I was able to walk it off and continue with my workout, and on Tuesday I had no problems -- until I was about to go to sleep. As I was getting ready for bed, the pain returned, and it was worse than it had been -- so bad, that I couldn't even move without stabbing pain radiating from the muscle I no doubt pulled.  I was unable to go to work today, and unable to workout. Thus, this week does not look so good for me, BFL-wise. However, I do look thinner -- many people have commented on it -- and I am keeping to a healthy diet. Proper nutrition is, after all, half the battle.  Hopefully I will be well enough to do some cardio and maybe light weights in the next couple of days, but until further notice, I plan to postpone working out HARD until Monday. And I will, accordingly, make next week the new Week 2.  yes, I can do that.  :-)"
0CAT92G,male,24,"Tired. Damn stupid tired! Cycles! Tired! Crap!   When I don't exercise on a regular basis, I get tired. Very tired. Then, it's hard to get back into exercising because I lack energy.

W68579V,male,24,"i watch ""walker, texas ranger.""  i know it's not quality tv, but i'm helpless.  i seem to have a weakness for crappy, overly dramatic tv, case in point, that time i was addicted to melrose place in tenth grade.  besides the fact that i can't/couldn't manage to tear myself away from either of them, walker and melrose place were/are nothing at all alike.  at least i had an exuse for the melrose place deal, i was fifteen.  i think i like walker so much because it appeals not only to my desire to be passively entertained, but it fits into what i feel like the medium of tv should be, which is simply to entertain people.  tv tends to render itself useless, or worse yet, earn itself a false pretense of usefulness whenever it tries to pass itself off as a medium that can accomplish any sort of elevated discourse on significant issues.  there are, of course, exceptions to that rule, but by and large, people forumlating most of their opinions on subjects that are even slightly deeper than trivial based on what they see on tv seems more harmful than helpful.    i don't feel so bad about watching walker.  feeling: restrained, or maybe constrained thinking of: the hierarchy of needs music:   urlLink ""standard"" paradigm"

W68579V,male,24,"there are ants in my bathtub.  not many, just when i go in there in the mornings, i see two or three, but that's been the case for a little while now.  i can't figure out why they're there, i've sprayed in there a few times and everything, and it doesn't seem as though there'd be anything in there to keep them coming back, i mean unless they  like  eating soap.  i wouldn't be so puzzled if i saw them in the kitchen too, i mean they're likely to at least find some crumbs there, hanging out in my bathtub, all they get is drowned when i turn the water on.  keeping with bathroom/shower stuff, albertson's doesn't carry my brand of mousse anymore, which sucks because i have to go to walgreen's to get it now, and walgreen's is way more out of the way than albertson's is.  i use condition by clairol, and i'm not at all in the mind of switching, i've used other stuff, and none of i've found to be adequate, i got pretty thick hair.  i thought about calling clairol and ordering a crate of it or something like that, but that'd be weird, and i'm not sure where i'd keep it.  i can get gold bond at walgreen's too though, that's a plus.  feeling: resourceful thinking of: bone, mid-hiatus music: ""you found me"" MxPx, via the Altar Boys"

65RDFE2,female,27,"Hello everyone.  Some of my college friends just started a blog so that we can all keep in touch and share photos, etc.  I realized this would be the perfect format for a new generation of the Chronicle.  I hope you'll agree.  I'm new to this, but so far it seems pretty simple.  I think I have to invite everyone to become members of the blog, then we can all post messages.  There are lots of different things we can do with this blog.  It's kind of like the Chronicle without the deadlines!  Once you create an account, you can post messages yourself whenever you want.  In other words, it doesn't have to go through me first.  Then, once a message is posted, other people can post comments just by clicking on ""Post a comment"" at the end of the post.  We can also post photos.  This requires a program called "" urlLink hello ,"" which you can download for free.  (Just click on the word "" urlLink hello "" and you will magically be transported to the site where you can download the program.)  It's fairly self-explanatory, though it can be a bit confusing at first.  If it's too confusing or you don't want to download the program onto your computer, you can always e-mail any photos to me, and I can post them for you.  We can also create links to all kinds of things.  I have already created a link to the map of Michael's sailing trip (see right).  Links over on the right have to be created by me, but you can put links within your own postings (like I did with ""hello"").  I created this blog at  urlLink www.blogspot.com  completely for free.  While I created it, of course any and all suggestions are welcome.  The sky's the limit.  Let's blog!"

65RDFE2,female,27,"Dustin and I went to Clarksburg over the weekend to see our newest family member, Minah.  She is super cute.  I am thrilled to say that I witnessed Brian changing a diaper.  We all spent a lot of time just looking at Minah waiting for her to do something.  She slept a lot.  At Paula’s, Nathan grilled up some steaks (delicious) on their new grill and Dustin, Nathan, Michelle (Nathan’s girlfriend), and I played “Cornhole,” a game where you try to throw beanbags into the hole of a wooden contraption.  (I’m sure there’s a more official name for this game, but I kind of like the  urlLink Beavis & Butthead -ish name.)  I played truly horribly at first, then started redeeming myself just as it began to get dark outside.  I had a request to remove all of the photos from this main page, since they can now all be viewed in the photo gallery.  I can’t do this because the photos in the photo gallery are linked to the original posted photos.  (Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I can’t really explain it any better than that.)  The way the blog works, new postings appear at the top of the page, moving everything down on the page.  This allows you to read the most recent material first.  The main page displays seven days of postings.  Older postings are archived each month.  Right now, we only have five days of postings (well, six days after this post).  So the more we post, the faster stuff will be moved off of the page and into the archives.  So let’s write!  I think maybe the best thing for posting tons of photos all at once would be for me to just put them in the photo gallery.  If people want to post just a few photos at a time, that’s fine, but for a large volume of photos, just e-mail them to me and I can put them in the photo gallery.  Then I can just add a posting that lets people know there are new photos to look at.  (By the way, there’s an article about weblogs in the most recent issue of Time.  You can check it out  urlLink here .)"

Minus the fact that I have TONS of homework this weekend, I'm ready to relax on Sunday and Monday!  :-)  I think I'm gonna get the rest of my evil homework out of the way in snippets.  I have like, 5 pages of Music Theory homework... BLAH!  Then I have a bunch of math homework.  I also need to go out and buy some Zip disks for my music tech. class.  I have to study for my quiz in that class, too.  Anyhow, I'm gonna go back and lay in bed for a bit more til I have to jump in the shower and eat some lunch before going to campus for lab.  BLAH!  :-)"
W48QVCZ,female,23,"Well, things are starting to come together for the new schoolyear of ASK.  As of now, we have 67 kids enrolled, but I'm sure we'll get a handful more next week... and a handful more the first week of school.  I'm a little tiffed right now, because I only have 3 other staff members, and apparently I'll be in ratio.  I do not want to be in ratio... that's WAY too much to expect of a site manager with over 50 kids.  So, I'm really (at this point) counting on those other 2 handfuls of enrollment... because that means I get another staff member PLUS a secondary manager.  I have so much stuff to do next week, it's ridiculous.  I have stuff to do at the office M-F again... T-Th is training stuff... Friday I have CPR training/testing for my renewal.  In addition to that, Tuesday morning I have to be at the support center at 8am to pick up stuff to take to the site... yeah... this means I get to drive the truck so that we can get all the baskets there.  :-\  I really HATE driving the truck... this is because it's HOT in Texas, and the truck has no A/C.  :-(  Oh well... such is life, I guess.  I'm really trying to find the positive in everything, though.  I'm excited to go back and see the kids... I've really missed a lot of them, and about 75% of our enrollment is repeat customers!  :-)  I'm also excited about the new program we're trying this year... and I plan on doing a lot of fun things with music and drama and such... The plan is that Friday's will be ""free form"" meaning, we don't have to do any projects, or homework program, or other things... so we'll be able to put on little programs!  I'm pysched... I think one of the things we're going to do is have a ""club"" that's like American Idol (because there are a LOT of kids interested in it) and so then on a Free Form Friday, we'll have them perform something for the whole group.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now.  Talk to you peoples later... leave comments... it's good for the brain.  ;)"

W48QVCZ,female,23,"WACKY WEDNESDAY    1. Poetry or prose?  Poetry 2. Funky modern art or the older, ""classic"" variety?  Classic 3. Sculptures or paintings?  Both 4. Theatre: exuberant musical or serious drama?  Exuberant Musical 5. Ballet or modern dance?  Ballet AND Modern Dance  :-) 6. Movies: major studio or indie?  Indie films are cool (like Memento and May) but I enjoy the major studio pictures as well 7. Authors: Shakespeare or Dr. Seuss?  Shakespeare 8. TV: PBS or A&E?  A&E 9. Music: Beethoven or Beatles?  I love both, though I'd choose the Beatles over Beethoven if I wanted to feel more carefree 10. Thought-provoking question of the week: You are a contributing member of your favorite art museum, and visit on a regular basis. They announce a new, temporary special exhibit by an artist surrounded by controversy...this person's work and/or political views offend you. Do you stop supporting the museum, or just stay away during the time the exhibit is there?  I'd just stay away... I wouldn't want to be hypocritical... and art by definition is a way to express thoughts/opinions freely... so it'd be stupid to stop supporting that just because I don't agree with what an artist thinks..."

But this summer... nada... :-(  I guess I'll just have to go visit Patty on my own, or something.  Patty and Trinity... *sigh*  It's a sad thought... not seeing them like, every night."
W48QVCZ,female,23,"I'm feeling very giddy lately... :-)  This week of classes went by extremely quickly... and very well.  I've been having a great time catching up with people in the music dept. and just sitting around laughing.  It reminds me very much of HS band, actually... except it's not quite as clique-ish.  Plus, I think that Sally is over the whole ""Jered and me talking"" thing... She sat next to me in microcomputer class... and we helped each other out.  Jered looks so different!!!  He cut off his moustache and goatee!!!  He looks a lot younger without all the facial hair... Anyhow, he accidentally walked into my music theory class... as he was making his rather humourous exit, he waved hi to me, said ""see ya later Kelsie"" and gave me a wink.  He's such a flirt!  Of course everyone then turned to me and asked if something was brewing there.  Then I had to explain to about 15 people that he and I had a class last semester and became friends.  Ugh... Now, in addition to Mattie always trailing me, I have Brent trailing me now too.  Freshmen... Brent is much less direct about it, though.  He's a very subtle admirer... which I appreciate, because I can still be friends with him.  It's more difficult to be nice around Mattie, because I'm always afraid he's going to ask me out or try to put his arms all around me and stuff.  Anyhow... it was so funny yesterday, because me, Naomi, Sandy and Bridget went to the JPL building for some breakfast before our science class... and Brent came in... he came right over to the table (it was just me and Naomi there) and he gave me this big hug.  He was meeting some others from the music dept. for some breakfast and all.  Anyhow... after he left, Naomi was like, ""Ooooh... Kelsie.  Who was that... he was ALL about giving you the big hug!""  Hahaha  She's so funny!  I explained to her that I knew him from music stuff... he's a freshman... and that he apparently developed some little thing for me over the break.  I'd never date him.  Superficial as it may seem, I like guys who are taller than me... and Brent is like, 5' 5"".  He's really sweet, though... and he's a GREAT guitar player.  So, yeah... onto work stuff....  Work has been pretty great this week, too.  We had some interesting stuff go on this week... one thing is apparently Mary (another Child Care Specialist) told some of the boys in the 4th/5th grade group she'd take them to a movie this weekend.  Now, I don't know if I'm the only one... but that just seems WRONG.  I don't think that we should have outside contact with these kids.  Now, I know I'm hypocritical for saying this... given the Joe stuff from HS... but, it's just different for elementary school kids... plus, there has to be authority in our situation.  Joe had no authority with us at all... he was too casual from the get-go for that.  But anyway, she's going to not have as much of an authority standpoint with these guys... not to mention, if the other kids found out, they won't understand why THOSE boys get to go to a movie with her and not them.  At any rate, I don't think that Greg knows about it... and I now have to decide if I should say anything or not.  As it is, it was harder for ME to control that group this week, because they were always wandering off in the cafeteria (during roll) to go and talk to Mary about going to the movie this weekend.  Then yesterday I saw her talking to one of the boys' parents about it, and the Mom got pretty upset about her wanting to take her son to a movie.  She was saying to the boy, ""We don't KNOW her... you can't just go out with a STRANGER to a movie... I've never even TALKED to her before...!!!""  Why is this...?  Because Mary doesn't talk to parents... EVER.  And that's one of the things she's supposed to do.  Greg has gotten really pissed at her lately because she's not doing her job very well.  She doesn't really care about what she's supposed to do.  She just tries to win the affections of the guys in the oldest group.  That's why he put me in charge of it the past two weeks.  That and he wanted to be paired up with me (since Greg W quit and Greg's had to be in ratio).  Oy... also, yesterday Steve (or Scuba Steve as we call him) came to substitute (he's an A.S.K. sub)... and he's come several times before to sub at our site... he's really cool.  He's usually pretty quiet... he really only talks to Greg and me.  And... okay... so, yesterday he was acting different around me.  Like, he walked me to my car when I left... he's never done that... and his truck wasn't THAT far from mine... I dunno what's going on there...  Anyhow... that's all for now..."

JA96WUD,female,15,"so this is the second time im writing today because the first time it didnt publish for some reason. alot of shit has been going on lately, so i think that this is a good way to vent. its seems like my life is out of my control. the only thing that keeps me sane is dancing...but sometimes i think im not that good....so whats the point? i dunno i feel like my studdio is holding me back from being the best dancer i can be....but i guess if i keep loving to do it it will all be ok.   So i honestly have no idea what happened to my realtionship with my mom. we used to be so close and we used have such a good relationship? what the hell happened. ever since i started school it seems like she doesnt wanna let me grow or experience new things...and i want to have new friends. she doesnt trust me and she thinks im just gonna drink and smoke and have sex. but i wont. lately we cant be in  a room with each other for more than five minutes without yelling at each other or getting into a fight. i think she hates me, in fact i kno she does cuase shes told me enough times. it seems she'll do anything to make me miserable and i dont kno what i did, except not take her shit. i love her...i truly do..but our relationship is deteriorating before my eyes and it seems theres absolutley nothing i can do about it.   Don't get me wrong i still love all my friends from my old school: cara sarah courtney po ryan jacob and nikki. for a while me and cara were drifting but were cool now thank god, shes one of my bestest friends. i kno u guys care about me and ill always love you.    I just really like change...but sometimes its not a good thing.....today i read meryl's journal and i wasnt mentioned in it at all....i havent realized how long its been since we've hung out. i miss her..but things have been so different since our stupid ""drama"" and i dont know how to fix it....i love chs and the people there but sometimes i cant tell...i just wish people werent so fake.     lately ive been so annoyed with a particular person i cant take it anymore nad i dont know how long ill last before i just flip out. this person is just so god damn sensitive i have no idea how to say anything...and how can u tell someone to just buzz off when youve known them for so long and they consider you their best friend?     School has been insane. exams are coming up. there must be something wrong with me because i studied for so long for one geometry test and i still got a 69. fuck. a good number, yes, but not for a test. people have such high expectations of me. its just been really hard for me to pretend to be happy lately, and i think maybe people have started to notice.     Today i did nothing but homework and sleep. it seems like i could sleep for ten days and maybe no one would no the difference. maybe i could wake up and everything would be perfect again....but i doubt that could ever happen....and why do guys play games? i guess ill never kno      To all my close friends dont even worry bout me....i just really needed to vent...this is exactly what i needed.....its really hard for me to open up to people, and when i do im constantly worried about the fact that theyll say something or think differently of me....i really needed to just lay it all out.....i dont care anymore.....people knowing how i feel is important to me..."

D15GI1X,female,26,"Went through an emotional day. Was sneezing so badly in the morning until it developed into full blown sinus..wah se..the feeling is horrid. Took 2 Chlopheniramine tabs and expected to be knocked out by afternoon. True to my words, I did and hobbled in my cubicle like a walking zombie. Didn't even bother to put makeup cos really felt lousy. Even attempted to stay awake by standing and reading my files.  But I glad its over. The medicine worked. And its all that mattered. Lose something, gain something. Forgo my sombreness, regained my health.  Went to wtc today to repair my film camera. Ya, not a typo, its film not digital, almost in antique phase. Even Canon said they no longer have the gadgets to repair my camera but will do their best. I beilieve them. Many suggested I throw away this camera and get a new one. That's becos I could easily get a good and new film camera for less than $200. Or if I had wanted some flexibility, could have contemplated getting a digital one.   But its not so simple. The Canon camera which I am currently using had accompanied me all over the world..Redang, Ipoh, KL, JB, Kota Tingi, Malacca, Phuket, PhiPhi, Chicken Island, Bangkok, Krabi, Turkey, Washington DC, Florida, New York, Korea, Nepal, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Ooty, Kolam, Allapey, Trivandrum, Sri Lanka. Its packed with memories.    You will never forsake something which had been through thick and thin with you, right?    Took a bus home from wtc seah im bus-stop. Another place stained with my memories. Will remember that particular spot for life. Same place, same setting, same atmosphere, but different emotions. Strangely, no more strong feelings.  Hi, hope you have found your 100% :)"
D15GI1X,female,26,"Wow, finally..elaine you are back. Have been waiting for you to be back. The worst thing is I don't know where you were and when you would be back.  You see, elaine is this friend of mine from MPS (Mountbatten Pri School). FYI, this retro school had been reduced to shambles. No more MPS now, what remains are just piles and piles of sand opposite the Old Airport Road Market.  Anyway, she works as a SIA air stewardess. And seems to be always flying around. Can never keep track of where she is flyign to and when she is coming back.  Need her help to sort out some + stuff. Hopefully can resolve this misunderstanding soon cos it has obviously dragged on for too long. I remembered my sis telling me that I have rather high expectations of people around me, but tell me how can I not be when they refused to self-improve and move on?  Imagine changes to only your body while your mental and emotional development remaining stagnant....that's scary...extremely horrifying..eeeeeeeeekkkkkkk....pls pls do something about it. It's time to buck up. Have a match with my niece, she is making superb progress. Already knows how to run and babytalk even though she is barely 12 months.  haha..my mum is talking to her now :) Can feel her sense of pride as she speaks to ningning over the phone even though she can't make out what she is actually saying."

D15GI1X,female,26,"wow..been 2 weeks. and i have come to love you more and more each day. not good with words, but i think u are one person i know who understands me, or should i say really make it a point to know how i am feeling.  adeline met with an accident yesterday during office hours. got a shock when she called and sms-ed me after the accident. i was stuck in a full day's meeting and didn't see her sms till 4pm when i came out of the meeting room. gave me a BIG shock cos it reminded me of corina. when i met her yesterday at raffles place before i had dinner with zz jl sm and limin, she seemed alright. who would know she actually woke up and started crying in the middle of the night? got me real worried this morning when she called me. din know wat to do and darling's face just came into my mind immediately. was very affected when he told me he will rush down to accompany adeline to the doctor cos i couldn't take leave. really..can't describe how touched i was. remembered telling him i would love a man who can love my family and friends as much as he loves me :) 10 more points for u darling..haha. that was not all. in the end adeline finished her clinic visit early. so me and darling didn't get to meet her at IOH. we went for a simple lunch at pearl's centre. was quality time spent just talking to him over the that short 45 mins lunch break. he walked me back to the office in the mild drizzle under that baby blue umbrella. met felicia and saw her shocked look. aiya who cares :) that wasn't all. he went on to find a particular type of chinese medicine to improve blood circulation for adeline ( haha..i didn't mean to give the wrong instructions darling !) he didn't give up when he couldn't find it at silat. went on to chinatown and eventually got the meds. after that we arranged to deliver the meds to ade but she was asleep liao. Lord, pls tell me how can i not be moved?  really must thank God. cos he had protected adeline me and lan eng from extreme danger yesterday. adeline was hit by a car but escape unscathed. only buttock pain. whereas for me and lan eng, God shielded us from lightning yesterday. both of us just stepped out of the office buildings when suddenly two bouts of lightning struck JUST ABOVE OUR HEADS like two swords crossing in the air. the one above my head hit the alarm bell two foot steps away from me. the alarm sounded. both of us were so terrified we stood there rooted to the ground, and couldn't move for that few seconds. WOW..can u imagine? lan eng and i were hyperventilating after that all the way to the bus-stop. thank God once again, for protecting me and lan eng and adeline :)  he lost his wallet during his boxing lesson and felt very demoralised. broke my heart. but i cheered him up once again..now you know my power haha. he still insisted on delivering the medicine to ade and sending me home after that.   little little things make the man. i agree with you jet.  716 :)"

D15GI1X,female,26,"my goodness, angie baby...now i fully understand how it feels to have a bad tummyache.  churning, bloated, stomach cramps..took the medicine darling made for me, i believe i am on the road to recovery.  quite worried abt mum. my mum goes for regular checkups at marine parade polyclinic because of moderately high blood pressure, of which she is currently on medication. that day her polyclinic doctor called her and asked her to go back for a review, but as the phonecall was answered by my sis in the midst of her sleep, she did not question further. and mum has delayed her visit to the dr because of various ""unvalid"" reasons like ah ning, work..  mummy, pls be obedient k. go and see your dr on monday. i m really worried. i pray for  Lord to watch over you from above, and for your happiness and good health, always  :) Amen."

D15GI1X,female,26,"hey Angelina Jolie, that new blogskin of yours is cool, definitely when compared to the keypad of your laptop, if you know what I mean. Frankly speaking, think you are really like me. we both reflect on our lives instead of squandering it away..haha. yup, i felt guilty yesterday evening and decided to come home early.   really think i am very xing fu, and I came to realise this not just recently, but long ago. i am surrounded by fantastic people. give you an example. my parents and sisters love me; my liebling loves and pampers me. i meet nice uncle when i was buying mee goreng at the hawker centre - uncle makes it a point to pack all my 3 plastic bags full of tabao stuff into a single carrier so its easier for me to handle; i met an interesting and outspoken trainer during my 3-day course; my coursemates are real funny and crappy - really brighten up the leadership course i am currently attending; corina remembers me - she called me up yesterday afternoon just to share a simple joy that she is experiencing with me (hey don't abuse the $ you just got from your claims!!); uncle wuts was so happy and pleased to see me on wed when i went back to NUH to visit him and the rest of my ex-colleagues; and most importantly I know that  God loves me   extremely to bring all these nice people to me and surround me every moment :)  it's amazing whenever i think of the things that God has planned for me. I sincerely thank him for everything that has happened in my life. These things were there for a reason.  i woke up this morning feeling extremely loved by everyone. isn't that wonderful?"
D15GI1X,female,26,"Am having lunch now, and blogging at the same time. I know you would see this, that's why I had to find time to write. To let you know I am here for you. Silence speaks, right?  It's hard to withstand this day of solitude from you, even though it's just 24 hours.   I am amazed by the extent that I am missing you; dunno who's  'committing suicide'  in the end..haha  I'll wait for you tomorrow, and pray for your safety and strength.   Haha..not very articulate. But that's essentially me..and what I wanted to say."

5LYQBTQ,male,27,"There has been (too) much debate in recent years about the style of music used in churches. Many fans of the contemporary approach shun all old songs and many fans of old songs seemingly shun anything written after 1899. As worship leader at my church, I try to do a mix of both. Sometimes we play old hymns in new ways, sometimes we play old hymns in old way and sometimes we play new songs. I think this is the best approach. That's just my opinion though. Today, I was listening to the Passion Worship Band's  Hymns: Ancient and Modern  on my iPod. One song they do is ""How Great Thou Art."" They arrange it in a new way and it sounds pretty good. (Note to all CCJ folks, I like our band's version  much better . But I digress...) Often, I have heard a song so many times that the meaning is kind of lost on me. I paid attention today though. ""How Great Thou Art"" may be one of the best praise & worship songs ever.   O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder, Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made; I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy power throughout the universe displayed.   Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art!   And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing; Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in; That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.   Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art!   When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation, And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.  Then I shall bow, in humble adoration, And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""   Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art!    Go back and reread those lyrics, especially the second verse. God's grace is great, something I may never understand but I am so thankful that He provided it to me."

Today, after lunch at home, I walked out the door for my walk back to work. As always when I walk, my iPod was right there with me. I stepped out the door and ""What A Wonderful World"" just happened to start right at that moment.     ""I see trees of green/Red roses too/I watch them bloom/For me and you/And I think to myself/What a wonderful world.""   At that moment the sky was a radiant blue and to my right, roses were indeed in full bloom in a neighbor's front yard.   Sappy, sure but the mood was right and the world was right as Louis Armstrong sang one of my 'funeral songs' (a song I want played at my funeral) in that gravelly voice that fits the song so well.

5LYQBTQ,male,27,"urlLink      I miss the guitar solo.   I know that I'm biased because I'm a guitar player but I always felt like a good butt-kickin' guitar solo took a song to a whole new level. Notice how ""Stairway To Heaven"" utilizes Jimmy Page's beautiful solo to kick the song into fifth gear. Classic.  Recently, a guy at work loaned me his copy of  urlLink G3: Live in Concert  featuring Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. A veritable smorgasbord of gutar solos. My friend, Daniel Copeland, and I saw Satriani in concert in 1998 and we left just amazed at the level of technical skill displayed. However, the downside of the guitar solo was also on display that night. It can be too much of a good thing if it's done with no soul. It's hard for Satriani, Vai and the like to achieve the proper amount of soul because their songs are nothing but a big solo. But I digress …  Think about your average '80s glam metal song and there's a good example of a soul-less solo. The solo took the song nowhere and was just an excuse for the guitar player to show his chops (think most any Poison song). Eddie Van Halen kind of started this trend but EVH had a little more soul to his playing than the average knock-off. Slash, of Guns 'n Roses, started to reverse this trend with his more bluesy leads and the way he played for the song instead of playing against it (think November Rain or Sweet Child O' Mine). Then came grunge.   Many think Nirvana et al. eliminated the guitar solo but they really just minimized it it. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""  does  have a guitar solo. Albeit a repeat of the melody line. Pearl Jam had lots of guitar solos, just not in every song and they were always tasteful I thought. Then came the rap-metal phase of rock and guitar solos went the way of the T-Rex. Emphasis was now on groove and riffs. Players with any skill were sidelined and had to be content churning out the riffs. I always liked Creed's guitar player, Mark Tremonti because he came up with some monster riffs. Only on a few occasions did he have the chance to rip off a solo and when he did, it was always a good one. I wonder how many Creed songs could have been improved if Scott Stapp had shut up a little more and let Tremonti play a bit more. I'm hoping his post-Creed band will feature more of his playing and less of the posing that plagued Creed.  This is getting to be more of a ramble than anything so I will end it with a question. What are a few of your your favorite guitar solos? I'll answer mine in the first comment."
3PLAE2J,female,26,"I just remembered something about a scene I saw last week while going home from PCA when I took my nephews swimming.  I passed by my old school...St Peter the Apostle, and through the gates I saw large machines, like a bulldozer and the one with the large panghakot. But what I didn't see was the old chapel. It was demolished na, because of the newly-constructed other church in the same compound.  That was the chapel where I was baptized, where my aunt got married, where I sang in a choir innumerable times, where I celebrated many Christmas masses.   I had my sixth grade graduation practice there, but never got to attend the actual event because I got chicken pox. This was where I felt sadness during a funeral mass for my choir teacher and dear friend, and where I felt really really happy during masses attended with friends.  I will always remember the tile on the floor with those retro asterisks. The way the sun would pass through the stained glass windows and color everybody a greenish-yellow hue. The way the air felt because it had no air-conditioning. The art deco-ish altar. The ""I am the way, the Truth and the Life"" in front, with the unaligned ""I"". My church was stark and simple, as life was then."
3PLAE2J,female,26,"Last night, decked out in a party outfit, I was looking for some shoes in the shoe rack when my father took a look at me and said: ""You're a  metrosexual. "" Take note, these are English subtitles. The audio is Hokkien, except for the M-word. (I think I watched one DVD too many). That same moment, my dad was ready to go to a different party,clad in a lilac-colored barong Tagalog and his two year-old, kiwi-polished-without-fail-Florsheims.  I said, ""Pa-aaa (with the intonation of a daughter mildly exasperated with her dad), do you know what metrosexual actually means???""  ""Doesn't it mean to be modern and well-dressed?"" dad went.  So I tried to explain to him what the term was. I have to admit, that term has been pretty much abused within the past year and a half. Botox-ing Albert Martinez is  metrosexual. If Dolphy slathered on face cream he'd be metrosexual too. Or Maurice Arcache.   I just hope dad didn't talk about his ""metrosexual"" daughter at the party."

3PLAE2J,female,26,"*AXN CHANNEL VOICE-OVER*  ""Welcome and infiltrate the world of high-stakes bingo...""    Good idea kaya yon for a new reality show?  Last Sunday, dad and I decided to do some father-daughter bonding... so for our quality time, we went to go to this benefit BINGO event in World Trade Center in Roxas (UP Med was the beneficiary). Last week, dad saw this poster in Manila Doctor's hospital advertising the bingo thingie... Aba, Php100,000 at LEAST ang prize per game? Very interesting. Dad wanted to see how the bingo thing was done, so he could get ideas for a fund raiser.   The poster read: P2 MILLION MUST GO! Aba, nagtataka kami. Dad was channeling his inner MBA at nagcocompute na siya sa brain niya, where did the P2-M come from? How many P1,000 tickets should be sold para bumawi and to cover the prizes, and still get enough profit.  Nagulat ako when we walked towards WTC (at kagad may isang scalper na lumapit para magbenta ng ticket less P50 pesos). The parking lot was more than full and a lot of people were outside. We bought a ticket... which includes: - 8 sheets/pages (1 sheet one game) of bingo cards. With one page=one game. And the sheet was divided into 4 separate bingo cards. -A stub for a sandwich and a can of soda (serious bingo players need all the sustenance they can get). -A stub for free entrance to Casino Filipino  -Free dauber(?). I'm not sure of the spelling. But in bingo parlance, it's the pen-thingie which does the colored dotting thing on the bingo cards. Di na pala uso yung nagpapatong ng butong-pakwan sa mga numbers.  The bingo pala was being held by PAGCOR, kaya naman pala kaya nila mag-mount ng bingo of this size!    So dad and I entered tapos WHOOOOOOOOOOSH! Parang blast of dizzy. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this moment. The whole WTC exhibit hall was full of people. Hundreds of tables... Amidst the tables were high chairs like they use to referee tennis matches, with somebody assigned to spot the people shouting Bingo! A stage in the middle with a large screen and a big streamer saying ""IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SHOUT BINGO""... and Pepe Pimentel. (But of course, who else).   Dad left me by myself for awhile as I inserted my self into this group of friendly-looking people. Mukhang family sila. The dad was on my left and the mom on my right. Tinuruan nila ako kasi di ko maintindihan yung mga patterns for each game. Crazy T, 4-Leaf Clover, 2 Floating Stamps, 3- Layer Cake. Aba, may mga tawag talaga dun sa mga patterns.Ang tagal tagal ko nang hindi naglalaro ng bingo. I bet standard na 'to sa mga mall bingos!   Whenever someone would shout BINGO, the tennis-referee-like guys would blow their whistles and a fire-alarm bell would ring. Collective groaning all around, and guffaws shempre pag false alarm pala yon, bwahahahahah! Printed on the bingo card sheets pala are numbers. So the referee-guys would just relay the numbers to the stage guys, and lalabas yung game card sa screen. Verified kagad if nabuo talaga yung pattern or not. Sobrang hi-tech na pala ang bingo ngayon.  Later on dumating si Benj to help me hehehe. Benj it turns out, is a Bingo Virgin. He has a vague idea of how a game works, and has never ever played it before. I let him do the dotting-thingie on one game para ma-""empower"" siya. Hehehe.  His interesting questions: 1)Bakit hindi naka-arrange in increasing numbers, for example, all the letters under B in a card?-->Nasagot din naman ni Benj kagad to by himself.  2)Kung nasa database naman yung itsura ng winning card, why don't they just announce na may nanalo na? -->Answers: a)May mga absent-minded na hindi nila alam na bingo na sila, so more chances of winning! b)If they did that,eh di parang raffle na yun. Mas may thrill sumigaw ng bingo! c)Mas may laugh trip pag may mga false alarm.  Speaking of false alarms, may isang nag bad bingo, and then you could see on the screen na hindi talaga mukhang arrow pattern yung nasa bingo card niya. I heard someone exclaim  ""Ang layo naman non!""   The prize for the last game was P1-million pesos. Nung innanounce na ni Pepe that it was the last chance to win P1-M, the WTC crowd erupted in a roar of table-thumping. Ang galeng! Parang partly yung dinner scene ng mga orphans sa ""Oliver!"", and partly an amalgamation of all those battle movies na kailangan ng war cry. Exciting! (Natatawa lang ata si Benj)  In the end, we didn't win anything, hehehe. Pero it was a unique experience nonetheless. :)"

Medyo may coffee-ish taste yung syrup, and it's creamier in texture rather than jello-ish. Incidentally, Dennis also makes yummy adobo and saging na saba!  We had a hilarious time laughing about our nilagang-baboy adventures. I told him about my aversion to nilagang baboy, ever since that incident in the St. Peter cafeteria.

He fished out the piece with a fork...gulat siya kasi may baboy nipple on the center of the meat square. Bwahahaha!     ""My water bag broke!""    Classic movie line! Anyhoo, nakalimutan ko i-kwento... earlier this week, a woman gave birth in the driveway of our old College of Dent building.   It started when my prof Doc Danny saw this woman clutching her belly in pain across Faura near the Supreme Court. The woman told him she was due in July pa. He then pointed her to the direction of PGH tapos sinamahan na rin niya patawid.  Now, to get to PGH from the Supreme Court, there's a short cut where you go through the Dent driveway. When they got there, medyo whooosh! Milky and clear fluid plus blood hit the ground. Reminds of that scene in Sex and The City where Miranda broke her bag, spilling fluid on Carrie's Christian Louboutins. Nataranta si Doc Danny so he left the woman by the guard house to call for help.  Maya-maya, yung vendor sa labas nagpahiram ng monoblock chair. Patients in the Dent lobby, a lot without teeth, became instant midwives. She gave birth right then and there. Somebody lent a surprisingly clean towel. Med students arrived. While they were waiting for the stretcher, somebody cut the cord with a Swiss knife some-kind-of-sterilized with a lighter.  It's a boy!"

I think if she wanted to win, she can train her cam on her then shoot!  Anyhoo, we spent the session traipsing (naks, how does one actually traipse?) around Intramuros and the Orchidarium.

Not to mention, she's the better wizard in terms of casting spells.    Only in the Philippines   More on watching movies. Movie watching in the Philippines is a totally unique experience. Buti na lang it's relatively cheap to watch a movie here. Pinoy audiences are not the silent type. If they feel that Tobey Macguire needs help, well,  ""Ilag Peter!!! Andyan na ang kalaban!!!""   Okay, the last one was a generalizing statement, but I just wanted to share a moment while watching Harry III at SM Manila with Bentot. At one scene where Hermione, frightened from the hippogriff named Buckbeak, grabs Ron's hand, most of the audience collectively went ""Uyyyyyyyyy!!!!"" Kulang na lang duktungan ng ""May gusto!!!!""

3PLAE2J,female,26,"yahooooooo!   No more cavities!      Yesterday was my last appointment with Doc Bok... just in time, because before I drove over to her house, I was walking down the street to get the car when I realized my mouth felt a little bit more spacious. Kinakapa ko yung tooth ko   with my tongue when I realized that I must've swallowed my temporary filling. Pag higop (?) ko ng hangin...Wahhhh! Nangingilo na! I must've have flicked the tempo away when I was flossing.     Anyhow, that afternoon, my inlay was cemented in. As opposed to a regular filling done in the clinic, an inlay has to be fabricated in a dental lab. Medyo masakit sa bulsa, since I have no income at the present. Buti na lang merong dentist's discount, sigh.     After the appointment, Bok and I went to Cafe Cio for cheap coffee. I am always on the lookout for cheaper alternatives to Starbuko and I highly recommend this place... for now.     Cafe Cio is located on Jupiter street near the entrance to Bel Air 2, malapit sa Aristocrat. For now, they have this promo wherein every food item you purchase comes with a free cafe Americano. For an additional Php 20, you can upgrade your Americano to a latte, flat white, Vienna or cappu. Not a bad deal. Cafe Cio is a Dencio's company, and their food menu only has Pinoy merienda food like ensaymada, bibingka, sansrival, chicken empanada, and suman sa latik. Thus, you can get a big ensaymada with a short cafe mocha for just Php 50. The cafe mocha's pretty tasty...very frothy on top. Good thing 'cause I don't like the whipped cream version much, like in Starbucks.  The place is frequented by a mix of some students (Mapua Makati?) and businessmen in the afternoons.  At night, well, hindi ko alam. :)  The place looks pretty nice, you walk up through a kind-of-driveway into a garden, and there is also an air-conditioned area with couches, etc where the drinks are ordered.     Gotta hit the books!

PQW3SJ6,female,47,"S  o... The other night, I promised a posting about the documentary  "" urlLink  Vinyl  "".     The film, by Alan Zweig, examines the obsession for collecting vinyl records. Alan, a confirmed vinyl obsessive, take us on a field-trip through the lives and homes of various fellow vinyl-collectors. It is fascinating on one level, and downright sad, on many other levels.    First of all, most of the collectors live in homes and lives governed by piles and piles of records. One describes his nightly ritual of moving boxes and boxes of records from off and in front of his bed. Then there are: the guy who has memorized every K-tel playlist, the guy attempting to collect every record ever made, the guy who had played every record he owns in alphabetical order.... over 4 years. The list goes on.    There is, perhaps a sense of ""thank God that isn't me"" that rises up in the viewer -- as well as a little envy Or maybe that's just me. I have to admit that I have a record collection, as well. Mine, however, fills only 6 milk crates (rather ubiquitous to anyone who had LPs in the 70s and 80s) -- miniscule compared to the guy who has half a million records in his 2-bedroom apartment!    Ironically, when I first flipped to the station, the first guy who was being interviewed was sheepishly admitting to having thrown out a huge collection of records when his brother was set to move in with him.... He didn't want to know that someone else had his records. Why ironic? This was Geoff Pevere being interviewed. Geoff, respected film critic and co-author of ""Mondo Canuck"". The brother was Bob, my best buddy in college.    The sight of Geoff and a friend turfing crate after crate, after crate of LPs into a dumpster made me nearly weep.    You see, my collection was doubled, back in the mid-80s when my brother bought out the stock of a defunct record store. He opened the door to the warehouse and said ""Take as many as you want!"" I took over 100... restraining myself, somehow, from taking the whole lot.    While a lot of the stock was 80s Pop music, which I loathe, I did find a lot of European EPs, dance, New Wave, and Japanese stuff. There were also collector editions, shape and picture LPs, including Meatloaf's ""Bat Out of Hell"" and a Michael Jackson Limited Edition, 9-pack of singles pressed on red vinyl (from ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get It"" to ""Thriller"". MJ from black to white.). I had high hopes of this making me some big money (though I hated MJ even before he became a pedophile). Sadly, those hopes have been dashed as he heads slowly and surely towards Segregation at a penitentiary.    ""Vinyl"" is available on   urlLink  video   . I highly recommend it."

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"urlLink Pseudo Stars.   Oh that's my blog. Bookmark me, k? Well, I've got work to do mostly for Coach Waters. And some for Mrs. Heffner, and I'm sure that Mr.Huff gave me some work. But, oh well. You know? I'm such a slacker. But, I don't care all too much. Bah. Who does?  Well, for those of you that don't know I've been writing a lot of poems lately, and it's mainly because of personal reasons. Only like, well, three people that know those reason have read it, and two that don't. So, about five, without the family counting. w00t. I like it, but It will never be posted unless I'm totally sure no one reads this ever. Advisors tell me it seems to make me appear very bitter. Although, they deny it, I agree, I am bitter. And a bit jaded. But, hey, have you seen my art lately? Have you read my book lately? Being Jaded like this can rock some hard ass. I mean, oh well, I have issues with getting close to people now. They can really get over it. It's just hard, because I hardly have trust in people and the human race in general. Who cares though? It's my issue, I've got a couple, I'll deal. Everyone around me will deal. Bleh, so, screw you people that don't.   You all know I love you, for the most part. And I say for the most part because, I like half of you a lot more than you deserve. That's mainly because I know I get annoyed a lot quicker than I used to. but, I changed a lot, and so did everyone else, if you ask me. I won't list the ways, but they did. And I did. And I'm happy with the change! So nah!   Oh, Progress Reports. Let's not go there. Heck, I'm doing all right, but not as good as I should be. Ah, tainted playlist. Well, not as good as I should be, is like B-ish. And I have a 99 in art. Oh wow. Unexpected. I'm a terrible artist, but whatever. Okay not terrible, but I'm not the best either. Anyway, I'm going to move on.  ANNA LOVES AB-BOY!!  It is so damn obvious. I swear, they are so going to start dating senior year. She is so in love with him, or his abs as she says. I tease her. Just like I tease her about everything else in the world. I get my fairshare of it too. Yeah, thanks for the nickname guys. 'Gibbs'? Seriously. Call me Carebear. Or Ephie. Or something better than Gibbs. Please, people, we need new nickname skills. Let's get lives, all of us. Together. w00t.    For all of you reading this know that you are subjected to be vented upon. So here is a vent now. I'm sort of annoyed with Anna. She totally blocked me, and up, I dunno why. I'm wondering what I did wrong this time. I wonder if she has an idea. i think she might be telling me to go away. Wai.  A loss of a best friend. Nothing said from Anna, as of yet, along she is working on her homework, unlike procrastinating me. But that's okay, I'm allowed to. I mean, WAI! Why is Anna hating! Annoyance factor rising.  Tell me Anna!! C'mon! You're mah bestest friend, please?  Also, Coach Waters, which is mainly a daily vent. WHY DO YOU MAKE ME DO THIS INFERNAL WORK!! That's all I really have to say. It just annoying. I thought I was going to do a report on the Gods and Goddess of Greece, not the Persian Wars. The Persian Wars. Ah, let me give you a run down. 1. They happened somewhere between 492 B.C. and 479 B.C.  2. The people in it had odd names 3. There are multiple King Darius..eis... 4. The people have dumb names. 5. It wasn't important enough to be made into a movie, like The Trojan Wars. Which is also a condom brand.  6. If there was a movie, it wouldn't have Viggo, Orli, Brad Pitt, or anyone cool in it.  7. It's dumb! I mean, really! WHO CARES?! They don't even have a condom named after the wars. The Trojan War must have been a war of sex or something. Stupid Persian wars, no great sex.

That was the first song that popped up on my Random. It says in the song that Love can make you stay. Somehow, I have gained belief for this. I.E., Casey. For those of you that know the story, doesn't it make sense? It does to me. I figured out..That I have a new favorite song, by my new favorite band (I have a new one each week). First off, It's either ""Kissing you goodnight"" or ""On my mind"" by Alister. Which is a band that rocks. But it's great song. I also like ""Somewhere Down in Fullerton."" Which is a great song by the same band. Anyway. I decided that my favorite movie was Ever After today. I like Princess Movies. Like The Princess Bride, which is such a GREAT movie. It's got the guy from Robin Hood: Men in Tights in it, as Wesley. Gosh I could go on for hours about that movies...those movies. I could aslo go on for hours about Homestar Runner and the enviroment.

I didn't, however have to play it until tomorrow, which requires me to RUN vigorously from C01 to A15 in order to finish my piece of shit Zelda Techno song which is just HORRID. I'd be better off playing something totally different, I'm just not musicallt talented, however, being a drama queen has it's advantages, such as drivng Mr. Jean to say ""enough drama, we'll do this tomorrow."" thank you God, thank you God!! Anyway, our drama peeps got back from conference on Sunday, and we (those of us that did not go) did get to hear about it. I was amazed by Colby Lemaster, as I always am, seeing as in my eyes, he is just remarkable. He is a juinor, and out of all the the...uh....7 people that auditioned for Sholarships Colby got 9 call backs from 9 different colleges. Truly, he is amazing, remember that name, he's not just a high school star, he'll be big, or at least, I'm hoping he makes it big, he deserves it, he's amazing. And he told me I was talented, so I nearly pissed my pants that day, even though I sounded pretty stupid, I was happy he said something, anyway, today was a new day in which I was grounded...for..ummm...a week. But that so matters not, I didn't go to school today... I'm uh....sick if you will,sick to my stomach, I was sobbing, and ugh, PMS took over....and I just died....not really...just went to sleep. Mental and Emotional breakdown really...just...ugh, had one. I am feeling so much better now though, after eating my weight in necco wafers.

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Defying Gravity.   I have a a bit of a lament.   Why is it that the blogger main page only shows blogs such as  urlLink Help Me, Bubby! , frankly Bubby, there is nothing wrong with your 80 year-old self giving out advice, but us Drama Queens do mind not being presented on the front page....I mean, I'm a High School Aspiring Director Drama Queen Artist. what am I going to complain to Bubby about that I don't complain to Dr. Abby or  urlLink Strong Bad .  Then again, there are a few good ones, such as  urlLink Spam Poerty  and of course, the very awesome and totally worth a look  urlLink Bam Diary , which is about memebers of the AMAR Fondation. Which only makes me wonder when I look at the other...uh...five or so of them, and they all end up being about the Presidental Election, which, me being a High School Aspiring Director Drama Queen Artist, I do not care as long as my parents are happy. Of course, you then click on the quick blogs, ones that have been recently up dated to find totally and utter crap such as  urlLink Kelly Osborne online  No one like you Kelly, you SUCK. No one wants to hear about how much everyone loves Kelly Osborne, because I hate her, and she dresses like a foo'. That's right, Kelly Osborne is A FOO'! Not Fool. A Foo'. Then you have the normal lamenting from College Students, such as my sister, or my friend Mike.  urlLink Oh look! Another Soapbox! , which I am not going to say is terribly bad, for this is nothing but a soapbox of a tastefuly drama queen who has a little too much time on her hands, becasue I go around clicking on links on the front page of blogger and retort my feelings to you on how badly this certian blog,  urlLink see link here , is. And of course, that blog does not suck.   Of course, then you have weonderful blogs in different lanuages, and of course, not to insult or anything, but it's just so amazing that there are blogs in  urlLink Arabic!  I think it's freakin' awesome. I don't even know what it says, but it's freakin' Arabic! How in the hell does that happen? I mean, I'm just curious. Then, you have blogs with warnings at the beginning warning people like rides warn people...you know...the nursing or pregnant thing...yeah....you know, such as  urlLink  SCHiTZoMANIa . Then you have blogs like  urlLink  Punk Rock Princess  which...are...common...misconspections. I mean, there you go, there is my lament on blogs, and you can stick that in your pipe and smoke it.  Anyway, it obvious that I have devoted this bog to drama and everything about it, because of Mr.Devlin and everything that he's done...such an impact he's had aleady....wannna be assiant director!!!

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number, baby.      If that statement is true, then why does it matter at such a young age? I'm 16...and I love someone that's 20. He's 20, as in four years older than me, as in, when I finish High School, He'll be finished with College, able to get a job and support himself and a family. And so it is looked on down the whole freaking world now? When I'm 18 and he's 22, it won't matter anymore, oddly enough because by law, now I'm an adult. So what? Why does it have to count now? He's not going to do anything to hurt me. Hell, he can't even buy liquor. And when he can? Does America thing he's really going to shove a shot glass down my throat unless I WANT him to? It's just so furstrating that everyone see it as a taboo, even my FATHER. Well, my father sees everything as a taboo, and it's not like a blame him, because I love him to death. My mother doesn't mind as much, and his parents don't mind as much, saying ""Well, as long as you don't have sex with her."" What's the problem in if he does have sex with me? It would be consensual, he'd never force me into anything. So, techincally, the statuatory rape charge is so that parents and get their daughter's boyfriend's thrown into jail because they love them=. And yes, America, maybe I am too young to know the meaning of love, but I have this unexplainable feeling for him, it's nothing like it was with any of my other beaus, it isn't purely sexual either, hell, it's hardly sexually. It being, knowing that he is always being, and thinking about you in the back of his mind, that he knows that he's yours and your his. It's...it's that he'd fly 2000 miles just to get to take you to dinner for one night, and to meet your parents. That's like 280 bucks he's willing to spend to SEE me. God, it's unexplainable, and maybe he's not my true love, but what's saying that I can't find someone that I ""love"" at 16? Nothing. Not my parents, and not God, and Most Certainly NOT America.    It's the feeling that his very being makes you happy...just him being.      GRIPE OF THE DAY/WEEK: Read ""Age Ain't Nothing But a Number,baby""?

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Cue the angst.  Angst, ah, angst. A feeling felt by most teenagers. How painful, eh? Angst is something that you have, even if you claim to be emotionless. Angst, a factor in the daily lives of us all. So, why is it that angst affects some of us more than other? Is it in our genes to be more angst than others? Or is it simply disappiontment, and a more dramatic life that people with more angst live? Is it a bad omen, or terrible karma that some how we got from our younger years? All those years of bullying others come back to you? Or maybe you weren't the bully, just the one being bullied, and are conveniced that one day, you'll have wonderful karma and get just what you want out of life, but as for now, cue the angst.  Some of us have to deal with it on a daily basis, and some of us don't, but it doesn't matter if you have that feelings, because, at some point of the day, you're around someone that is angsty. Naturally, you'll have some too, sooner or later. Face it, being happy isn't something you can do all the time, so you might as well give it up. Hiding angst is even worse, the more you hide it, the more you get. You start to develop a collection of angst, you'll you have a high-stress breakdown, and trust me, those aren't too pretty. Being a angst person myself, I can tell you this: Release your angst, openly if you must. First off, it's good for you, and second of all, it adds drama to any normal high school life. Angst + fantasy + lies + truth + betrayal = great great drama and a lovely angsty high school life.   Ciao, Steph  Song of the moment: Pretty Girl (This way) -[Sugarcult]-"
S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Hello Hades. Don't mind the orange spary paint on my mind.   A letter to Coach Waters.   Dear Mister Waters,  I am one of your students, Stephanie Hutson, of your third block Honors World History class. Here is what I think of you.  You are a tryannical man, with no compassion towards anyone that walks into your classroom. You have conformed your mind you personal ideals that you think everyone should follow. You over-load out stressed minds with excessive work, only to give us extreme toil the next day when you take 15 points off after you claim to be unable to read our writing. You say that students have never had a problem with you, well obviously you haven't met me. I am sick of your arguements that you are always right. You play God with our grades and that fact is that you are not. No longer will I stand for this satanic dictatorship in the classroom. We are not minds to be molded into your conformed and insane ways. I'm feed up with you feeding me bull shit about how having a time limit is good, even though the group is obviously missing one person that was unable to be replaced. And yet, that is somehow my fault that I am unable to furfill this because I've had plenty of time, yet, any of the required information left out would have lost me points anyway. You have to blame everything on someone else, it is never your mistake, always ours. Read this, and take heed. I am protesting your methods. I will stand against you, like many low-life peasents stood against a corrput leader. I have supporters, and I have freedom. I am a powerful force, and I will do everything that I can to stop you. Nonvoilent methods are the way, so are the teachings of Gandhi. With all that you have taught us, and all that you have forgetten, let me tell you this. History is made by people that take a stand, so sit up and watch us try, we are the future, you are nothing more than a fading image of the past, and the past is curshed. History repeats, and so it shall be with us. Deny us food, and we will take it. Deny us freedom, and we will steal it. Deny us water, and we will still drink it. Deny us our feelings, and we will show them. And deny us our speech, and we will speak louder than before. So there, Mister Waters, now you must deal with what you have created. You've molded our minds revolution. But like all the leaders before you, are you prepared to fall?  Sinceraly, Stephanie Hutson"

O8WR4EE,female,15,"So hey I'm back again sitting in my study hall wear my pj's cause it's pajama day! Well this past weekend was a good one over all. Justin came to visit me on Saturday morning and we watched the labyrinth( that movie rocks) Fifle Goes West, and Romeo and Juliet ( the new one). We had a good time just chillin watching movies in the den. Then after he left my friend Emily called and we went to Kohls where I got her to buy this cute girly shirt which is a big accomplishment if you know Emily. After that we went out to eat and then to church were I got to see Alex!! I was really excited cause I hadn't seen him in like 2 or 3 weeks. Richie and my cousin started fighting and being dumb during the service and it got really annoying. The only bad part about that night was the fact that Alex was grounded so we couldn't go anywhere afterwards. But it all turned out to be ok I went home with my sister and we made cookies. We made lots of little heart shaped ones and then a big flower and a big shamrock cookie they rocked. On Sunday I went to VCDC and I had to be there at 8 20 ( grrr) cause my parents were playing on the worship team. After church I went home and ate lunch then my dad took me to the mall to get the final things for my HC dress. I got this rocken shoes for only like 16 bucks and a pair of fishnets. On Sunday night I went to worship practice and it was ok nothing special except for maybe watching the boys play Halo on the projector. hehehe well I'm going to go ill write later peace out."

YAOMQ5O,female,23,"So I've decided that I am going to be stuck doing FHE until I have learned the importance of it and love serving in my calling. That is why I've been doing the same thing for over a year. I wish there was a way I could improve my attitude, but I just really don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. It wouldn't be so bad if I was in charge because then I would just have fun outdoors things every week and good food. Since I'm not in charge, just a lowly cog in the machine, I have to be supportive of activities that I think are lame. For example, last night we played mad libs. It was a beautiful day outside and we sat in the institute building trying to come up with funny stories that were just lame. My real concern is that we NEVER do any kind of service. Its really a shame and a waste of people who are probably willing to help whenever they can.  The mailman was there, but he came late so I couldn't talk to him before the activity. I couldn't talk to him during the activity because I was on the other team, then I had to cut and serve the brownies I made (and will not be reimbursed for). After that I was going to go talk to him, but he was on his phone, so I decided to call Kathy (my bff) back. We talked a while and when I got off, the mailman was on his way out the door to go play hockey. Whatever.  On my way home I thought that maybe it was more my fault that we weren't talking. I mean, its not like I make it really easy for him or anything. I called up and asked when I could schedule some time into his busy social calendar. He said we could hang out Tuesday (today). He was really excited sounding, so turns out he isn't trying to avoid me. Good news. So now we are hanging out tonight and I feel like I have to come up with something to do. Ugh. All I really want to do it go to Bova's frozen yogurt for white chocolate tonight. Any other ideas?  Today I'm going to lunch with my friend Patrick from work. He is really cool and is reading Atlas Shrugged right now. That book is so good and if someone likes it I immediately feel like I have a connection with them. That and the Harry Potter books. I'm such a nerd.  Derek called me yesterday, but I was already in bed. It was quite a surprise to hear from him, since he isn't the best in the world at keeping in touch. Every time I hear his voice it makes me smile and remember how happy I was when I was his close friend/girlfriend. What a kid!"
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"My fiddling lesson after work went really well. I told my teacher that I am going to play in the contest in Loveland on August 7, so now we are focusing on getting my rounds put together.  I hope that a fiddling contest is different from a normal violin contest.  My past is filled with stressful failures when it comes to violin, and I really don't want to get into that again.    After my lesson I went over for institute, but it was cancelled because the teacher's wife went into labor.  I guess that's a good enough excuse, but I was really bummed for 2 reasons.  First, there was a chance that my favorite mail man would be there.  Second, I really wanted to go waterskiing this morning and I wanted to set it up with the guy who has the boat.  Alas, neither happened, so I was outta luck.    I went home and finished up the invitations for my party.  The preliminary guest list has almost 50 people on it.  I had no idea I knew that many people in Colorado.  I have to go back to the craft store tonight and get more paper for invites.  I'm just going to invite everyone.  That way if only half can come I'll still feel like a lot of people care.  I'm tricky huh.    So I was just sitting around watching a movie and I realized that I didn't want to do that all night again.  So, I decided to call up the mail man.  It took me about 15 minutes of weighing the possibilities before calling him up.  I've never called him before, and to be honest, he never really gave me his number.  Once I was looking at his phone comparing its ghetto-ness to my own phone and I called my number.  That way he'd have my number and I'd have his.  Tricky, huh.  Anyway, after realizing that the worst case scenario was that he would laugh in my ear and tell me that I am way too losery to hang out with I decided I could handle that, and I called him up.  I was a complete idiot on the phone, but somehow invited him to come over to my house and then we'd drive to Coldstone. I've decided that I will stop giving guys a hard time for not having the guts to ask out someone that you like.  That is REALLY hard!    We got ice cream and talked until 12:30 in the morning.  He is a really interesting kid, and way cute, but for some reason I just wasn't getting all that excited.  We sat on opposite couches and talked about his last girlfriend.  In January he broke up with a girl he thought he was going to marry.  The week after he did it, he started thinking that he'd made the wrong choice and the stress was so intense that he got hives.  He's really interesting, but the whole conversation kind of sent red flags up all over the place.  I told him about Derek and everything I learned from that relationship.  It was kind of funny because after I talked about Derek, I found out that mail man and Derek had worked together two years ago on the Unity IV rocket project at BYU.  Small world.   Since I made the first effort to show him that I want to be his friend by calling him up out of the blue, its his turn to return the favor.  If he is interested I think I made it really clear that I am too.  If he isn't, he's a retard.  I just got my mid-year review back and it looks GREAT!  I think I'll probably get a pretty big step increase, so maybe I'll actaully buy that washer and dryer I've been meaning to for 3 months."
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"I started reading Screwtape Letters again, and this time I read it with a pen.  There are so many interesting ideas that are mentioned in there and for me it totally helps to make notes in the book.  This may make me a bigger nerd than anyone originally supposed, but I'm willing to bare that burden.  The book is WAY good, and I'd suggest it to anyone who wants a little introspection.  During work I had some interesting email correspondence with a friend.  I'm so glad it happened, because it cleared up a lot of issues between us.  Hopefully we can just move on now.  The only thing is it would have been so much easier to just talk about it a month ago instead of me having to be a detective to try to understand how he felt.  On the other hand, I probably needed the time to really come to grips with the truth.  After work I went shopping and found the cutest skirt and Nordstrom (my home away from home).  I probably shouldn't have bought it since I still need to buy a washer and dryer, but it was just SO cute.  Plus, I haven't bought any new clothes in over a month.  What am I working so hard for if I don't allow myself some carefree spending?  I stopped by the men's department to see if my friend was at work.  He is my crush's younger brother and I still haven’t yet decided if I want to pursue the older or younger version.  Is the brother switch possible if I change my mind half way through the summer?  He wasn't at work, so I didn't get to see him.  Then, I stopped by Galyans to watch Eric ring people up for a minute.  He is so proficient at that.   A big group of us went to dinner because a missionary that served in our ward came back for a visit.  It was weird to see him as a normal kid and meet his family and stuff. I got sucked into a long conversation with his mom, which was really strange.  She kept asking me questions and then she was listening so intently to my answers that it kind of creeped me out.  I had a hard time maintaining eye contact.  Anyway, when they left she gave me a big hug and then held me there while she told me that I had to come out to California and stay with them some time.  I was like, ""thanks, I will for sure,"" but I was thinking, ""no way, you psycho."""
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"Today two people, who I hardly get to talk to ever but I miss terribly, told me that they follow this thing every day.  I had no idea they were interested in my exploits.  Just for an ego boost for me, and for some information, why don't you take a minute to sign the guestbook and show me that you're reading.  Thanks so much!  (make sure to notice that my mom signed my book.  At least she thinks I'm cool)"
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"At 2:45 pm yesterday my phone rang.  It was Sarah saying that she was done working in the lab and ready to take me shopping.  Lately  I have been on a clothes buying rampage.  I think this spree is a result of two main impetuses. First, I don't have a washing machine handy, so I am rapidly running out of clean clothes and second, wearing a new outfit makes me feel more attractive and I'm trying to work it with the mail man.  Anyway, lethal combination.  I threw all my cubicle stuff into two boxes, packed up my computer and labeled everything for my  move in 7 minutes and was out the door.  I met Sarah at her house and we went to Pearl street.  She found this really cool store and we did a mad dash, because we only had enough change for 18 minutes on the parking meter.  I got a really cute white skirt with a big pink flower on it, and Sarah almost bought a cool pair of black and white shoes but she had restraint.  Impressive.     After our mad rushed shopping, I came back to my house to get ready for the Rockies game.  I felt retarded ""getting ready"" for a baseball game, but I knew the mail man was going to be there and I still feel like I need to look my best around him.  I drove down to the game with Colin, Eric and Brett.  It was good to be with them. It felt right.  It felt normal.  I was happy. Because I am on the FHE committee, I had a reserved parking spot right across the street from the stadium.  It was the parking spot of my dreams.  Really, there wasn't a closer lot we could have parked in.  It was great.     We got our tickets, and took our seats.  Now, I really don't like to watch baseball and I find it even harder to get into the game if you can hardly see the people playing.  Our seats were the very farthest away.  Although, since they were free I can't really complain. The mail man was a little late, since he worked until 6:30.  He called me as soon as he got to the stadium and I told him how to get his ticket and get in.  When he got up to the stands I was talking with Colin, so I didn't really see him right away.  When I turned around there he was and my stomach jumped all the way up to the mile high seats in the stadium.  He was sitting on the bench next to me, but there was a space between us.  Just then, his sister came over and sat in between us.  UGH!  We talked for a while, but the mail man didn't say anything to me and I was getting a little frustrated.      In an effort to calm down and just let it go, I decided to find a Pepsi.  As I was leaving our nosebleed seats, I saw a lady holding a Pepsi bottle, so I assumed you can get them in the stadium.  WRONG.  I walked around the whole stadium looking for that delicious nectar that would soothe my rumpled feathers.  I had to settle with a coke.  Gross.      I got my soda and was walking back up the stands. I turned into my row and what befell my eyes, but the mailman with his ex-girlfriend sitting on the bleacher in front of him, leaning back into his open legs.  I was instantly enraged.  I felt betrayed and played and tricked.  Why had I let him get to me so quickly when he was obviously just a player who didn't look at me as anything but a diversion until he can get back to school.  I was really hurt.  The guys I was with were typical guys and didn't know how to truly help me fuel the fire within.  If Sarah had been there she would have been so mad for me her wrath would have been uncontrollable.      In the 6th inning the three boys left me to go walk around and pee, so I was left alone.  The mail man and I chatted a little, but I could feel that I was being cold and distant.  It sucked.     The mail man and his sister left in the bottom of the 6th because some of her friends were at Cheesecake factory just down the street and she wanted to go say hi.  He wouldn't let her wander downtown Denver by herself.  That was nice.      The boys got back and I was miserable, so we left between the top and bottom of the 7th.      I was so mad on the drive home, but was able to keep it in until I had dropped off the guys.  When they got out of the car I just let it go.  Tears were running down my cheeks like a deluge.  I was so tired of letting people into my heart just to have them trample all over it.  I really needed to talk to someone, and the first person that came to mind was Eric.  As I was reaching over to my phone, it rang and it was him.  He knew I wasn't OK and called to tell me that I'm cool and that he was there if I needed anything.  It meant so much to me to have him say he was there for me.  All I really needed was a hug and for someone to tell me that (1) the mail man was a retard and (2) I am cool.      I got home took a bath and then saw that the mail man had texted me.  It said:     ""why'd you leave, you fair weather fan"" (because the Rockies were loosing 12-2)     I had calmed down a little.     I tested back:     ""I wasn't really into the game, plus I felt really stupid.""     He tried to call, but I wasn't feeling like talking.  He left a message that said to call. Then he texted:     ""why?""  (Like he didn't know)     I replied:     ""Lots of reasons""     He replied     ""Anything I can do?  I don't want you to feel dumb.""     I replied     ""Nothing you can do, just dumb girl stuff.""     Then he called me and asked why I felt stupid.  In that instant I just decided to stop messing around and be honest.  No games.  I said, ""well, I really like you mailman and I just felt like...""     Then he said he was coming over and we could go get a frosty together.  Good, I hate the phone.     He got to my house in record time and we drove over to wendy's.  We talked about everything under the sun except the conversation we started having on the phone.  We got back to my house and ate our frosty dairy desserts.  We finally got around to me saying that I felt retarded because when I walked up the stairs and saw her between his legs all flirty.  He said that none of that was initiated by him, and when she did it he didn't know what to do and he was worried about me coming back and seeing them like that and what message that would send.  He apologized for any awkwardness.  It was perfect, and exactly what Colin had guessed happened.  It was like at my birthday last year when all Colin wanted to do was talk to Sarah, but Gabby kept getting in the way.      Anyway, the mail man and I stayed up until 2:30 talking again.  I am crazy about this kid!  We kind of talked about what was happening and we regretted the bad timing (since he's leaving so soon).  We decided that we would hang out for the next month, and then when he comes back for winter break we'd go skiing together. Timing is everything.  Why couldn't I have met him while we both were in Provo and we could actually date?  Now we are doing this kind of strange half dating, despite both of our better judgments."
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"So I've lived away from home now for 5 years, and this is the first year that I have really felt all alone and grown up.  All through college I lived within a 10 minute drive of my grandma and aunt.  They would take care of me, feed me when I was starving, give me a place of refuge when I couldn't handle the stresses of single life, you know...family support.   Now that I am in Colorado and completely without family I realize how important they are to me. I also realize how lucky I was to have them during college.  Also, I realize how important it is for me to have a surrogate family here.  It is really comforting to know that I have people in my life who just sit there and let me cry on their shoulders if I really need to.  No judgement, no attempted problem solving, just there to help and love me.  Those people have no idea how much they mean to me.  I don't know what I'd do without them...probably move away from here.   So yesterday I was accused of not working hard at my job (by the mailman) and it REALLY hurt my feelings.  I'm not a slacker, and I hate that my job isn't more challenging for me.  For someone to just make fun of the effort that I do put in really hurts.  I'm frustrated by the fact that work isn't really hard and totally consuming, and to have someone say that's MY fault is hard to hear.  Although, in reality it may be my fault.  Maybe I should be doing more or working harder or finding interesting things to research or learn instead of just completing my assigned role to the best of my ability.  Stuff to think about."

YAOMQ5O,female,23,"Yesterday after work I stopped by the mall on the way home.  This new guy I am interested in works at Nordstrom, which is very bad for two reasons.  First, Nordstrom is my weakness. I love the store.  I don't need any excuse to go in a drop my money like a 20 lb brick.  Actually giving me a reason to go there is really bad.  Secondly, it is on my way home from work, so I can't avoid going by and thinking, ""I bet he is at work, and my wardrobe could use a little infusion.""  Anyway, he wasn't at work, and this time I actually asked someone if he was there.  I am such a nerd and kind of afraid that I am a scary stalker girl.  Must get my head back on body and let him come to me.    Went out with Marie for dinner at Naked Fish.  The salmon was actually not bad, even though I live in a landlocked state.  The only kind of annoying thing was that we opted to sit outside on the patio and the when the breeze blew through the trees little bits of nasty nature fell into our plates.  Kind of gross, but c'est la vie.   Afterward I went with Marie to her church services.  She goes to first Presbyterian in Boulder.  The speaker made some really interesting points and pretty much all of her talk could have been given over the pulpit at my church, so I was fairly comfortable.  After the lesson, everyone got up and was mingling and talking.  I didn't know anybody and it felt like the first time you show up at a singles ward.  You're just standing around looking for anybody to talk to you and be nice.  Luckily, a few people did so I felt alright about that.  On the plus side, there was a far denser population of good looking boys in her church. That's always nice.    It started to rain pretty hard so we decided to skip the traditional trek to coldstone and I came home.  On my way home I talked to this kid named Ryan on the phone. I invited him to go camping with my crew for the weekend.  After finding out more details about the trip he decided not to come, which was a bummer, but the whole phone conversation really pumped me up.  I was actually funny and interesting on the phone, and we talked for almost 15 minutes, which is really good for me since I hate talking the phone. Anyway, he practically asked me out for sometime next week.  Stay posted for more info.   Also, my death crush from 5 years ago called me up to talk.  I didn't get the phone, but he left a message.  It was nice to hear his voice. I like talking to people from the past because it reminds me of how much I have grown up and improved.  Lastly, I called up my good friend Alan and convinced him to come camping with us this weekend. He hurt his knee, so he was considering not coming.  Then, I reminded him that 1) we won't be doing any backpacking so there won't be two packs for him to carry and 2) he is going with me and I don’t really DO strenuous physical activity. I am really excited for him to meet all my friends and be social because sometimes I worry he is just sitting down there in New Mexico going to work every day, riding his dirt bike every evening and going to bed without having talked to a single person all day.  Yikes.    So all this male attention is making me feel normal again.  It is really hard for me to not have it since the last two years at BYU I was surrounded by guys and although it was all just platonic (except for Derek of course) I still miss having those kinds of friendships."
CZUDUF7,male,23,"Had my first ride on a scooter today. Got up to whole heady 60mph! Was great though. Rode pillion, and went to Llandona beach on Anglesey, with me giving hand-signal directions!  Less good was the weekend. I've been very ill and mostly in bed, shame as some people I know from  urlLink OUTDOORSmagic  were up in Snowdonia to climb Tryfan, and I sorely would've like to have gone with them.  Need to insert a bit about the strength testing I did in the week following the peace march. I was a guinea pig for a sports science honours project, and it involved me being strength tested on a KinCom dynanometer and then having to do 150 bicep curls to damage my left bicep! Then cryotherapy - 15mins of my arm being submersed in 15deg water! Blood test too. Tested everyday until Thursday. Interesting stuff. Good to see in Sports Science dept. The girls doing the project were nice too."
CZUDUF7,male,23,"Last night I watched Buzzcocks/Shooting Stars, then jogged to the Fridd PC room. It was almost empty, except for - can you believe it - Sarah, and two new friends of hers. When they logged off I actually sneaked outside before they could see me - didn't want to be seen as some Billy No Mates! But then I felt ashamed - usually I never worry about what others think. So I went back in and stood - well, sat - my ground. Later on I watched Fame Academy - great! - and then let Sasha have a roll about in his ball. He was vey energetic last night! He had a good roll around in the chapel, before I put him back in his cage and went to be myself. I could hear him running on his wheel for ages!  I'm very happy today - went to the little old Mike's Bikes shop in Upper Bangor, and managed to find a pair of cartridge brake pads to go with the Avids. Excellent! Had a hair cut too, and nice chat with the hairdresser."
CZUDUF7,male,23,"I've got my hamster back! I visited Ruth last night after leaving here and Sasha was fine with me. I couldn't bear to leave him, and Ruth wanted me to take him before she got too attatched to him!  Compared to his sister, he's much thinner, and much more active. I mentioned this to someone today and they said 'just like you then'!  Went to the Treborth Botanic gardens work day today. Had a lovely time gardening in the sun. In the morning, I pricked out lettuces, and in the afternoon I cleared scrub. Chatted to some new people - Jenny, who lives next door to Helen and can climb 5c (my best is only 4c!), and another girl who live in Emrys but I didn't get her name. Cute though ;) Another cutie was Mandy, who I've nick-named Lara as she was dressed like Lara Croft! She was a friend of Nicky, who was also there. Me and Jenny sat by the (incredinbly hot - the wheel barrow wheel started smoking!) bonfire and didn't notice everyone leave! So we drove home. Met Emma in the Chaplaincy and phoned Nicky, and we all went to Cable Bay. The setting sun was beautiful; it's reflection like a stream of lava across the sea. We paddled in the sea and climbed on the rocks a bit. We'd seen a woman do an amazing cartwheel-backflip thing, and so we had a go ourselves. I was rubbish and Emma didn't even try, but Nicky did a great cartwheel.   Cruised home at 50mph on the A55. Spotted Helen jogging to the Menai Bridge so crossed it to shout 'hello', then drove down & around under the bridge to show the girls the view. I got out with the engine running to have a go at climbing the piers a little way, and Emma jumped in the driving seat and drove my car off! It was very funny - she'd stop, let me catch up (I was running after her) and then drive off just as I got there!   All together a great day :)"
CZUDUF7,male,23,"BAD NEWS  Poofus the hamster just managed to reach my trousers the bars of her cage last night, and ate them. 35, and I'll have to replace them as 1. They were very good and 2. I only have two pairs of trousers now.  Plus the wind blew my lovely slate barometer and glass boat from Venice down yesterday. Over 30 together. But kinda symbolic; both were bought when I was with someone I no longer see.   GOOD NEWS  Went with Helen to a photo shoot today! It was a with a local professional photographer, and bizarrely his studio his Llandegfan village hall, where I used to help with Cub Scouts. Helen remained dressed this time (it was for a modelling agency portfolio), but it was the same place where she did her nudes and, gulp, *bondage* photos the other week! (for her boyfriend for Valentine's) But I actually spent the time preparing my Sports Science lab tech job application - deadline is in two hours!"
CZUDUF7,male,23,"d'oh   Noticed at breakfast this morning that Shredded Wheat are supporting the  urlLink British Heart Foundation's  Big Red Fightback (which strangely isn't mentioned anywhere on the BHF's website) by putting tokens on the back of their cereal packets, which if you send in will lead to Nestle giving the BHF a 1 donation per token. Good stuff.  Unfortunately, there's also a the chance to win an instant prize with the packets - the chance to win a CAR, in fact..."

This must be as boring for you to read it as it for me to write it, but in case anyone is checking I'll update it now and then, and it'll make a good diary-thingy sorty thing for me.  Anyway todays highlight was my NEW TYRES ARRIVING FROM GERMANY! YES! Ordered late Monday, despatched Tuesday, delivered Friday. Can't wait to fit them and sort out my bike, then get down to Betws!"
CZUDUF7,male,23,"There is no spoon   A Russian on the course and I did the bleep test together earlier this week, but we both messed up, I made only 10.8 (for various reasons) and she 8.3. If it had gone smoothly she's have easily have beaten me but she had drunk too much water beforehand. She was pretty upset afterwards, as she really wanted to do it properly (she's in amazing physical shape)."
CZUDUF7,male,23,I remember that one of the effects of Prozac is that it reduces your inhibitions and makes you more playful. In fact that's how I feel when I'm really happy. And you know what? I'm beginning to feel like that again.
CZUDUF7,male,23,"Today's been a bit crap... didn't go to bed until past 4am (can't actually remember why), and didn't wake up until 10.20am. Went down to get some milk from the kitchen and ended up chatting to Will, Debbie and Emma for a while, and also stroked Sannai and was given some Christmas pud by Will (yummy!). It's been raining all day and it felt very cozy. I like rainy days... when it's sunny, you sort of feel under pressure to go out, but on days like this you can contentedly stay inside and potter about, or just watch the rain. But after breakfast at, er, midday, I feel asleep unti 4pm, then listened to Chris Moyles, ate some biscuits, and came here. Yay."
CZUDUF7,male,23,"Hopefully Saddam will just leave, probably at the last minute. But if he doesn't, noon Thursday is my bet for the bombers & tankers to launch from Fairford. Hopefully, they and the rest of the air attack only go for army command & control and Ba'ath buildings, and leave civillian stuff alone, and send in troops early to give the Iraqi army the chance to surrender rather than be killed by air attack. I desperately hope that happens."
YIVJED7,male,15,"Ian's mom had to do some errands, so we went to a bunch of places with her whilst, er...  urlLink fooling around with my new camera . During the outing, Ian bought The Matrix and I got a tabloid (I love those things XD). Then we went to Wendy's, but they were mean and didn't give us fries. >:(  Completely unrelated, Zefer is being weird. It's kinda worrying me."
YIVJED7,male,15,"Saturday was fun. Well, maybe not the work part. Because work is  work . And I must say, Saturday's Market is a bit busier than Wednesday's. But other than that, pretty fun. My sister picked me up from Gritty's after work, and we went to some Clam Festival a few cities away. Why we celebrate clams? I haven't a clue. I don't even like clams. They  did  have some pretty yummy onion rings though. :) She, her boyfriend, and I did some little quarter-gambling thing very similar to roulette. And what do you know, we doubled our money! Too bad we only started out with $2. Then we went to her place and rented School of Rock, which was pretty funny. Jack Black cracks me up. That night, I got to sleep in the AC room. Ahhh, AC. Of course, I slept like a drugged panda. ;)   I HATE YOU, GOOGLE ADS."
YIVJED7,male,15,"I think this year is the first time I actually got my dad something for Father's Day. I usually just let my mom get something, and I sign my name on it. X) This year, however, I put some effort into a present. A few months (perhaps weeks) ago, Zefer linked me to a site where you can type in your address and get a nice aerial image of your house taken by a satellite. The images are black and white and kinda hard to make out, but since our house has that massive garden in back, it's pretty easily distinguishable. Anyways, I took that image of our house/garden and added in the name of my dad's farm business and the year it was established in MS Paint. Then I got a nice frame to put it in at Wal-Mart. I think it turned out to be a pretty snazzy Father's Day present. He seemed to like it.  After that, my sister and I played badminton for a while. And then we went to Subway for supper. Mmm... subs."
YIVJED7,male,15,"Whee! New journalish blog thing! I had another journal a few months (possibly years) ago that got eaten by animals, so it's about time I made a replacement.  So what's going on? Summer break is almost here for one. Only one day (according to my mathematical skills, half day + half day = one full day) is left till the big break. Ah, can't wait. It'll give me the time I need to work on projects that I've put off during the school year (my under-updated webcomic and my big fiction story). Knowing me, I'll probably end up starting a few other things as well.  Today was pretty cool though. Seeing as it's the end of the school year, there wasn't much really productive going on. Geometry was studying for the final exam, Spanish was doing some quiz thingy, Gym was sitting, and Global Village was more sitting. Ohhh, I got to play Oregon Trail on the crumby school Macs with Chris in Global Village though. That was pretty cool. I caught typhoid fever and died. :) And I swear to god our guns shot cannon balls.  Anyhow, I should probably be studying for my Geometry and Spanish finals. They  are  tomorrow after all."
YIVJED7,male,15,"My doctor wanted an x-ray of my chest for some reason. He had one, but apparently it was outdated. There was alot of resistance on my part. Along with some name-calling.

YIVJED7,male,15,"urlLink   A BLEACH BLONDE Penguin Lies Beneath!    I took the  urlLink Inner Penguin online quiz  and found out I am a Bleach Blonde Penguin on the inside. Now this is quite a do-gooder kind of penguin. ^^ Being one of these wondrous birds is quite the experience; I'm what can be known as 'the quiet one' or in some extreme cases 'the wussy one'. This is because I have a great affinity for helping people out. My broad repertoire of healing techniques are well-known. Those who stick by me are lucky, as I tend to help them when help is most needed.   I don't think much of myself, and never put my own well-being above my friends. I'm calm, pleasant, intelligent, and vastly fun to talk to. On the battlefield, however, my healing purposes are my only strength. When it comes down to actually fighting, I'm not exactly gifted. Hiding behind a strong friend is always the best option! XD    This is old, but way awesome. :D"
YIVJED7,male,15,"Okay! Let's see how many words it takes me to describe a week!  Tuesday, went to Ian's. Played Thief III, which he had recently acquired. Awesome game. Later, Darren joined us.  Whose Line  games ensued. Then Darren almost blew up Ian's computer. But he didn't. Went home. Ordered pizza. *shock & awe* Which, like, hardly ever happens.  Wednesday, wooork. Started out pretty normal till around 6 or 7, when it started  down pouring . It was vicious. But luckily, that didn't last to long, so business proceeded pretty normally. I'm planning on using my earnings for some anime DVDs. So hopefully, within a week or two, I should have the complete Cowboy Bebop and Escaflowne series. Whoo!  As far as comics went this week, I managed to complete a M-W-F schedule. With help from Mr. Catfish. ;) I have no idea what I'll use next week. I'd like to do every week day, but I might end up with M-W-F again. We'll see.  And that concludes my muchly abridged week!"
YIVJED7,male,15,"So why haven't I been posting? Well, because nothing is happening. No, really. Ian is in Toronto. Or  something . Ragnarok has found a pretty effective way to tick me off. Chi has yet to return, and I don't think there have been  any  group chats this week. At least none that I was a part of. My Stargate SG-1 season 1 and 2 DVD sets have been keeping me pretty busy.  urlLink Bofrearl  started existing.  urlLink Comics  stopped existing. And once again, no work this week since it was all rainy and such. This has been  such  a rainy summer. Not the good rain, either. No thunderstorms or down pours. Just gray, misty, icky rain. Anyways, that's about it. I'll probably go continue working on comics. I'd like to get at least three done today. We'll see what happens though."
YIVJED7,male,15,"Yum. I just got to eat lunch at China City. Chinese food = PWN.  In other news, I tried to do a Kirby move earlier today. You know the one where he ducks and then does sort of a slide kick on the floor? Long story short, I can't do that. ;) Wouldn't it be cool if I could though?  Thus far, it's been a pretty uneventful weekend. I'mma try to get a ride to Casablanca Comics later to pick up a few comic books I've been wanting. I'll probably see if Ian wants to do anything tomorrow too."
YIVJED7,male,15,"I seem to be back on schedule with comics. I did one today, and I have one ready for tomorrow. And if everything goes as planned, this should be a pretty awesome storyline. :)"
N85DQ0I,male,23,"Watched Gary Sinise tromp around a futuristic landscape in a Philip K. Dick-inspired film,  urlLink Impostor . Had fun, but it was a bit too long, not nearly enough exposition, and the double-whammy-surprise ending just felt like they were trying too much. Still, when you consider that it was originally intended as a 30-minute short film that was expanded into a two-hour feature for little or no reason other than ""if thirty concise minutes of fast-paced action-scifi-paranoia is cool, then 120 minutes of it must be  four times  as cool!"" ... then it's all right.  At least I didn't get the  urlLink re-rated from R to PG-13 version . That could've really finished me off.  Other than that, I've been harassing my friends, listening to  urlLink Morrissey  (there's a secret reason behind that which I'll tell you later), and whining about this blog-thing."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"""So there I was in Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon ...""  Well, actually, there I was, ready to kill myself because of my dead-end temp job. Maybe I'm being a bitch, which is quite likely, but me and Manual Labor just aren't the best of friends; especially not when it also gangs up with its friend, Stressful Environment. The long hours didn't help any, either. It's no fun getting off work at 11pm and not be home until sometime after midnight.  So I took a chance. I called up the aforementioned music store's headquarters in Copenhagen and queried about any job openings. I was asked to come in with a short sales pitch of myself in writing and shake hands with the manager. So I called the temp agency and told them I'd sprained something nasty. An hour later, I was on a train to Copenhagen.  When I got to the store, the manager wasn't in, and a trickle of nervous sweat broke out on the back of my neck. I managed to suppress it and decided to wait for him to return. Once he did, I was led down into the basement of the store, which apparently doubled as the main store room for not only this particular store, but all the stores on the island.  In the corner, a corpulent man sat at his computer while two dogs, two young kids and who I assume was his wife hovered around him. After ignoring me for the better part of 10 minutes, he asked me what he could help me with, and I replied that I was looking for a job.  He made some potshot inquiries to my person, then proceeded to ignore me some more. It wasn't intentional, though — he just seemed to have an awful lot to do. Not work-related, mind you — but playing with his kids, showing them album catalogs, and furnishing his wife with promo CDs seemed to be taking up the better part of his day.  After a while, he suggested we retired to his office for a smoke break to discuss details.  Along tagged another employee, who apparently also needed a smoke.  His ""office"" turned out to be a cramped little room with dimmed, blinking Christmas lights in the ceiling, a bench, an ashtray, a picture of some Indian figure, and a framed picture of Bob Marley sucking on a huge roach. The smoke turned out to be a sizeable joint, which he proceeded to light up and pass around.  The interview itself didn't so much concern me as it concerned entertaining, if completely unrelated, stories about how and why the room had been constructed and what the premises had been used for in the past. In the half hour we spent in the room, we only got as far as deciding that, since I didn't have a driver's license, I should probably be working in-store, not driving from store to store with wares, which seemed a tad obvious to me.  Once the joint had been smoked, we exited the room and he proceeded to ignore me some more. Then, he picked up the phone, dialed my local store, and told them I was coming in Monday at 10am. After hanging up, he looked up at me and said, ""Heard that?"" I nodded. He then dived headfirst into another longwinded monologue about the things he'd noticed hadn't been taken care of when he last inspected the store, then handed me a card with these things written in neat bullet-list form, saying, ""This will be what you'll be taking care of on Monday.""  All this time, I'd been sitting on a desk, leaning against a shelf full of CDs. A voice next to me said, ""Does this mean you're an employee now?""  I nodded.  ""Good, then I can tell you to get out of my way. Please get out of my way.""  In my marijuana-induced semi-stupor, I hadn't noticed he'd been stacking CDs onto the shelf while I'd been sitting there.  After shaking on it, I left the store, somewhat floating on air (and not only because of the elation).  I'm going to  enjoy  phoning up that temp agency, telling them to go fuck themselves."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"I have a bad aim, nobody said stop, I didn't notice much difference, and it was wonderful. Can't make up my mind what I feel most terrible about."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"Not much today. I've created three mix tapes for the Roskilde festival (of which one side is blank, should we choose to ape up and record some craziness at the camp).  I should've been with Lasse, buying canned goods and ensuring a cheap Roskilde, food-wise, but my timetable's gone tits up. See, it's the traditional ""riding-around-in-a-huge-truck-and-visiting-every-classmembers-family-whilst-drinking-ungodly-amounts-of-beer"" day for the graduates, meaning that my kidbrother must currently be on his umpteenth beer. I wanted to be here when he shows up at our home, which turns out to be somewhere like half past seven ...  And that's what screwed up my timetable.  Oh well, I don't think those canned goods will mind me picking them up at a later date.  Tomorrow's a party, and I really want to go. Several questions need to be answered first; most of them involving financials. God, I hate being out of work. Poverty is the ultimate ill."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"I've been reading a book my kidbrother, for some explicable reason, says he got free with a Warhammer 4000 catalogue (yeah, right), entitled ""117 Ways to Turn On Your Woman"" (translated title, of course).  I can only wonder if the author — a woman, in case you were wondering — wrote this book with one hand, because she frequently leaps headfirst into detailed descriptions of not only the technique involved, but also what reaction you should expect, coupled with some very frequent staccato-like deliveries separated with commas, such as ""you rub her pussy, she moans, she begs for more, you can hear her breath quickening"". I get the feeling she wasn't writing this book purely for her audience's benefit, 'sall I'm sayin'.  But even more importantly, I dearly wish my girlfriend's sister wasn't spending the evening with us. I don't want to leap into the old ""the book didn't teach me anything new""-tirade, but Orwell's philosophy that the best books tell you things you already know is definitely true. And, regardless of whether I learned anything, it definitely made me want to exercise them in practice. Oh, the sweet agony."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"Barring my first day on the job, I've smoked weed every day I've been involved with this record store, which now counts four days and an afternoon (at the job interview).  My ""supervisor"", if you could call him that, seems pleased with the work I'm doing; we have the same tastes in music and humor (he also prefers  urlLink  Futurama   to  The Simpsons , and enjoys pissed-off American stand-uppers in the  urlLink Bill Hicks -tradition) ... and I don't seem to be screwing up too much.  Plus, we seem to be getting stoned every day.  I can't tell you where this is going, but not to worry; I think I'm responsible enough not to turn this into some required ritual or anything. I've already gotten that talk once about alcohol, and while I appreciate the concern (I think), I don't have an addictive personality.  But I do enjoy the after-work joints.  Or, as they seem to have turned out the past two days, the during-work joints.  Oh well.  As long as it doesn't affect our work, everybody's happy.  Even Mr. Big Shot.  Well, I wasn't planning on making excuses throughout this entry.  Everyone was psyched that Dave Grohl is playing drums for the new  urlLink NIN  record. And that one of our favorite albums,  The Downward Spiral , is being remixed in 5.1 stereo. Plans of having a little after-hour gettogether in-store are already in the works, even if the thing hasn't got a release date yet.  In other avenues, my desire to quit the temp job in the absolutely perfect manner actually led to me momentarily forgetting all about it.  It wasn't until the day before yesterday that the temp lady wrote me, asking what days of the week I wanted to work that stupid fucking job.  I wrote back, saying, ""No days, really, 'cos I've found something much better.""  So, this morning, she threw a mild temper at me, asking me why I was being so rude when they were ""giving me a second chance"" (since I was fired from the last temp job).  I wrote her back, incredulously, reaffirming that my firing had nothing to do with the quality of my job performance.  I didn't  have  to be rude, I know, but  a)  I'm still pissed at the way temp workers were being treated at that package gig I just left, and  b)  I don't need to be patronized by people who make their living pushing poor and desperate people around like the toilet paper of the workforce that they so clearly are.  Bollocks to that.  (Pardon the British slang;  urlLink Jamie Oliver  was just on.)  Anyway.  That's my life, so far.  Organizing CDs, smoking weed, and pissing off temp organizers.  And then, coming home to hug the 'wife' and getting a brilliant nights sleep.  I even installed  urlLink an alarm clock  on the computer, because my girlfriend wasn't home last night and she had brought the mobile phone with her that we use as an alarm clock.  It worked wonders last night.  This morning was slightly different, because my girlfriend and I need to get up at two different times, and — well, I don't know if I just fucked up, or if this program doesn't like having two instances of itself running simultaneously, but somehow the timer on one of the programs got switched to sometime during the afternoon, which is way off.  Oh well.  If it doesn't happen again, I'm chalking it down to my own ignorance.  And I love the fact that it's been written by a college student who was sick of being late to class; that just warms my heart, in some weird, perverse way."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"I've just returned from my kidbrothers graduation, which was such a formulaic, dull experience that I was glad I got drunk first.  Thankfully, there was alcoholic sips at the ensuing reception-thingy (of which I managed to snag three), and maybe there's even the chance of me appearing later.  Which is when things start to get fun.  Hooray.  Right now, it's celebratory sips of wine with CO2 ... and a phone call to see if this night turns out fun."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"Well, there I went, to the  urlLink Dillinger Escape Plan  gig, with the bass player and lead singer of my band. We saw  urlLink The Psyke Project  warm up, thinking, ""Man, that was worth the ticket fee alone,"" and then Dillinger come out and completely trash the place. My hearing has yet to fully recover, because I didn't bring ear plugs, figuring they could be readily bought at the venue (guess that showed me).  After the gig, we had a nice little chat with Dillinger's drummer, and I got his John Hancock. Really nice bloke; I mean,  really  nice. It was almost like he didn't want  us  to leave.  All in all, good gig.  Went home yesterday to take care of laundry and, on the way, pick up a  tent , which is kind of  essential equipment for spending a week outdoors . So now that's taken care of. This is going to be one hell of a vacation. Screw the warm South; I'll take a festival any day."

OI21F2X,female,26,"It seems that Americans luv to label everyone and anyone. Based on the race, based on the ethnicity, based on the place you live, based on your area of weakness; you named it and there is a word for it.But why? In no way does it make one's life easy. It just complicates the lives of people and of course attaches a sort of biased or stereotypical attitude towards it. In case your child doesn't mingle with anyone then he might be an autistic, in case he finds difficult to concentrate then he/she has ADD( attention deficit disorder). Well,if the person has problems in working on their stuff then learning disabled, if the person is unable to talk freely with others then anxiety problem.Oh God. I am fed up of coming across these labels.  As time passes by they just get embedded in the colloqiual language and are used so commonly that they become a cliche. Ulitmately the salad bowl starts looking like a trash can wherein you find all the differences in an ugly way rather than in a healthy way.Of course agreed that associating a person to a certain condition or a group surely helps in understanding the person more better but most often it only serves as a tool to create more chaos and inferior feeling. Just like the invention of atom bomb which was actually created to know the benefits of nuclear fission and fusion but is used for destructive purposes the same is with labeling.  This is nothing to do with labelling but more to do with human nature. How the humans try to ease out things and then complicate it further:). Sounds funny but true."
OI21F2X,female,26,"One of the eminent psychologist whose findings and theories were ignored till recently. It is quite suprising because his writings and his findings have more practical implications in today's world. Thus he was way ahead of his time.In his book ""Thought and Language"" he emphasize on the role culture and language plays in improving the brain connections and the functioning fo the brain. According to him ""the zone of proximal development"" keeps increasing as we expose the growing human to various things in the surroundings which builds the connections and thus the memory.

OI21F2X,female,26,"After experiencing a lot of change in me I now believe that we are what we wanted to be and we will be what we want to be.         Every person has his own pattern of thoughts influenced by so many things around him. The environment, the role models  who influence him, his experiences in life , all of them  mold his character to a great extent.  Especially when he admires certain things and is unable to fulfill them , the strong desire to achieve that particualr thing enters the subconsicous level. As time passes by , through various experiences, or through various encounters, these feelings or cravings get strengthended, faded or modified . Without the knowledge the individual works to achieve what he wanted to and finds himself  in the very state he once dreamt of.      I  was very surprised  to find  myself in the same situation I once dreamt of. Right from my food habits, my dressing, my preferences , everything is  almost similar to  what I always wanted to have. It  is  amazing to discover the  change in me, especially when you try to step five years behind .     Our dormant thoughts are constantly in action trying to achieve waht we aspire for, what we dream for, what we desire for. The positives consequences reinforce our  motives while the negatives can have a drastic effect on us. The person can compromise and move to another destination or it may give the person  reseliance to achieve what he wants to.      And the ultimatum is the result of the struggles and the processing which goes together.     So it's always good to dream about something which you want to achieve, cos the moment you dream, your subconscious is activated which influences your conscious efforts to achieve your goal.And in case you fail in  getting what you dreamt of, believe me it was not worth your effort. You deserved something better or different:)."
OI21F2X,female,26,"So I am a reading clinician for the next four weeks. It's a nice way to interact with kids and help them to read. Especially the struggling readers.How I wish we had something of this kind in India. Well, yes may be very soon I can start something:). However, I often feel that the way we read or the way we are taught to read is faulty. In fact a person who is a good reader( not quantitatively  but qualitatively)is more successful in his academic pursuits than otherwise. In fact good reading strategies should be taught right from the kindergarten which enrich the child's brain with all the right literature and the thinking process. Reading surely helps build analyzing skills, problem solving skills and of course comprehension. All these factors are very much needed in every activity we are involved in.   So when we are reading, there should be a method to be followed.In fact most of the fluent readers do follow all these rules or the structure of reading. Well,for the adults or the fluent readers the SQ3R method ( Survey, Question, Read,Recite and Review method) really helps.  urlLink http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/sq3r.html  gives you an idea of this method.  Ok and now coming to the emergent readers, well the kids in their formative years have to be motivated in a better way to enjoy and love reading. This can be done by choosing the material appropriate to their interest level, their ability and also the level they need to achieve. Discussing the title and trying to predict what the story is will initiate more interest and motivate them to read. Picture walk, wherein they are made to look through the various pictures and try to frame the story based on the pictures will help them to draw some more information about the story. And then while reading there should be pauses or stops wherein the child has to stop reading and then reflect back to what they read. And then questions such as what might happen next, and questions which are inferential can elicit the information and improve their comprehension.  In a similar way the texts or the books chosen for begginning readers, transition readers and fluent readers cover similar aspects based on their level.Thus the same rules applies based on the level of the reader."
OI21F2X,female,26,"We write,read and work on the stuff necessary to either complete our coursework or to do with our work.As we keep growing or learning and progressing through our careers and academic struggles, each one of us develops his/her own pattern of doing things.This aids or influences the way we think, the way we analyze, strategies we use for problem solving, organizing, proioritizing and planning our goals, developing our interests and fostering them etc.. etc.. through imitation and sometimes modelling them to help others.The methods of learning and the surroundings influence the individual and contribute to the  evolution of the person. Hence no one person is in any way similar to another.   But.... we do need to know the best ways to function productively in the environment we live.This means to adapt, folow and function according to the rules of the society(Darwin's theory of "" The survival of the fittest"" is still valid).  Education plays a major role in shaping the individual. In a way  the term ""education"" is a very broad one and every person differs in their perspective. However the end result is always enlightening and improving oneself.  So the methods/ strategies used to help students gain knowledge should be practical enough. They should be able to apply the knowledge and the skills to develop their analytical skills, problem solving skills, organizing and analyzing in a genrealized way( here ""generalised"" means able to apply one's knowledge in different situations using the same strategy).  Ok so the gist of the whole story or the gyan of the day is to have a practical approach towards the strategies used in teaching. Cos our reading and learning habits have a great influence on our lifestyles too."
OI21F2X,female,26,"Well everything seems to be perfect today. The climate I mean. It is cool, drizzling and very cosy. Somehow am feeling very romantic and poetic. Thought of sharing some of my favourite poems. The one by Rudyard kipling is my favorite. It reminds me of Sri Krishna in "" THE BHAGAVADGITA"" wherein he tries to explain Arjuna the essence of a well balanced person or a ""sthithapragnya"". I can very well relate to the readings from  ""The  GITA"" to this poem by Rudyard Kipling ..... Very inspiring and enlightening.       IF        By Rudyard Kipling  If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream - and not make dreams your master, If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!""  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!   Kipling is said to have written the poem 'If' with Dr Leander Starr Jameson in mind, who led about five-hundred of his countrymen in a failed raid against the Boers, in southern Africa. The 'Jameson Raid' was later considered a major factor in starting the Boer War (1899-1902).  Courtesy:  urlLink www.businessballs.com/ifpoemrudyardkipling.htm   My other favourite poem is by Robert Frost. This one is known by many But I remember reading it as part of my English text. I really liked it and now feel like reading it again.     The Road Not Taken                     by Robert Frost       TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth;              Then took the other, as just as fair,   And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same,              And both that morning equally lay   In leaves no step had trodden black.   Oh, I kept the first for another day!   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   I doubted if I should ever come back.             I shall be telling this with a sigh   Somewhere ages and ages hence:   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—   I took the one less traveled by,   And that has made all the difference.                courtesy: urlLink http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html"
OI21F2X,female,26,"Wel, most often I come across very inquisitive and eager minds who want to know a lot about India and our customs. Especially most of them questioned about the significance of bindi.To save my head I did tell them about it's significance which I read when I very young in a monthly book called Wisdom. HoweverI wanted to just check if I was right. To my amazement( or rather dissapointment?) none of my Indian friends knew the answers. So I decided to probe and find out the reason. I found this very interesting article which made me feel proud about our ancestors. They indeed had a very scientific approach for everything.   Bindi is derived from the Sanskrit word ""Bindu"" or a drop, it is supposed to signify the mystic third eye of a person and therefore, when properly marked, becomes the central point of the base of the creation itself. It is a symbol of auspiciousness, good fortune and festivity.  Why Bindi? The very positioning of the bindi is significant. The area between the eyebrows is the seat of latent wisdom. This area is known as the ""Agna"" (6th chakra) meaning ""command"". It is said to control various levels of concentration attained through meditation. The central point of this area is the ""Bindu"" wherein all experience is gathered in total concentration. Tantric tradition has it that during meditation, the ""kundalini"" - the latent energy that lies at the base of the spine is awakened and rises to the point of sahasrara (7th chakra) situated in the head or brain. The central point, the bindu, becomes therefore a possible outlet for this potent energy. It is believed that the red kumkum lies between the eyebrows to retain energy in the human body.  courtesy: urlLink http://www.shaadi.com/wedding/rituals/bindi/040306-bindi-history.php"

OI21F2X,female,26,"""Oh really""? The comment left me thinking and pondering over what she really meant? In fact I have a habit of writing everything in a detailed and desciptive way. Most of my papers and assignments are very lengthy and very detailed or ""wordy"". But what does it tell the reader about my personality?  Well,Courtney was suprised by the length of my lesson plans and when she showed it to Heather who happens to be my friend, she gave a very brief and postive(?)remark ""It's a part of her personality. She tries to explain every small thing in detail"", she said.I was a bit taken back. Of course was suprised that she knew me so well.But?.....  Hmm..so did she mean that I am very descriptive even when I talk?And how does it reflect on my personality?   I was in fact pondering over the same topic this morning. But I have a different explanation to give.Well,I do believe that our academics and our work refelcts our personality but to a great extent there are factors which influence us to behave in a certain way or work in a certain way( may be I am supporting Watson's behaviorism and Skinner's conditioning theory now.They seem to be emebdded in every life experience for me).Thus to completely attribute my lengthy and descriptive work to my personality would be a bias.   Well, I believe  I am more descriptive because of the type of education system I was exposed to all through these years till I landed up in the US.Through out my school and college years I was supposed to be as descriptive as possible.( Five marks answers at least two pages, 10 marks answers at least 5 pages). And after getting out of the examination hall  the focus of our discussion would naturally be on our performance and also on who took the maximum number of additionals:).It was used to compare each  other's performance and also predict their sucess in the exam.Well,no discrimination between the arts and sciences again. I was a science student and still was expected to be as descriptive as possible in my answers.   So you see It is not a part of my personality but the style of writing I had cultivated.Well,I do have  some more proof to justify my say.During my proctoring sessions I am supposed to invigilate the examinations.Even this time is spent in observations and most of the time in preparing for my assignments.   Though I did it unintentionally I was suprised when I went through the answer sheets of the biostatistics students from India and America.When both the Indian and the American students took the bio stats exam, the Indian students took more time to complete the test and were also more descriptive in their answers.Most of the Indian students used pens while the Americans used pencils. Thus after collecting their papers and sneaking and peeping through them I felt I wasn't alone.   And I have another strong reason to justify my style to the education system I am exposed.One of these days an american desi had taken the test.(It was hard to know if he was of Indian origin. He rather looked like a Latin American at some point and a tanned white American at another. But still he had some faint features of an Indian.However his name which had an Indian middle name solved the puzzle).  Well, as I had expected this guy took the test in bio statistics and used a pencil and was less descriptive.So my analogies and my analyzing skills helped me to justify my style but is there something to do with my personality? What did Heather  actually mean?   Though not a big issue I am still trying to analyze what she meant."

I can't even describe how disorganized and wasteful our time was.  Too much time spent on things that didn't matter yet and not enough time spent on important things, like parts.  I marched right up to Quiggley and told him that I was going to kill him for bringing me and then I was going to kill myself.  Aiy... Hopefully once we get out of music rehearsal it'll be better.  As much as I love hearing from Seth everyday, I can't help but think there's something weird about it.  I dunno.  Maybe it's because I haven't spoken to him for so long and now we're making up for lost time.  I certainly don't want it to stop, but I can't help thinking that someone is going to get hurt eventually...  To make things more confusing, Quig is trying to set me up with a guy in the cast, named Seth.  freaky."
3R8IB78,female,25,"It's Friday.  My last day in New York.  Sad, and yet, not.  This week has been a strange one.  I've seen more old friends then I could've imagined.  The weirdest goodbye, however, I think was Matt.  I didn't expect to feel emotional about it.  We haven't spent much time together this year.  He gave me a hug and kiss and it was the first time I felt something about leaving the city.  Today, I'm going to lunch with my friend Mike from high school. (I'm not sure that counts because he'll be near home while I'm there.) Then tonight, I'm going to visit with Seth.  We haven't seen each other in several years, though we live in the same city and chat online a lot.  It'll be a good thing, I think.  The packing is coming along.  I took my bed apart last night. It's really quite compact in pieces!"
3R8IB78,female,25,"There's a John Denver song that I always come back to when I'm trying to get through those really hard moments in life. It's called ""Poems, Prayers and Promises"" and it goes along like this:                           I've been lately thinking about my life's time,             All the things I've done and how it's been.             And, I can't help believing in my own mind             I know I'm going to hate to see it end.              I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain,             Spent a time or two all on my own.             I've know my lady's pleasures, had myself some friends,              Spent a time or two in my own home.              I have to say it now, it's been a good life all in all             It's really fine to have a chance to hang around,             And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,              While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around             And talk of poems and prayers and promises             And things that we believe in,              How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care,              How long it's been since yesterday, what about tomorrow,              And what about our dreams and all the memories we share.    This song always makes me reflect on all the wonderful things going on and somehow I can deal with the crap.  Ironically, the first time I really listened to it was on the trip from Chicago to Winchester during the spring break of my senior year of college.  I had just come from visiting Josh and a grad school audition, which I had bombed, and the worst car trouble of my young life (Martina broke down in Gary, Indiana - shudder).  I was also facing the end of school and leaving behind some of the best times and friends I had ever had.  Similarly, my recent troubles stem from the sadness I feel at leaving NYU and my friends and classmates.  Also, I'm having some difficulty figuring out exactly what my feelings for Geoff are and what his are for me.  Which brings up the question of my moving to Chicago.  Why  am  I moving there...?  Something to think about.  I was in the process of cleaning some stuff out and throwing a lot of loose papers away when I came across an old letter from Justin Eller.  Justin was one of my closest friends at Shenandoah.  We had a very strange relationship, and though we never actually dated (I think there was one date which involved antiquing in Front Royal...) I know we loved each other very much.  He's in Iraq right now, he joined the Army to play the clarinet and pay his loans...  now he's fighting. sigh.  Anyway, I found this letter that he sent to me right when Seth and I were having real problems.  It just seemed so poignant:             ""As far as [Seth] is concerned be very careful but try not to be un-needingly selfish by trying to protect yourself from a future heartache, okay?  He might be the one.  Be true to yourself and if you're ready open up to him like no other, make sense?""   It's times like this that I wish I could just pick up the phone and call Justin for a chat..."

The first few episodes were really funny and then, of course, the last couple became very tense and drawn out.

I'm not really that fond or even familiar with Macs, for that matter, but I have been learning more about them while working on the newspaper this year. I don't know that I would ever want to own one myself, but there are some pretty cool things about them. As an added bonus with the iMacs, Apple sent a few copies of none other than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. I think my addiction to the game has quickly worn off, but I have a feeling that there won't be much work going on for a while.  On a different topic, my journalism advisor received an advanced screening copy of the movie  urlLink  Shattered Glass  . It's about a journalist from the  New Republic  who fabricated most of his stories and ended up paying the price. Since it's related to journalism, my advisor may let us watch it in class sometime."

3D8MI3M,female,33,"Why do the weekends go so quickly? and why do I never seem to achieve any of the things I plan to do? I just about manage to do the washing, give the place a very very quick once over, and then it's Sunday night again and I have to think about getting up early.  I love long lay-ins at a weekend - would be better if I had the Sunday paper delivered, and a handsome man to bring it to me along with a cup of coffee - he could read the Sport pages, and help me with the Crossword (but only if I asked him - I wouldn't want him starting it before me), and then insist I had another cosy slumber while he got on with the lunch preparations! Aaaahhh! To dream.  I did at least get over to see Dad this afternoon. He seemed thoroughly underwhelmed with his posh Penhaligons scent library, but little Emily was thrilled with her Beauty Box that I'd bought her as a special treat from her big sis. I was dying to get her to open it and try on the glitter gel and hair mascara but her mum had other ideas and told her to keep it for when she next had a party to go to - spoil sport.  I never did the usual girlie stuff as a kid - I always had my head in books - or wanted to play on the rope swing with the boys in the wood opposite, until the local farmer recognized me as one of the kids playing Chicken - swinging out just as he came down the hill, he told my Dad and that was an end to that for the summer - we had to decamp to the local river and swim off the slipway - until the local eel-farmer recognized me as one of the kids riding a bike off the jetty just as he was coming down stream...............  Kathryn was always the girlie one - she had a huge Sindy house - ex-display from the local toy shop - every single item of furniture and accessory then available - she used to get really cross when I snuck in and put Action man in very compromising poses with her dolls - funny - she never picked up any of my books, and she always hated playing Scrabble with me.  Emily's a bit of a girlie girl too - so I bought her some stilts for her birthday this year - boys toys were always much more fun - somethings we never grow out of!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"My pleas have finally been heard by our super-efficient Office Manager - I now have a large oscillating fan keeping me cool. My request for a sun-bronzed bare-chested handsome mute with an ostrich feather fan standing behind me drip feeding me grapes was ignored but you can't have everything.  It's not arrived a minute too soon either, having spent most of the afternoon playing ever cheekier and flirtier email tennis with a cute, and I suspect newly-single, solicitor who I used to deal with a lot when I worked in my home town. Our paths have crossed for the first time in over 8 years on a friend's house purchase - it's so much more fun when you can inject some humour into what could otherwise become a dull legal process.   There are some boring old farts in this game - too stuffy and far too serious to be taken seriously - thankfully, they are a bit of a dying breed - even solicitors have to recognise that they are performing a public, client-centred service - not doing the public a favour by allowing themselves to be instructed and paid handsomely for it. The only ones that tend to get paid anything like a decent return now are estate agents!  Mind you, most of the agents I deal with regularly are really helpful, like Sarah, bless her, who spent all afternoon phoning removal companies to find a van for one of her sellers for tomorrow, just so my clients, who were further down the chain could move the day before they go away after a very stressful 3 month delay. It worked - contracts were exchanged by 3.30pm - client is delighted  - so much so he offered to take me on holiday with him at the weekend - if only I'd managed to find an assistant who I can rely on to cover for me, I might just have taken him up on it - I've got to know he and his wife quite well from our daily chats and emails.It won't see the same next week!  Oh well! What I can be sure of, is that there will soon be another to take his place!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"You would think, given that I only live next door, my mother would have been able to give me a little advance notice that my new patio door was being fitted today - it's not a lot to ask, surely. But no - the first I heard of it was when Jack came in my bedroom at 7.15 this morning demanding the key.  I had to fly around the house with the Dyson, picking up half a rainforest of Sunday paper, empty wine bottles, clothing etc. I haven't done anything all weekend and the place was a tip. I've just shut the kitchen door and hoped the glaziers don't get thirsty or need the loo - they would have to battle through half-emptied weekend bags, shopping bags ( I found a fantastic underwear sale yesterday, it was a bit extravagant of me, especially as I don't get paid until tomorrow, but a girl can never have enough foundation garments, and corsets are definitely a fashion direction that suits my Jessica Rabbit-prone figure) and shoes to get to my en-suite, and then I dread to think what they might find.  I had hoped to be going home to new French doors, but the miserable Loss Adjuster would only cough up for one replacement panel - still it will be nice to have the scent of the garden wafting in of an evening - shame it also allows Darius to bring in ever larger mammals - many a night has been spent chasing him and a mole/baby rabbit/albatross around the lounge - which reminds me - I must pick up cat food on the way home."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I took the hire car for a spin this afternoon - to meet a man. I was a bit nervous, Jack was also worried for my sanity and decided to come along with his friend as an unseen body guard. They were all set to cut holes in my Sunday Times and Boo picked a spot at the top of a very tall tower from which they could maintain discreet surveillance. I gave them a fistful of notes though, so they had soon forgotten all about me and were headed for the nearest record shop.  In the event, I was in very safe hands. He was charming and I think even more nervous than I! I'd changed the venue at the last minute - I didn't fancy waddling around a nature reserve in Shantung silk mules, plus I didn't relish the thought of 2 giggling teenagers peering at me from behind binoculars - so Lincoln seemed the better option - something for everyone to do. I recalled my earlier foray into this field and was careful not to repeat the mistake of aimlessly wandering and steered us quickly in the direction of a smart bar where we proceeded to sup coffee and while away the afternoon getting to know more about each other. Much better to have eye contact and the chance to use body language - and it seems to have worked - he's online now and still very keen to chat - even talking about meeting again. Phew! So maybe I'm not entirely repulsive to all except the care-in-the-community community.  So all in all a pretty good afternoon. Thanks, Peter - I promise I'll leave the Killer Teenagers at home next time."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Ladies! There are handsome, sexy, well-mannered young men on this thing! I know! I just met one.  The Newton Bombshell!He was a little bit late,(only a few minutes but they seemed to go on forever) not his fault-accident-I managed not to run away but it did take a fag to keep me there and then I wished I hadn't. I was really nervous and wishing I'd chosen one of my fab new summer tops rather than my safe cashmere jumper- not a great choice for a hot early summer Sunday. I was really tempted to head back home and change - but the longer I dithered, the less of an option it became.  My trained teenage assassins were on alert and texting me for money for ice-creams - bless, this internet-dating is becoming as much a part of Jack and Boo's weekend as mine. I promised them a fiver to stay discreetly in the background. I spotted him driving in - and then didn't know what to do - should I stay by my car and watch him search? no - being a Taurean I took the bull by the horns and walked up, legs of jelly, hoped he wouldn't notice them, being all pale and not my greatest feature.  We lounged in the sun sipping champagne and munching on strawberries - very civilised. He was cool as a cucumber ( pointless apparently), not even phased when he poured half his fizz down his leg. I was really wishing I could suck it out for him but I'm sure I didn't give myself away. I can flirt like mad with someone I know is safe, but put a stud in front of me and I dry!  I would quite like to see this dark-haired Bomb again but doubt I will. I get the impression, without him actually having given much away, that he tends to go for tall leggy blondes with few brain cells - or maybe tall leggy blonde doctor types - either way, not short, chubby red-heads with teenage bodyguards in the background. The fact that he didn't give much away spoke volumes and I didn't want to keep asking questions in case it felt more like an interview than an afternoon in the sun. It was really a pleasant few hours and I can't wait for the day that I don't feel quite so inhibited by my weight and can actually flirt to my utmost ability - I'm really good at it and quite enjoy it but I am finding it hard to get back into the swing- and shy doesn't suit me!  I didn't go straight home but popped to see an old school mate and his wife for 20 minutes which turned into 3 hours and a pretty fab barbecue with his mum dad and 5 month old baby (he was 11 weeks premature so still very tiny). I noticed an ugly black bruise on my knee which I hadn't spotted earlier - maybe it was from when I kicked myself all the way back from the park.  Any way, all said, I'm feeling pretty optimistic about myself - sun and good company at the weekend has helped- a dancing date on Thursday, dinner the week after and a potential trip to Belfast in the offing all combine to keep me smiling and away from the cheese board.  Right - work!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"What is going on here? I made a fab posting last night but it doesn't appear to have saved at all. Oh well - I can't remember what it said so it can't have been that great.  I had a day off today. Quick smell these salts!! I know - it came as a surprise to me too - but I thrive on spontaneity in small doses and as I was in very real danger of over-sleeping, I decided to spend some quality time=money with my son. We went shopping!  5 hours and a dozen or so bags later and we headed home with my 6 months supply of scented candles, new nail polish, a silver poncho - just in case I had to resort to the silver dancing shoes to go with my lilac corset dress for the wedding - and 2 purportedly expensive coats for Jack that we had snapped up for £75!  I wasn't content with that - I just had to call into all the shops that I knew would still be open when we got back home - and what do you know?! I got the perfect silk mules for my outfit - for just £6!!!! Ecstatic or what! and I even picked up a shawl in just the right shade of lilac so now I will be able to attend the wedding comfy in the knowledge that my hideously unattractive gnat bites are covered.  I didn't stop there - I bought a telly too - just 15 minutes before the store shut - Craig, the incredibly cool manager, who clearly had far more important things to do and was way too important to bother with eye-contact - casually slipped my card through the thingy - and dismissively told me it was rejected - then patronisingly suggested that I might have given him an old one - Tosser!  I, for once, calmly accepted it was a mistake - I really didn't like the way he called me ""Miss"" - not something I ever have a problem with -but from a 24 year old bum-fluffed shop assistant who then proceeded to call me ""Love"" - ffs - I sped round to the Morrisons cash point - checked my balance - phew! still healthy - and happily parted with £150 in return for my new 21"" Nicam TV - teletext and everything - haven't had that before - I even bought a new hairdryer.  I would potentially have bought a Tumble Dryer and Fridge Freezer if Craig hadn't been a Wanker of The First Order. Mum has offered me her old F/F - bless her. What will I do to while away my nights if I don't have to chip ice off the inside door anymore? And I figure my new cleaner might be able to hang my clothes out so the T/D isn't a priority.  Lorraine left a message on the answerphone - looks like we might be going to see Madonna after all - just need to check out how expensive these flight tickets are going to be - and I am really starting to worry about the groaning sounds emitting from under my bonnet every time I turn the steering wheel - I can't turn the steroe any louder until my sinusitis has thoroughly cleared up."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I don't know why I bothered getting up today. Yesterday was bad enough - £75 at the vets before even 9am! - but at least Darius has still got his eye! Jack had a sleepless night thinking he'd lost it to a big nasty street cat! He was so traumatised he even asked to come to work with me! Spent the day helping with the photo-copying, filing and post and enjoying being asked if he was on work experience from college and watching everyone's reaction when they heard he was my 13 year old son - I got a bit fed up with the comments about our comparative heights, specially as he leans nonchalantly on my shoulder at any possible opportunity! He particularly liked the jokey m-pegs my boss kept sending him until I pointed out to them both that I had work to do and neither of them were there for fun!  Yesterday did end slightly better when we headed into the UCI on the way home. I managed to stay awake through 2.5 hours of Harry Potter - a recommendation for a film if ever there was one, given my extreme fatigue by that point.  This morning I took Jack and Luke rock-climbing, or at the least, that was the plan. I hadn't actually booked it so I was stuck with 2 boys, kitted out for extreme sports, in the centre of a rainy Hull with everything shut except the shopping centre. The did do a bit of ice-skating, but soon got fed up when they fell over too much and realised there were no pretty girls to impress so they went back to the cinema and Jack sat through HP again - poor Luke, hope he didn't have a running commentary throughout. They still managed to munch through money like there was no tomorrow -but if it left me in peace at work I figured it was worth it!  It came as only a mild surprise to me when the brand spanking new hire car made a small cough on the way home, just as I was approaching a very busy roundabout, at the height of the rushhour. I had heard how economical diesel engines are but even I was beginning to think there might be something wrong with the fuel gauge after it had apparently only used 1/8th of a tank after 432 miles! So we then waited patiently for half an hour, accompanied by teenage stereo farting, for the AA man to come and rescue us. I was just glad no-one passing would recognize my car - not a hint of mud, peeling Iron stickers or bent bumpers in sight.  I managed to get Jack home in time to go out for a birthday tea with his grandma while I headed off to a bereavement client, only 15 minutes late. That went better and my woes have now pailed into insignificance.   Jack's back now and screaming for the keyboard - so I'm going to have a very small glass of wine and then maintain my early to bed routine for yet another night! It's nearly the weekend!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"What a strange weekend it's been! I really shouldn't be left unsupervised! My teenage son, fondly referred to as the Cashmonster (CM), has been away on a school exchange for the last 2 weeks and I've taken full advantage of the opportunity to get clicking on the Internet! My eyes have been opened, I can tell you!  I discovered Internet Dating recently! I'm addicted! I haven't really bothered with the opposite sex for the last few years!There is a story behind it but it is far too painful to reveal on our first meeting! Anyway, I've become somewhat of an overnight success!I'd never even stepped foot in a Chat room before - thought msn was just a place where kids get groomed by bogus sinister characters  - certainly not a place for an intelligent, moderately successful, independent working single mum from a back-water in Lincolnshire to spend her leisure time! Gosh! Am I a quick learner though!  It all started about 3 or 4 weeks ago! The CM was out doing what he does best - wasting my hard-earned money down the local High Street with his baseball-becapped spotty mates! I had a sinkful of pots and a kitchen floor that had more flora on it than a small tropical rainforest along the amazon! It was so awful in that kitchen that even the ants were starting to complain!I'm very good at multi-tasking so I decided to have a click about on the computer whilst sipping coffee and procrastinating!  I'd bought the new computer at Christmas for the CM! I'd had a bit of a play about on it when it was first installed - checked out the BBC - booked tickets to see Mastermind being filmed (? don't ask!) - subscribed to the National Trust newsletter - entered a few competitions - tried to find Martin Johnson's home number! You know, the usual! Well, a friend had told me about a dating site which was supposed to be very good with a high success rate of marriages to handsome, intelligent, wealthy doctors! Needless to say, I'd checked it out - even posted an anonymous profile but I wasn't prepared to go as far as subscribing to it! I wasn't going to pay good money to be ignored by men in my spare room as well as in the supermarket, bar, workplace! So I'd forgotten all about it!  This particular day I was merrily deleting spam from my Inbox when I came across a free introduction to a new dating site! On impulse I clicked on it and decided to have a nosy about! I was a little bit circumspect when I saw it was obviously very adult-orientated but I'm a broad-minded girl! (well, actually that's not quite true - I pretend to be but when it comes down to the nitty gritty Sunday school had a very strong early influence in my life!) Anyway, I ticked all the boxes so as to ensure I could see all the site had to offer! Who can blame me - everyone pretends to be what they're not on here apparently! What harm's one more 32 year old bored mum masquerading as a bisexual, dominatrix, swinger going to do? Anyway, within minutes people are trying to talk to me! I was terrified! There was a 22 year old couple in Burnley who obviously believed in share and share alike! A 39 year old guy from a South coast seaside retirement town who was clearly very proud of his satin bedspread! And then a guy of a similar age to me from an East coast resort not too far away from me! I decided to try and talk to him!   Me: ""Hello! How's the weather in Ethelthorpe-by-Sea today?""  King Kong: ""So you here to talk dirty then? How big are your tits?!""  Me: Gulp!   KK: Do you take it up the dark way?  Me: (delay where I wasn't sure if he'd be offended if I just left the room at a rapid pace, I'm new to these things remember! What if he could see me on the webcam I'd bought CM) I'm really sorry, Mr Kong! I seem to have stumbled in here by mistake - terribly sorry to waste your time! have a good day!  KK: (suddenly and strangely softer tone to his text) Hey, that's ok, Cherrypie69! (ok! OK!-I was just trying to fit in remember!) It's not really my type of thing either if truth be told! Much prefer a pint with my mates and a game of snooker! Why don't you try www.singlesaferand freetowomen.co.uk!  And it was as simple as that! I've not been back to www.hotrampantscarypeople.co.uk, not even to remove my profile! I bet I'm the biggest prick-tease on their! Some poor guy with a fetish about being ignored is having a rare old party, I'll wager!  But I have joined the tipped site! My ability to attract the opposite sex has mulitplied ten-fold at least! I got carried away after the second night - helped along by a few glasses of wine! Well, here's a woman who never had a shortage of admirers in her youth but had spent the last 2 years sitting on her sofa with her wine bottle and the remote control for company every night about as attractive as Waynetta Slob when she's not making the effort!! I'd suddenly got half a dozen men from all over the place wanting to talk to me! I even got crushed on by a very handsome, young Italian guy, so you can understand a girl's head can be turned! They all wanted to know what I looked like!  So you can perhaps see how easy it might be to have a momentary lapse of sanity! I posted my picture there! My gorgeous new friends shouldn't be deprived of being able to see the vision of loveliness that is this witty, edgy, feisty sex-kitten they're beginning to fall in love with! It seemed like such a good idea at the time! I really must start a campaign to fit breathalysers to computers ( and mobile phones but that's a topic for another day)!   You may or may not know that it usually takes a site-provider a few days to approve the profiles and pictures that people post onto it! Make sure it's not indecent, illegal, libellous etc. (not something www.hotrampantscarypeople.co.uk spent much time on!) So it was quite a surprise 2 days later when I check my e-mails during my lunchhour and see a message from the dating site proudly informing me my smiling mug was now being published to the world at large! AAaaaaaarggghh! Panic! It didn't seem quite such a good idea in the sober light of day! Particularly given that I'd used the only digital shot I had access to, my work's publicity shot - which was due to be published in the local daily paperwith a readership of about 250,000! That afternoon was one of the longest of my life! I was supposed to be going straight to my weekly Fat Club after work but instead I dashed home and sped into the backroom to quickly remove it before too much damage was done! I figured most people would still be on their way home from work before 6 so I might be able to remove it before too much damage was done!  Nnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooo! "" Your picture can not be edited for 72 hours!""   I was stuck up there, approachably grinning at hundreds of strangers and, even worse thought, people that might know me! Despair! Horror! I was tempted to collapse sobbing in a corner but I'd already paid my subsription to be routinely and publicly humiliated on the scales at the local Church Hall! And on the bright side - I'd not had a problem with constipation or water-retention that day! I'd worry about it later after I'd bounced about the community centre with my fellow salad-dodgers!  In my defense, I was probably already in a mild state of euphoria, brought on by the irritatingly pert Cheese Nazi declaring (in a far too amazed tone for my liking!) that I'd lost 2 whole pounds in a week! So when I eventually logged back on, the realisation that in the space of less than 6 hours 56 men had all been interested enough by my mugshot to click on my profile and learn more about me actually gave me a bit of a buzz! And as I watched they kept coming, from all over the place, Barnsley, Bristol, Ghana, Guadeloupe! These men were either all blind or I didn't look completely like Hattie Jacques and Bernard Mannings love child!   Anyway, I've not really looked back since! I did remove my picture after the obligatory 3 days by which time I'd had almost 200 hits and loads of men wanting to chat - some more successfully than others! I was lapping it up! I was a Cyber-Goddess! I've made new friends all over the place, I've started to brush up on my rusty school-girl French (with varying degrees of appreciation) and I have about 4 or 5 apparently intelligent and not-too-unattractive (if they are using their own image that is) eligible-sounding suitors vying for the chance to have the pleasure of accompanying me on a date!I've had a couple who are only there for the cyber-sex too! I was very good at dodging it at first, but then I came over all Mrs Robinson with a 20 year old postman from a town not too far away from me! It was actually quite good fun!   I've come to a bit of a halt though! It's getting increasingly difficult to justify chatting to these lovely male companions every night and not take that next step of actually meeting them, in a safe public place you understand! I've made a number of different excuses - all of which translate into ""I'm too scared! Let's just stay here where it's safe and you can go on thinking I'm the witty, sexy, glamorous, successful Woman-of -your-Dreams!"" I've also spoken to a couple on the phone! That can be a bit odd! How do you tell someone you've been flirting with for the last 3 weeks, who you had imagined with the voice of Barry White, that they sound more like Kenneth Williams!? Very disappointing for a girl!   Anyway - I'll let you know if there any developments! I'm gonna just log back on for a few minutes - just in case Colin Firth got connected!  ;-) x C"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Blissful day! Slept 'til about 11 having spent far too long talking to a would-be accountant from the North West and a very unusual Irish giant - it was mad - my son would have been shocked - I certainly was! Anyway, I lay in bed for the entire Jonathan Ross programme reading - not my new novel but a foodie magazine, got all inspired and headed for my temple, St Tesco, as soon as I'd deloused myself in the bathroom. I see everyone in there(Tesco - not my bathroom, it's big but not that accommodating) so it took some time to get around - then I had to head for the rugby club to drop off the Player of The Year shield which CM has to pass on to this year's Superstar of the Park! His old, sadly-missed coach was there propping up the bar - I think he had a soft spot for me as he used to play against, and compete in the after-game bar with my dad. I recieved a very warm reception and some mighty fine compliments. I would have quite happily drawn up a stool and passed a pleasant afternoon with him but I had to pick CM up from some roadside close to where he and his mates had been climbing trees - every time I worry about how fast he is growing up he goes and does something charmingly juvenile and lulls me into a false sense of security about my ability to get through my thirties grandchild-free!  I picked up a DVD on the way home and have just spent the last few hours with Helen, Julie and the rest of the Calendar Girls - loved it! But why does someone else always beat me to these fabulous ideas! First Helen Flipping Fielding and now a bunch of ageing, greying women from a sleepy North Yorkshire backwater with better figures and more spirit than me! Unfair! But then again, all the ideas I have would probably land me in a Libel trial, so maybe fate is kind!  I've decided I am going to try and write - but my printer has different ideas and won't let me see the start of the BBC's books - will have to hope the office manager is too busy to notice me downloading partly-formed manuscripts from a non-legal website next week! Aaaarggghhh! Now I'm thinking about work! Somebody inject me with Gin - quick!!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I'm really pleased I did as I was told for once and stayed away from the office all weekend. The piles of files were still here when I walked in this morning but they didn't look half so threatening and imposing as they had at the end of a very tiring week. I've whipped through them today, well that was once I'd seen 9 sets of clients, responded to about 50 emails and answered a constantly ringing phone. I had only managed to dictate 3.8 minutes-worth of work by 4.30pm, then I had to rapidly sign my post before getting my last clients of the day in to sign their contracts. They were a really young couple buying their first house - they were so excited - wonder whether I'll be acting for them in 2 or 3 years time when they are moving onto their next house, perhaps one with a bigger garden and nursery for the children? or going their seperate ways as more often seems to happen.  The rest from work has definitely done me good, but it nearly got me into deeper water than I had intended. After the experience with Hann the Mann last week I had firmly decided not to even think about meeting anyone else until I was feeling more confident, slimmer and had my roots done. Easy for most people, easy for me too I thought! But since when did I do anything easy! I forgot to factor in the effects of marinading myself in a few bottles of wine over the weekend, culminating in me suggesting to a witty young man from Derbyshire that we go on a mini-cruise to Holland for our first date! It seemed like such a great idea at the time! I've never been on the Hull ferry even though I see it everday on my way to work and he seemed such a nice young man.  Fortunately, he appears to be quite a sensible, mature gentleman, despite being a mere 30 years old (Gosh! Eva would be so proud), and recognized that perhaps I had allowed the wine to cloud my judgement so he didn't go straight to the P&O website and book a 2 for 1 as I had insisted he do! I think  perhaps it would be wiser to meet for a drink and chat first, before co-ordinating our holiday plans, just not sure when given the state of my diary over the next few weeks and my inability ot leave the office much before 8pm (it's 19.47 now technically I've finished work, not doing any more tonight - just taking advantage of the peace and quiet and lack of friendly msn interruptions!) At least this time he's seen what I look like, a further side-effect of the alcohol-consumption being my lack of inhibition in using my webcam (I stayed clothed, Eva! Even wine can't stop me being hopelessly shy about my body), and he's still wanting to talk to me which is a positive sign.  I'll have to go and see the Cheese Nazi tomorrow and let her scales decide the verdict - loss of 4lb or more I'll agree a date, anything less than that and he'll have to wait! (If you are reading this I have never lost more than 3 lbs in a week so far, so don't warm the car up!)"
95M00OF,male,35,worried.  things are going so well.  when does one of us (me) try to sabatoge everything?
95M00OF,male,35,"I have to wonder what happens when I decide to do something to improve my life.  I'm really trying to 'bounce' my eyes from things I shouldn't dwell on, but when I make an effort to do so, there seems to be so much for them to stick to!  Is it because I'm just more sensitive to inappropriate thoughts and actions, or am I under attack?  Like yesterday.  I left the house, pledging to 'not look lustfully on a maiden' (Job 31:1), and no sooner than I get to the end of my street than I see this hottie I've never noticed before jogging, wearing a bit of spandex and little else.  I try not to break my neck 'not looking'.  I go the grocery store to get something for lunch, and it's like the inside of my wildest dreams/nightmares.  The cute stocker is wearing stretchy, low slung, beyond hip-hugger slacks, and when she stoops to refill a bottom shelf  right in front of me  I am immediately aware of the shock I could deliver by telling her how much I appreciate/wish I hadn't seen the obvoiusly see-thru white thong with little kiss prints on it.  That was visible to below the spot where it dissappeared into her cheekal division.  And that I like the rose tat that the thong is supposed to cover. arrg.  I look (of course) until I realize that I'm almost drooling, tear my eyes away and turn the isle corner.  Quickly.  It's not the isle I need, but it's an escape.  As I walk down, I get halfway and notice the woman heading toward me looks like she's wearing shorts-pajamas.  Without underwear.  Oh yes, the fact that her cuffs and collar don't match becomes  very  evident as I get closer.  Then, (don't ask me how the physics apply to this, I still can't figure it out!) as she reaches for something on the shelf, she completely pulls open her top, revealing her unfettered mammarial excess.  And I mean excess.  AND, she is unaware of the visible facts at least until I am past her.  Which I would like to say I did as quickly as I could, but alas, I did not.  I don't think she was even aware I was there.  So I grab my food, not even realizing until later that I get a flavor of yogurt that I don't particularly care for.  I head for the check out, and there again, I think it must be Stripper Day at Winco.  Short lepard spot skirt, tight, low cut crop top (which barely holds back the raging abundance), and as she bends over to empty her cart, I think ""Hey, I've never seen fuzzy panties before.  Oh.""  Yeah, there may be fuzzy panties, but I bet they don't come with clit rings.  All of this before 9:00 am.  Then I get to work.  It is Hottie day at the bookstore.  On my first forray out of the backroom I spot another hip-hugger thong show.  On my second, there is the firm bralessness of a tank top (walking into an air conditioned store) over sweat pants snugged down to the point that I can read the tag on her peach panties.  Yup, Victoria, I know your secret.  The third time, I get to see just exactly how well built both of the college girls who work in the store are, both within seconds.  I stayed in the back room the rest of the day.  I didn't want to put all of this in here to tittilate (interesting word) but to illustrate what happens when I try to take control of my mind.  Is there really that much temptation every day, and I am just blissfully unaware of it?  Or were the plethora of sightings deliberate attacks on my spiritual morality?  In either case, I think I'm better off if I don't try."
95M00OF,male,35,"Ya know, the more I find out, the more I don't want to know.  But then again, denial is a thing of the past - or so I'm hoping, so all I can do is find out everything.  I don't know if it would be better to get it all out up front, or continue to let it all just eke out piece by piece, and deal with each piece separately - but that seems to drag out the hurt, so I don't know."
95M00OF,male,35,"Of course, I still have to write the letter.  I can start with Tom Fischell, write to him and send a sample of a letter to the churches.  At the same time, send letters to everyone, connected or not."
95M00OF,male,35,"I've run across this quote three times in different places in the past two days.  I wonder at the significance . . . ************** It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.  The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly . . . who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails at least fails greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never known neither victory nor defeat.                                          Teddy Rosevelt *************** Gotta ponder that . . ."
95M00OF,male,35,"Wimped out today.  Mom called to wish Bronwyn a happy birthday,and I didn't tell her to fuck off.  I  FELT  like it, but I didn't.  I did tell her that the prosecutor had denied my case, so once again the bastards get away with it.  But, I told her I expect her to keep a close eye on the kids.  Maybe it's better this way, rather than just cutting her off.  Cyn still thinks I'm mad (or should be) at her.  What makes me mad is her trying to decide what my emotions are, and telling me I'm not facing things if I don't appear to agree.  So, do I continue to communicate MY thoughts, or do I go back to letting her put emotions in my head?  I think I need to write more.  My days don't seem as foggy as they have this past week."
95M00OF,male,35,"ok, I'm going to bed.  If I write any more . . . well, I don't know what I'll do, OK?!?"

'Lathe of Heaven' by Ursula K. LeGuin"
95M00OF,male,35,"Feeling a real need to write tonight, but I don't know about what.  Cyn is on the phone with her mom, having a hard time, and doesn't want me near.  She. . . I dunno, she something.  Been talking w/Loki (who is going through shit) and Ti (who seems to be ok) and biding my time,  waiting to be needed - no, WANTING to be needed, but Cyn is in this superwoman mode, wanting to 'take care of her own needs' like a marriage isn't a partnership.  I understand wanting to be strong, but she won't ever be, not as sick as she is.  Then again,I can't do her life for her. She has to go to work, has to do church, thinks she has to put on for the world.  I could help more, I guess, but then I don't have time to read, time to write, then I go slowly mad and curl up in my comfy little shell and start dying again.  Wow, that sounds so cheery!  Of course, most of my thoughts these days ARE doom and gloom, waiting to screw up for the last time, waiting to be asked to leave, wi\aiting for Cy to do something drastic.  I'm hoping she won't, but I get afraid she may-being in as much pain, and as much pain, as she is.  I worry.  I'm good at it."
95M00OF,male,35,"I talked with a puddle today  and asked what wisdom she was willing to give. She was quiet a long time, and I was afraid I had offended.  At the end of our silence she spoke.   First, she murmured,  Tell me what you see.  Then I will give you my wisdom.  I leaned and looked deep. You are beautiful, brilliant, smooth and difficult to hold Soft when I caress, hard as stone when I use force. You are transparent.  I can see what supports you. As your environment changes, so you accept the change, becoming what serves the elements: vapor, liquid, ice. And yet, dont you still keep the same essence throughout a lifetime of change?  I dribble you through my fingers, disturbing your rest. Im amazed how quickly you return to your peace leaving willingly a part of you with me, absorbed through my skin, cleansing me Accepting my gift of unrest as  ripples playing on your surface   changing your boundaries.  The birds tell me about you, too. They say you taste like stone and purple delight.  I decide to taste you, too Its true! Liquid dust, the fragrance of things remembered, sweet regret, sweet truth in forgiveness, chance, another opportunity.  I taste again, my tongue exclaiming Chill! Refresh! What a kick! I wonder that you can be so many things at the same time and still be true.  and yet you are.  We rested silent again, a long time this time comfortable, for I know I had spoken truth.  At last, my puddle (mine, for now I knew her) my puddle spoke: Here is my wisdom, she whispered. I leaned close to hear. I only reflect what is.  I have nothing else to give.  Silence deafened. I drank what she gave. When I felt I understood, I looked to her for confirmation. I saw only my own eyes, and then she was gone. The universe had need of her now.  I mourned her passing, and tears filled her bed.  A new puddle smiled and whispered, Hello, Beautiful."

Guards were stunned to discover the man had glued his hand to that of his visiting girlfriend last week.   Media reports quoted Uwe Dieter Krone as saying, 'We've glued our hands together to call attention to my prison situation and to be heard.'   The couple had to be hospitalized.   'They will remain there until they can be separated and will then have to appear before a judge to make statements. They cannot appear in court together,' said Raquel Navarro, a spokeswoman for Spain's Penitentiary Institutions.   Navarro said she didn't know what type of glue was used.   Krone, 39, was being held in a Madrid prison pending possible extradition to Germany, where he is accused in a case involving the trafficking of prostitutes."""
YD6P057,female,24,"I hadn't heard from the White Truck Guy (WTG) since we had met for drinks, but then again, I didn't think he would call. I threw that experience over my shoulder and made it a memory. No big deal. Welp, he called me on my way home from work yesterday. He said hello and then almost immediately questioned me on my relationship status. I told him that I was dating someone, but that things are pretty open. He was kind of quiet and I then jumped into the same kind of questioning. Was he in a relationship? He said yes. And that's when I replied with: You're a bad boy!"" Funny, sorta, but I meant it. I don't deal with people like that and plus, it's just a precursor as to what will come. Anyway, I asked how long this relationship had been going and he didn't say. Then I got even more smart and asked if he was married!?!? DUH! He of course answered yes. I am so damn naive!!! It never even entered my head that this guy would have been married. I mean married guys don't hang out their trucks yelling at girls driving in the mountains!!! YAH THEY DO! Why do I give people the benefit of the doubt? Why do I think that all people are good people? Not saying WTG is bad, but WTF? Who does that? He apologized for lying. I accepted. No big deal to me, as I just had a margarita with the guy, nothing more, nothing less. And he has 2 children, to boot! His oldest is 7! Shit, 7 years ago I was 17 and in high school and had just lost my virginity. It had never dawned on me that he was married. NEVER. SOMEONE NEEDS TO GIVE ME A SWIFT KICK IN THE ASS!!! Wake me up."
YD6P057,female,24,"Well,  It's my first time to blog and to tell you the truth, I am really excited about it!  I have always wanted an online journal for everyone to view.  I dated this one guy who all he ever wanted to do is read my diary.  I was always so afraid he was going to find it and read all of my dirty little secrets, but thankfully I broke up with him before he found it.  So, I might just contact him and tell him that I have an online diary and that if he wants, he can read it and find out how very exciting my life really is.  :0)  It's Friday and our water has been turned off here at GAHSAW.  So we have to go across the street to the mortuary to use the bathroom... Talk about creepy.  It makes me laugh though.  I walked in there today and a friendly man who looked like a cherub asked so politely, 'Can I help you miss?  I answered, yes, bathroom please!  He smiled and looked at me doing the 'I just had 3 cups of coffee dance' and pointed me down the hall.  The mortuary music guided me down the hall with a smirk.  I have been in these types of places so many times, I feel like I even know the song that is being played.  How sick is that?!?

YD6P057,female,24,"Friday, July 09, 2004   This is from mytrafficnews.com.  My mom and I thought it was Hee-Haw-Highlarious!  Enjoy... Gobble Gobble     Friday:      The best way to spend the last few minutes (or hours) of a holiday-shortened week, we think, is to goof off. Hey, goof off with us, as we take a jaunt through what's going on that might tie up traffic tonight. Get comfy; there's a lot going on.  First, there's the 12th Annual LoDo Music Festival, blocking off 20th through 22nd Streets from Blake to Larimer next to Coors Field today and tomorrow. Today's music starts at 5 p.m., and the official site warns against bringing such things as cans, fireworks and turkey legs. You heard them, people, NO TURKEY LEGS!  C-470 and Morrison Road could be packed during the rush hour because of a 5:30 p.m. show at Red Rocks with The Allman Brothers Band and String Cheese Incident. By the way, both are ""jam bands"" which means this concert will probably be about 9 songs and 47 drum solos in only 7 or 8 hours. Whoo! Turkey legs are OK, but only from free range turkeys.  Meanwhile, the Amphitheater on Fiddler's Green Parkway will host the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, as they play the music of Led Zeppelin starting at 7 p.m. If the Internet is to be believed, this really is happening. Next week a banjo and bagpipe band play the music of Ice-T. OK. We made that one up, but it seems about as likely. Cornish Game Hen legs are OK, but no turkey legs. Sorry.  But wait, there's more! The Pepsi Center not only has Cirque de Soleil in the parking lot at 4 and 8 p.m., but Women of Faith are in the Can itself, starting at 7 p.m. Don't expect all the typical swearing as attendees scramble for the last parking space that will actually fit an SUV. But watch for a lot of grit teeth and a growl of ""I'm going to PRAY for you SO DARN HARD!"" Whole turkeys -- if very, very flexible -- are allowed at the cirque, and for the faith event, well, you can bring whatever food you want as long as you promise to send us the recipe and it's OK if you used Miracle Whip because we can't cook without it either.  Most of these events repeat tomorrow, with one addition: John ""I'm a turkey leg at heart"" Fogerty plays tomorrow at Universal Lending Pavilion. We mentioned this yesterday, and a MyTrafficNews family member wrote in and thought our ""secret code"" was another lame joke. It's not! Click the link below and enter the secret code COACHF in the Special Promotions window; you can get one or two tickets for only the service charges.  Another reader wrote in and said that Fogerty is great, but he's excited to see the other act on the bill: Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers. ""Nothing like songs about tequila,"" he writes, ""and, well, more tequila!"" Except maybe a Turkey Leg ballad.  We're excited about the show, and we're not sure what the rules say, but we're bringing turkey legs. They can have our turkey legs when they pry them from our cold, wrinkled up hands! And even then we'll keep all that yummy seasoning and the juices that drip on our hand! So there!  If you have a fear of crowds, hide in your closet and eat turkey legs until the weekend is over. Otherwise, get out and have some fun; there's plenty to be had. We'll either see you Saturday night at the Fogerty show, or right here Monday afternoon. Until then, thanks for reading!"
YD6P057,female,24,"I just got my review back from my boss.  ARG!  I have love/hate feelings about annual reviews.  That whole week before the review, I get all nervous and jerky and then the day of the review I have a breakdown.  In this year's case, I cried.  Yep, I cried.  Very nice Erin, cry away and make everyone else feel like crap.  ARG!  I was told a few people in the department have 'complained' about how I don't work 80 hours every two weeks.  Nice.  It's a non-profit, no one works 80 solid hours every two weeks.  If you don't give me enough work, I just sit in front of my computer and surf the net.  So, I started working 90 hours every 2 weeks and I noticed how many people don't even work their own damn 80 hours.  Oh well, I am the new girl and need to buck up and strap on the 90 hours in pride.  Oh and by the way, everyone needs to mind their own business!  Oh and I am coming in late on Monday cause I am going to be at a concert late Sunday night and am going to feel hung over!  Oh and yah, the 19th of July I am taking off the WHOLE day to mourn the loss of my dad... It's been 10 years, ya know... so everyone can kiss it if they have a problem.  I don't get paid enough to feel this shitty about 80 hours.   Plus, If you were to calculate the actual time I spend driving to GAHSAW, my hours would be well over!  I mean I spend over 2 hours a day in my car to come here... so 2.5 hours a day x 10 times every 2 weeks =25 hours of driving time every two weeks.  I work over 9 hour days so... let's do the math and we all know I hate math... hmmm... 9 hours a day x 10 days every two weeks = 90 hours not including my 25 hours of driving... so really I think, breathe, eat, drink, GAHSAW 115 hours every two weeks!  AGAIN, KISS IT!  If they accounted for all of my 'work hours' I would be making over 40 a year!  YIKES!!!  I am getting screwed!!!!  If I wanted to go further I could charge for gas!  500 miles of driving to and from Boulder every week... $23 per gas up x filling up 2.5 times a week is $57.50 x 52 weeks is  $2990 .  Let the numbers speak!  Holy crap, that was a good rant...   Back to work!  EMPlanner"
YD6P057,female,24,"urlLink Randomly Organized Thoughts    Monday:  Pretend to work.  After pretending to work, hit it hard to make it home before 6 so that I can jaunt to the tanning salon.  I am looking quite tan for this Irish white ass.  Well, I might not look that tan to you, but only certain people really know how tan I am.  :-)  Yah right!  After Tanning:  go home to play Bunco with neighborhood ladies.  Hell Yah, I could win $20 big ones.  Tuesday:  Attempt to come into work before 9am.  Dilly Dalley around the office, again.  Meet Carolyn (grade school friend) at porn shop.  We are there to shop for our other grade school friend's bacholerette party.  Plan on getting something sexy and slutty for her and for me.  :-)  PS... I need red shoes to go with my HOT black and white halter dress.  Must go shopping.  Wednesday: (actually my Friday) Again, attempt to come into work before 9am.  Head home a bit early to freshen up for the girly party.  Plan on drinking a few too many margs, just enough to make me fun, but not too many to make me want to dance on tables without a bra.  Thursday:  Sleep the fuck in.  I plan on mingling with my bestest of best friends Sniff.  She's in town for the wedding and she brought her scrum-ditaly-umpshious hunk of a boyfriend, E-Rocks Sniffs World.  That's actually his name.  I heart him, big time.  Glad your here E-Rock Sniff's Socks.  :-)  Oh, and we will be going to visit my nearly completed house in E-Town.  Pedi's and Mani's will be had for the big wedding day.  Thursday night going to a Meeting Planners extravaganza!  The Quarters Auction at a fancy golf course.  Should be fun.  Great event to schmooze with other industry folks.  I love being one of the youngest in the industry.  Makes me feel powerful and successful...  SURE?!?  Friday:  Big wedding day.  Sleep in.  Hopefully see JD before wedding.  Get hair done by Mom's stylist/boyfriend.  Nice that he is willing to do my hair!  Can't wait.  Get ready with Jenny?  I should call and ask her if she wants to get ready together just like we did in high school for most of our dances.  :0)  Awe the good old times.  I miss her more than you know.  She is the only one who calls me on my shit.  The best of the best damnit.  Wedding begins at 6pm.  It will resemble Justin Timberlakes song, Cry Me a River.  Tears will flow, snot will be apparent.  It won't be pretty.  I always cry at weddings.  It doesn't matter whose wedding either.   I am such a hopeless romantic.  Don't tell anyone.  I wouldn't want the secret to get out that I am all mushy and soft.  Since we were little girls, the Bride to be and I used to dream about our weddings.  Mostly our receptions.  Mostly the music.  Because we are such dancers, we came up with a list of songs that are a must at our receptions.  Number one on the list is Dancing Queen by ABBA.  Oh HELL YAH!  Baby Got Back is a Favorite.  Joker is always good.  Sniff and I want the Boot Scootin Boogie to be played.  I CAN'T WAIT TO DANCE.  Reminder:  Bring Flippies to dance in... I know my feet are going to hurt.  PS:  Hopefully I won't kill a girl that is attending the wedding.  She's not my favorite and I am not hers.  Prepare to dim a few fires that could be/will be created at the reception.  Ex BF and GF's reunite for the first time since the break-up.  Yikes!  Saturday:  Sleep in.  Recover from hangover.  Head over to new bride and groom's parents house for BB-Q.  Head over to my lust's house for a BB-Q.  Meet all the people he will be living with on ""The Ice"".  Hopefully make out a bit with lust.  :-)  Sunday: I would like a day to myself.  Seriously, I need to hang out with myself and readjust my attitude.  Probably swing on the porch swing or take a drive to somewhere quite."
YD6P057,female,24,"Weird week at work this past week.  Been so busy, I can hardly blink.  I am feeling a bit overwhelmed and my mood has shown it at home.  After coming into work on Wednesday feeling tired, overwhelmed and moody, one of my co-workers asked what was wrong and I told him I just needed a vaca.  He then said, take one and take PTO time and then proceeded to ask how much PTO time I had.  Mind you, this is ths shit that ratted my ass out to my boss about my hours at work.  I then told (Let's call him WOXC) my hours and he then proceeded to say, 'well, you really don't have that much time saved up because this next week is the 4th of July and they take PTO time out of that.  Not kidding, 10 minutes later WOXC comes into my office and says, 'well, I have decided to take off today and tomorrow, don't be mad.  FUCK YOU.  I just opened up to you and told you I just needed some time off and you come in and rub THAT in my face.  ASS.  So, I continued to work until 6:15 (alone), and get my shit done.    I did screw up a major project this week so it wasn't WOXC's complete fault.  But let's blame him anyway!  :-)  Like I always say, the first step is admitting it and the second step is blaming someone for it! Anyway, the project I ARFED up made me look like a complete fool.  I seriolusly doubt myself and my abilities.  However, I have to just get over it and move on.  So, every night this week, I went out and didn't come home until after 11.  I am so tired!  Found out that one of GASAW's dearest workers passed away this week.  Very sad week for everyone there.  People were sad and it was difficult to work because of all the sadness.  He was our groundskeeper and maintanance guy.  So sweet and too young to die like that.  He's in my thoughts and prayers.  Also found out that my bestfriend is moving to Montana.  All I have to say about that is YEE HAW!  Now, she'll only be 8 hours from me.  Not bad.  And good thing is, is that she gets to bring Erik with her.  A lot of good things are happening for her right now.  However, a little concerned about the move on Erik.  He hasn't really had a big move like that and it is hicksville.  Not sure all that country music and cowpoke shit will be that easy to get used to.  Expecially for a guy who gets to go to a major sporting game.  They will now have to drive 8 hours to do so!  That's right Erik and Jenny, the Avs, Rockies, and Broncos are now your 'hometown' sports teams!  YEE HAW!  I'm pulling for you E-POK.  If you need the 'big city', come on down to D-town, and I'll take care of you!  Went downtown last night with so friends.  BFF Caitlin, lil sis Sarah, her hot boyfriend Adam, his big bro Nordys cafe guy (can't remember his name) and his wife Nicole, my coptoys Robbie and John.  Fun Fun night.  Danced all night long and took a bunch of pictures.  Went to IHOP and didn't get home until 4 this morning.  NICE!  I wore a booby top and great jeans.  Not sure why I mentioned that but I felt like a modern day Jackie O.  My dad would have been proud, minus the boob fest.  Oh well, I got em, might as well flaunt them before they sag to the groud.  Been having fun being quasi-single.  Been dating this new guy who is pretty serious about me. A little freaked out because I like going to clubs and having a good time, and I don't want to answer to anyone but myeself.  I am not going to think about it too much.  This Girl Just Wants To Have Fun.    Today is kind of a scary day.  Going to a housewarming party today up in Thornton.  It's for some friends of Siahjo's.  It was a year ago today that I had my bell's palsy.  Just a weird reminder of how unhappy I was.  I know that I am going to see his friends and explain my life to them.  Not really sure how ready I am for that.  I love this couple though.  Great people who have always pulled for me.  Actually Carla is the one who sends me the emails that Jo writes his friends and family.  She is so nice to me.  I completely miss her and Eddie.  They always made me laugh.  Mom and Don made it to Houston.  Guess they both got stung by wasps.  The wasp that stung Don flew into his shirt and stung him a bunch of times.  Weird.   I am off to do some laundry, hydrate myself, feed the dog, fight off the hoards of men standing at my door to see my lovely, makeup smeared face and smokey hair smellin self!  I'm hot.  Peace out  PS, someone, anyone needs to post here.  I think I am talking to space."

YD6P057,female,24,"urlLink TheDenverChannel.com - News - Bear Enters Woman's Tent, Rolls Her Around : ""Bear Enters Woman's Tent, Rolls Her Around  Snowmass Village Woman Escapes With Minor Injuries  Bear hunters are tracking a large black bear near Snowmass Village, Colo., after it crashed into the tent of a local woman and rolled her around, the Aspen Daily News reported Wednesday. The hunters will kill the bear if they are able to track it, according to the Colorado Division of Wildlife. 'This bear, because it did injure a person, if we are able to track it down, it will be destroyed in accordance with (Division of Wildlife) policy,' Todd Malmsbury of the DOW told the Daily News. Emily Casebeer, 19, said she was sleeping alone in a tent at the Snowmass Creek trailhead Sunday when the bear entered her tent and started rolling her around. She was not seriously injured and quickly made her way to her vehicle and drove home. A subsequent examination revealed a small wound on her leg and some bruising. When she returned to her tent, it had been destroyed. Malmsbury said the encounter it is the first incident of its kind in Colorado this year. Casebeer did not appear to have any food in her tent at the time of the incident, according to Malmsbury. He said there are 10,000 to 12,000 black bears in Colorado at the current time.

YD6P057,female,24,"For no other reason than not having to answer to anyone, the weekends are great.  I love spending time with my dog and lately I have been taking loads of pics of him because we got him groomed and he is so damn cute!  I have never felt so good about myself emotionally, however, I am sick of being fat!  And sick of being flabby and out of shape and sick of hiding my ""flaws"" and sick of going shopping and feeling like crap.  So, I HAVE TO WORK OUT.  I loved it last summer.  It was my release after Jo and I broke up and I looked and felt a lot better plus, I looked hot in cute little dress (and when I mean little I mean a size 12 dress).  I just want to be a size 9/10.  That's all!  I know that's two dress sizes down but I know I can do it if I work hard and watch what I eat.  So, I am going to eat salads for lunch everyday and have a nice healthy dinner.  (chicken and veggies)  It's been tough eating right at night because I have started dating a new guy and he loves to go out (like I object) to eat at great places!  However, I have added tons of fuits and veggies into my diet and have picked up on the water intake.  ARG... Working out is KEY!  It's been a pretty quiet day.  (thankfully)  Mom's fathers day patio furniture was delivered and she got to swing on the porch swing, which was nice to watch. I didn't get to swing because I had lunch with Caitlin.  We both are living back at home with our moms and we needed to vent.  She is the only one who understands my situation right now.  We are going to Greeley tomorrow with some of our girlfriends to the Rascal Flatts show and to the Rodeo.  Very excited about that.  And it will get us out of the house.  I am lucky though, cause mom has a BF and spends the night at his place 2-3 times a week.    Today it stormed.  It's been so rainy and stormy here this month.  I love it.  We need it too.  Kennedy gets so freaked out.  Today he even jumped into my lap.  HE NEVER DOES THAT.  I had mom take a picture of it and now it's my wallpaper on my computer.    Random thought of the day:  I can't even tell you how many marriage proposals I get after telling a guy (hockey fan) that I have season tickets!   I can't even tell you how far I am from the thought of marriage.  I knew Jo and I weren't going to get married probably by the end of year one.  We weren't meant to be and he needed to experience life outside of Colorado and the US.  He is fulfilling his dream and sounds like he has finally found his place in life.  I read the emails he sends to his friends and family (I get them from his friends Eddy and Carla) and he sounds like another person.  No one I have ever known.  Jenny asked me a few weeks ago if I missed him.  I told her that I didn't miss the old Jo and the new Jo is someone I have never known.  Carla said that Jo might want to hear from me, but I think that I probably caused him too much pain with the breakup.  I am sure he just wants to move on.  It really was such a painful time and I have never been so depressed in my life.  We were just so different.  I am such a goodie-goodie and Jo broke a few of my life rules.  I am not even sure why we stayed together.  We just were raised differently and grew up in very different neighborhoods.  However, I loved his family.  It was huge and they always were so nice to me.  I do miss that.  A lot.  But sometimes love isn't enough and a great family isn't enough.    I thought for sure I would accept some of his habits and mature, but I didn't... and in the end, the habits and my immaturity got in way.  Plus, he wasn't ready to settle down and all I have ever wanted was to be married.  It's actually almost been a year since we split.  I haven't seen him since, either.  We almost met up, but I kept putting it off because I didn't want to complicate things.  It's for the best.  His friends, Eddy and Carla are having a house warming party next weekend.  They invited me, but I am not sure I want to go.  It's still pretty painful and the last time I saw one of his friends, things didn't go very well.  Jo found out that I ran into one of his friends and he went nuts and called me on my birthday and bitch/cussed me out for conversing with his friend.  That was the last time Jo and spoke to each other.  It didn't end on a good note and that's part of the reason I don't really want to email him.  Everyone knows how I am.  I always say that it is easier to be mean to me that it is to be nice when ending something.  Like when my Dad passed away, everyone would come up to me and say things like, we love you or other nice things and that would make me cry.  My mom and I always say, just be mean, cause we hate being sad.  I know Jo and I were mean to eachother and I can deal with that.   Mean doesn't stick around like sad does .    Weird, cause when Jo and I broke up, it was on the anniversary of my father's death.  Hmmm guess the mean cancels out the sad.  Huh, weird.    I don't really know why I am writing so much about him.  I guess I have been thinking about him a lot lately because it's been a year.  But maybe it's because I get these periodic emails he sends to his friends and family and wonder who the hell he is now.  I mean his emails are so different from the man I know.  I wonder if it is a front his is putting on so that his family thinks he is okay.  Who knows.  It's been 2 years since we went to Europe together.  I loved/hated traveling with him.  I wonder what it would be like to travel with him now.  Now that he is off pot?  Alright, I have to go downstairs now and enjoy this quiet house.  I am going to read and sleep!  Elvis has left the building!"
2HDCV58,male,15,"so I went to see Sleepover with Maryel yesterday and that was like the best movie ever. I mean it was so funny and very cute. I thought it was gonna be very stupid and cheesy, but it was awesome. Me and Maryel were laughing through the whole thing but I don't think anyone else thought it was but it was fun.  Oh yea and another plus is that the main guy in it sooooooo frickin hot I couldn't stand it. So I just wanted to recommend that movie to all of you. and i would see it again if anyone wants to go see it after Orlando. or we could see a different movie if you want cuz there are tons of good movies out there. and I really miss you guys so maybe we could all get together after Orlando and do something. I dunno.... just a thought. Love, Erica"

885ELY7,female,27,"was rather good. :)      after watching a movie, dinner, and pool with val till past midnight, ngak and i went on to hangout at the middle road muslim food centre (middle earth) for teh tarik and some crappy prata. to my surprise, he suggested getting some beer from 7-11 if i could hangout abit more. it was raining, quite heavily too - but off we went, splashing through unsheltered junctions along the way. after corona and wild turkey were purchased, we parked ourselves on some metal chairs and a glass table outside a quiet hotel just opposite hotel81. the going-on's at hotel81 proved quite entertaining... we could see everyone going in and coming out. heh... the most dodgy ones were this buncha ""queens"" with one angmoh dude. 3 of them, very hot... but when we heard their voices drifting across to us across the road - woah.      so anyways, we talked. about everything under the sun. and sometime in the middle of it all, he asked if he could ask me a personal question.      ""well, quite a number of people have been telling me this... is it true that u have a thing for me?""      i laughed and said, ""who told u? how come so many people know?""      he couldn't quite remember exactly who, but nick and lina were included. i've never told nick or lina but i know that they would know. they woulda seen telltale signs. and they're both smart people. and they've seen ngak and i stay back late so often... besides, from the things that nick says, i already knew that nick knows. besides them, val has also told him the same thing.      then he carried on to say, ""actually, i have a thing for u too.""      i said, ""really?"" and just smiled. all this time he was quite bashful, and would only look at me once in awhile. though after this, he managed to look me in the eye and smile. then after a beat or two, he said, ""but u do know my stand, right?""      ""yeh, sally told me about it. ""      ""well, there's more to it actually."" and he went on to explain that his previous (many) relationships have kinda ended the same way, and that the problem lies with him. none of the relationships he's had lasted more than one year. it seems to be a pattern happening all the time, and he doesn't want the same thing to happen again. so he's gonna try and change himself before going into anything with anyone.  ""u're not disappointed or anything, are u?""      ""nah, we'll just see how things go.""      and he seemed happy with that answer.       we went on to talk till 6+am. i always seem to be doing crazy, irrational things with him around. sigh. before we parted, our goodbye hug felt tighter than usual. as i closed the door of the cab, he was beaming at me while peering in the window.      i went home, had a shower and went to work. it's amazing how i got through the day. i think a main factor which kept me up was the knowledge that he does like me too. :) at least now i know that he's not being nice to me just because he's the same with all the girls. and i feel much better now that he knows, and i know... and everything's out in the open.      i managed to convince my graphic designer kamil to share a cab home with me come 6pm. already started dozing in the cab... reached home at 7pm, my brother was in the shower so i went to lie down first. guess what? i slept all the way through to 3am, still in my office clothes. ate some leftover dishes (left for me) and went back to sleep till 930am. called in sick. then slept till about an hour ago. i think i will go sleep somemore in abit...      well, so the plan is to keep hanging out whenever, and see how it goes... :)"

Cosy and beautiful, this is def a place for honeymooners. i made friends with some crazy journalists - we had tons of beer and wine to drink for dinner. Many were hung over the next day when we had to catch the early morning flight.   I'm glad to be back!  Calcutta is my next destination for a work assignment. It's to explore prostitution there - a 5 day gruelling trip where i've to secure interviews with prostitutes (that other media are not interviewing). how am i going to do that? i don't know..but wish me luck. i'm super excited cos it's not just a product launch, but some real investigation!  the other reality that i'm facing is i'm seriously considering moving to OZ. I so want to do this but i'm scared shitless. i wouldn't say it's 100% confirmed but it looks that way. Had the BIG TALK with D...it's a lot more serious than the other times. Many things are swirling in my mind about this...let's just say it'll be the craziest thing i'll be doing ever...  bloop: would it be really hard to find a job there?   boo:  sorry i didn't call you. i really didn't receive your email on thurs. what did you end up doing?  sounds like bloop and ber had a great weekend partying.   looking forward to hearing from all of you =)"

885ELY7,female,27,"http://www.lovetactics.com/     According to Bertrand Russell, ""Human nature is constructed so that it gives affection most readily to those who seem to demand it the least.""  This being the case ""and I assure you it is"" then what hope can any normal human being who intensely craves love and affection have of winning the one they want?  Won't their very need for the other person be the thing that turns the one they want away from them?  The answer is ""NO!"" It is not the need for love, which all people inherently feel which drives others away from them, but it is their indiscretion about exhibiting that need.   What we need to learn is to make a distinction in our lives between the way we feel and the way we act! Or, in other words, we must learn self-control.  Not that we should suppress our emotions to the degree that we deny to ourselves what we are feeling. No, no indeed.  We should always realize and be honest with ourselves what we are feeling inside. But we must be discerning, discreet and wise about the things we know about ourselves, which we share with others.  Just because you find yourself desperately wanting someone, for example, doesn't mean you should act desperate. But neither does it mean you should try to deny the feeling in yourself. So you feel desperate! So what?! There's no shame in that. Join the club. Millions of wonderful, great, fantastic people who have lived long before you have felt this way. There's nothing wrong with wanting.  But what I warn you against is not trying to control the way you talk about it to others. You see, a dog should wag his tail, not have the tail wag the dog. And YOU are the one who ultimately controls your behavior, your emotions should not be doing that.  Remember when you were small and felt unhappy and upset about not getting your way? What did most of us do?  We would lie down on the floor and act out our emotions by beating our fists on the floor and kicking wildly. But when we got older we learned to put away childish behaviors and hold back, except in the area of romance.  What I'm saying is that we need to be mature in this area as well.  ""But,"" someone cries out, ""isn't it dishonest to not express what you feel?""  ""No,"" I answer. ""It's a simple matter of growing up.""  The mature thing to do is to learn to distinguish between feelings and actions. Feel intently, deeply and honestly. But keep your behavior in check.  That person who keeps his behavior separate from his feeling ultimately commands the most respect, and love from others.  Remember how, as a child, you were instructed that if a big dog came rushing up to you, you must do your best not to show any fear?  The reason was that, if you show fear, it encourages the dog to bite you. Well, sadly, the same thing applies in human relationships.  If you tip your hand too soon that you're feeling vulnerable to the other person, then it actually invites them to emotionally burn you in some way. So act as brave as you can and keep your feelings to yourself.  The key thing to learn from Bertrand Russell's statement is that love is given to those who seem to least demand it.  Because the truth is we all need love ""desperately"" but we can overcome the built-in disadvantage by learning how to act."
885ELY7,female,27,"Asking a Guy Out      by Mark Sullivan    Men definitely like it when women ask them out. What's not to like? But before you get busy with your phone and address book, there are a few things you should know.   For starters, a part of the guy will wonder if you've called him up because you want to have sex with him. Guys are generally hoping to have sex whenever they go on a date, so this probably won't mean he'll behave any different, but you might want to set some limits early on. (Unless that is why you called him.)   Also, be prepared for lots of dating gray areas: Who'll drive? Who'll pay? Who'll decide where to go? The impetus is generally on the guy to control the flow of events on a date, but since you initiated things, how far will the initiative extend? Ideally, this will be part of the fun, but it can lead to baffled expectations on both sides.   Another thing to consider is something guys have been dealing with since time began: The answer might be no."

5DYC0UK,female,23,"Ha!  So, I've heard from 3 different people (attorneys) that Judge Hughes felt just awful for last week and his taking his bad mood out on me.  Yeah, funny, though b/c I never got an apology.  One of the attorneys basically said that I'm working for the ""Bobby Knight"" of judges, so I guess that's good b/c if there's anywhere I can get thick skin as a lawyer, it would be here, huh?  So, it's almost time for the normal work day to be over...unfortunately, I still have night court to do.  I did get to get out of the office today, however - lunch with the sister and nephew.  I wanted to go to the arcade with them, too, but sadly, Aunt Nain had to work.  Alas...the life of a working stiff!"

And I've missed so much work, so I'm pissed about that...all around, Nain is pissy today.  Pissy pissy pissy.  I might just take it out on these people I'm writing divorces for.  Looks like today will be a work through lunch and work late night, huh?  Arg."
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Whoo!  Yeah!  I'm so happy that it's almost the weekend I could just burst.  This week has SUCKED big butt, and that's an understatement.  So, just got into work...doing the usual routine, drinking my Starbucks and checking my email.  It usually takes me about 1 hour to actually get myself motivated to work.  I'm super tired today, no idea why but I had to go for the grande today at Starbucks instead of the tall.  Hey, at least I'm not ""venti-tired"" right?    So, for those of you who are asking about why I'm so excited about this weekend - well, Alaina has a date this weekend :-)  And he might read this so I can't really tell you what I'm planning on doing, but it is a surprise - but I'm excited to say the least.  So, that's what I have going on Saturday.  Tonight...god knows...maybe I'll help Erika move some more - she has her hands full, that's for sure!  I need a good weekend with how much this week has sucked.  That, and I have a big MRI on Monday...which I'm not looking forward to, so I want to have fun before I do that.  For those of you who haven't had an MRI ever, it's like being in a coffin with someone pounded a jack hammer up where your head is.  It is a good time to be had by all :-)  well, I'll write more later, I'm sure b/c it's Friday, which means the motivation level is down today.  But until then, I must work!  Laters!"

I will never do that again.  So, I'm wasting company money today.  I'm thinking about going upstairs to the library and hiding out so people don't blatantly see me not being productive as I'm doing right now.  But then I'm afraid that if I did do that, the drugs would take over and I'd fall asleep with my face in a law book.  Ha, that would be funny, however.  Anyone have any good suggestions on how to stay awake?  Caffine has been tried...unless I had some straight Jolt, I think that's a moot cause.  Augh...must....work....must...keep....going..."
5DYC0UK,female,23,"I'm going to rip my brain out seriously - my head isn't liking me this morning.  It must be protesting the fact that i got up this morning to work out b/c I have the worst migraine.  And I gotta work - must finish this divorce today - yes, the divorce I've been working on since the beginning of July.  I got a 2 hour talk about it yesterday, and even though he said I did better than my last order, I still have to redivide the property.  That is one reason why I don't want to be a divorce lawyer - property division sucks.  More than anything has sucked before.  Parties never tell the truth about anything they own which is ironic b/c they DO take some kind of oath when they come on the stand, but that doesn't seem to matter to some people.  Or if I AM a divorce lawyer, I will make sure to provide the judge with everything possible that he will need to make a fair decision.  B/c as I stand now it is virtually impossible (and the judge agrees with me) to fairly divide this property.  You can't fairly divide an estate if you don't know how much every item IS.   So, yes, I'm drinking my black coffee, poppping my Excedrin Tension Headache and wearing the glasses in order to see this morning...Must get this order done!  3 more days!!!!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Yeah, so his bad mood?  I got the wrath of it for about an hour there today - I suck as a future lawyer, basically.  Suck suck suck.  I shouldn't be in this profession and I have no backbone...blah blah...so, yes, today is just GREAT guys.  I'm totally loving this week.  OH, I can hardly stand my happiness about how this week is going.  I might just do a little dance right here at my desk.  (And YES, I'm being very sarcastic)  Anyone want to go to happy hour?"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"augh, one more hour left of work!  I seriously have gotten NOTHING done today - well...no, scratch that...I made a hair appointment and I DID turn something into the judge.  Gotta say, I'm a little nervous about giving him my work as of lately...who knows how he'll react?  He's bipolar, I swear he must be.  Anyway, I'm really really wishing today was Friday and I could have my fun day tomorrow.  It's going to be great - I don't think I've been this happy or smiled this much in a long time, and I'm loving every second of it!  I must share my happiness with the world!!! :-) ha ha...OK, back to work I go!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"augh...Have any of you just been in a shitty mood for no apparent reason?

So, I'm awaiting my meeting...I did get my editing back for these orders and I have huge changes to make yet again, even to the divorce that I had to totally rewrite and I thought I did much better on!!! And I'm getting stressed about moving and leaving everyone and I'm wound so tight right now I might just lose it on someone...some poor soul who probably will do nothing to deserve it and then I'll end up having to apologize and feel like an ass...it's a vicious cycle :-) so, word of advse to all of you I live with, close to, or have any contact with whatsoever - Alaina's in one of THOSE moods :-P And if you know me well enough, you know just what those moods entail."
5DYC0UK,female,23,"That's my goal today!  Today MUST be a better day, so help me!  So, last night was not too bad...I got out of court late here....long winded lawyers kept us in court until 5:00, but I made it just fine to my nephew's karate test.  He's a purple belt now!  My nephew seriously is the coolest kid ever, and his Aunt Nain is so proud of him.  Of course, I had to come home eventually..my family is crazy.  Well, my parents, I mean.  I got an earful about how long I was on the cell phone last night...blah blah....Just keep telling myself 3 weeks, and I'll be back in Dayton in my OWN apartment and free from people who try to control and tell me what to do.  I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to be controlled at all, so this summer has been challenging to that extent, to say the least.  Anyway, not much going on here today.  My boss is gone on vacation until the end of next week (Yay!) so the mood in the office is so much happier today.  Hell, at least I won't get yelled at, right?  and then later tonight I'm going to go help Erika get her stuff packed to move into her newer, bigger apartment.  I'm a moving pro by now, so I could probably do the whole job myself.  That's what you get for moving every year or less.  I'm just SO ready for the weekend.  Got some big plans I'm excited about - I get to spend Saturday with one of the nicest people I've ever met, so I just wish today were Friday so I can go ahead and do that :-)  But until then, it's a-divorcing I must go!  Later gators!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"So, I just got into work this morning....am still trying to motivate myself to do some work, but we'll see how that goes...only 3 more weeks of writing divorces, so I'm happy about that.  I'm ready for a change.  the good news is my lawyer from the car accident is going to hire me for the fall!  AND he's going to pay me!  Whoo!  Not sure just how much yet, but anything is better than nothing!  I'm excited to work somewhere new and maybe see if this is what I want to do or if working in a small firm is for me.  Anyway, I had a GREAT great great weekend.  Everyone in the office is in a bad mood today, but I'm not!!!  Nope, no case of the Mondays for me today!    So, it's to work I go - just wanted to say HAPPY ANNIVERSARY to my favorite brother and sister-in-law - 7 years of marital bliss :-P  Love you guys!"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"I'm getting pretty bad about blogging, it has been over a month since my last post.  Maybe it's just that my life is busier than it was last summer.    Colin and I have been together for 3 months now, it has been a relationship full of adventures and mishaps, but so far, the good outweighs the bad by a substantial amount.  Since I last wrote, we have gone on two more surf trips, my sorority formal and done the Sun Run.  In March, Colin and I went back to Tofino for a weekend and I finally got up on his surfboard!  Yay, it was a small wave, but at least I managed to stand up.  For the Easter weekend I went down to Oregon with Colin and his friends for a Mexican food fueled surf trip.  We went to Cannon Beach and Seaside and I bought my very own surfboard!  It is bright pink and has black fins and a clear leash!  I should have been studying that weekend, but it was so warm we surfed and lay on the beach in swimsuits and drank beer and daiquiris and ate beef jerky!  Ah well I did study a bit and I still did really well on my exams.  This past weekend Colin and I did the Sun Run.  Neither of us was in top shape, he had hurt his leg the weekend before and I got a really bad cramp halfway through the race, but we still managed to finish the 10 km in about 45 minutes.  Tonight I am going to Colin's initiation into the Legion.  Basically, he just has to recite an oath and have a few beers with the members afterwards so it should be no big deal.  After that, I am off to exercise with Kimi!  In other news, my grandmother died on Sunday evening.  She had been sick all of my life and the doctors never really figured out what was wrong with her.  She smoked for 40 years before she quit a decade ago, but it had done a lot of damage.  She survived at least 3 heart attacks and cancer so it isn't like she went easily.  I'm going to miss her a lot, she was the only person in my life who really accepted me for whom I am and celebrated my achievements more than I did.  She was the first to call the relatives to brag about me and she always told anyone who would listen about her granddaughter.  It is nice to have someone who thinks the world of you, even if you know you don't deserve all of the praise you are getting.  I only wish that she had never smoked, I will always wonder what her life could have been in the past 24 years if she had been in better health and how long she could have lived.  Her own parents lived until they were in their mid-nineties and although they weren't very mobile, they seemed happy.  The times when I will miss her most are when I eventually get married and when I have children.  These are times that I know she would have wanted to witness and times that I wanted her to be with me.  She told me the other year that she would not live that long, but she asked me to give one of my daughters her first name as a middle name and I agreed.    I'm taking my mother to tea on Friday, she needs to get away from the house and away from all of the funeral arrangements for a few hours and I really should spend some time with her.    Anyways on a happy note, I got an A+ on the one course that my grades posted for!  *Listening to Outkast - Hey Ya*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"One day until Halloween and I still don't know what I'm going to dress up as!  Eek!  I can't really worry about it until this afternoon; I have a midterm today at 1pm so I've been studying for the past few weeks.    Stephen and I have been fighting a lot lately and we almost broke up on Tuesday night.  We've decided to try to work out our differences.  I've been taking out my stress about school on him, it’s not fair, but I'm working on it.  Outdoor Rec shouldn't be stressful one would think, however, we have a lot of silly little assignments that pile up and some profs aren't very professional.  I mostly like the course but my computer prof is about the most annoying guy I have ever had to deal with in terms of classes.  Argh.  This weekend I have a Halloween party with my class on Friday, on Saturday I'm getting my belly button pierced and maybe dyeing my hair auburn, and on Sunday I'm kayaking in the morning with Stephen and hanging out with my long time family friend Melissa in the afternoon.  So, as long as I do well on the midterm today, I will be having a stellar weekend!  *hoping that I've studied the right stuff for my exam*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"I have suddenly developed a taste for sushi.  I used to gag everytime I tasted seaweed, but I seem to be over that now.  Mmm sushi...    Today has been fairly dull, just work and more work.  I'm going swimming with Stephen tonight, that should be fun.  I bought chocolate fondu and strawberries for dessert tonight, I hope he likes them!    Last night Kimi and I had our first weekly exercise session of the summer.  It went pretty well, we tried out some exercises on my exercise ball and went for a walk.    Oh my, I still haven't got Heidi's present yet and her party is Saturday, I should get on that.  I have to buy office supplies for work this afternoon, so I'll pop by some other shops on the way there.  *leaving the office to buy kleenex...riveting I know*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Well yesterday mostly sucked.  The car the guys were fixing was completely rusted out and ended up being sent to the scrap yard.  Then Rogers sent me a huge phone bill eventhough my first 2 months were supposed to be free except for the $35 activation fee!  Yay I get to spend several hours on the phone sorting that one out.  The boy and I had to sit around all night waiting for the tow truck guy to come and get the Accord so we didn't get to go to the park at all.  Oh well tonight after work we're supposed to be going swimming, that should be fun.  Two of his friends are coming out on Friday.  I already know Kirk, but I'll be meeting Colin for the first time.  Oy, more people to pinch me for monkey trees, Chevron stations, 60 km per hour and complete stops.  It all started when I taught them the Monkey tree game.  Whenever you see a monkey tree you are supposed to pinch the other person/people and say Monkey Tree can't pinch me!  Unfortunately the boys decided that they needed more pinching opportunities so the decided on the above 3 reasons to pinch me!    Hmm it's 10:10am and I was supposed to have a meeting with my boss starting at 10am and he's still nowhere to be found.  I haven't seen him since Wednesday, hopefully everything is ok.  *sitting at my desk and admiring my new cell phone*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Happy St. Patrick's Day!  It appears that my wardrobe contains nothing green, too bad...  I've had an interesting couple of weeks, mostly fun only a few annoying moments.   Two weeks ago I went to a surfing competition with Colin and his friends.  It was pretty good, we drove down to Washington and camped out for 3 nights.  My surfing is still terrible, and I still have bruises from that weekend, but I'm looking forward to getting better.  Last weekend Colin was sick so we stuck around town.  On Saturday we went bikini shopping and then to Ikea and on Sunday practiced skateboarding, played frisbee at the beach, and saw his friend Jeff's new place.  This week he is staying with me while my parents are away, Monday we went to a film festival and last night we just hung out at my place and played board games while listening to my parents' records.  Tonight we are supposed to go out drinking for St. Paddy's day, but we are still up in the air as to where we're going to go, and who to go with.    I met Colin's mum the other week.  She is very nice and I think we got along well.  She brought me presents, that kinda made me a bit nervous, but it was sweet of her.  From what I saw of it, her and Colin have a very good relationship and they definately love each other a lot.  Anyways I'm off to buy a wetsuit...."
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Hmm, well I had a pretty good weekend.  On Friday I went swimming with the boy.  Saturday, I slept in, went shopping with my parents, and had dinner with Heidi.  We went to Milestones and then meandered along the seawall for a bit.  On Sunday I went hiking around Buntzen Lake, it was really pretty, but when we crossed the floating bridge I thought I was gonna fall into the lake for sure!  I saw Stephen later Sunday evening and we had a quiet dinner together, fun but it'll be nice when he has weekends off again.    The fixing of my car didn't happen on Thursday, it was raining so the guys left it until Wednesday of this week.  Hopefully if all goes well I'll have a car by the end of this week.    No really exciting plans for this week.  Stephen's friends might be flying out to visit him on Thursday but he doesn't know for sure yet.  It should be interesting to meet them, so far all I've heard are a lot of stories and Stephen has shown me some photos.  Hmm hope they're not all crazy :P."
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Ah my first entry.  Tonight I'm going to have dinner with Stephen, my very cute boyfriend, and his landlord.  Tomorrow, however, will be much more exciting!  My dad and Stephen are fixing up a car for me!  Finally at 23 I'll have a car and not have to borrow mum's.    Stephen and I have been together for almost 4 months now!  He's really sweet and good looking too!  We met through some mutual accquaintances at a pub night and for our first date I took him canoeing.  Later tonight we are going clubbing with some of my sorority sisters, it should be fun, I haven't seen many of them since April.    This summer I'm working a desk job instead of going back up to camp as an intern.  I get paid more, but I'm really gonna miss having my own pool, canoes, and 560 acres to wander about.  Hopefully next summer I'll get back up to camp, but tuition is massive this year, so I have to put $ in front of fun."

Tonight I'm going to teach the boy how to make mashed potatoes!  Fun fun.  Tomorrow is Heidi's birthday, I'm going to buy her present tonight.  Tomorrow we're all going to the waterslides and then to her place for dinner after.  I hope I don't have an allergic reaction to the chlorine this time.  Other than than not much is happening, I'm going rollerblading with Stephen after dinner and shopping tonight!  *sitting at my desk wondering how to get my brain to thaw*"

After the movie, Stephen and I went to the beach and wandered about for a bit.  It was a pretty good night, but the boy is obsessed with his computer, it is kind of annoying when he plays with it while I'm over, but I guess no one is perfect.  Today is pretty dull; my boss is away again so here I am in a bright pink Hawaiian sundress.  Only 5 days until I leave for Toronto!  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll have a good time.    Tonight is the first night of the fireworks, I'm biking to the beach with Kimi and Stu, it should be fun as long as I can figure out what route to take to their house once I get off the bridge.  At least this way I will find out approximately how long it would take me to bike to work.    *listening to American Pie by Don McLean*"

B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Better Humans   Breast cancer has been linked to a common virus, suggesting that a vaccine could be developed to help prevent the disease.   While not proving a cause-and-effect relationship, the finding by researchers at Otago University in Dunedin, New Zealand and Melbourne University in Victoria, Australia suggests that infection by a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a risk factor.   ""The most exciting possibility would be, if that were the case, maybe further down the track somebody could develop a vaccine,"" lead researcher Ann Richardson of Otago University said in an interview. ""It could be given to young children and it would protect people against being exposed late in life because they already would have developed antibodies when they were young.""   Viral connection  A link between breast cancer and CMV is supported by other links between cancer and viruses, such as that for cervical cancer.  CMV is a type of herpes virus that infects humans and can cause such symptoms as deafness.  Worldwide studies suggest that it may also be linked to breast cancer.   ""Countries where most people are exposed to cytomegalovirus and other viruses in childhood have lower rates of breast cancer,"" says Richardson.  Adult infection risk  For their study, Richardson and colleagues examined blood samples from 377 women less than 40 years of age.   They found that women with breast cancer had on average 22% more antibodies to CMV than women without the disease.   This suggests that women infected with the virus in adulthood have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women exposed as children.  If true, it means that vaccines against CMV that are already in development could help prevent the disease."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"CTV NEWS   Almost one-quarter of Canadians have been the victims of medical errors, according a new report. These mistakes have resulted in people taking up to an extra 1.1 million hospital beds annually.  The Canadian Institute for Health Information commissioned the report, Health Care in Canada 2004. Released Wednesday, it says Canadians experienced ""preventable adverse events"" with the following being the most common mistakes:  One in nine adults reported receiving the wrong medication or the wrong dose.  One in nine adults and one in 11 children caught an infection while in hospital. The most common infections were pneumonia, urinary tract infections and surgery site infections.  One in almost 7,000 patients had a foreign object, such as a sponge, left in them after surgery or a medical procedure.  One in 1, 100 senior citizens experienced hip fractures while in hospital or during surgery.  One birth trauma (for example a dislocated shoulder) occurred per 81 newborns. This study expands on a landmark report released last month that found preventable medical errors may be contributing to more than 20,000 deaths each year.  This report studied the number of mistakes and their effects on patients.   Dr. John Wade of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute said the lack of openness about mistakes must change. ""If we don't change the culture from one of blame and shame to one of information sharing and solving the problems, we won't make much headway.''   In the past, the issue of openness has been hindered by the threat of lawsuits.   ""This is a massive problem, which is only going to be dealt with by thoughtful effort -- not by blaming people, but by finding a way of bringing the errors into the open. So we can find better ways of doing things,"" said Michael Decter, the former chair of the institute.   ""The main reason people litigate in the health system is because they feel they were misled, "" he added.  Some suggested solutions for reducing errors include ensuring mistakes can be reported without the threat of liability to medical staff, and improving accuracy through methods such as electronic medical records.  Medical errors have been in the news this week. Health authorities in Victoria, B.C. are asking 300 patients to be tested for Hepatitis B and C along with HIV, after a possible contamination was discovered in dialysis machines at the Royal Jubilee Hospital.  This report follows news last week that the infection, clostridium difficile, has afflicted 1, 400 people in Montreal and Calgary and killed 79 people. Hospitals in both cities are battling outbreaks of the infection. The outbreak is blamed on the use of a popular antacid medication commonly used in Quebec and Alberta to treat ulcers and gastro-esophageal reflux disease."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"CNN    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Respiratory problems, including some asthma, can be caused by mold, but an extensive study released Tuesday failed to indict the fungus for a host of other, often major illnesses that some have sought to associate with it.    ""Even though the available evidence does not link mold or other factors associated with building moisture to all the serious health problems that some attribute to them, excessive indoor dampness is a widespread problem that warrants action at the local, state and national levels,"" said Noreen Clark, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan.  Clark headed an Institute of Medicine panel that studied the health effects of mold, which has drawn increased attention in recent years with the shutdown of a major hotel, delayed openings of schools in several states and a raft of lawsuits.  The Institute, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, said mold and building dampness do constitute a problem and urged it be corrected through a range of steps, including changes in how buildings are designed, constructed and maintained.  ""An exhaustive review of the scientific literature made it clear to us that it can be very hard to tease apart the health effects of exposure to mold from all the other factors that may be influencing health in the typical indoor environment,"" said Clark.  ""That said, we were able to find sufficient evidence that certain respiratory problems, including symptoms in asthmatics who are sensitive to mold, are associated with exposure to mold and damp conditions,"" she concluded.  Excessive dampness influences whether mold, as well as bacteria, dust mites and other such agents, are present and thrive indoors, the committee noted. In addition, the wetness may cause chemicals and particles to be released from building materials.  A rare ailment known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis also was associated with indoor mold exposure in susceptible people.  Preventing indoor dampness But the committee said it was unable to find evidence that mold is associated with fatigue, neuropsychiatric disorders or other health problems that some people have attributed to fungal infestations of buildings.  The little evidence that is available does not support an association, the committee said, but it added that because there are so few studies it cannot rule out a connection.  Molds that are capable of producing toxins do grow indoors, and toxic and inflammatory effects also can be caused by bacteria that flourish in damp conditions, the report noted.  The committee said information exists on how to control dampness but architects, engineers, building contractors, facility managers and maintenance staff do not always apply this knowledge.  The members called for development of guidelines for preventing indoor dampness and said they should be promoted nationally. In addition, building codes and regulations should be reviewed and modified as necessary to reduce moisture problems, the committee said.  Lawsuits claiming illnesses from mold in buildings that were not properly built or cleaned up have multiplied in recent years.  Changes in building codes in the 1970s to make homes more energy efficient and airtight had the effect of allowing less ventilation through a house that would dry out a wet wall or floor, which in turn may have led to more mold damage claims, according to attorneys involved in some cases.  The National Academy of Sciences is a private institution chartered by Congress to advise the government on scientific matters. The study was funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Medical News Today   A simple measurement of the expression levels of two genes in breast cancer tissue appears to identify tumors that are more likely to recur in women treated with tamoxifen for early-stage disease. Determining patients for whom tamoxifen treatment is likely to fail would allow earlier use of other therapies that could be more effective for those women.  Researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center and Arcturus Bioscience, Inc., describe their findings in a report to be published in the June issue of Cancer Cell. The paper is being released online today (www.cancercell.org) because related material is being presented at the June 5-8 American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting.   The study was supported by grants from the Avon Foundation, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the National Cancer Institute.   Tamoxifen, which blocks the interaction between the hormone estrogen and its receptor protein, is used to treat breast cancers that express the estrogen receptor. However, only two thirds of these patients have a prolonged response to the drug.   ""Until now, there has been no way to predict which estrogen-receptor-positive patients will not respond to tamoxifen treatment,"" says Dennis Sgroi, MD, director of Breast Pathology at MGH who led the hospital's research team. ""Identifying those for whom tamoxifen is likely to fail could allow physicians to choose other drugs, for instance the aromatase inhibitors that more completely block estrogen's action."" Sgroi is an associate professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.   The hormone estrogen can stimulate both the normal growth of breast tissue and the uncontrolled growth of breast cancer. Cells from most breast tumors contain estrogen receptor molecules, indicating that the tumor's growth is likely to be sensitive to the hormone's action.   Estrogen-blocking drugs have been used in recent years to prevent hormone-sensitive breast tumors from recurring after surgery and to treat metastasis. More than 500,000 U.S. women currently take tamoxifen, making it the most frequently used drug of this class.   The MGH and Arcturus research teams have collaborated for several years on studies of the molecular characteristics of breast tumors. Last year they published a study showing that advanced analysis technologies that identify which genes are expressed, or ""turned on,"" in tumors can characterize the tumor's aggressiveness.   As a follow-up to that work, the research teams led by Sgroi and Mark Erlander, PhD, Arcturus chief scientific officer, began to investigate whether such molecular signatures could help identify which drugs would be the best options for particular patients.  The researchers gathered tumor samples from patients who had received tamoxifen treatment for early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. They identified 60 frozen samples suitable for gene expression analysis for which clinical follow-up information was available. Of those 60 patients, 32 had remained disease-free for an average of eight years, while 28 had recurrence of their tumor or metastasis.   Expression profile analysis demonstrated that the ratio between the expression levels of two genes – HOXB13 and IL17BR – was the strongest predictor of whether a tumor would recur. The higher the expression level of HOXB13 and the lower the expression of IL17BR, the greater the chance of tumor recurrence. Data from an additional 20 samples of tamoxifen-treated tumors supported the predictive power of the two-gene expression ratio.   ""Many clinical laboratories currently have the capability to utilize Arcturus technology to measure the relative expression of these two genes,"" says Erlander. ""Several centralized laboratories are developing a test that will be available this summer.""   Because HOXB13 is known to be overexpressed in some breast tumors, the researchers investigated whether the gene might also play a role in tumor development. Using cells from normal breast tissues, they induced the expression of the HOXB13 gene. Cells in which the gene was activated showed obvious structural changes and appeared to have an increased ability to move and invade other tissues, characteristics of tumor cells.   While that result must be confirmed by future studies, it suggests that the pathway controlled by HOXB13 could be a new therapeutic target.

B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Health Central    Their death rate is three times that of young women, new research finds.    (HealthDayNews) -- Want to know two of the biggest risk factors for an early death? How about being young and male.  That's the conclusion of a new study that found the risk of premature death is particularly high for males in the years surrounding sexual maturity, but it persists in later years as well.  ""Being male is now the single largest demographic risk factor for early mortality in developed countries,"" said Daniel Kruger, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research.  He's co-leader of the study, which appears in the June issue of Evolutionary Psychology. He will also present the findings at the American Psychological Society annual meeting May 28 in Chicago.  The danger of being male rather than female is concentrated in the years between adolescence and adulthood, the study found. In those years, the death rate for men is nearly three times higher than for women.  But the difference exists years later. In the United States, the death rate for men up to the age of 50 is 60 percent higher than for women. Even at age 75, the male death rate is 46 percent higher. Overall, American men have higher mortality rates for 11 causes of death, ranging from heart disease to homicides to suicides, the study found.  ""The magnitude of the sex difference is most starkly summarized by the numbers of deaths before age 50,"" Kruger said. ""For every 10 premature female deaths, 16 men died prematurely.""  Kruger and Dr. Randolph Nesse, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School, got their numbers from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, the World Health Organization and the global Human Mortality Database. Data from 20 countries revealed the same pattern -- higher male mortality, with a peak difference at the age of sexual maturity.  The overall ratio of U.S. male-to-female mortality rates increased sharply at adolescence, peaking at 2.94 from ages 20 to 24 and slowly decreasing to 1.46 from ages 75 to 79, according to the study.  The highest male-female mortality ratio for a specific cause was 9.03 for suicide from ages 75 to 79, meaning nine men that age killed themselves for every woman who did. The next highest male-female mortality ratios were for homicide (5.72) and non-automobile accidents (4.91) from ages 20 to 24, the researchers found.  One reason for the difference is as old as time, Kruger said. Men --indeed, males of all species -- ""compete for status and resources to attract attention and partnership of women,"" he said. ""The higher degree of mating competition among males is the evolutionary reason why females live longer on average in most animal species.""  ""Not all men successfully get a partner,"" Kruger added. ""Because of this, men are willing to take a higher degree of risk. Women's behavior is shaped by the needs of child care, so they have a decreased tendency for risk-taking.""  Much could be done to reduce excess male mortality, Kruger said, mostly by persuading men to follow the rules of a healthy lifestyle -- proper diet, moderate drinking and exercise.  Some societal changes could also help eliminate the causes of early male death, Kruger said. But curiously, reducing the number of weapons in the hands of the American public probably wouldn't help, he said, because the male-female difference persists in countries where handguns aren't generally available.  The new report could also help, Kruger said. By bringing the mortality difference to public attention, ""people would have a better idea of what is happening and might pay more attention to men's health issues,"" he said.  If male death rates could somehow be reduced to those of women, ""one third of all male deaths under age 50 would be eliminated,"" Kruger said."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Forbes   MONDAY, July 12 (HealthDayNews) -- Ever feel like your heart is racing or beating erratically? The culprit could be an underlying sleep problem.   A new study adds to increasing evidence linking atrial fibrillation with sleep apnea. People diagnosed with the abnormal heart rhythm were twice as likely to have the sleeping disorder as general heart patients, researchers report in the July 13 online issue of the journal Circulation.  While the study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, it does suggest that obstructive sleep apnea -- when breathing stops repeatedly during sleep -- predisposes people to the heart rhythm abnormality.   ""The bottom line is that if you have atrial fibrillation, at least consider the possibility that there may be underlying sleep apnea,"" said Dr. Virend K. Somers, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic's Division of Cardiovascular Diseases and a senior author of the study.   The study is believed to be the first to examine the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in people with sleep apnea. That information could have significant implications for screening and treating patients with atrial fibrillation.   Dr. Meir Kryger, a Canadian sleep disorders specialist and member of the board of directors of the National Sleep Foundation, said the findings suggest that cardiologists need to begin asking their patients about symptoms of sleep apnea. In addition, the study points to the need for greater collaboration between cardiologists and sleep specialists.   ""There are very, very few cardiologists around who are actually involved in sleep research,"" he said. ""Hopefully this trend is going to change.""  Cardiac arrhythmia, the term used to describe an abnormal heart rhythm, is the result of a change in the normal sequence of electrical impulses that stimulate the heart. In the case of atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, the upper chambers of the heart quiver instead of contracting. Since blood isn't pumped out completely, it can pool, leaving the risk of clotting.   The condition affects about 2 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association, but research suggests that the number will exceed 5 million by 2050.   Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissue at the back of the throat collapses and closes during sleep. People with this condition literally stop breathing, sometimes hundreds of times during the night for periods ranging from 10 seconds to more than one minute.   An estimated 18 million Americans may have sleep apnea, according to the National Sleep Foundation.   Both atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea share certain links with cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and coronary heart disease. Being male or obese also are risk factors for each condition, experts say.   ""What's interesting about [the study] is something that's been evolving in the last two to three years -- the notion that there's a huge link between cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea,"" said Kryger, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg and a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba.   The Mayo study involved 151 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and 312 general cardiology patients. People in each group completed questionnaires about their snoring, daytime sleepiness, body mass index, and hypertension to identify risk for sleep apnea.   Almost half of the atrial fibrillation patients were deemed to be at high risk for sleep apnea, compared with a third of general cardiology patients, or 49 percent vs. 32 percent.   The association of sleep apnea with heart arrhythmia was greater than the association of sleep apnea with its traditional risk factors, such as body mass index, neck circumference, and hypertension, the authors noted.   Overall, patients with atrial fibrillation were more than twice as likely as general heart patients to have sleep apnea.   Why the strong connection? When sleep apnea interrupts breathing, oxygen in the blood drops and carbon dioxide increases. The body's ""fight-or-flight"" response is activated. And the struggle to breathe may result in dramatic shifts in pressure across the heart chambers. These reactions, if left untreated over time, may predispose someone to atrial fibrillation, the authors suggest.   A Mayo Clinic study reported last year showed that the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation is doubled in people with untreated sleep apnea. The new study shows just how widespread sleep apnea is among patients with that heart arrhythmia.   ""I think the evidence that's coming out slowly from our lab and from other laboratories is beginning to sensitize people to this link,"" Somers said."

A romantic movie can boost progesterone levels by more than 10 percent, researchers at the University of Michigan report.   Researchers tested three separate groups of study subjects for hormonal levels before and after watching selected scenes from three different movies.   One group watched a romantic scene from “The Bridges of Madison County,” a second group watched portions of “The Godfather Part II’’ while a third group watched a documentary on the Amazon rainforest.   Men watching a violent scene from “Godfather Part II’’ had testosterone levels jump as much as 30 percent.   A romantic scene from “Bridges of Madison County” saw no change in the testosterone levels in women, however, men's testosterone levels fell.   The group watching a scene from the rainforest movie saw no change in hormonal levels.   “When you’re watching movies, your hormones are responding, not just your mind,’’ said Oliver Schultheiss, psychology professor at the University of Michigan. “If you want to learn about someone’s personality, look at their video collection or look at what’s on their bookshelves,"" added Schultheiss."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"BBC NEWS    Regularly eating soya-rich foods cuts a woman's womb cancer risk, say experts.   A study of 1,700 women by the Shanghai Cancer Institute suggested the more soya they ate, the lower their chance of developing the cancer.   Soya contains isoflavones, plant-based chemicals that mimic the effects of oestrogen in the body, the research in the British Medical Journal says.   Having a diet rich in soya has previously been said to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.   It has also been suggested the chemical's oestrogen effects could be beneficial in fighting heart disease and cancer.   East-west divide   This latest research looked at 832 women from Shanghai aged 30 to 69 who had been diagnosed with womb, or endometrial, cancer between 1997 and 2001 and 846 healthy women of the same age group.   The researchers compared the women's soya food intake over five years, and took their measurements.   It was found that women with endometrial cancer ate less soya than healthy women.   The incidence of endometrial cancer in Asian countries is between a fifth and a third of that in Western countries.   The researchers say this could be because the consumption of soya-rich foods is significantly higher than in Western countries.   In this study, women's average intake of isoflavones from soya food was around 25 times that reported in Western countries.   Writing in the BMJ, the researchers, led by Professor Xiao Ou Shu, said: ""Dietary factors may play an important role in this international variation.   But they said some of their findings, including an indication that overweight women benefited the most from eating a lot of soya, required further investigation.   'No evidence of harm'   Dr Tim Key, at the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit in Oxford, told BBC News Online said the research added to previous studies suggesting soya lowered endometrial cancer risk.   ""The overall picture is that, for this cancer, the data appears to be reasonably consistent that there may be a reduction in risk.   ""But there is not sufficient data to suggest there really is an effect.   ""For breast cancer, the evidence is considerably less consistent.""   He said he would not advise women to increase soya intake in their diet. ""There is no evidence of harm, but the evidence of benefit is not conclusive.""   Dr Key said the biggest risk factor for womb cancer was being obese."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Medical News Today   Dietary niacin (vitamin B3 ) may protect against the development of Alzheimer's disease and the cognitive decline associated with ageing in older people, suggests research in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.  Rich sources of niacin include lean meat, fish, legumes, nuts, dairy products, enriched grains and cereals, and coffee and tea.  [Dietary niacin and the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease and of cognitive decline J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2004; 75: 1093-99]  The researchers base their findings on almost 4000 people aged 65 and older, who had no Alzheimer's disease. These participants completed a dietary questionnaire and were checked for any signs of decreasing mental agility (cognitive decline) three and six years after the start of the study.  At three years, a random sample of 815 people, who had not initially had Alzheimer's disease, were checked for clinical changes and their dietary niacin intake assessed by means of food frequency questionnaires.  Among this smaller group, 131 people were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. After adjusting the results for age, gender, race, educational levels, and the ApoE gene - all important risk factors for the disease - those with the lowest food intake of niacin (an average of 12.6 mg/day) were 80% more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease than those with the highest intake (22.4 mg/day).   An analysis of the larger group showed that the rate of cognitive decline among those with the highest niacin intake was almost half (44%) that of those with the lowest intake.   Niacin has been prescribed to older people to prevent confusional states, and severe deficiency causes pellagra, a condition characterised by dementia, diarrhoea, and dermatitis, but its role in Alzheimer's disease has not been thoroughly explored, say the authors.   Previous research has indicated that niacin has an important role in DNA synthesis and repair, neural cell signalling, and acts as a potent antioxidant in brain cells, they say."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"They're really the best kind of drunken injuries, aren't they? What's the fun in injuring yourself while drunk if you can remember it? Anyway, Saturday morning I woke up and noticed this:      It took some thinking, but I now believe I know how it occured. Sabrina's going away party was Friday night at Randa's. There was 151 present (it's like kryptonite!), as well as Cazadores (mmm...). I remember having two shots of tequila and two shots of windex, and eight or so beers  seems  like a realistic estimate, but I felt far drunker than that.   So Michele was hanging out close to the toilet, and I laid down in the bathroom and was talking to her. Randa came in to check on Michele and had to step over me, and warned me to close my eyes, as she was wearing a skirt. As a display of good faith, I moved my arm to cover my eyes, apparently at the same time as she was trying to step over me. Her heel caught my arm, and that is when I think the injury was inflicted.   In retrospect, I could probably think up a much better story involving shots, stiletto heels, and bodily injury—a better, sexier story.   I didn't intend to get that drunk, but rather to properly enjoy the excellent company. Once again, I learn that high-proof liquors are not to be trifled with.   I hadn't expected Sabrina's exit to have a big impact on me, since I made my own move away from Waco a year ago, but knowing that she was leaving made me sad. Part of it is that with her exit, most of my Waco life is gone for good. Another thing is that being around my good friends, it reminds me how far I still have to go with people here in Houston. Mainly, though, Sabrina, I'll miss being able to see you whenever I spend a weekend in Waco.   Things listened to in the car on the drive home:   Modest Mouse:  Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks  The Polyphonic Spree:  Together We're Heavy  Fountains of Wayne:  Welcome Interstate Managers  Belle & Sebastian:  Dear Catastrophe Waitress"
QCKJZB6,male,23,"After normal Saturday activites, I headed to the 1820 Binz St. party. Viraj, whom I haven't actually met, sent out an e-mail to the graduate student mailing list about his birthday party. I certainly had nothing better to do, and reasoned that, surely, if he had invited the entire graduat school, somebody I knew would be there. So, I grabbed the emergency six pack of shine and set out in search of the party.   It took a few passes, but I narrowed things down to the correct block. I thought perhaps I was looking for a house, but didn't see anything that seemed right. I did see a lot of people parking, walking, and carrying beer, so eventually I parked and followed the people to the courtyard of an apartment complex. Picture time:      I was, frankly, amazed. There were, at the peak, a good two hundred people in the courtyard of this complex (and a DJ). What truly impressed me was that they were able to get their neighbors on board with this. There were two kegs and an inflatable pool full of beer (to which I added my contribution). I was pleased to see some of the genetics crew there, and I renewed my acquaintance with the new first years. I ended up promising two people mix CDs (one was a Dashboard Confessional fan, so I thought that an introduction to Death Cab was in order; the other just wanted a mix, and all she gave me to work with in terms of her tastes was Dave Matthews, U2, and early nineties grunge). David W. and girlfriend/SCBMBer/girl-I-spilled-beer-on-at-the-retreat Tiffany were there. Tiffany shares my fondness for tequila (though I have not yet given her the introduction to my dear friend  urlLink Cazadores ), and had apparently been indulging in that habit. We went into an apartment to get shots. There were no clean shot glasses, so David asked me how much tequila (Cuervo) i wanted.   ""Three shots.""  I think that impressed him thoroughly. I guess he's never seen me chug liquor before. It's good to know I can still inspire my peers. Wanda, SCBMB administrator extraordinaire put in an appearance, which continues her strong campaign for coolest program administrator ever. The cops showed up about 1:00 and made us kill the music, but did little else to hassle us. It's nice to be of age. I also met a Brittish girl in line for the bathroom, and impressed her by a) identifying her as Brittish, b) understanding her when she said her name, c) confessing that I was probably attuned to the accent from spending part of my evening watching ""The Office"", and d) confessing that I had to watch it with subtitles. She was a geologist who worked for Exxon (again, I'm impressed that the party invites made it as far afield as they did), and seemed pretty cool, but I lost track of her after that.   The party started slowing down around 2:30 (a bit early for my tastes), so we gathered up a crew for Taco C. David W., thanks again for all your hard work trying to propagate the Taco C. habit.   Not a whole lot happened today. Stephanie made dinner and a birthday cake in honor of mine and Jennifers's birthdays, of which I partook. Then I headed over to Dan's for Six Feet Under (great episode this week), and then over to Lisa's to see the ring, spend a little time with her and Bryan, and enjoy some of Lisa's birthday cake.   All in all, a great weekend. Hell, it's been a great week."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Some of you may enjoy this video of  urlLink Segway Polo . There's some nice wipeouts.   I picked my car up from the Toyota place today, and everything's back to normal in that department. I think my lab computer's due to ship tomorrow, and hopefully I'll get it next week.   The new first-year graduate students (and medical students, and physician's assistants in training, etc.) are here this week for orientation. On the first day, they take a headshot of every one of the graduate students and then print up a pictoral roster so that you may identify your classmates. However, this is only distributed to the first-years, and perhaps some of the administrators and professors. I need a chance to look it over to see what's going on in terms of the ladies, and preferrably soon, but I'm trying to avoid looking (being?) desperate. Here are my options:   * Wait for our administrator, Wanda, to get her copy framed and posted on the wall in her office * Hope one of the new students rotate in our lab and then ask them to see the roster. This apparently happened to Graham last year, and may even be a time-honored tradition. Graham requested that if I did this that I scan it and send him a copy * Corner a first-year in a dark alley and mug them for their copy  It'd be nice to have access to this before we (I assume) have our annual back-to-school night of free beer at  urlLink Valhalla , the Rice graduate student pub.   Kennedy, a girl that Graham has been seeing, has decided that she wants to set me up with a friend of hers (Fiona?). Graham has never met this girl, Kennedy has seen me exactly three times, and she and I have had zero substantial conversations. Frankly, I'm a bit scared. I hadn't been planning on looking super-sexy tomorrow, either, but I guess that doesn't take a whole lot of extra effort.   It occurred to me that my camera phone should be playing a bigger role in providing blogging content. I'll try to get on that."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Earlier today, I gave Sabrina points for her impressive AP Biology recall abilities. That was a mistake. She deserved more.   That brings me to the ancient tradition of bestowing Ninja Points. Ninja Points can never be bought or sold, but may only be earned and bestowed. Whenever somebody says or does something sufficiently impressive, clever, funny, intelligent, insightful, or ballsy (or the female equivalent thereof)—something of blinding brilliance—you may bestow Ninja Points upon them. One is often enough, but some occasions may necessitate two, three, or in some cases, as many as five ninja points.   Ninja Points can be redeemed by using your special ninja abilities—hang from the ceiling, bounce off walls, move with blinding speed, disappear into the shadows, or even call upon mystical fire to smite your enemies.   Ninja Points: know them, bestow them, use them. Sabrina, I hereby honor you with two Ninja Points.   The lab is beginning to look like the day after Christmas. There are two new grad students in the lab (including me) and one new post doc. They've both gotten new computers and monitors, and my two beautiful hunks of aluminum ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ) are due to ship on Friday. We had an IBM ThinkPad show up today (for general lab use) along with an accompanying Sony 20"" LCD, and a PowerBook is on the way as well.   I'm experiencing the joys of debugging—I've got two scripts to analyze some data, and the results they produce are inconsistent, so I get to stare at two windows full of small text for hours on end, until I realize, in a flash of brilliance, ""Hey! There should be a semicolon there!"" Semicolons: the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.   I'm also working on this fall's upcoming qualifying exam. On September 1, I have to submit three one page abstracts of proposals for novel research, unrelated to the work I do in lab. My committee will pick one, and I will have until mid-October to turn it into a full NIH-style grant proposal, which I'll have to deffend orally, and then never think about again.   I guess it would make too much sense to, say, give me time to get an actual paper published which would advance my scientific career. Way too much sense."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Having but a few days ago signed a new lease on my apartment, it occurs to me that I should probably have a nifty name for it. Casa de Ward doesn't seem entirely appropriate, as it's not a house. The Ward Pad? Ward Central? The Ward Cave? Ward's Palace of Love? Ward's House of Pies? Let me know your thoughts on what to call it.   Also, Rebecca challenged me to come up with a name for her current car (Camry, '99, dark red, sedan, sun roof, leather). I've not got any ideas. Sabrina's been referring to it as Becca #3, as it's the third car she's had since turning 16—her accord lasted a couple of years before Dad totaled it, then her first Camry made it a year and half before she totaled it, and now she's on the new Camry. Suggestions?   I started things rolling on getting the car taken care of today. The auto glass place is supposed to call me shortly, once they've acquired the proper piece of glass. After that, we'll need to make a decision about car alarms (do they still sell those that will send a deadly electrical current coursing through the body of the car?), and then I can get the stereo and the plastics taken care of. Thankfully, I have a spare car for a couple of weeks, so now's the time to have the Camry Mark II out of commission.   I finally got all the pieces together for my new nifty wireless network/music system, and it works wonderfully. I'm currently rocking out with Fountains of Wayne, and whatever else my computer's random number generator deems appropriate. And, I've got two less long, ugly cords running the length of my apartment from my computer to the cable outlet and stereo. I can even control it the music from my phone. Sweet."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Here's an  urlLink article  (skim, don't read) on why cool cell phones, and the people who use them, will be the death of the consumer electronics industry. I've already ditched my old PDA in favor of using the address book and calendar in my phone, but it'll be a long time before a phone can rival my  urlLink iPod , my  urlLink GameBoy , or my  urlLink digital camera . Then again, I don't carry my GameBoy or my camera around very often.   I thought this  urlLink lego version of Spider-Man 2  was pretty cool.   Those of you who have blogs should set up an account with  urlLink FeedBurner  so that my newsreader can alert me when you update, and I can spend less time checking to see if you've updated. It supports both RSS and atom standards, which is nice (since I haven't found a free newsreader that supports atom, which is what all blogger offers). The news feed keeps track of when a web page is updated, and by running a newsreader program, you can keep an eye on which sites have new content. It's a great timesaver, and will improve the effeciency of my laziness.   As per my previous promise, here's the view out the closest window to my office:     MD Anderson is more or less in the center of the picture, then, to the right, is the University of Texas Health Science Center, and, on the far right, the tip of the Jewish wing of Baylor College of Medicine.   And, here's my desk:     On the far right is my 20 oz. plastic water glass, which I use to minimize the trips to the water cooler (a good fifty yards away). I'm averaging about four a day right now. In the center is the flat panel monitor I'm using until my ultra-cool flat panel monitor comes in. Further to the left are my iPod and headphones, and on the far left is our lab's server, which I could unplug if I wished to plunge the lab into chaos. I am Ward, fear me."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"First off, welcome, everyone, to my new weblog (or 'blog' as the kids are calling it these days). Shortly after Sabrina began her blog, she asked me why I didn't have my own.   ""Because I would be playing into the stereotypes. I'm already a computer guy; I can't have a blog too.""  Walking amongst the general public, it always saddens me to see people playing into stereotypes, whether they be ethnic, gender-specific, professional, social, and so forth, which is why I've pledged to fight some of the ones that apply toward me. Being an intelligent, technologically adept white male from Texas, people are going to make certain assumptions about me, and I like for them to be pleasantly surprised when it turns out they're wrong.   But, here we are. What could have brought us to this point? Well, Sabrina and co. have inspired me, and, at her request, I'm going to try this out. I expect to hear (preferably privately) if this not entertaining or interesting, because I'll either try to fix it, or, failing that, give up entirely.   Next thing you know, I'll be the fat, slovenly computer programmer with a pony tail; I'll be leave dirty dishes in my sink, throw out my candles, and refuse to talk about my feelings; I'll start following sports, become a Republican, and start listening to, oh, say, Incubus. Perhaps it should be techno. Choices, choices...  Now that I have explained myself, on to business. I'm going to take Sabrina's mission statement to heart and make my primary goal that of entertainment, though I'll probably be weak on occasion and throw in the occasional whining, soul searching, science, technology, or music post. Once again, constructive criticism is appreciated. Please don't be mean; I have surprisingly thin skin (looking at you David—already disappointed in me for doing this, proably—Win and Thomas). I'll continue to update my web page in the haphazard fashion in which I've always done it; this is to suplement it.   It needs a name. This (""Ward of the State"") is a temporary one (though it could become permanent). So, I'm taking suggestions. I like the idea of doing something that's a pun on Ward, though anything else will be considered as well. I'll try to post some real content next time."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"I always thought I had a fairly large music collection. It's around 250 or so; my iTunes library (which includes some things I don't have on CD) works out to about 17 days of continuous music. Assuming a cost of $13 per CD, that works out to a total expenditure of $3250. Here's a visual:      However, watching ""Six Feet Under"" at Dan's on Sunday night, I was once again awestruck with the majesty of his collection, whose size he approximated at ""about 4000"" (correction: Dan says 3000, which is still impressive). Now to be entirely fair, a significant portion of those are live shows that he's recorded and traded for, but that would still leave a thousand or so. It's most impressive when witnessed in person, but this should give you an idea:      Also on Sunday, I stopped by Sam's to pick up a new floor fan. I have problems with air distribution in my apartment; though there is one vent for every room, they are all fairly centrall located, and my living room has the largest space but only one vent. Additionally, the living room contains all of the heat producing electronics, and the worst offender, the iMac, happens to be located at one of the most distant points form the air vent. I have a celing fan, but it can only do so much. So, I got something similar to this (but with a short stand):      These things are amazing. Putting it near the cool part of my apartment and aiming it towards the hot, it manages to, on low power, keep my living room evenly cooled. I've even been able to bump the thermostat up a few degrees. Honestly, I think a small array of these could create a tornado or hurricane of horrible destructive force. You should all write your congresspersons to alert them of the potential danger to America's security. Or, better yet, armed with this knowledge, a select group of us could rule the world, James Bond villain-style. Think about it."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"So the new phone's here. First, pictures:     Side by side, the new phone and the old phone. That's the new one on the left and the old one on the right.     More comparison shots.     I call this one ""phone sex"".   So, cool things. First, it's a camera phone. The pictures are small and bad, but it's still hot. Second, it supports the new GSM band and so gets much better reception. Third, bigger screen. Fourth, it's not a flip phone. Fourth, it does polyphonic ring tones, so I can download, say, the theme to Zelda 2 in midi (thanks Bryan) and have it as my ring. And most importantly, it's got Bluetooth wireless and will sync with my calendar and address book on my computer.   It rocks.   The wireless card adapter is in Houston, but the USPS wouldn't deliver it without my signature. Never mind that every other service will just take it to the office. That's just too damn much to ask, apparently. I'll have to wait until I can pick it up tomorrow for hot wireless digital music action.   Wednesday night is Big Ass Beer Night at Little Woodrow's in the village—24 oz. beers for $1.75—and thus a traditional gathering time for many of us at BCM. I'll probably head that way in a little bit. Perhaps I'll have some more entertaining story to post as a result."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Saturday, once I caught up on sleep (1:00), and did the typical things I do on any given morning before leaving the house (bathe, cloth, etc.), I gathered up my laundry and went to my aunt and uncle's to do laundry. It's a good excuse to get some quality driving time in (very therapeutic), get away from my area of town for a bit, do some reading, and often times I get dinner out of the deal, too. We went to  urlLink this place . They've got their little microbrewery on site, and though I won't give it too much credit since it's a chain of microbreweries, I ordered the seven beer sampler (two ounces each, maybe?) along with my buffalo chicken pizza (disappointing—a bit weak on the hot sauce).   I came back to my place and had a choice between going bowling with Dan and co. (my concert-going friends) or going to see  The Bourne Supremacy  with Nathan and Melissa (of the Cellular and Molecular Biology program at school) and their friends. Since I was horribly sore from the dancing (maybe that'll discourage me next time), I opted for the choice that had me sitting on my ass for a couple of hours. The movie was thoroughly mediocre. I hand enjoyed the first one—though it was nothing special, it was entertaining enough—but the second one was just not particularly interesting or exciting.   I was supposed to catch up with Dan &c. at a bar afterwards, but he couldn't hear his cell phone, so I went over to Woodrow's to hang out with Will. He'd the door man there on Fridays and Saturdays, so it's pretty dependable that he's a) there and b) bored. I know the bartenders through him, and they're kind of cute, so it's not a bad way to kill an evening.   After they closed, we went for food. I had no idea that  urlLink La Tapatia  was open until all hours of the night, but it's really an exciting discovery. Bryan and Lisa recently introduced me to it recently; it's reasonably authentic, cheap, good, and they put these nifty little marinated carrots on the table with the chips and salsa. It reminds me of that place that's next door to IHOP in Waco. My quesadilla rocked, and there were leftovers for lunch today. The place was absolutely hopping at 3:00 AM when we were there.   I went to Dan's to watch Six Feet Under tonight, since my normal HBO source (Lisa) was unavailable. Win and Thom first turned me onto that, and though I think it's sort of been downhill since the third season began (currently in season four), I see glimpses of hope tht keep my watching (and sometimes driving half-way to Katy to see it). I'm currently doing my Wardlogging and enjoying the wonder that is Adult Swim. There's not a day that goes by when I don't say a prayer of thanks for ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" and ""Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law"".   Sorry about the relatively boring posts. I'll try to limit it to more entertaining stuff in the future, but I thought some background on my rockin' life here in Houston would give events some nice context. Until then, picture me dancing to make up for it. That should entertain you for a while."

2BXAKR7,male,16,"Tetsusaiga: ""Iron-Pulverising Fang""!     Watched 12 episodes of Inuyasha this morning (woke up at 6:30am for some reason), and so far, I liked the 4 episodes where Inuyasha gets Tetsusaiga the most. I've seen most of the 12 episodes in english, and when compared, they seem to match fairly well. There could've been a lot that they could've edited, but they didn't, so kudos to them. Oh, not to mention they left the OP and ED fairly intact.   Speaking of anime, anime society was ok... lotsa problems on the first day. Lotsa people too. Ana-sama was late around an hour, cause she just came back from an art trip. Then there were ""Technical difficulties"" which prevented us from watching anime at all ^^ so bascially we just chatted and sketched, which was cool, but still.    Ahh... the sun dispersed all the clouds in the sky... must be a sign ^^ ... to get to work...    Addendum: happy thxgiving people! ^^ jus finish watching up to eps 32 of Inuyasha, that's all i have on me. Boy, did I ever underestimate the interesting-ness of that series... it's actually pretty good.    ~Chronos"

Welll, I've reached about that much tonight, but I'm not satisfied yet. I plan on finishing 4 ^^;; And it's probably possible. Haven't shown my report card to my parents yet... all I know is that the all the yelling and lecturing will take up too much of my precious time, so I'll show it to them as late as possible, lol ^^;;   Anyways, felt like taking a break.. so now here I am... seems like it'll be a pretty rushed rush to the end. ah well, i look forward to it *grins* the only thing I'm worried about is that my parents might transfer me back ... that would really suck. Sooooo... back to work for me.    ~Chronos"
2BXAKR7,male,16,"Anyway, back to the story: so yah, the experience left me less shy and more open. I met up with a lot of old friends, and found things are not what they used to be (stupid of me to think that it might - too much changes in one year). lol, I remember attaching myself to Keane for the first two months of school... and getting lost very often. Then there was confusion about tests and test centre, units and unit submission, day zeros (I spent my first Day 0 hallwalking because I had no idea what to do), and Focus (which I joined without taking the test - keane dragged me to see Mr.Church, the then-Focus teacher). I eventually met and got to know Joe and Hoshi throughout the year - among a bunch of other friends.   By the time I got adjusted to everything, I was quite behind in units. *sigh* I remember saying to myself that I won't fall behind to start with... but I did. And it got worse. On the bright side, I joined CSUNA for the 3 rd  year in a row, and actually got up and spoke some stuff. Best year ever... I plan to join next year. (CSUNA = model UN). Also, I joined the Anime Society, and was kinda... taken aback... at how late it ended ^^;; We watched Cowboy Bebop the movie - personally, I feel that Cowboy Bebop's plot and stuff goes too slowly... I heard that usually they start off with Akira. Glad they didn't, as I already saw that (and was left very, very confused).   Hope I haven't bore you all t'death yet ^^;;   ~Chronos"

2BXAKR7,male,16,"European Handball Wrap-up     Well, it's been an amusing time... today, we lost the championship match for our conference. There were a few things that were not right about that game tho...: the team we were facing subbed in 3 good players from other teams; Dever does not know how to count; the winning shot was made on a travel. Other than that, it was like our other games, except with better passing than usual: Javiar gets the tip-offs, pass to hanson, score; or try to score.    I have no problem with hanson being a ball hog; he makes good shots. But when he's swarmed 3 to 1... it really couldn't kill to pass it to an open Kevin or Javiar... not to mention he went against our strategy of slowing things down when we're ahead... eh... oh well. All in all, i'd say we deserved that OT win... in fact... if it wasn't for those above points, we'd won it w/o going into OT, like we did last time (we played during regular season, and beat them by one)   Anyhow, there are two more games of 3-ball (Conor's team vs Fadi's team, and the All-star game), then onto other intramurals, presumbably 4 v 4 volleyball. Dunno if i should join... maybe if people want me to...    Eh... i will be dropping casual remarks about this in my article on 3-ball.. lol, it'll be something to toss my frustration against. I wouldn't be so frustrated if the team we were facing wasn't (a) unable to win without outside help, (b) trash-talking, cocky 10ers.    Besides that, life's been fairly good... thx to keane, renae and von for coming out to watch ^^ it's greatly appreciated... u really didn't need to sacrifice a practise for that... thx again   ~Chronos"

4B1R1S1,female,16,"i remember waking up at 6.45am to go to school. my primary school is just opposite where i stay, so it's pretty convenient. the familiar surrounding make me feel comfortable. i still remember the dark alleys, the music room, the hall.. my classroom... the field, the teacher's room.. the general office, the basketball field, the canteen... the whole school! my batch was the last batch of students to leave the the school... before it merged with Clementi Town Primary. Soon... most of the original staff transferred, and most of the teachers of the new school is from Clementi Town Pri. i miss the school, the teachers, the fond memories the 19 yr old building brought to me.   When news of the merging surfaced, i was shocked but also relieved that i was the last batch.. so dun need to change the Uniform.(Clementi North Merged with Jin Shan Primary B4)(Jin Shan pri was originally situated at the Now Nan Hua Pri). It's just like killing a teenager. Clementi North was only 15 yrs old! How cld they close the school down?!  The school brought to me many fond memories... It also gave me opportunities to go overseas, tho i wasn't the elite students. i went overseas not once.. but TWICE! how lucky can i get? i remember after recess, my frens and i would head to the field and spend the rest of the break time there playing. we played croc, balancing act.. all the childish stuff. The guys would play soccer or basketball.. Oh! did i mention the canteen food!? Geez! it's very delicious! i miss it sooo much! We'll eat ""gan mian"" with loads of chilli & tomato ketchup.. Oh the drinks were very cheap too! u know how much? 20 cents only! and it's the size of those plastic cups u see in coffeeshops! Oh how i miss it...  I remember in primary 3, sitting with Zhimin and Grace, i sneaked food up to class to eat. it was the cuttlefish i remember really clearly.. hehe. That was sooo fun! Primary 5 was the best year i've ever had. i would play and laugh right in front of the teacher with my then-pals. But my results fluctuate. so p6 had to go to the 2nd class... wasted right? but nvm.. i'm having fun here in kent ridge..  haiz.. how i wish Methodist Girls' would allow alums to go back to the school to reminiscence.. how i wish.. i wish i wish.. i MISS U CLEMENTI NORTH!!!  *psst, i cut my hair by 3 inches! lol.

FJX5J38,male,17,"about a week or two ago, i started writing another song, but this time i had the persistence to finish it, complete with lyrics.  i dont have to tell you what its about...      Memories by Matt Wagner  1 They say your first love always hurts the most and now I know that isn't just a joke I knew a girl when i was 15 years or so she was the only love I'd ever known.  2 I met her at a concert on a hot sunny day we laughed and we talked and everything was ok When the stars came out I would hold her tight and we'd rock and we'd sway for the rest of the night  (chorus) Isn't it great to be loved by someone? Well, if you lost that someone just remember this song and the memories you shared with that person who cared but then something went wrong and you were lonely and scared  (music...)  3 We used to sneak out and we'd stare at the sky to see if any shootin stars would fly by. It's memories like those that I'll never forget, I wish I could go back to the day we first met  4 (slower) I saw you with him the other day and I tried but I couldn't keep the tears from my face I hope that he's the best in the world because your still my favorite girl  (chorus) Isn't it great to be loved by someone? Well, I've lost that someone and I've written this song about the memories that I shared with that person who cared but then something went wrong and my hearts lonely and scared  (music...end)"

FJX5J38,male,17,"mmm. doesnt the title of this one just make you hungry? rancid pig blood smells something like vomit you could say.  i had to scrub pig blood off of the floor of the garage today.  it was stuck on like glue, and we need a new sponge now because i had to scrub the floor so hard. yeah my dads just been pissin me off lately with all of this work he has been throwing on me.  im considering not doing any of it if he takes the computer keyboard away, because theres nothing he can ground me from after that.  i might just go take a bus to my old town or something and live there for a while. anyways im going to wait for my dad to call and have an arguement with him, then go clean the garage some more. hope you are all having a fine day today."
FJX5J38,male,17,"yeah this sounds retarded, but i am starting to wonder if there is any way to go back in time.. maybe re-live an experience through a dream?.. maybe ill try tonight. and fail. and laugh at myself. i was thinkin about it because i wanted to go back in time to that time.. ya know.. with her.  wish i could stop thinkin of her.  shitty deal. ah well, if i care so much about other people, i guess i should be happy... i wonder what it will be like hanging out with her again.  i hope its the same as.. well the first half of last time.  i had more fun than i can remember. espresso is fun.  today is brett pembertons birthday. he still has my sweatshirt. grr.. ah well ill get it eventually.  see ya people"

I also have a big mouth...  My dilemna: should I play SC or Star Wars: KOTOR?  That's about all my life has to offer, here's a song that has ALOT of meaning :P  Jesus Walks (remix) - Kanye West and Mase   (Verse One - Kanye West)   Between the girls in the jury   The devil tryin’ lure me, fury me   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me   My Pastors shakin’ his head, He ain’t sure of me, but surely   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me,   They asked, do you say your prayersAt least two a week?   I ain’t talking to god,I know what I’ve been doin’ G   Do you know how I be embarrassed?   My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents    And I ain’t good, at that ""give us this day""   The slaves is trying to give us this free,   I’m trying to give us this pay   Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was   We was all ‘ghetto fabulous’ All at the rooms in the Cyberus   From this Jacuzzi water, Can you cleanse us?   Can you please unfold my Cardiare Lenses?    God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses   For me I almost died, Falling asleep in the Benz   It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized   And when I play it at my show I feel sanctified    And he gives me direction when I can’t decide   He is alive   How can you tell me that he ain’t, When I said,       -Jesus Walks-(Kanye) God show me the way, now the devil can’t break me down   -Jesus walks with me- (Kanye) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now   -I want Jesus-(Kanye) And now I think there is something that I can say now that’ll right my wrongs   -Jesus walks with me-(Kanye) I finally talked to God, I ain’t afraid ‘cuz his love is so strong      (Verse 2 - Mase)   Come on, Come on, Before you take my name   Take my fame   Why you had to take my shame?

On top of that my back is sore, I haven't had as much time as usual for sc and now I have nothing interesting to write about im my blog.  Well... maybe not everything has changed >.  Hmm, I haven't played ball in almost a week.  I think I'll go before work at 4:oo today.  I wanted to go yesterday but I feel asleep on my bed after I decided to lay there for a sec.  LOL, I was awoken by my pool of drool.  Here's my song recommendation for the day:  Carl Thomas - My First Love   verse 1   Back in highschool,   I knew a girl like you,   She was heaven sent,   All the time we spend,   You kinda look like her,    I remember the way we were   Cause we were all in love,    I'm feeling you because...      chorus   You're 5.2, Brown eyes,   I don't know what to say,    You make me feel that way,   It seems like I'm dreaming,    I can't believe myself,   I found somebody else   You remind me of a girl that was my first love   I can't let you go   You're so sure like my first love      verse 2   Now I'm not letting go,   I think you need to know,   I'm not mad at you,    I've been through this before,   She got away somehow,    But that won't happen now,   No never again,   I finally found a friend...      chorus You're 5.2, Brown eyes, I don't know what to say, You make me feel that way, It seems like I'm dreaming, I can't believe myself, I found somebody else You remind me of a girl that was my first love I can't let you go You're so sure like my first love      bridge    I've been dreaming   Of someone like you   I had to pinch myself    Just to see if it's true   This is crazy   Just like deja-vu   I feel like I know you   This dream is so beautiful      chorus   You remind me of a girl that was my first love   I can't let you go    You're so sure like my first love (repeat 4x)     hehe... 5'2"" brown eyes..."
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Wow, it's cold in here. And I gotta do some laundry... but first ima procrascinate by doing this post.  Saturday: I was scheduled for 9-4:30, I woke up at 8:55 so I was late as usual. Got to work and did some work... our manager is gone for vacation so we got some lady as a sub... iunno, I just don't like her too much. Thankfully work went by pretty fast that day. Afterwards, even tho I was tired from all the work I've been doing lately, I went outside to run some ball. Wooo.... my shot is WET. Like honestly... I've never been so confident in my shot in my life. I played my friend 1on1, and the whole time he just didn't understand. Well, I'm a big guy so I'm known mostly for my post play, so when I was draining my shots he couldn't figure it out. There were 4 of us there so we ran some 2on2 after. They were pretty fair teams, tho my teammate had a very hard time stopping his man. My shot continued then too. We won the first game and lost the next like 3. But the real fun part was standing in the fountain... hehe... good times.  Sunday: Ran some sc in the morn then took my shower and went out wit the family. We dropped off some movie at Blockbuster then we went to the National Sports across the street from there in Pickering at my request. When I told them I wanted to go I thought they still had mad shoes like before... now all they got is some bootleg ""SLAM"" basketball shoe. I did find a good deal on some Nike hoodies... $29.99. Not bad considering in the winter they go for about $80. I also bought a ball shirt. It's made out of that shiny material that causes liquids to like slide off, Durasheen or something. That was also on sale for $19.99. So I did the math and calculated $57.49 after taxes so I bust out $60 in my hand while the cashier was ringing it through. Then she asked for $46... and was like ""huh?"", don't worry, I wasn't complaining. I also noticed she had a PUSH braclet on her left wrist... did she hook me up cuz of that?? ... hahaha... prolly just an honest mistake that I took advantage of. Afterwards it was time for some DQ. Mmmmm... I got the large brownie batter blizzard. It was so chocolatey, like I'm sure they just took some vanilla ice cream and added alota brownie batter in it and mixed it up. Then again that's what their ad said... When we left my parents decided to take us to a movie ^_^. It was kinda a struggle when we were brainstorming movies to see on the way cuz b/w me and my bro we had seen 4 relatively new releases, but when we checked the movie listings at Morningside we decided to see the Bourne Supremacy. We were 2 hrs early so my parents and little bro went to the nearby Wal-Mart while my older bro and I stayed in the arcade. At first we ran some Time Crisis 2 (ya the old one t.t) but it was pretty good. Then we started taking turns playing this basketball shooting thing. Argh!! It got me so mad cuz the ceiling is so low. Like I'm kinda tall and when I shoot I put alota arc in my shot, so alota the time when I shot it hit the ceiling. I had the record first wit 23 then 29. But my bro broke it wit 33. You get bonus time after u hit 30 so the key was getting there first. He ran outta money but I kept on going to beat him. But I swear that game cheats... like I even pointed out to my bro when it wouldn't count my baskets. Eventually I crushed his rec wit a 38 and retired as champ... that was after $20 in tokens... LOL! Finally we went to wait outside the theatre. There was a movie still playing there, something about ""Thunderbirds"", so we waited outside. As people started waiting with us, one of the Deli ppl from my store arrived and said hi, then a few mins later a guy I know from grocery came by for the same movie too. The movie was pretty good - 3.5/5. Alota killing and intense chases... always good. Iunno, I think I kinda expected a little more... Well after that we went to the Swiss Chalet across the street. It was so empty inside I thought they were closed! When we finally got served I figured why cuz the service sucked. It was a decent meal and I paid for most of it. But we're not going back there again.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well know I guess I gotta address certain ppl...  Will, I commented ur blog so check that. We still are friends...  Matt, I do care that your back, despite still not saying anything to you. I'm sure that Will or Ada filled you in why not. You and Ada both had a countdown here (check earlier posts) but I ended both of them when I found out. You were the one who I felt I could talk to the easiest about what was happening, but you didn't tell me either... I guess at Ada's request. Even tho she is ur best friend, I still don't hold you any less accountable than the other two. I may not be your best friend, but if you were willing to call me a friend at all then I believe that I deserved to know. Don't worry, I'm not gonna be a jerk and start telling ppl the things you've told me, tho the thought has crossed my mind a few times. But as far as I'm concerned, everything that happened since I told Ada how I felt to now was all an act you put on... Trust is a dangerous thing.  But you still have the title of ""friend"" in my books if that's what ur wondering.  Yet it seems you got the worse of it.  I forgave Ada alot easier than I thought I would (stupid weak heart) and Will and I spoke once in person before he told me and that was when we say I, Robot.  But you I trusted the most...  Now I wonder, did Ada ask you guys to come cuz she was afraid I was gonna pull something?  At first I thought it was just cuz u both wanted to see her that last nite before she left, but now I think there were other reasons too... I ask this her rather than in private because I'm sure I woulda eventually asked all 3 of you, so I guess u guys can collaborate this one too now...  Hmm... now I'm thinking about alota things.  This post was supposed to end after my address to Matt but here I am still...  Ada... I still think about you every spare moment I have, but now its different things.  I have no idea what's going on between u and Will lately, and I can't even imagine what's been troubling you lately.  Alota the time I keep things inside cuz I don't wanna put any extra pressure on you... tho I guess from me posting here I'm doing it anyways (it is MY diary after all :P).  Sometimes I wonder... why did I forgive you so easily?  Why do I still try when you already told me that you weren't going to pursue romance anymore?  What do I expect to happen in the future?  Is there REALLY any space for me in ur busy, busy life?  What can I do that Matt and Will can't?  Am I making thing worse by wedging myself into your life?  What do you really feel for me?  ...then finally... if I was given a chance wit someone else, would I move on?...  I know that you've got more important things on your mind, so don't ponder these questions... in fact, knowing that your prolly gonna read this makes me wanna delete it, but I won't... don't bother with any of this till ur life is a little more stable.  As usual... I'm willing to wait as long as you need  It's funny how starting to write can set you off on other topics..."
KDGGEE4,male,17,"It's been less than a day since i lost blogged.  I usually dont do write this often, but this morning was to much for me to hold in.  Everything was going just how i imagined it before this morning.  I felt as tho i was in complete control.  I was an ocean liner taking a cruize of the Caribbean... everythings going good.  How wrong i was.  What seemed like an ocean liner was really me drifting in my dinghy.  Small and fragile, where the smallest gust of wind could top me over.  Well today, i hit more than a gust of wind, i hit a storm.  I was just cruizing along, having a friendly convo.  This person wouldnt believe me about something i said, so i reinforced it with the best example i could use, not even considering the possibilites or the consequences.  Well the last thing that i could've expected to happen happened, creating a storm of emotions.  No details here, but i simply could not find the words to say.  Did i stop? No.... i asked another question, and got the only fitting answer to finish the convo.  At this point, it was too much, I had to leave, I had to run away... even if it was just for a moment. So i signed off and went upstairs throwing myself and other things around my room, trying desperately to cope... finally i just sat on my bed, back to the wall, and put my head down.  I was so lonely, i needed some1 around me, so i called up my friend and we went to MickeyDs. I called him up half way to his house, he lives on the way so it only makes sense i pick him up.  As i saw him, i put on a fake smile and acted like everything was ok.  I wanted to tell him everything, but i was happy enough just having some1 to talk to about anything.  When we got there, we were about to order breakfast, but while we were thinking they changed to their lunch/dinner stuff.  We were both to shy to order now, so we ended up just sitting in MickeyDs just chilling, talking to some1 else who works there.  LOL, one of the employees tried to sell us a coupon, it was good too, i woulda bought it if i had money.  Big Mac combo for $3!!! Anyways, we left, went to Mr. Sub next door to get some healthier food.  My friend ask for my recommendation, i said Louisiana Chicken.  We both got one, and i got an assorted for my mom (i knew she'd be mad if i didnt get her anything).  On the way back, i asked a simple question, something to help me out.  Sadly, he gave me the exact opposite of what i was thinking.  All that did was make me 2nd guess my morals and values.  On the other hand, the food was good.  Finally, i got home.  I wanted to talk to that friend, but he/she was gone.  It's funny, i ran away before, and all i wanted to do was talk to this person now.  O well, that email will have to do.  On the bright side, something tells me that it might not be as hard as i thought... if all goes well.  Yes, u cant tell through this very unspecific blog, but it was a storm.  Although it didnt seem like it at the time, going through the storm was all worth it... getting thrown around barely surviving in my dinghy was worth it, to see that beautiful sunset in the end..."

Eventually I woulda given up this ""grudge"" and tried to get it how it was before. I said you had the worst of it rite now, Matt, cuz I hadn't heard the apology yet and I was still mad. I was eventually gonna say it was ok, and that I understood ur situation.  But u called me a jerk...  So who wants to be friends wit a jerk? I'm not sure if I would want to. I didn't think any of u were jerks for doing what u did cuz I assumed it was cuz you didn't wanna hurt me. But apparently I'm a jerk. Fine... so be it. Matt, I'm a jerk for being upset that someone I trusted didn't tell me what was going on. I'm a jerk cuz I didn't talk to you for a few days. I'm a jerk cuz u msged me on msn and I didn't respond cuz I was on sc (notice the status). I didn't wanna end these friendships, but if I'm the jerk... then you won't have to speak to jerks anymore.  I'm not into getting in between friends either. So Will, Ada, you don't have to choose between friends, I'll decide for you. Will, I will miss you when you go to school in September. Ada, I will always love you.  There, now it's over..."

KDGGEE4,male,17,"Here's SOME of the lyrics from my current fav song: Hope - Twista ft. Cee-lo I'd like to dedicate this song to my #1 fan Martha... ALWAYS KEEP THE FAITH!!!   ""And I Wish God never gave the men power  To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)  Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,  When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh  We will never break, don't underestimate, we shall motivate,  And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.  Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,  The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.  Sit at the light so long,  And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,  So when right go wrong,  Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!  Let's HOPE!  Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,  I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,  We can make it always so optimistic,  If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,  I pray for justice when we go to court,  Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,  Why can't we kick it and just get em on,  And in the famous words of Mr. King 'Why can't we all just get along',  Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I  Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I  Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,  And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,  You can be wrong if it's you doubting,  With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,  And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,  Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!  And let's HOPE    [CHORUS] Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,  Take this music and use it  Let it take you away,  And be hopeful (hopeful) and He'll make a way  I know it ain't easy but that's okay.  Let's be hopeful!""    Heres the shortened lyrics of my fav song to sing in the shower: I swear - All4One I'd like to dedicate this to that special girl who im APPARENTLY taking to her prom... :S (they say the chorus like 5 times, one at beginning, between the 2 verses and like 2 at the end so i put it once :D)   ""I see the questions in your eyes I know what's waiting on your mind You can be sure i know my part 'cause i stand beside you through the years You'll only cry those happy tears and though i make mistakes i'll never break your heart  I'll give you every thing i can I'll build your dreams with these two hands We'll hang some memories on the wall And when (and when) just the two of us are there You won't have to ask if i still care 'cause as the time changes the page My love won't ever age at all  [Chorus] And i swear by the moon And the stars in the sky i'll be there I swear like the shadow that's by your side I'll be there for better or worse till death do us part I'll love you with every beat of my heart This i swear""   Wow, it's only be a week since i started this thing and im already falling behind!! Well, it's been a few days since u last heard from me, so heres what u missed:  Sunday Missed Church :( (its not my fault really)... Well, i woke up turned on the comp, played some sc... the rest is kinda fuzzy.  I also promised a very special girl that i'd take her to her prom as a last resort, and she said that i was her first and last resort... YEA RITE!!! i can picture the last part of it but the first... naw... Also, i spent a hectic nite sorting out my timetable, its not like high school where they do everything for u, u have to first decide what u wanna do in University, look at the requirements for that program, make sure u take all the prerequistes for the later courses, and sort out when u wanna take what... THEN after that u have to check the timetable to see when the different lectures and tutorials for each course is going on, and then pick the rite ones so that nothing conflicts... whew, it was WILD!! after an hour i got the fall session done, but the winter never seemed to work, i tried changing this lecture that practical... it didnt work!!! I thought i had to drop a course but then a divine ray of light enlightened me and it was all so clear ^.^  Monday: I woke up, played some sc, and decided to go wit a friend to Fairview Mall to run some MvC2 (Marvel vs. Capcom 2) the BEST FIGHTING GAME EVER!!! Wow, it seemed like the longest bus ride ever... what seemed like an eternity seemed to only take 50 mins... lol, i struggled when i got up to tell my friend who took the bus almost everyday to fairview to get off on front of the mall, only to find out that the 85 stops INSIDE the mall at Don Mills Station, hahaha, every1 was looking at me funny, now i know why... Well when we got there, we seen some nice sales going on at Champs, Athletes World and Foot Locker, everything 70% off!!! If i had money i woulda bought something, but i didnt.  LOL, im $500+ in debt rite now, dont worry why :P!  Anyways, we finally reached the arcade at the other end of the mall and seen the the competition was already there.  When we walked in, there was a lil kid who was using some cheap characters which are looked down upon in the arcades, and an azn guy using reg characters.  After the azn won, i put in my money and died in like 30 secs!! LOL, i even accidently picked a cheap character and still got owned!! Well, after me the guy got to i think 9 wins total before my friend finally beat him and left.  Then i put my money in and owned my friend a few times, after we realised that the side my friend won on is kinda broken... the low block (which is key) wasnt working too well.  Anyways, i beat the lil kid and my friend a few times, then i gave my friend $.50 and let him beat me cuz i wanted to see him do something which he never did >. On the bus ride home my friend invited me to run some more MvC2 at his house... we were both hooked so i said yes.  On the way i bought some fattening goodness at the local MickeyD's and ate it at his house.  We got there at about 7-7:30... and we played till past 11!!!! But then my mom called and was pissed cuz it was ""late"" so i had to go home :(  Today: Woke up, sc/msn, some ppl came and interrupted my fun to test the fire alarms :@ who needs fire alarms anyways??!! lol, jks.  I made plans wit a friend to go to open gym at my FORMER high school (man it feels good to say that) but then realised that it's closed and decided to play ball on turf.  When stepped on the court there were like 5 kids like hitting pine cones wit a baseball bat :|, not cool, i hoped there would be some competition but there wasn't, so i started working on my game: pull-up jumpers, post game, some left-handed layups.  It was mostly pull-ups cuz thats my weakness :(.  Got home, more msn, shower and here i am... Man im hungry but my mom left again, theres leftover from lunch but... meh...  PS. Matt, we gotta chill sometime, i'd email u or comment ur log but i cant :( call/email me sometime..."
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Yesterday, I FINALLY GOT MY GRAD RING!!! now i just need $500 to pay my parents back for it and im good.  Let's see, yesterday was fun.  After gettin my grad ring, i went wit my parents to see our future house. (we move in sept, i'll miss u paradice)  It's finally starting to look like a home, we have walls and that pink insulation thingy.  I saw my future room, looks kinda small but im sure it'll seem huge when i move in and i stop sharing a room wit my annoying little bro.  Im confident that i'll do more homework next year than this year just cuz i'll have a REAL study space now... this year i did all my homework on my bed >.  After that it was off to youth group where i joined in fellowship with my beloved BASICs... (thx for making me come Martha) It was the first wednesday for about 2 years that i went to, and alota things have changed.  They actually have all the songs in powerpoint or something and Scotty and Hans led the worship.  But the real fun part was spending time wit Matt, Martha and Ada afterwards when we were SUPPOSED to be helping Ada wit her letter... but me and Matt just talked about our video games... (sorry...).  Well, it was mostly me talking to Matt, SOMEONE who invited me didnt say a word to me... :P Afterwards, Mike said that i could get a ride wit help, and i reluctantly accepted.  What i didnt know is that their ride as already full and that he offered me the ride out of the goodness of his heart... had i known that i would've called my parents or taken the bus... but anyways, Me, scott, hans, brent, jordan, mike, trish, devon, luke (?), and the driver Pastor McNeil all fit into one van.  Devon had to sit on the floor and the whole time i kept on thinking that i took her seat and felt really guilty.  But finally i got home, ate something, talked to ppl on msn and went to sleep.  I woke up this morning and did the usual, turned on the comp.  I signed into msn and saw Jessica online.  After exchanging some words, we discovered that we shared a few friends: Will and Ada from ETCBC!!! What a small world!!! Anyways, she promised that she would come wit me sometime to something... funny cuz ppl make me promise them the same thing... It's always good to find out that there are more believers out there than u thought.  Tho i wish i found out earlier :(  I also had to select courses for UTSC today.  And after alot of confusion and research, i discovered that my university plan was ruined cuz they didnt offer an important course to me until spring session ( 1st term: Bio, chem, calc, comp sci, and linguistics 2nd term: more bio, more chem, more calc, more comp sci, and algebra :D  Today is also the first time that many of my friends are reaching ball at paradice... so far its me, simey, caspy, koo, janis, AP, and nick.  Sadly, i'll have to leave the court earlier than i would have liked to cuz i gotta go to work.  I have also discovered that my manager is closing tonite >.  ps. Anyone know good Rap/R&B songs? my list is straining :("
KDGGEE4,male,17,"It's only been 2 days since school officially ended, and the searing pain of losing my friends has already set in... so i dedicate this post to everyone who helped me along the way...  ps. theres alota stuff to particular ppl so u prolly only wanna read what applies to u :D  Gillian: whenever i needed someone to listen to my ramblings, u were always there.

U were the main reason y i had so much fun. I'm sorry for: being a bad dancer, for not talking, for ruining ur corsage, for leaving u at britts...  Dont ever forget our song!!  To my BASICs:  Thank you everyone at Forward for keeping me straight.  Matt, Ada, Martha, thank you for bugging me to come to church, if it wasnt for u i dont know how i woulda ended up.  Sorry for not coming to church as often as i coulda, but plz dont ever give up on me.  SnoCamp was a blast every year (3on3 champs!!) and so was anything else we did together... Next year I'll be in C&C, but ima still try to come wit u guys to snocamp, i got a championship to defend!! Although im prolly only third string: if u ever need a friend i'll always be here.  To scott: thx for all those rides to church, u dont know how much they meant to me... one day u can pay me back for the beatings.

Grads of 2004: I'll miss each and everyone of U!!! -.-"
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Today was ok, but since this is only based on one day theres not much content here. :(  Wait... maybe thats good for those of you who read this but regret it half way through the long posts...   I woke up at 6.  Yes!!! 6!!!  I got up at 5:45ish to get a drink and couldnt sleep after that.  I then proceeded downstairs and did my usual morning thing.  I then played some more of the WC3 campaign.  Afterwards I took a shower and got dressed to go to the pickering flea market.  The flea market was exactly how I imagined.  A huge open place wit hundreds of lil booths.  I hadn't gone there before so I was kinda excited.  I had $200 in my pocket and I was ready to spend all of it!  Well I started off the day very shy, afraid to ask any questions.  But as I went from clothing booth to booth I got more into things.  Asking the price of this and what they have in that size.  Well, to keep a long story short, I left wit a pair of lite blue jean shorts, some dark blue RocaWear jeans, and a black and white ""name brand"" tee.  I use the quotations cuz they have a name on the front but expert analysists (my friends) tell me that the tees are bootleg... hahaha, o well, i got some great prices.  Usually a nice pair of jeans are at least $80.  I payed $60 for the jeans and a white tee.  And the shorts look very boot, but for $25 how can u go wrong?  I payed approx. $25 in tees, nice ones wit decent designs.  Reg tees that size usually go for 2 for $30.  Did I get a good deal?.... I like to think so.   Afterwards my friend came over and we ran some INTENSE MvC2.  He usually owns me but I had the xbox advantage.  To keep this short we played for like 4+ hrs and at the end I was prolly up 8 games or so.  If we did this at the arcade we woulda spent at least $10 on quarters.  He's used to the dreamcast controllers while I love the xbox.  The only diff besides the size and shape is that xbox has 2 xtra buttons that serve as PP and KK.  This is key for dashing in linxing out supers.  He didnt take advatange of this and strained to get supers sometimes while I cant play w/o it and abused it to my heart's content.  But anywhere besides xbox means me getting fooded.  After he got strained in WC3 we finally reached the courts.   When we got there, some guys were getting ready to play hockey where the net wit the mesh is so we played on another one.  We ran a rematch of around the world and he took 1 and I took 2.  Then I shot around and watched another game going on as my friend talked to a girl (I'm sure) on the phone.  After, that we ran 1v1.  The first game was on the same net we started on.  He won and then we moved to the mesh net.  Then he beat me 2 more times before we called it a day.   After a short chat I took a shower and here I am... my fam ate out again w/o me and I'm hungry...  On a side note, my posts lately seem to have been bothering my only fan left, so lemme explain a few things.  Here's the main thing:  ""I knew that if I ever ""loved"" someone who ""loved"" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit...""  No, she didn't confess love...  ""I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they  might  take it.""  Might is the keyword, she seemed like she might... that means 0.01% chance... which is more than I ever had.  Anyways, see ya later... all 1 of you who MIGHT read this...  Warren   [10/7/11]"

V7LSQIP,male,15,"The world is dark, everything is black and white. The people have no color, the lights are gone. I see pictures of you and I smile, for they are in color. I think of you and me, so happy, you deep in my arms and we're happy because we are perfect for eachother. But one day, it crashed and ever since the world lost its color. Why did I have to say what I said and do what I did? Do you know that I'm sorry? Do you know that when I look at your picture, I cry? You know this but you pretend not to care and I know you're mad and life without you is dull and gray. I continue walking down the street and briefly glance into a cafe and the world becomes bright again. The sky becomes blue, the lights flash and the people are happy. My heart restarts as I gaze at the back of your head as you pay for coffee at the counter. I touch the window and as I do, you turn around and once again, color fades from the world again. Alas, it it not you. I feel cheated because the slightest glance at your face would allow my emotions to return. I walk back to my place, opent the door and see you sitting on my couch. I now it's you but there is still no color. What are you doing here? I ask. Because we need to talk, you say. I sit, you sit, we all fall down. I'm sorry for what I did and there are millions of things I want to know, but the words evade me. You see, whether you know it or not, you're the one who keeps me going. I look in the mirror in the morning ans ask ""Why?"", but I see your reflection, much brighter than mine, behind me. You are the physical answer to my question. When I'm driving on a bridge, I think, ""Why not?"", and I see your picture on my dashboard and the light pours out of my car and you once again answer my question. Remember when we first met and I told you that I could read your eyes? You thought I was kidding until I did and you were nervous because everything I said about you was true. When we talked, you were timid and I was not and when and when I said something funny you let out a nervous giggle. When you did something you thought was stupid, I brought you back up by saying it was cute and you giggled again but I was serious. Remember how you said guys didn't like you because you thought your glasses were dumb? I told you there weren't and that your eyes were perfect and your glasses only made you prettier. You thought I was being sarcastic but when I leaned over and kissed you, everything in the world was perfect. There was no pain, no war, no      , no hunger. All was full of love and you knew it and I knew it. There was that one time when I said I didn't deserve you , do you remember that? I said I was afraid that you really didn't care about meand you were just friends with me to be nice. You then said that every moment with me was worth it and you leaned over and kissed me and I knew that I would never love a person more than I loved you as long as       ran through my veins. But all of that changed, do you remember what I said to make you so mad? So mad as to walk out on me? I don't remember and I'm glad I don't because I don't ever want to repeat it. You see the sorrow and Pain in my eyes and you begin to cry. You had your doubts, who wouldnt? But the moment you looked into my eyes, you finally realized that nobody feels the same way about you but me. You saved me, made me a better person, the person I truly am. You say you're sorry, too and I begin to cry as well. Crying, we embrace and as we do, the sky turns blue, the lights turn back on and life returns to our faces. The roads we walk stray and become difficult to traverse. We will fight, we will quarrel together, but you know and I know that we are srtonger than that. Do you know why? Because what doesn'y kill you only makes you stronger."

I have got to be one of the biggest idiots this side of the Mississippi (which is funny, because before I came here I was the biggest idiot on the other side of the Mississippi). Does it make sense to anyone else that he cares about me, but he's going to fuck this other chick? Because I'm not seeing it. How can you claim to care about a person, then tell them you're going to have a meaningless relationship with someone else, know that person A sees you and the ""meaningless"" chick around, and expect them to want to continue a relationship with you when they're able to? Am I wrong for feeling slighted in this? I just want to feel okay, you know? And not feel like I'll never be good enough for the guys that I really like. Because that's how it seems so far.

I need to learn how to be more patient.  I don't like how things just seem to meander along.  I'm not a meandering kind of person.  I want everything, and I want it now.  And, I'm not used to sitting and waiting for things.  In the past, if I've wanted it, I go out and get it for myself.  I can't do that now.  But, I can't make myself not want it, either.  And, I'm sexually frustrated.  It's only been a week, I know, but when you're having that much REALLY GOOD sex, you kind of begin to crave it.  I think it's possible that I'll be headed into another dry spell.  Yea!!!  I wish I were back home, and I wish Justin were around.  Then I would have a backup plan.  Now I'm all alone at Ft.

I know that all it will lead to is major heartbreak, so I'm making a pre-emptive decision to use him solely for sex.  Not such a bad thing, right?  I really don't know what I think I'm doing, or why I even care.  I should just let things take their course, but that's not a very Jessica thing to do.  I know I'm stupid, no one has to tell me that.  I just wish I had some idea of what the future holds.  A lot of my friends have gotten their orders.  They've learned that the majority of them will be in Iraq by the first of next year.  I haven't received mine yet, but I'm scared.  I don't want to go.  I thought I did.  I was all for dying for my country, but would I really be doing that?  Or would I be dying for some corporation or lobbyist?  So now I sit here, not knowing where my future lies, whether it be in war or matters of the heart, wishing I could take back the last eight months of my life.

I know I'm going to hell, but that's my life.""  It's always meant something to me.  I laid awake last night wondering how things might have been different.  I wondered what I'd be doing now if I had married Matthew.  Would I be divorced?  Would I have kids (though, we know that can't happen unless it's a miracle)?  I think things started heading downhill for us when we found out that it would be difficult to conceive.  Not that things were ever great, but I think the reason we were together was because we each thought the other would be a good parent.  A stupid reason really, and I know that now.  But all those things I thought I wanted, a husband, a house, kids, a yard, a white picket fence, I knew it would never happen for me.  Now, I don't know what I want.  I don't want to get married.  My mom thinks I'll change my mind someday, but the only reason to get married is to have kids.  Otherwise, you can just live with someone forever, and be perfectly happy.  I don't know that I even want to live with someone forever.  I don't think there's anyone out there that could tolerate me for that long.  I'm always afraid of being hurt, so I never tell people how I feel.  Because if you let them in on your feelings, they have a window to your soul.  And that's how you get crushed.  Stupid rantings, I know....."
4ZAP27B,female,23,"It feels like forever since I last wrote, but not much has changed.  I'm still stupid.  Crazy infatuated with someone who I'm quite sure doesn't care about me in the least.

Who wants to spend all of that time in the car???  It's the only place that sells fireworks year-round around here.  Not fun.  Still haven't gotten laid.  And I've had the opportunity.  Just not with the person(s) that I woud like to have it occur with.  Nothing like heading into nine weeks of sexual frustration with six months of it already behind you.  So, I have exactly 11 days to complete all of the following:  Get Laid (preferably more than once, but I'll take what I can get), Get addresses compiled, Forget about Ryan, Finish packing my stuff, Buy military acceptable bras and underwear (did you know that Victoria's Secret is not acceptable???  I didn't), Figure how exactly how much time it's going to take to fix my hair so I can get it all chopped off before I go if I can't hack it, Get Laid, Forget about Ryan...... yeah, so I mentioned them a second time.

8WSXFAT,female,26,"Today my father died. No, not today, in the year 2004, but today, in my mind 12 years ago. Twelve years ago today, my father received a heart transplant, and 12 years ago I killed him off in my mind. For one brief moment, I considered life without him in it. I was fourteen years old.     I spent most of my conscious life with one idea in my head: my father is dying. I remember in kindergarten, explaining to a class of five year olds what a quadruple bypass surgery was.  I was more than a precocious child. I was a freak. I had myself pegged that way from that point on.     I didn’t really think I was that strange till third grade, when I realized other children didn’t come home to empty houses and messages on the fridge saying, “Gone to the hospital, there is money for pizza on the counter. Don’t watch too much TV. Get your homework done. We’ll go to the hospital after school tomorrow. I’ll pick you up early. Love, Mom.”     Other girls spent their pre-teen years fawning over crushes. I spent mine trying to sleep on orange vinyl couches and molded plastic chairs. I never learned what the latest clothing trends were, but I knew where to get the best sodas and snacks in any hospital in downtown Buffalo. Perfumes were never my thing, but I liked that they drowned out the stench of the emergency room.     On the day my father got his transplant, we admitted him to Buffalo General Hospital. It was a beautiful sunny day, with temperatures about 80 degrees. I remember thinking I wanted to go swimming that afternoon. I was a bit angry that he was in the hospital, since that meant I could not go to the public pool. I didn’t want to go swimming in our back yard, since the pool was so small I could stand up easily and it felt like I was in a big bathtub. I gave up on the idea of swimming, or doing anything fun, and resigned myself to a day of drawing ill-conceived faces and reading three-month-old People Magazine.     Coming back from the hospital, we stopped at Burger King. We went through the drive-thru and ate the burgers in the car. We passed the airport, and were almost home. I suggested to my mom that I go for a bike ride. I needed to clear my head. I needed to get away. I needed to keep going and going and never stop. She agreed it was a good idea. We got into the driveway and she put up the garage. I grabbed my bike, rode it up to the car and gave her a kiss on the cheek as she walked to the mailbox to get the mail.     I started to pedal hard. Pushing my muscles harder and faster, I careened forward not wanting to stop. I remember my right leg cramped from sudden activity after hours of sitting, but I didn’t care. I kept pushing. As I rode, I cried.      I got thirsty, and had no water bottle with me so I stopped at a diner owned by my former best friends’ family. Their father was glad to see me. He gave me a soda and let me sit for a few since I was red in the face and out of breathe. The fifties nostalgia diner was sea foam green and white, with splotches of pink and coca-cola signs everywhere. I drank down my coke, listening to the jukebox playing, “Daniel” by Elton John.  “Daniel is leaving tonight on a plane. I can see the red taillights….and I can see Daniel waving goodbye Lord it looks like Daniel. Must be the clouds in my eyes.” I sat there, my eyes still stinging with tears, and I let my father die.     I closed my eyes and I saw the future. My father’s funeral, the hundreds of people turning out to say what a brilliant sun of a bitch he was, my immediate family in pain, and my extended family squabbling over everything from the will to the way the priest conducted himself. My siblings’ weddings, occurring in my mind over the next five years, without my father there to make sure the functions happened according to his traditions. My mother in white….lots and lots of white. White is such a hard color to clean.     I understood then why Hindus wore white as the mourning color. With white, on dusty roads, you must be aware of yourself. You must always be conscious of what you are wearing. You must be careful every time you eat or drink. You never forget the person who died.     I saw my high school graduation, my college graduation and every other milestone in my life. I saw the probability of moving to Texas to be closer to more extended family, or Washington DC for the same reason. I saw my mother working. I saw us losing the house I grew up in, or selling it to help my sister pay for graduate school. I saw me and my mother in a cramped apartment in downtown Buffalo. I saw all of this, and I decided it was ok. I resigned myself to the idea that my father was going to die. I gave up on him.     I left the diner, after thanking Mr. Harrishburg for the soda, and headed out again. Once again pushing my legs hard, feeling the pain and pushing for more. I whipped past the houses of friends who had known me since the day I was born. I stopped and rang their doorbell, hoping to get a game of catch out of them, or at least a drink of water. No one was home.     The tears stopped. I felt empty. I had accepted my father’s death, and the inevitability that came with it. I turned my bike around and slowly started for home. I pulled into my driveway, and my mother pulled in behind me. She was honking the car horn like she was in a parade. I turned and watched her waving frantically for me. I ditched my bike on the front lawn, not even putting down the kickstand, and ran to the car. “We got the heart! We’re going to Cleveland! Put your bike in the garage, and go get packed!”     I started to cry. I had thought no more tears could come, but out they came. My mother thought they were tears of joy, but they were self-pity. I felt guilty. I had given up. I had given up and there was still hope. I have felt guilty about that for the last twelve years.     For twelve years I have made myself suffer for a lot of things in my life, but none more than that ten minutes. The ten minutes in which I allowed my father to die.     Recently, I encountered head-on my unforgiving nature and how hard I am on my adolescent self. My friend invited me to hear a choral concert of Elton John songs. I sat there in the audience, and heard “Daniel” for the first time in twelve years. For the past twelve years, I avoided it. If it came on the radio, I changed the station. I never bought any Elton John albums and I drowned it out with conversation if it was played in restaurants.     In a theater, I could not run away from it. I sat there, and allowed it to wash over me. I was fourteen again, and angry at the world. I was fourteen again, and angry with my father for being sick. I was fourteen again, and giving up. My heart seemed to stop as they sang it, the song that was the aural impression of my subconscious disassociation with my father. I sat there and cried, and wanted to run. I am not a rude person, so I suffered through it. I listened to the lyrics, and remembered. I allowed the emotions to coarse through me. I started to forgive the innocent fourteen year old. Which is why, for the first time in twelve years, I can write about this, without just recounting a narrative."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"""Someone to touch your hair, someone who cares.....Reach out and touch me!"" I am not sure if that is what the words are for that song. Still it feels right. I have come to the realization I spend an inordinate amount of time alone. As I job hunt, I am alone. As I drive, I am alone. I eat alone, watch TV alone, go to the movies alone, drink alone, read alone and feel sorry for myself for being alone...alone. Still its funny, most of the time I revel in being alone. Since moving back in with the parental units, they spend so much time wanting to know what is going on with my life, that being alone felt good. That is, until being alone became lonely. Now all I want are a group of friends I can call upon to no longer be alone."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"Both these quotes were overheard on an ABC TV show. The show was about television shows that were only pilots and never aired. They were just too funny not to write down:  ""What could be more adorable than a boy and his troll?""  ""Have you ever had a man stand behind you and kiss you on the back of your knees?""  I know this is not a big post, but I will write more later. This week I have been celebrating my parents' 39th wedding anniversary and my sister's 36th birthday. Plus we are moving Mehala into her apartment here in Miami. I'm kinda tired.  I do promise more later. *SMILE*"
8WSXFAT,female,26,"Sometimes it is not so bad, living in the spare bedroom of the people who created me. After all, I am not paying for rent, food, utilities or any of the other things that people my age struggle to pay for month after month. Yes, I am trying to see the bright side of it all. After months of job hunting, I am still no closer to a full time position than I was in November 2003 when I was sequestered here. I try not to complain, or to feel depressed, but it is as bad as living in the parents' basement...except this time I am trapped on the 24th floor of a highrise condo. For those of you who do not like or know me well, I don't like heights like that. I don't freak out, but I also don't go out on the balcony, at all...unless circumstances beyond my control force me.  Lately I have been forced out onto the balcony more and more, by life and situations involving the parental units. It is easier to go there than to run screaming from the house at 2 in the morning when my mother is online plugging away at her own blog, and all I want to do is check my e-mail for five minutes. My mother stays up later than I do, and my father wakes up early. So, basically there is no time alone, unless they are both going someplace together, or at the same time.  So I spend tons of time locked in my room, with the television on in the background, reading, or doing one of my many hobbies. Ok so this piece says nothing more than what is going on each and everyday in my life...but sometimes that is for the best."

LAYTON, Utah - A self-appointed editor of library books has given new meaning to ""purple prose."" The do-it-yourself censor is turning swear words into ""darns"" and ""hecks"" — in purple ink.          ""They believe it's within their right to deface public property and impose what they believe on others,"" library director Pete Giacoma said.   ""It's a crime. It would be prosecuted if we were to find who did it, by luck or accident,"" he said.   Destroying or defacing library materials is a class B misdemeanor. It's punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, but Giacoma said the library usually will settle for restitution.   ""I think the worry of the public, every once in a while, is that we're doing it,"" he said. ""We're not.""   Giacoma said in cases like this, the vandals will usually tire of editing books and stop on their own.    And now for article number 2:    Alleged Library Book Thief Sparks Chase      Mon Jul 19, 2:01 PM ET       Add  urlLink U.S. National - AP  to My Yahoo!  By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer  SYRACUSE, N.Y. - A 36-year-old man led police on a brief car chase, driving on sidewalks, through parking lots and even against traffic on a busy boulevard, so he wouldn't get caught with stolen library books, according to police.          ""The officers were a little taken back when they found out what the deal was. They couldn't believe it,"" said Syracuse police spokesman Sgt. Tom Connellan, who added police broke off pursuit because the situation Sunday became too dangerous.   ""It was stupid and reckless,"" said Connellan.   There were no injuries, and — even more amazingly, Connellan said — no property damage.   Byron Haynes of Syracuse was to be arraigned Monday in Syracuse City Court on misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, petit larceny and reckless driving, as well as numerous traffic infractions.   Haynes offered no explanation to police when he was arrested, Connellan said.   Connellan did not have the titles or authors of the five stolen books but said they all dealt with Jewish religion. The books were swiped from Syracuse University's Bird Library, which has substantial holdings of rare books, manuscripts and collections, including original writings of authors Joyce Carol Oates and Dr. Benjamin Spock, 19th-century reformer Gerritt Smith and transcontinental railway builder Collis Huntington.   ""Our special collections are kept on the sixth floor. Access to that area is very regulated. These were taken off the shelves that everyone has access to,"" said Kevin Morrow, a university spokesman.   Haynes was not a university student, Morrow said.   An officer spotted Haynes running a stop sign about 4:30 p.m. Sunday near the library. Moments earlier, a suspect had fled the building with the stolen books, setting off the building's alarms as he ran out the doors.   The car chase lasted about 10 minutes. A dozen police cruisers were involved, although only three or four chased Haynes. During the chase, officers saw the suspect toss a backpack out the car window, Connellan said. When they recovered it, they found the stolen books.   ""We assumed it was drugs or guns the way he was driving,"" Connellan said. ""We even brought in a canine to go through the car. Nothing.""   Onondaga County deputies in a helicopter tracked Haynes until he tried to ditch his car at a city park. City police arrested him after a short foot chase.   Connellan said investigators were doing a background check on Haynes.    So this sparks the question....Why are libraries so contraversial all of a sudden?"
8WSXFAT,female,26,"“The Eyes of Texas are upon you, all the livelong day. The eyes of Texas are upon you. You cannot get away…” is a line that conjures up memories of baseball caps and very loud marching bands. In Austin, that song is sung at every sporting event UT has. Even though, I never attended UT Austin, the songs, and the spirit are ingrained in me. I found myself recently making fun of Aggies (graduates of Texas A&M) with a friend of a friend over dinner. She had lived in Dallas. I had lived in Austin. We had nothing in common, but that was enough. We were able to converse like good friends, after a couple drinks and a round of Aggie-bashing. I’ve discovered, since leaving Texas there are two types of people…people who have been to Texas, and people who have not. People who have been to Texas, even the ones that hate it, never completely put down the state. The people, who have never gone to the state, are the ones who bash it.   I admit, it is the state that brought us two President Bushes, but it is also the state that brought us President Johnson…so in a way, it will all balance out in the end. Well, maybe not, but this is not a treatise comparing the presidents who came out of Texas. What is this exactly? I’m not sure. I guess in a way it has to do with poetry, and the song, “Yellow Rose of Texas.” I was recently exposed to the fact that any poem by Emily Dickinson can be sung to the music of “Yellow Rose.” If Ms. Dickinson was writing her poetry today, she might choose to have it come out that way…. just to poke fun at the state of Texas. Instead, it is just another one of those things that people with too much time on their hands discover on the Internet."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"I keep discovering strange things growing in my backseat. I guess I should back up. In the back seat of my car, I keep one half of a bicycle (the quick release wheels and seat), a bicycle rack, various computer components for work and personal use, books from my own collection and the public library, clothing for various stages of Miami weather and three or four pairs of shoes. I also keep back there papers that I need, most of which are not actually important, but I feel should not yet be shredded, various tools, for use in the car, my jewelry making tools, and generic brand breakfast bars in both strawberry and mixed berry flavors.  Even with all that stuff in the backseat of my car, it must have taken a bolt of lightning hitting it or something, because last night I discovered my library and personal books had reproduced. My silly romance novels, and books by Arthur Schlesinger and Jennifer Hochschild have had a secret liaison and produced a love child unlike any I had ever seen. It is definitely something out of Mary Shelly’s  Frankenstein . I discovered in my backseat a book entitled  Thieves in High Places  by Jim Hightower.  I know I did not purchase this hardcover concoction, and it has not remnants from the library, so my only course of deduction is it was created from sexual or asexual reproduction. Since I highly doubt  The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability  mutated during mitosis to create some new tuber, and such a different book from its parent. I see no choice but to believe that my books are practicing non-safe sex.  I really must talk to them about this behavior, because bastard love children take up a lot of space, and like all books, make me want to read them. I barely have time for the oodles of books I have on the public library’s hold list. Still, I took the book in my arms and tried to read it during dinner last night. I could barely get passed the first chapter. It felt as poorly written as right-wing rhetoric, yet it was from the left.  And so I will conclude this piece of backseat melodrama. I need to go out to my car, see if there are any radioactive spiders inside of it, and have a serious conversation with my books. They need to learn that unsafe sex has consequences, since I don’t want to get a call from the public library complaining that their books are diseased."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"God Bless Reverend Al Sharpton. I have been avoiding the Democratic National Convention. I did not want to hear yet another sanitized speech which gave no opinions about the way this country has been run since the 2000 election. I did not want to hear once again, that the Democrats were not going to attack Bush, or take a stand on any of the numerous issues they could be talking about. Instead, the Democrats have been looking like ostriches with their heads in the sand, looking for their butts. This morning, I heard about Al Sharpton, and the fact that he did not give the cookie-cutter speech approved for by the DNC, and instead spoke from the heart. He spoke the words of a lot of Americans, words I have been hoping to hear since the primaries. Here is a quote from the speech last night. I had hoped to copy the entire speech, but discovered that because he did not give the speech the DNC had approved, no news agency so far has a copy of the speech. This is the passage that touched me the most (Quoted from  urlLink www.signonsandiego.com ):  ""Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age,"" Sharpton said. ""Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of (civil rights activists) Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us. This vote can't be bargained away. This vote can't be given away.  ""In all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale.""   Mr. Sharpton has earned my respect, and my admiration. I did not expect much out of this election process, except to hopefully oust President Bush. A lot of you may have heard me declare that I plan on moving to Canada and pleading for political asylum on Wednesday November 3rd 2004 if we re-elect President Bush. Mr. Sharpton has reinvigorated my desire to work toward getting John Kerry elected. He may not have the ability to declare his opinions as bluntly as Reverend Sharpton can, but he can be the face that helps to make those opinions fact.   I'm gonna end this entry with one more quote from the honorable Reverend Sharpton: ""The issue of government is not to determine who may sleep together in the bedroom, it's to help those that might not be eating in the kitchen.""   I now wish I had spent last night listening to his entire speech. It definetely gives me hope for the future."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"I was just in Barnes and Noble looking for a magazine. It occured to me as I stared at the stacks, that there was not one ""womens interest"" magazine that interested me. Sure, I have read my share of Cosmo and Marie Claire...find me one PMSing woman who has not consumed the trash at some point in time...and I will show you a liar. Cosmo is like chocolate, it makes you feel good, or bad, depending on how much you consume. Still, I have no desire to learn how to give a better blowjob, get a man to be interested in me just by wearing a specific scent during the summer solstice or figure out which shade of white works best on my skintone.     So I wonder, why is there no ""mens interest"" section? There are sports magazines, hobby magazines, political magazines and everything else, but men do not have their own interests. Don't men want to know how to give better head, or if black really will make  them look slimmer?     Wait a second, of course they don't, because the magazine publishing world is aware that they have a brain. The magazine world just assumes, that because I ovulate, that I am interested in magazines about weddings, there were 30 different magazines there, all about being a better bride....and even more about how to have a good pregnancy...and how to be a good parent. Why are there no mens magazines about good parenting? Isn't parenting a two person job?     The older I get, the more my attitudes return to the time when I was in middle school. Back then, I could not understand the ""womens interest"" section. I also had no desire to comprehend it. Clothes were nothing more than the thing I put on in the morning. Makeup was for other people...an alien substance that I wasn't sure I ever wanted to experience. Somedays I miss that time in my life."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"The undertoad is strong today. That irrepressible feeling that something bad is going to happen. Nothing bad may happen. I may be fine today. It may be yet another day, full of banter and nostalgia, but it could be painful and scarring at the same time. I cannot get out of my head today. All I want to do is sleep, but I am stuck in the middle of a traffic jam on 95. I wonder, if I napped right now, would anyone notice?     I write sonnets in my head as the radio blares. Who cares about being springtime fresh? The rain comes pouring down, stranding me behind an 18 wheeler that takes up 4 lanes. I want to cry.    I want to shed tears for the woman I am, and the child I was. I want to have a home of my own, a career of my own, a life of my own, and I am sick of the protocol that is set up, that I must follow to get there. Why must I follow the rules? Why can't I be exempt? Why won't the headaches stop?    Why must everything be in triplicate, and typed, and double spaced? I wish just once I could stop the pain...that creeps into every decision I make...every part of my being...everything I create. Everyone judges me, and expects me to judge them in return. I am tired of judging...can't I just enter for the fun of it?    I hurt, am tired and hate my life....I thought it was supposed to get easier as we got older? Why does it just get harder? Why doesn't trying our best count for anything anymore?"

Sex and class    The wealthy, high-society mother of a 17-year-old girl was concerned that her daughter was having sex. Worried the girl might become pregnant, and adversely impact the family's status, she consulted the family doctor.   The doctor told her that teenagers today were very willful, and any attempt to stop the girl would probably result in rebellion. He then told her to arrange for her daughter to be put on birth control and, until then, talk to her and give her a box of condoms.   Later that evening, as her daughter was preparing for a date, the woman told her about the situation and handed her a box of condoms.

I needed to get away from my parents because they were smothering me, but my life hasn't been any better since I moved out here.  At times, I think it's gotten worse. I hate my work.  Yeah, I know, I couldn't have possibly lived off of the cash I was making working two jobs, but it's not like I'm making a great deal of money here, either.  It's just that I don't feel like I'm being challenged enough and I'm quickly growing weary with boredom from this job.  At least the people here are for the most part nice. My personal life sucks as much as ever as I am still alone.  I don't have much for the friends department either as Dennis is not a very close friend and he has his own cronies on the westside to hang out with.  Jenny has been such a bugger to deal with for the last while.  I understand her situation is rough, but it's not good to be focusing on it 24/7 and it's beginning to bother me.  She's gonna read this too and get more pissed off at me than she already is because she's been taking everything so goddamn serioulsy lately.  She can't ever take a fucking joke.  Sometimes I think I'd have been better off if I just stayed at home.  I mean my sister can't take a joke, but at least she's hilarious when she gets angry and she gets over it rather quickly.  Jenny's been such a bitch lately, that I want to go home and get away for a while but I can't :'( She'll get over it, I hope."

0D4CHHN,female,23,"Have you heard the news?  I am so depressed about it.  Ozma broke up.  It's such a shame.  I love that band so much.  They were like Weezer done right, since Weezer sucks anymore.  I really wished it would have been Weezer instead, but it had to be Ozma.  I'm so sad because I never got the chance to see Ozma perform and I really wanted to but since I moved out here I was either too poor, too busy, or too preoccupied to go out.  Now I'll never get to see them.  How sad.  It pisses me off too because Ozma was sooooo gooooood.  I mean they never really had that point where they just started to incredibly suck (like what's been happening to Weezer for the last 3 or so years).  Why do all the really great bands have to break up?  Why can't the bands that were once great and now incredibly suck break up instead (and yet Weez - I mean they - stay together).  I guess it's for the best.  I mean, this way Ozma never had the opportunity to get to that phase where you just suck and people wonder why you're even still together (*coughs* weezer).   Okay, yeah, in case you haven't figured it out already, I really wish Weezer would break up, but let me argue my case before you all threaten to kill me.  At one time, Weezer was an excellent band.  Blue album and Pinkerton were sweet albums - unique, melodic, and all around great.  It all seemed to go downhill right about the time Matt Sharp was kicked out of the band, but I'm sure that's  purely coincidence .  Green album was a total sellout with about  maybe  3 good songs and the rest of the songs seemed indistinguishable from each other.  Maladroit.... well... it would have been a better album if Rivers had just taken a little more time on it.  Frankly, most of the tracks sounded very incomplete and unfinished and in a few cases, the demos sounded much better than the final tracks.  Aside from the downsliding quality of music from the band, the guys don't really seem to enjoy it anymore.  I think it would just be better for the guys to do their own things.  I think if Rivers truly applied himself, he could start writing some melodic masterpieces again.  He has a lot of talent that he's just not using to its fullest and I think Rivers could do better than he's doing - tons of unused potential.  Speaking of unused potential, the Space Twins could possibly be an underground indie cult favorite if Brian just had the time to work on it.  If he wasn't in Weezer, he and Tim Maloof could work on some great material for a new album.  Brian also needs to focus a bit more on that unique style of writing he used to have (i.e. Osaka Aquabus, Goddess of Love) instead of getting too emotionally wrapped up with his music (i.e. Nothing for Love, Running Out of Time).  If he and Tim had the time to really work on it, the Space Twins could really be something special and with Weezer out of the way, they'd have the time.  The Special Goodness, on the other hand, could be arena gods if Pat had the time to focus more on his songwriting.  TSG is a great live band and if Weezer broke up he and Scott could do that full time... if it weren't for Atom being in the Offspring now.  I'm sure they all could work something out, and if TSG isn't enough for Shrinedog, I'm sure there's a metal band in need of a bassist somewhere, because let's face it rock and metal are Scott's elements - NOT powerpop.  I just realized it's my 96th post.  4 more 'til 100!  Maybe I'll have a party or something..."

There could actually be someone out there who would be able to tolerate me at least as a friend.

I mean, maybe if i was skinny and cute or at least thinner and pretty someone would find me attractive, but there is no place for a fat girl in this world.  What is it that men have against us?  Am I less of a person because of my weight (if anything I would think I would be more of a person)?  Maybe I'm just too much to handle.  I don't know what it is that makes me so goddamn unattractive.  Why does my weight have to be such a fucking big deal?  It's not like I have problems fitting into chairs or I get winded walking upstairs.  Yeah, I admit that I could stand to shed some weight, but why should that keep a guy from dating me?  I mean I don't see myself as being grotesquely unhealthy.  Maybe there's something wrong with the fact that I don't see it, but I honestly don't see what the big deal is.  I think there are much worse problems a person could have, such as selfishness, major personality problems, no sense of humour, etc.  On a side note, I really, really, REALLY miss my car."

SF6OWBR,female,25,"Well, Its almost over. Last year, I was a wreck at this time at the thought of saying goodbye to my class. I have mixed feelings this time around.   Anyways, we had field day today, which was a lot of fun! We had eleven different events, many of theme a series of relay races, and a few water activites. i am so glad that we did this...these kinds of activities really boost morale on a school site. Too bad we don't have more of them anymore!  In the afternoon, we had the teachers versus 6th grade soccer game. I didn't sign up because the idea of playing softball terrified me - last year at my *other* school we played kickball, which seemes a lot less... dangerous.   But, my kids strongly encouraged me to play, and it makes it a lot easier to stand out in left field praying nervously and anxiously that no ball ever comes your way, when you have 30 kids screaming your name from the sidelines.  And yes, some balls did come my way. And no, I didn't field them very well at all. the upside is nothing really went past me. I was able to stop everything so I didn't have to chase it. Let's see...one time it rolled out and I scooped it up and threw it to our short stop...when really I should have thrown it to second. Another time, it was a pop fly right to me and it hit my glove but rolled out :o(...but I recovered and threw it quickly to the short stop...albiet it a little to high...and the third time I was able to again catch it on a roll (after both the short stop and the thirdbase man missed it) and send it back to third...unfortunatly the runner was already safe.   The upside is that I had 5 at bats, and I hit the ball each time. (one time was close, though...two strikes and a foul before I hit it.) I got out at first twice, but the other three times I made it home...securing 3 of our 17 total points. The sixth graders ended up with 16...and admittidly there was a certain player on our team, playing first base, that gave up quite a few outs to the sixth graders.   It was a lot of fun, and I was quite pleased. Of course, now I am exhausted...i fell asleep on the couch at 7:30 in the process of thinking about how I really should get up.  I have the sinking suspicion that I am going to be a little sore in the morning."
SF6OWBR,female,25,"People are weird.  I, however, think I must be the weirdest of all.  I have always been out of touch with my peers.

SF6OWBR,female,25,"I just finished reading Deception Point by Dan Brown. Another intriguing read! Once you read two of his books you can figure out his recipe real quick...a strong heroine, a romantic hero, a quick paced hunt, and a villian who is least likely to figure out...Unfortunatly, perhaps because of that, I was able to figure out the villian in this particular novel.  What I really like about his books are all the little pieces of trivia and knowledge that he hides in each story. You learn alot of little things along the way that are really cool.  If you haven't read any Dan Brown, I highly reccomend them. Find the one with the topics that interest you the most...but I think you'll find that if you like his style, you'll like any of his books. He is a great story teller, and his short chapters and quick pace make his books easy to read and hard to put down. I'll list below each of his books and key polt points:   Deception Point : NASA, Politics (US Presedential race), Spy technology   Digital Fortress:  NSA (National Security Agency), code breaking technology, the debate between personal privacy and National Security.   Angels and Demons:  The Vatican and its rituals, Religion versus Science, an ancient brotherhood known as the Illuminatti whose goal it is to destroy the Catholic Church, and sculptures around Rome.   DaVinci Code:  sequal to Angels and Demons. Art (DaVinci's), Religion (and its suggested role as a political tool), The search for and history of one of the most quested thing in religious history, and of those who know what it truly is.   Happy Reading!"
SF6OWBR,female,25,"I didn't watch The Swan. However, I have a friend who was working as part of the show, so I was curious about how ""ugly"" the girls were when they started, and how ""beautiful"" they were when they finished, so I went to check out the website.   As I glanced at the before pictures, I was confused...none of the contestents were particularly ugly...in fact the majority of them, if not all, looked just fine to me! I mean, granted, the pictures weren't the most flattering, the hair was messy and no make up and around the house clothes, but overall they looked just fine!   Then I saw the makeovers...and they just made me feel so sad. They look so different! They are not even the same person! I just felt so sorry for these women...sorry that they couldn't find peace with who they were, sad that they now looked so different then how they were born. I mean, I am sure they are happier, but my goodness, I can't imagine living my life in a body that was no longetr my own. I would just feel so sad, like I wasn't good enough before, and I only am because I was surgically changed. Many of these women weren't jusr ""enhanced,"" they were changed.

In any case, I really enjoyed the film. It is very funny, and, i hope, will make a lot of people ask themselves some questions. (Of course, those that probably need to the most probably won't see the movie...I wonder if I could sneak into Harvest Crusade and play it on the jumbotron?)

(when you read that last sentence to yourself, pronounce again as if it rhymes with rain...Sounds nice, doesn't it?)  Ok, so Friday night we went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on IMAX. Now just let me say that I love this book...It is my favorite of the five, and so I knew I would be critical of it. That being said, I thought they did an excellent job of adapting this story to the screen!!!!  I am going to tell you about my opinion of the movie below. There are spoilers for the movie and the book, so be warned, particularly is you don't know the story at all!   ******Spoiler Warning*******  Favorite Part:  The time turner sequence  Best effect:  The way they showed the Dementors effects, especially on Harry.  Well Done:  Michael Gambon taking over the role of Dumbledore after Richard Harris's incredible portrayal of the headmaster in the first two films. The transition was good, and Imust admit, that Gambon's portrayal seems more like how I imagined Dumbledore, a little more spritely, a little more energy.  Most cheesy:  While all of the actors are growing into their roles well, one area I believe needs a little work. Daniel did very will displaying many of the emotions required in this film, particularly anger.  However, there was one scene that was kind of off. Harry is sobbing under his invisibility cloak in Hogsmeade, and Hermione goes to comfort him. As she pulls the cloak of, his facial expression is far different from the sobs we heard moments before.   Part that was most like how I pictured it: The scene with Harry and Sirius down by the lake, surrounded by Dementors, and the figure across the lake who uses the PATRONUS curse to save them...as well as the corresponding time-turner sequence.   Part that was least how I pictured it: The physical space between Hagrid's hut and the castle...I didn't picture it quite so steep and rocky...I pictured it more as a gentle sloping grassy field. I don't remember such a striking difference from my imagination in the other two films, so I need to rewatch them to see if they show the route to Hagrid's hut in the other films.   Somewhat disappointing: They don't show the letter Harry's godfather writes giving Harry permission to go to hogsmeade...the first caring, parental thing ever done to Harry in his conscious life (of course, as we know from reading Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore does many parental acts for Harry...But he doesn't know about them yet...)  this isn't a major complaint because I feel like they did a decent job of showing his new role in HArry's life by rearranging some other sequences. But the letter part was so moving to me in the book that I wish they would have included it...Of course, they still can in Goblet of Fire briefly...For example, ""I can go to Hogsmeade...my godfather signed the form.""  VERY DISAPPOINTING: They don't explain who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are. They show there name on the marauders map, but they don't explain who they were. Nor do they explain why Sirius and Peter were Animagi in the first place. I think this really should have been added...It would have fit in well in the sequence where Harry says goodbye to Lupin, and added only a few moments, I think key, to the movie. Oh well.  However, I hear they did hint that Harry figured it out...Although I didn't see this part (a, shall we say, medical situation caused me to have to leave the theater immediately after the film, thus being unable to watch the credits).

SF6OWBR,female,25,"You know, it occured to me on Sunday that 4th of July is one of my favorite hoildays. You can spend the whole day outside. You can swim, barbeque, and relax. And pretty much everyone that you are going to meet is celebrating as well. You don't have to stress about wrapping any presents. There are patriotic songs to sing. Fire works. Community events. People wear red white and blue, spirited colors like a school pep rally...except that we are all on the same team. Its a pretty cool feeling.   I spent one 4th of July in London. It was odd to not have everyone celebrating...until we got down town...there was a huge celebration going on...lots of whistles blowing, happy people dancing in the street...one of the coolest gay pride festivals I've ever attended. So we still got to celebrate on 4th of July!   I was worried thhis year about Belle, and that all the loud fireworks would scare her. However, she did just fine... Probably because she was so tired from going to the HB parade and then to the barbeque that she pretty much slept through the whole evening. Plus, we did have Karaoke Revolution up pretty loud...

FHARGL9,male,15,"I have *finally* figured out what my problem is when it comes to relationships. About time.  You see, I've had quite a few girlfriends in not much of a span of time, and I know why. I truely loved Nat, and when she turned me away, I tried to recapture that feeling of love I've felt for her. Often emotions would get in the way, and I'd get into a bunch of quick relationships that end in heartbreak. That's exactly what it is. I want to actually, honestly love a girl, like I've loved Nat.   I've been hurting every day about this, and really haven't said anything. Just keeping quiet except for a few times, usually looking for a new girl to rush into a relationship with, in hopes of finally falling in love again. I swear love is a drug, and it's something I've been addicted to since I fell for Nat.  As soon as I met Nat, I became this romantic, always writing romance stories and everything about love...I always wanted to live out those stories but it's impossible.  Nat says my biggest mistake is me going with all these girls..but she's the reason why I'm doing it. I swear to God I wouldn't be going through girls like this or being so attached if I had never been in love before. So it's a never ending cycle until I find a girl to love....but I ALWAYS rush things, because I want to feel love as quickly as possible.  Basically, I'm screwed. I can't get love out of my head, and I'm just going to keep hurting, and hurting, and hurting...nice to know that my first love ended up being the biggest mistake of my love life."

Jebus, why can't it be easier to pass? ;_;  I started feeling better when I got home though.

I'm certainly having fun talking with him, and my conversation goes on with him, as of this writing.

DWO9MYV,female,25,"The financing on my house has been approved; fate again turns me in a new direction. These next weeks will be very busy, I'm sure.    This weekend was fantastic. On Friday I packed the camping gear and headed out to the cottage. With my aunt, uncle, and two cousins visiting sleeping space in the cottage was at a premium, so Jasmin and I setup the cots and sleeping bags and slept in the tent. Our supper on Friday was interrupted by a local woman who wanted to ensure we were aware of the bears in the area, and for us not to have any food with us in the tent. Needless to say my sleep was a bit restless. My dad made us feel a bit more secure by ensuring the fire outside the tent was smoldering and smoking for most of the night, and mom supplied us with pots and spoons to bang for scaring away any clawed invaders.      It was terrific to see my aunt Judy again and converse with someone within my own family interested in environmental and social causes. We shared opinions on home schooling vs. the public system, and protesting with action vs. protesting with intellect.     On Saturday I made Chinese food for the whole gang and the four younger girls in the family entertained us with a movie they had made. Maybe I'm getting old and sappy already but hanging out with family was pretty cool.     I had to leave today with some very stern words for Jasmin, as she's been acting up aggressively towards my brother. I don't know how we're going to control this, I don't know if the drugs are making it better or worse. I'm going to have to make another call to Dr. Stickles, and perhaps make a plea to mental health to get Jasmin to see a professional sooner than planned.  Oh, and I think my cat has a limp.

C8NHIYD,male,23,"My Decision, Mein Kampf   If you would have told me that a graduate with three majors graduating with top honors, a 90% on the MCAT, and 5 years of research would be rejected from every single choice school he wanted to go to I would have laughed outright in denial.  Denial is my reality.  I was always raised to think that doing your best and working your hardest would be rewarding, not only for your inner self but also for your future.  What I wasn't told was how all this depends on whether or not people will actually LOOK at what you have done.    Growing up I saw my share of racism with my family being from Iran.  Some were more gruism than others but you can never erase those memories and they motivated me to try to make a difference.  I never thought that I would experience a more subtle but equally degrading form of discrimination.  After performing poorly on the MCAT I was reject by over 20+ medical programs (I lost count after 20).  I retook the test relunctantly knowing that everything I had done was overshadowed by one stupid reading comprehension section.  When I got my new scores a great burden was lifted off my sholders.  I was in the 90th percentile and in science I was above that.  Surely this would mean that I would have a shot at my top schools for an MD/PhD program.  Surely places like UCSF, UCSD, and Stanford had to take notice.  I was right up there with them as far as everything.  The reality:  I didn't even qualify to submit a formal application to UCSF, Stanford told me that students like me infuriate them, and UCSD rejected me despite letters from two alums of that school.  I turned to the University of Washington, the only other school in West (where I wanted to be) that had the research I was interested in.  Indeed, 5 days after my interview I was accepted to the MD program.  Yeah right, the MCAT is just one factor.  Reality:  It is THE FACTOR!    I  anxiously waited for the news from the dual degree program.  My rejection came several months later with no reason.  The director said I should do research, perhaps try a summer research experience.  It was obvious my application as not ""looked"" at.  What else COULD I have done?  I'm only a recent undergrad; how can I have more than 5 years of research experience.  It was obvious that the thing at play here was merely where I was from.  Idaho = incompetence.  Need more evidence?  There has NEVER been an Idaho educated student accepted to that program, EVER.  I felt a feeling that I hoped I would never feel again, discrimination.  So, am I being overdramatic?  How would you feel having to wait 2 years to go to a school that wasn't at the top of your list, in a city you don't like, and to the wrong program!  I have a deskdrawer filed with over 40 rejection letters.  Did I have other choices?  Yes.  I got into 5 medical schools and 1 MD/PhD program.  However I have a specific area of interest and want to stay in the West.  Call it stupidity or ambition.  What does that leave me with?  I want a school that is established, has a program I want, and has some reputation.  I'm sick of being treated this way.  There was no ""choice.""  There was only one viable option.  The University of Washington is the anti-Albertson College.  It is almost the exact opposite of ACI.  The people treat you like a number, it is huge, and has a huge reputation nationally.  Alas my ""decision"" is to go to the University of Washington and reapply for the third year now to the MD/PhD program.  I guess it is irony because I don't like coffee, rain, or dogs.  But no need to worry I will spend my first day in the beautiful city of Moscow, Idaho.  I guess that's what I get for going to school in this state, having to stay even longer in it!  When I bump into numerous people they ask, ""So, are you excited to be going to medical school.""  How do I respond to something like that?"

C8NHIYD,male,23,"I will never forget the time I stood in a bread line in Iran shortly after the Iran-Iraq war.  I was quite young back then but remember vividly the soldiers getting out of the jeep with their machine guns.  The people at the bakery were stunned as these soldiers forced their way to the beginning of the line, took their bread and left.  Needless to say the sheer FEAR kept us all in line.  Resistance to them would surely lead to being hit by a bullet.  Over the past several days I have been listening to the endless tributes to Ronald Reagan and his legacy.  There are many things people cite, including the being the great communicator and the famous phrase “tear down this wall.”  I started thinking about the masses of people that felt compelled to pay tribute to this man, a man whose politics I don’t agree with.  I started wondering what George W. Bush’s legacy would be?  By default any president that was in power during 9/11 would have that be his legacy.  However it is how we dealt with times of hardship and change which form legacy and ultimately greatness (or infamy).  As I thought about this more, I struggled to come up with a definitive item, one concrete thing that could define his presidential legacy.  On Saturday, I marched in the Old Fort Boise Day parade in Parma Idaho.  I marched for the Canyon County Democrats, holding a banner in front of one of the candidate’s cars.  Needless to say we were not welcome.  Many expletives were yelled at us and some even threw candy at us.  As I was belted in the back of the head with what felt to be a tootsie roll or jolly rancher, it hit me what Bush’s legacy ultimately would be.  What drives people to hate someone not of their belief so much that they would want to inflict harm on someone by throwing candy at them?  How bad has it gotten that we must FEAR to express our views because those views are deemed un-American, un Republican/Democrat, or anti-patriotic?  I am still of the optimistic notion, having traveled and lived for brief periods of time in other countries that people, although not directly willing to admit it, like America.  They like what we stand for and like that we can march in parades, express our views, and challenge what we feel we need to challenge.  They like the hope and inspiration that America inspires.  My cousins in Iran ask me tons of questions starting with, “In America, how is…”  They want to learn more and deep down they are pro-American.  Enter the world post 9/11.  The once optimistic United States has turned it’s focus from innovation and open debate to terrorism, all the time, every time.  Our main export is not optimism but FEAR.  Fear that we will die, or you will die, or you must help us make them die.  Terrorist.  Terrorist.  Terrorist.  9/11.  9/11.  And God Bless America.  The Bush legacy in a nutshell.  Now some may view this as harsh or over simplified.  Perhaps it is, but explaining every thing I have seen this administration do is beyond my allowable web space.  I ask, how are those kids that viewed us with such optimism, how are my cousins, now viewing us?  Has our shining beckon of freedom gotten brighter in a world UNITED behind peace, optimism, and hope?  Or have we fallen into the darkness of cynicism, obsession, and secrecy.  Well when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and it has fallen.  It has fallen into the darkest realms of pseudo democracy where open debate is seen as weakness, war is seen as necessary, and questioning is seen as treason.  Too extreme?  I listened to John Ashcroft today on CSPAN (basically raw news data for folks like me with no life).  He was grilled on why he was not disclosing a memo discussing the handling of prisoners and definitions of torture by our country.  He argued that HE did not feel that it was the right thing to disclose.  However illustrious Mr. Ashcroft is, the fact remains that his opinion and thoughts are NOT law.  By law and the constitution one must either claim executive privilege (which is from the president) or must cite a specific statute.  Period.  Ashcroft did neither.  He felt it enough to merely say that he didn’t feel it was right.  The information he would give may help the terrorists evade interrogation.  Further, Ashcroft has been quoted as saying that we must not ask questions of the war until after it is over.  This sort of logic reminds us all of much darker times in our world’s history (you draw the comparisons).  The point is that Ashcroft was using FEAR, in this case fear that the terrorist may get useful information, yet by law and the constitution he must exercise one of the two mechanisms if he is not willing to disclose information.  The falling cradle will fall into an abyss of peril if transparency, law, and precedent are trivialized by one man’s “opinion” especially if  that opinion is hinges on exploiting fear.  We must not get on an airplane because the terrorist might be planning their next big attack.  We must be careful of trains.  We must be weary of middle easterners.  Now these are natural reactions to some extent after 9/11 but there are limits.  I could get in my car and get in an accident.  I could get in a plane and have turbulence knock me out of the sky.  I could get E-coli.  I might be suspected of being a terrorist!  (damn I need shave, and fast!)  On 9/11 our world did not change so much as our attitudes towards it.  There were, and always will be terrorists and people that hate America.  We will likely be attacked again and we will do everything in our power to stop that, but certainty is never guaranteed.  We can either blame all our society’s ills on the events of 9/11 (heck our ex-college president blamed our financial crisis on 9/11) or we can give the terrorists the symbolic middle finger, become even more prosperous, and advocate what they fear most, peace and understanding of beliefs different than our own.  We can either talk about terrorism all the time or we can start becoming more optimistic and inspire hope in our friends from other countries.  There is a distinct difference between jealousy in something and inspiring hope.  I think the path we have taken thus far is clear and THAT ultimately will be Bush’s legacy   When our government constantly tells us to be fearful or weary of this and that democracy runs the risk of becoming dictatorship ruled by fear.  When we go to war on the premise of FEAR of mushroom clouds or bioagents we are risking more than just mere emotions.    As for me, although I don’t have to deal with bread lines, I would proudly march in another parade advocating a cause I believe in and FEAR getting hit by candy.  At least it is better than the FEAR of getting hit by bullets."

When she saw my mom and me she immediately gave us hugs and we could see that she was quite upset.  She immediately told us how her mom had an advanced stage of cancer that was undetected before.  She had tears in her eyes at this point and said she was going to close the restaurant in a few weeks while she took her mom to Vietnam.  I know the trip will not be one of fun.  She was very worried that business would not return when she reopens the restaurant after she comes back.  I reassured her that my friends would always be there.  I'm not sure how everyone out there feels but that place holds a special place for me.  I'm thinking of giving her a card signed by us regulars.

LMPRF5F,male,17,"Kyle showed me this cool  urlLink internet radio site . Here's a  urlLink thread  all about this site, including all the links related to this. People can upload their own music, or pick from a list in their database, and queue it up on the list to be played. You need  urlLink winamp version 3  to play it i think... Or, if you think something like the awful  urlLink version 5  would work, go ahead. I have better things to do than try and convince you you're wrong."
LMPRF5F,male,17,"Old man Mechling ran outside in a hurry and saw to his great dismay, a short little man was dancing around naked on his roof and urinating in the snow.  ""GET DOWN FROM THERE!"", he cried, but the little man was already out of site.  Months later, they met again at Dairy Queen.  Upon driving away, old man Mechling was mooned with a pressed ham on the window, the whole world watching, and Max was banned from the house for good.  This is a true story."
P6LH97X,male,24,"Sorry, i didn't really get it. Probably there are a lot of people who understood it even less than me. It wasn't a complete waste of time, but there was a feeling that i missed something. Or maybe it just sucks and everyone is afraid to admit that it does to seem intelligent. Whatever."
P6LH97X,male,24,A first favourite is the white flower pickled in the head. Does everybody also want to become dear like me? I am a joke  urlLink baby pig . You can also become beautiful like me now!  I wonder why  urlLink coffee  tastes so good when you're naked with your family.
P6LH97X,male,24,"I should eat less ice-cream. I'm cheating myself. It's winter, for God's sake."
P6LH97X,male,24,"I talked to Hadar on the phone yesterday, and we had nothing interesting to say, so she told me to just babble some crap. So i opened the ""Good Vintage"" ("" urlLink Batzir Tov "") lyric sheet and read her Yona Wallach's ""Kol Neshifa"". Hadar was pleasantly surprised, and so was i. Reading poetry aloud is fun. Later in the day i read her some more Yona Wallach's and also the first verse of ""Eugene Onegin"" (the whole of which i should read myself already!) Today i read her  urlLink Shalom Gad 's ""Yibane Hamikdash"". It seemed fitting -- it talks about building a home, a temple (mikdash) of love by a couple, using manual labor and some funding help from the bank. Equally realistic and poetic.  Now if i could write some decent poetry it would be really great..."
P6LH97X,male,24,"The bags are ready at Hadar's place. My last mindless day at work. Apparently my lovely government decided to play with the calendar, so my flight is on the Memorial Day and not on the Independence Day, which is not very nice. In any case, i also noticed that i land back in Israel a day later than i thought. Oh, the dates. But why should i care.  In the duty free we got ourselves 500ml of  urlLink Chivas Regal  in a plastic bottle, for the trip."
P6LH97X,male,24,"I ordered a new camera -- Olympus UC750. 4MP, 10x optical zoom, xD card, 4 NiMh batteries and the rest is not very interesting. 486$.  I try to recall how it was when i had the Fuji. It is much harder than to recall how it was when i lived in the USSR."
P6LH97X,male,24,"The wall clock is in the garbage now. The alarm clock still works. That they stopped on the same day is a curiosity.  I'm using the Hebrew phrase ""ima shelkha zona"" (""your mother is a whore"") more and more lately. It's been waiting inside me to come out ever since i heard it used so effectively on the brilliant Chamber Quintet's ""Watermelons"" sketch (i won't get into details).  Here's an example:  urlLink Amir Peretz , ima shelkha zona!  It can make a good bumper sticker."
P6LH97X,male,24,"Only about 40% of the people voted. No final results yet. I voted the first thing in the morning. I don't have big problems telling who i vote for in local elections -- for the mayor i voted for the Greens' Avi Binamo and for the council --  urlLink Shinui . I considered the Greens, but they didn't have a website and didn't even answer my email, so there -- they lost my vote. I don't know almost anything about the candidates in either list. I really hope Shinui pass the barrier, they should have ran together with the Greens.  As i write this, i realize why 60% of the Israelis find the elections so boring. It's still a shame, though."

P6LH97X,male,24,"The last day in Yosemite. We love this place. The camping is peaceful, the waterfalls are breathtaking, and all those cute squirrels everywhere.  Before leaving to San Francisco, we went to Vernal Falls. Everyone warned us that we'll get wet, but we just went on. The climb was hard and then those terrible drops from the waterfall were very disturbing, and when we had to decide whether to go on to Nevada Falls or go back down, we went on. I've got to admit, though, that i felt with El'ad like Hadar feels with me -- El'ad went faster than me and i needed more rest. So OK, he's in better shape than me, but he's supposed to be  laid back ! How many times i have to remind him that?  Anyway, after that ordeal we rested a little and went back down on a different path. We took some very impressive pictures there. The waterfalls, the waterfalls...  And then the long way to San Francisco. I drove those 3+ hours. Where Yosemite National Park  ends , Stanislaus National Forest  begins , and i, knowing some Latin, understood that a Park is something more preserved and a Forest is just a forest. But it's still national. The transition from park to forest to just a bunch of hills and then to the usual American sprawl was very gradual. A little before San Francisco i made a very silly mistake -- attempted changing lanes without looking at the dead zone and almost crashed the car. But only almost. The car into which i almost crashed already had some bumps in it. But i still learned my lesson well.  Driving inside SF is very hard. All those strange angles between Market St. and the numbered streets are very confusing with unusual traffic lights, one-way streets etc. Good thing the hotel was close to the highway. We stayed in Holiday Inn Civic Center and they are complete thiefs. The parking is fucking $25 a day! And the hotel is not really that good.  At 22:00 we went out to take a look at the city. Hey, we never learn -- no-one goes out so late in USA. There were a lot of homeless and drug dealers on the streets, but they didn't harrass us. At least we found an Internet cafe. Which was still very expensive.  The impression, however, is that SF is the closest i've seen yet to a real, that is, European city. But it's still very American with these srtaight streets."
XSS647U,male,17,"This wasn't done directly from my mouth, because the original one was cleared away by the site (due to some technical glitches).  As I was saying my head is beginning to pound more nowadays, what with the increased investment in food and the frequency of looking at others' examination results. Only recently I had a headache so bad I can't seem to remember anything that happened on that day.  That was Friday.  The headache seemed to coincide with a terrible day.  All I remember about yesterday was that I broke my test-tube immediately after purchase. Fantastic. Oh yes, and I remember the quote of the day upon telling them of my plight - ""So fast?""  They say speed is a virtue, after all. Why you looking at me like that?  Lately I've been more contradicting than usual - yes, the problems that come with immaturity, and I say IM with small I and M. I can't seem to fully concentrate on what I want to do. The worst thing is, sometimes I don't know what I am saying or doing.  The feeling is something like sitting down for the General Paper and thinking of all the points for a Chinese composition.  And I was only rubbishing the idea of open diaries just today. Well, my opinions change rapidly."
XSS647U,male,17,"Dear Reader,  The first point I would like to make in this article is that I had never wanted to cause grief to anyone - and that my blog is purely entertainment in reading.  My earlier attempts at freelance imagination journalism have been just that - imagination, nothing more.  To prevent others from thinking that I have conflicting ideas, I have hence decided to remove the article on The Establishment.  The second point is, of course, that I would like to apologise to those who have found me irritating, lame, short, ugly, and those bad points, of course. I will give my all to try to reduce the first two properties that I seem to have, but I can't do anything about the latter, though. I can't afford plastic surgery, you know.  I don't make enough money on writing articles on this blog. On the contrary, I think I may get sued and fined.  That's about all for amendments. Thank you for your understanding."

XSS647U,male,17,"It looms near.  Tomorrow I will have my first report card from this institution.  I can't say that I am exactly looking forward to it; after all there is nothing exciting about my report card unless you put E equals to exciting. Or O for outstanding and so on.  People are staring again - they think they are looking at the exterior of a great brain at work, but unfortunately I will have to disappoint them yet again. Don't judge a book by its cover, though my cover's pretty tattered - so is my brain, actually."
XSS647U,male,17,"Imagine talking with half of the working part of your brain that's shut down.  Yes, I'm doing that now. Right now.  I believe there are some necessary corrections that have to be made to the recent article on The Establishment. The first, of course, is about the inaccuracy of the membership of the ALC. I did state in the previous article that the membership is 24, but it is of course incorrect, since unless we expand the ALC it is impossible to achieve such a number since, of course, we only have a maximum of 24 people in the class.  And, yes, there are people who, for some reason, prefer to stay Neutral - with a capital N to denote that they aren't really neutrals - by not joining THE club of the moment. Thus for the mathematically-inclined (or not), the membership of the club is definitely less than the abovementioned number.  So I believe that I have made adequate corrections to my previous article."
XSS647U,male,17,"It's been a long time since I sent in my last actual entry.  To that I apologise to those ardent followers of my blog - those few that I can count with half a finger. I thank you.  In any case, it is terrible to assume that I have been lazing my time away while I have been away from this blog.  It should never be assumed also that I have been using my time with maximised efficiency because that would have been a lie.  Singapore Idol - the first two episodes have been, unfortunately, like its American predecessor - putting almost as much camera-zoom focus on the uncut, uncensored and untalented compared to those that has the power and the vocals.  I'm going back to my seat though."
XSS647U,male,17,"The above word isn't defined as something similar to the word 'crack', if you know what I mean - what I mean is, I'm taking a well-deserved rest, away from the hustle and bustle of freelance imagination journalism.  Of course that's not my full-time job; I am, unfortunately, still a junior college student (and a poor one at that). But recently I have burnt myself out with all my nonsensical things that I am busying myself with.  The time is 10.40pm and I have just returned from a day spent in the Scout Lore Quest. For tenderfeet (that's the term for non-Scouts), the Scout Lore Quest is some sort of trivia quiz where we pit our knowledge against one another. In the finals there were four teams - Anglican High, Anglo-Chinese (Barker), Raffles Institution 02, and Holy Innocent's.  The first round was nicely done - we had 8 points, sharing the lead with ACS Barker. But it appeared that we had ""taken advantage"" of the situation - to quote a HI Venture, saying that we had spent more than 30 seconds on the three questions, because the timekeeper had apparently confused the timings for each question - and he demanded that something was done to recoup their losses. (For your information HI was at 2 points at round 1.)  The judges agreed with that suggestion, and declared that round 1 be repeated except that we would not get to take part since we had ""taken advantage"" of the situation.  By then ACS Barker had taken the lead - 13 to 8.  The end of the quiz came quick - and ACS Barker had built up a substantial lead to land them the champions' trophy.   We were the 1st runner-up, and though we are satisfied with the result I can't say that I was exactly happy about what happened on stage today.  Well, if life was about fairness I'd look like a Caucasian by now."
XSS647U,male,17,"The papers danced their message above his palm, continuing its magical relaying as he made out the words in the dim light. The grotesque stump of beeswax candle burned faintly, its meager flame flickered and guttered, leaving acrobats of shadow where its light did not reach. The faint glow left much to be desired in the way of light for a commoner, yet he had long grown accustomed to the dim settings. The weak glow illuminated the archmage’s study, his arcane sanctuary. Tomes of unspoken power, bound with all sorts of hide, even human, adorned the rows upon rows of shelves that lined the circular room. The shelves were a wonder by themselves, their exquisite workmanship evident in the failing light, where magical designs prevented the wrong hands from getting to the shelves without permission. All that, and much more, had been acquired during the great mage’s adventuring days. Now he lived sequestered deep in his tower where young aspiring magi came for tutelage. Powerful magics had been drawn in the construction of the tower, for the blocks of black granite that had been hewn from the mountain face of the Daishain Mountains a thousand miles away had been carried with an unerring precision that outdid any mortal’s work, as arcane glyphs and sigils engraved upon the impregnable stone walls interweaved and twined together, forming intricate designs that defied the eye, making even the finest lace seem drab. Even a century after its construction, the tower still prickled with fey energies from the residue of its making.  The man focused his eyes, the yellow gleam still undiminished with age, upon the bits of parchment that still danced their message. His initial irritation was soon smoothed over as the message unfurled its contents. The frowned dissipated, leaving only the wrinkles of age, as his facial muscles twitched in a smile. Excitement added its own gleam to the magical yellowness in his eyes, an emotion so seldom associated with the man even in his younger days, but he could have been a different man then, as he nodded his head in what seemed like agreement."
XSS647U,male,17,"The yellowed parchment crumpled in the gnarled hand and bony fingers that closed upon it. The paper was malleable in its own sense, yet brittle if approached in the wrong way. Flakes of brown parchment flitted in the soft breeze that circulated the room, as creases, some a darker shade of yellow, others dark brown, appeared where they had not been before. The hand opened, veins showing clearly in skin wrapped so thinly over bone that sometimes there was more white than pale that could be seen, and the paper whisked upwards and around the room haphazardly, most guided by the wind, but leaving behind the core of what is dancing above the palm of the hand. It was no longer just one piece of paper as the message had come to him, nor merely just the random bits of paper that broke off with age, but the shape and size of each separate bit of paper that floated above his palm had a specific way that it blew in the wind, all in all presenting a very different message than that had been written.   Janadas.   The name had not been spoken, not least for the last century since the old man had lived in the room. Neither had he been disturbed, for the age-old enchantment on an elliptical, reflective rune sitting on its obsidian pedestal in the middle of its study prevented anybody from intruding upon his privacy. He frowned, unhappy with the casual way he had been addressed, inferring the disrespect that came with the name. The frown did not do much than add its own creases to the already wrinkled with age skin, as the wizard’s eyes gleamed with the yellow light characteristic of all powerful wizards who have approached their Prime, the time period where the ability manifested itself to its maximum, still with as much intensity as they were decades ago. Even the slightest apprentice failed to lose his power with age, except the physical sense of spell casting, but for the old man the eyes were the only features he had managed to retain from his youth.  The papers danced their message above his palm, continuing its magical relaying as he made out the words in the dim light.

As the final word played itself out, the man threw his head back and roared in maniacal laughter, the sound traveling through the entrance to his study, past the enchanted arch that served as the trans-dimensional walkway, bouncing off the walls yet never reducing its magnitude, where startled servants dropped pots and apprentices glanced out their quarters cautiously, wondering what monster had been the source of that laugh. Other acclaimed wizards looked in the direction of the laughter with puzzled expressions, wondering if he had finally gone mad, although that could not have been technically true as he was already half mad at best."
XSS647U,male,17,"I went for pioneering training today (pioneering is building structures out of wooden poles and manila rope lashing, but it's much more complicated than that), and I realised that those old friendships aren't as strong anymore. Something must have happened, because that inseparable secondary school gang had disappeared. I only saw four individuals instead of four stalwart friends yesterday at dinner, and even so, we seemed more concerned with ourselves than with our peers.  It is difficult to maintain friendships, but it saddens me that such things are unfortunately inevitable.  Such a coincidence; I had to get hold of this song by Keane today.

Naturally, I was so excited and happy at the possibility of meeting others who would share common interests, so I joined. But I forgot that I live in the Gainesville area.

OHU04IN,male,26,"I was listening to Nirvana on my way to school today.  for those who don't know, (which is most) I live a half hour from work and school.  that time makes a great buffer between home and the other two.  I was listening to Nevermind.  Yeah, you all owned that one at one time or other, I know.  I myself like Bleach and In Utero more, but ya take what ya can, hey?  anyway, as I was coming to school, I found myself running a single lyric through my head ""I found it hard, it's hard to find, the will what ever, nevermind.""  or that is what it sounded like to me.  and I started to think about that, I know, first mistake.  Anyway, I was really digging what I was coming up with about that one bit of the song, with Cobain ripping the song from his soul up and out his mouth.  And I thought about how hard it is to keep the desire to live day to day at the grind.  I thought about primary motivation, what gets you out of bed in the morning. For me, it honestly is my faith in my God, my Heavenly Father.  For you it's something different.  But we all have a primary motivation that helps us face the day, to find the will to accomplish what ever we need to.  what's your Prime Motivation?  Answer silently."
OHU04IN,male,26,"So, there I was at dinner, someone asked me what the most profound thing I have learned in the past year has been.  This comes at the end of my first semester as a colege junior. I thought about all the things that I learned in m upper division English classes, I thought about my spirituality, and lessons learned the hard way from the Old Man.  I thought about the two failed attempts at meaningful relationships and one real possibility, I thought about the new and growing relationship I have with my parents, and how I see them in an entirely new light.  I thought about a lot of different things, and the final result came when I read something a friend wrote about feeling content.  I have to say it simply, the biggest thing I have learned is how to grow and strive to be a better human being, and still be content with my progress so far.  Am I in a rush to find love and get hitched? no. Am I ubber involved in my church? no, involved yea, but I have time for alone time, which I need from time to time.  I am growing, and not breaking down, because I am content to be who I am right now, the bad poetry will get posted next time, I promise.  right now I am feeling too good to worry about poetry, perhaps tomorrow... any way, Thanks J, I honestly appreciated your post."
OHU04IN,male,26,"Well now, it has truly been an interesting few days since last I posted here.  Those who have talked to me know that I have a girlfriend now.  It is entirely too long a story to tell here.  But that is OK.  The best way for me to express it is to say that today when I talked to her on the phone, she said she loved me.  That made my day, hell, my week, year, life.  I don't plan on letting this girl get away, unless she really wants to.  Anyway, that's enough sappy lovetalk from me.  Perhaps I should throw a poem on here as well, to wash the sappy taste away.  So here goes...I call it   ""Storm's Peace""  Small boy wandering the streets alone It's a small town in winter Shovel jauntily thrown across his shoulder Snow falls heavy and fat on the ground Hunter orange cap bobs with excited steps Streetlight makes the world a snow globe The boy shrugs his grey and blue coat Snow settles deep on a driveway The battered shovel swings down Someone's driveway feels steel scrape Pushing a shovel too big brings aches Down the road another walk is covered Shovel returns to shoulder Another streetlight creates another eternal scene The boy pauses at lights edge and looks An owl calls from a power pole Another walk calls the intrepid boy onward Silence crowds close not deafening just murmuring Homemade denim pants become snow caked Giant evergreens collect their white cloak The boy is frozen not by cold not by fear A rumble begins almost in the ground Sneakers in snow pivot the boy Snowplow crests the hill pushing with a chiming chain Eyes full of innocence and awe watch the rumbling jangling shovel The owl flies away A dog barks And the weary boy slings the shovel over his shoulder And begins his walk home Growing in ways he can't know yet   Bent  It comes from my childhood, winters in Flaming Gorge, most notably in Dutch John are beautiful.  The poem is third person about me as a boy and an expierience I had one night shoveling snow for the fun of it. Snowfall has always been comforting to me.   Well noble readers, I bid you good night.  You will also note that I have removed a previous posting.  having said what I did, I no longer feel a need to share it with the internet surfing world.  But I do want you all to remember this, a Nickel's worth of wisdom isn't worth what you paid for it. Fenris"
OHU04IN,male,26,The message that I formerly posted here has been removed in favor of a Poem called   PAGAN  Stone bakes my hands  Sweat burns at eye corners I cry as I worship my God Stretching for a crack I wedge my fist and hang  Heatwaves lick my chest and stomach Arms quiver searching the face of God A nob becomes a hold I advance and spread on stone Move before pain robs my grip Endurance drips away with sweat I lean in supported by feet  Pressed to rock Fire burns through shoes The face of God burns me  Chalk my hands and reach Making the move I fall from my God  I am glad for the rope  Bent  I dig climbing.  This is how I feel when I climb.
OHU04IN,male,26,"But What of the Wolf?   What is he to become In this new enlightened age?  When honor is old fashoned And left out in the rain;  What is a wolf to do when  he feels he can't fit in?  What shall he do  with his outmoded ways?  Shall he cast off his coat, Turn in his teeth?  And take up man's ways, Sure to never offend;  Sacrificing honor for acceptance Is the wolf a fool?

OHU04IN,male,26,"well now folks, I am cooking up a real doozey of a post and I hope you can all abide a little poetry again as I prepare a good solid well thought out and planned, pre written post that will have a definite begining and end, and some good stuff in between, but until then, you will have to content yourselves with this bit of filler I wrote and reworked a hundred times.  I was once told to provide the answer in the poem, but that isn't the point.  read on to find out what the point truly is...  Look for me  If you watch, carefully,             You might see me. I am the silent one, slipping between people. If you listen, quietly,              You might hear me. I am he who is not missed, unheard by man. If you close your eyes in the silence,              You might feel me. I am mist, my touch, as a feather, seldom felt. If you breathe, deeply,              You might smell me. I am the scent of empty, the odor of alone.  I circle you and your friends, slipping between, and gone I am invisible if you look, silent if you listen, texturless to feeling, Odorless to bloodhounds. You’ll never find me if you seek.  Fenris"
OHU04IN,male,26,"Well now you little postaholics, bet you never expected to run into a new post already.  It is sufficent to say, I am trying to keep my mind busy, very busy.  Some are no doubt shaking their heads wondering when my poor little brain isn’t busy with too many things to process.  Well, that’s true, and I usually let it run and run, but this time, there are some ideas and thoughts that I don’t want to dwell on.  But all that is beside the point.  When I got home from work today, my folks had gotten home from my brother’s retirement ceremony.  He’s retired/retiring from the air force.  That too is beside the point, I know, I know, get on with it already, well here you go.  My dad was watching one of my all time favorite movies, The Rookie, about that teacher that goes to the Major Leagues in his forties.  I am a sap I know, but when he gets called up, and he has that look of joy… well, it reminds me that dreams do come true.  The story of Jim Morris and his rise to the major leagues is the story of baseball.  For those who don’t know (I manage to keep it pretty well hidden) I am a huge fan of baseball.  It is a sport that grew out of the most difficult time this country has ever gone through, the American civil war.  Baseball is America to me.  I don’t know exactly how to express how I feel about it.  Baseball is not a game I watch on TV, and it has been a long time since I followed my favorite team (Atlanta) during the season.  But I will always stop and watch a few minutes of a little league game, or maybe an inning or two on TV.  I really don’t watch much TV so most of the time I run into a game it’s live.  I remember buying Topps cards with the chewing gum with the cards.  I also remember cutting my mouth on that same gum, from the fifties I think.  Once I even managed to blow a bubble with some of it, four or five packs went into that bubble if I remember correctly, and I got a Tony Gwynn.  I remember playing ball my junior year of high school.  Something about that uniform, having it on made me feel right.  I honestly think that a baseball jersey is one of the classiest looking shirts in the world.  Now if you have been paying attention, you have already realized, I never ever claimed to be any good at playing baseball, heck, I’m not very good at slow pitch softball.  But that is all beside the point.  I own a ball glove, and I have a few baseballs kicking around.  There is nothing in this world like a game of catch with a friend.  The feel of letting the ball fly, the sharp snap of a baseball in a well used glove, the sound of summer.  Satisfaction is to be had in a game of catch.  I don’t know if I have gotten anything across here except I am more than a little verbose and I like baseball.  I really like baseball.  I like what it used to mean and what it means.  So I guess that this whole post is dedicated to the boys of summer, from Babe Ruth to Hank Aaron, from Jackie Robinson to Nolan Ryan.  To the day I saw Mark Maguire knock number 62 out of the park.  To those guys who tried and failed, like Mr. Manning, my ninth grade English teacher.  To Jimmy Morris.  To a six year old some where breaking in his first glove. To an old man who played ball as a young man just home from World War Two.  To any one who has held that little white ball, swung a bat, or caught heard and felt the snap as their glove closes around the ball.  To baseball, to summer, to youth, to dreams.  Fenris"
OHU04IN,male,26,"I have been thinking a lot about friends recently.  I never had that many until the past few years.  I can't quite figure out how a goof ball nerd like me gets to have the coolest friends.  I guess that is just the way it breaks in life sometimes.  But anyway, I have been thinking about how I watch my friends interact.  They seem to be a pretty good bunch of folks.  They never seem to judge each other.  There is always a healthy dose of teasing and button pushing, but it never seems to enter the cold malicious deliberate stage where people intend to destroy other people.  I am still getting used to having multiple friends, some in Logan, some in the basin, some in Provo, and a very very good friend in Kaysville.  I will not belabor the part about my friend in Kaysville, because those who know me know that I talk almost incessantly about her and you have or will hear me talk about her at some point or other.  I am not going to apologize for that.  I am in love folks, and ya just have to deal with it.  Anyway, like I said, this group of friends thing is new to me, and most of you have heard me thank you for your friendship.  Well, with fingers crossed (you have no idea how hard it is to type that way) I will try to put in words what friends mean to me, and why at some point I will thank you for your friendship.       No one is ever forced to become good friends with anyone else.  It is a free choice made by a person to like and trust, on some level, another person.  Now, for someone to accept a friend, well now, that is expressing trust and granting a value to the person befriended.  Not to say that the befriended person had no value before, but their value has gone up because someone besides god has recognized their value.  Come on, you know it's true, when you are valued by another person you feel better about your self.  Anyway, when I thank people for being my friend/friends, I am not groveling and saying thanks for giving me value, I am saying Thank you for recognizing my value and choosing to associate with me, it's simple people, don't tell me how easy it is to be friends with me, don't tell me it is silly to thank you.  All I am doing is saying thanks for reaffirming my value in God's eyes.  Because when you break it down, that is what friends do.  Any way, enough said this post.  Thank you all for being friends with me.  Also, if you are not my friend and you read this, well, you really are missing out, because I happen to belong to several of the greatest groups of friends on the face of the Earth."

RI0870P,female,27,"This is my second try at this.  My first attempt failed partly due to laziness, partly due to technical ineptitude, partly due to my horror at realizing that people might actually read it.  So why do it at all?  The same reason people scream in an empty room.  The same reason people have sex in public bathrooms.  The same reason we look away when we want to stare.  Because we all want to be heard, respected, loved.   urlLink Because we are all cowards."
RI0870P,female,27,"So we're buying a house.  It's something that most people do at some point in their lives.  In fact, at this particular point in my life it seems like just about everyone is buying a house, so not wanting to stir the pot, we thought we'd buy one too.  Of course, we went about it in the most methodical, cautious, and sane way possible.  Which is to say we poked around on the internet for about a week, drove past about five houses and looked at two, the second one of which we bought without ever having hired a realtor.  Now that the tornado of paperwork has cleared and we're in debt for the rest of our lives, we're beginning to realize that our house is a fixer-upper, and we, well, we don't actually know how to  fix  anything.  Isn't that fun?  At least my mother has been supportive.  When I told her that we bought a house she said, ""That's great, but what are you going to do when the housing market collapses next year?""  We've taken to driving by the house every day at least once while our financer and realtor armwrestle for the final purchace agreement.  I think my husband does it because he enjoys it.  He imagines us getting old there, raising many generations of cats, planting tulips.  I do it because every time we go past I see one more thing that is terribly, terribly wrong, and so my sense of overwhelming dread is justified.  The windows need to be fixed.  The outside stucco needs to be fixed.  It's in a neighborhood with three apartment buildings and a block away from the railroad tracks.  There is a giant hole in the front yard.  The garage is about to fall over.  The gutters need to be replaced.  On and on the list goes, until my mental picture is not that I'm moving into a house, but a giant, money-sucking hole in the ground with little more to protect me from the elements than a plywood roof and a clothes line.  At least one thing I do know how to fix is a good, stiff drink."
RI0870P,female,27,"Well, the party was mainly a success.  We didn’t manage to finish the keg, but there was also no nakedness (although I do find myself secretly disappointed, like maybe our party wasn’t worthy of nakedness).  Nothing and no one got broken, and even people from completely different arms of our social circle seemed to get along and make new friends, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.  Unfortunately, staying up way too late means my body is quickly being overtaken by a horrific cold, so I also feel kind of achy and foggy.  I am currently in that sick limbo where I feel completely fatigued and crappy, but I don’t sound bad enough to call in sick to work.  But it's not too bad since my job consists of sitting in a chair and staring at a computer screen, which is probably what I would be doing if I were at home anyway.  Life in the fast lane won’t allow me much repose, though, because this evening I have yet another raucous party to attend.  There will most definately be nakedness at this one, but instead of a big hairy drunken man, it will be in the form of my over-stimulated three year old nephew.  I bought him a dump truck and shovels in bright, primary plastic, because he loves to make volcanoes in the sand.    Three years ago today he was born in the Fairview hospital, during a terrible summer rainstorm, about three months early.  We rushed over as soon as we got the call despite the green sky and rain.  I still vividly remember standing in the ICU, wet and shell shocked, offering bleary congratulations to my freaked out brother-in-law.  I remember watching this little thing no bigger than my forearm reaching towards me with tiny fingers, while my sister, feet still numb, giggled and cried simultaneously.  I had absolutely no idea what was going on—just a vague astonishment that this was a brand new person, slightly red and wrinkled.    Now he’s waist high.  He knows all his colors, how to count to five, and that farts are really funny.  He’s sweet and naughty and has the most amazing blue eyes.  He likes to run fast, tickle people and play with things he thinks are gross.  Everyone has their opinions, but I think he’s going to grow up to be a famous writer.  Happy birthday, Rory."
RI0870P,female,27,"Well, it’s over.  Just like that.  We didn’t hug.  We didn’t make any promises to see one another again, promises we knew we couldn’t keep.  We said our goodbyes, dry eyed and without drama, as if it didn’t matter.  As if there had never been anything between us.  As if I was just another dental patient.  It may seem silly, but I was a little bit surprised that after all we’ve been through together—the eighteen x-rays, the abscess, the botched root canal, the two huge cavities threatening to overtake the tender pulp—that there wasn’t a little bit more to our farewell.  At least a pat on the shoulder and a “See you around, kiddo.”  But I suppose the operative dentistry waiting room isn’t the place for pathos, and seeing MJ so blithe, all I could do was eek out a timid “Congratulations on finishing dental school!”  He laughed, looked a little confused, and walked away.  There was a moment as I sat in the chair waiting for the instructor’s OK on my Mesial Distal when he started to say, “You know, you are…” and I thought he would say  …my best, sweetest patient.  I’ll always remember the day you walked in with your gums full of bacteria and a look of terror on your face.   But all he said was “…my very last case.”  Luckily, because my mouth was stuck open with two vacuum tubes and various sharp metal things sticking out of it, he probably didn’t register my look of disappointment.  I left feeling just the slightest bit used.  Was I just an interesting case?  A smorgasbord of textbook problems?  Another mouth on which to practice direct pulp capping with adhesive resins?  But it was not a total loss.  The dental assistant did compliment me on the productivity of my saliva glands.  And MJ did massage my jaw when I said that it was beginning to get stiff (which actually sounded more like “Aaaw!  Aaaw!”).     And I did get my last filling for free."
RI0870P,female,27,"The weather today is  urlLink unseasonably cold .  Raindrops and wind in the morning, and a brisk blue sky in the afternoon.  It feels much more like October than August, so it’s a little disconcerting look out the window in the morning, still clinging to the blanket, and see the trees still so full and green.  This is orange and yellow weather.  Soup weather.   People are wearing sweaters and drinking coffee but there isn’t a single class to go to or a pumpkin in sight.   As I walked to work, I could feel my nose gradually turning from its usual slight wino-pink to a terrifically undignified cherry red, but I didn’t even care.  The breeze swept through me and gave my insides a little more loft.  I feel re-inflated.  Crystallized.  I feel parts of me churning back to life.  Maybe that’s why I’ve been so obsessed lately with the dangers of dormant potential.  I can feel myself being revived in the dim corners of my brain.  I think that every person on earth could be described as a hurricane in a lead can.  True, some keep the lid off.  Others keep the seal so tight there is barely the hint of a breeze.  Some push everyone and everything around them just to keep the momentum going.  Others suffocate it to a wheeze.  Every single one of us has the capacity to churn the universe into something of our own creation, if we could only figure out how.  Problem is, we really don’t know how unless we’re Jesus.  I love this cool weather because it has allowed me to indulge in a little inner chaos.  It gets my blood pumping.  Makes me want to walk fast to nowhere in particular.  Stirs up the damp, dormant thoughts.  Speaks of change and possibilities.  Lets me get carried away.  So there."
RI0870P,female,27,"Ah, the Academy.  Beacon of truth, justice, and ideals.  A symbol of cooperation and humanitarianism--the very origin of the accomplishments of man.    This was where I wanted to spend my life, imparting my knowledge onto the  tabula rasa   of tender-eared Freshmen, collaborating with my colleagues, conspiring to make the world a better, righteous, and pure place.    When I first took this job, marginal and low-paying as it was, I thought I was in heaven.  My stapling experience had finally paid off, and now I was moving up to a place where people thought for a living.  Imagine that.   Thinking , for a living.  And then you get to tell people what you think, listen to them tell you what they think you think, and have three months off to think about thinking for next year.  With all of that thinking around me, it wouldn't matter that I wasn't faculty, because these easy-going (three months off!), reasonable (thinking, remember, thinking!) people would treat me just the same, honoring my contribution to our collective mission.  In a way I was right.  They do treat me the same as they do their colleagues.  I get the same passive-aggressive emails, the same tantrum phone calls, and the very same evil, posturing lectures.  The corporate law firm that I worked in before this atrophied my soul.  This place tries it's best to downright kill it.    I know I was naive, and I know that I, of all people, should have known better.  Both of my parents were professors here, and though I never knew the exact reason that they both retired early, I certainly can't deny the whiffs of bitterness that came from any conversation relating to their careers.  In the end, they were dinosaurs to their department, adherents to an old cannon that quickly gave way to the Politically Correct nineties.  I mean really, who needs Shakespeare in this day and age anyway?  Just another dead white guy.  But that's not how knowledge is supposed to work, is it?  I always thought it was a process of building on ideas, of adding and enhancing, so that our understanding was richer, more complete.  Instead it seems like a game of proving who is right and who is wrong, then tossing dollar bills to the winner.  Of course, it doesn't help that our dear Governor Dickface has been consistently cutting funds to the University ever since he took office three years ago, so Department Chairs are beginning to resemble a circling pack of starving hyenas.  Now both my husband and I are on tracks that will make us completely unemployable by anyone except the academy, and I'm beginning to come to the realization that I really, really don't want to become these people.  I don't want to sacrifice honesty and friendship for a good wine party quip.  I don't want to spend my life envying my colleague's accomplishments, or catfighting for official praise.  All I can do is hope that maybe there is some place that is not like this.  Maybe somewhere in the Vermont woods, or the Himalayas, there is a group of people who haven't let go of the idea that sometimes being happy is better than being right."
RI0870P,female,27,"I urge everyone to support  urlLink this cause .  Of the three candidate states, I think Alabama is probably the most logical choice, as I have never had the desire to spend absolutely any time in it, or any of the states it boarders.  South Carolina is out of the question, since I've heard it has a nice beach.  Mississippi is a second choice, but even that might be a littl risky since it is close to New Orleans, and I fear that may result in contamination of the pure hedonism I hold dear.  I urge everyone to contribute all of their support, prayers, money, and redneck family members.  The plan may be aborted if they receive fewer than 50,000 participants (is that a biblical number, I wonder?) so keep a sharp lookout!

RI0870P,female,27,"I was in Madison this last weekend, enjoying a tenuous peace with some of my more conservative in-laws, when we heard about the death of Ronald Reagan.  After a few of the usual gasps and exclamations that follow news of any famous person’s death, my brother-in-law let out the most heart-breaking moan, turned to me and said: “I bet you’re really happy about this, aren’t you.”  I was a little shocked.  I thought I had shown remarkable strength in not starting a political argument about what we were eating for breakfast, and here I was being accused of callously wishing death on a defenseless, senile old man.  I know that most Republican Americans believe that liberalism is just  urlLink a tool of the antichrist  for world domination, but I’m hardly going to start picking on someone who probably can’t even tie his own shoes.  I wasn’t happy.  Alzheimer’s is a terrible disease and a long, torturous death.  I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.  In fact, I don’t think that I’ve ever had a particularly negative opinion about Reagan.  I was too young during his presidency to see the actual effects of his policies.  I was too young to listen to the Dead Kennedys or get the political undertones of Bruce Springsteen songs.  I was too young to understand that Iran Contra revealed anything more serious than that Oliver North was an idiot.  Any opinion I had of Reagan was my parents’ opinion, and that pretty much amounted to knowing that the wrong team had won.  Now, watching the gears of the political machine slowly shift direction so that they can use the momentum of Reagan’s death for their own gain, I’m starting to wish I had been happy, because the next couple of months are going to be painfully depressing.  Even  urlLink Kerry  announced that he’s going to stop campaigning for a week as a sign of respect (that’ll show those pesky critics that he’s not a centrist waffler), and I am just waiting for the tsunami swell of conservative memorials, retrospectives and commemorations, all with little Gee-Dubya perched on top.  Just you watch: Reagan will become the biggest American political hero since FDR.  And despite my not hating Reagan during his presidency, and despite the fact that I would never wish such a horrible death even on the human equivalent of a banana slug, must we forget in our posthumous huzaas that this  urlLink great leader  was called an airhead by his own authorized biographer?   ""There is a basic inability of the political mind, the ideological mind ... to comprehend that a great man can be fallible in private, can sometimes be  urlLink comically fallible  in private."""
RI0870P,female,27,"Stiff again.  I probably did more yard work yesterday than I have done in nearly a decade, simply because it is the first time in that long that I have had a yard.  As I raked and dug and poked, working up some respectable blisters, I realized something completely unexpected: I was actually enjoying myself.    I don't know how it happened, but I loved the smell of dirt.  I loved that I was breaking a sweat.  I loved working in the afternoon sunlight filtering through the leaves of our apple tree.  I felt rugged and satisfied.  I felt empowered.  I felt happier and more at peace than I have in months.  It just crept up on me.  After all of my complaining that I would never be able to tell a weed from a flower, I found myself unable to sleep last night as I mapped out the raised beds where I’m going to plant all of my hostas.  Maybe a year or two down the road, I plant a dogwood tree.  And some yaro.  And lots of daylilies.  Today I have been forced to admit that I may wish I was punk rock, but yesterday was proof that I am just a hippy offspring trying to contort myself into an urbane pose.  I like camping.  I like growing things.  I like eating food that’s good for me, and mornings when I wake up early and I’m not too hung-over to enjoy the sunrise.  I like—dare I admit it?—world music.  There, I’ve done it.  I’ve completely lost my edge.  Now you know that all of my angst is really just a put-on to hide the granola sentimentality beneath.

RI0870P,female,27,"When I was nine my father had a double bypass operation, and he decided that before he stared death in the face again there were a few things he wanted to get done.  Europe was one of those things.    So with my dad's healing chest looking like a YKK zipper he bundled us all on a plane to Munich, bought a VW van, and drove us through almost the entire western half of the continent in three months.  Sometimes my parents ask me if I remember all of the historically and culturally significant places I saw.  When they talk about how lucky I was to have played in Trevi Fountain, all I can remember is my perfect aim when I squeezed my hands together in the water, resulting in a spray that hit my sister dead in the crotch.  There were some big statues around, though.  But there was one thing that even my nine-year-old irreverent self was in awe of, and that was Europe's Cathedrals.  Coming from the Midwest, Cathedrals are few an far between, and none of them have that heavy, ghostly quality of something that has been around for centuries.  In fact most of them are a sort of 70's translation of grandeur; they all have the greenish burbur carpet, abstract rectangles of colored glass, and of course the ubiquitous gold-flecked laminate lamp covers.  Europe's Cathedrals were built by people who thought worship was serious business.  You won't see some hippie with a guitar singing in the Notre Dame.  No matter what country we were in, there was always one old woman dressed all in black kneeling in front of the largest statue, looking as if she were praying to the lord to spare the life of her first-born son.  There was lots of dark wood, giant blooms of red and blue glass, with several panes depicting the solemn, leaded faces of saints.  The smell of dust and the strangely comforting mildew of old books was everywhere, and hundreds of votives flickered at the feet of Jesus, Mary, and a few saints, their marble faces a smooth, quiet tragedy.       My sister and I went to a Cathedral nearly every afternoon we were in Europe.  We dropped our coins in the donation box and each lit a candle.  I don't know what my sister did, but as the flame began to catch I always whispered some prayer I can't remember, some ferverent wish that my nine-year-old heart must have thought was the most important thing in the world.    I'm not a religious person.  Confused is probably the best description of my spiritual upbringing.  My mother is a Catholic who hates the Pope, and my father is an agnostic when he's feeling generous (mostly he's an atheist who can't understand why all of these reasonable people went crazy).  But for a good year after I was in Europe I set up a little shrine in my room, lit a candle, and prayed to the Virgin Mary every night.  She was, after all, a mother, and like most little girls I was fairly convinced that mothers were holy.  But the most important element was trying to recreate the weight of those Cathedrals; I wanted the heavy, history laden air, the feeling that I carried with me every person who had ever lit a candle, closed their eyes, and hoped for something good to happen.  These days, with Mel Gibson's big budget gore-fest ruffling feathers, I am back to my religiously ambiguous ways.  I still like the idea of Santa Clause.  Buddha was an okay guy.  That's pretty much where my thinking on the matter ends.  But regardless of who hates who or which history is deemed the right one or what the true significance of a little strip of celluloid is, sometimes I still stop to think of the fact that hundreds of spectacular man-made works of art dot the earth.  Each is vastly different in aesthetic and religious context, and each fantastic in their own way, but the one thing that joins all of them is that they were built in homage.  The homage of our ability to dream of better things."

DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, school is over for the semester finally. WOOHOO!!  I had 2 classes this term, (a B- and a B) which I've decided is almost too much to do at the same time as working a full-time job, being active in CubScouts as a Pack Leader/Den   Leader, and trying to help people with their home PC's. I've got to find out how to get my grades yet, as I'm eager to see what I ended up with. Plus, I'd like to get submitted for tuition reimbursement (money NEVER hurts).   It'll be nice to have my Monday/Thursday evenings open for the next couple of months for a change. The boys and I have really gotten into playing Disc Golf©. We have a really awesome course here, just a hard one for beginners due to the EXTREAMLY number of trees lining the course. It's a very beautiful course, located by Veteran's Memorial Park on the west side of the park.  The oldest son and I went down Sunday at 1, as they had mentioned on the local Cable access channel that they would be having 2hrs of lessons, for $5/person with a disc included.  We were there, and the only other person to show up was the instructor.  They mentioned about pre-registering but I hadn't seen anything on the TV about that. They said we didn't have to pay but I still did, just to cover their time.  The guy who was teaching us REALLY knows his stuff, and is going to be playing at the World's in Des Moines, Iowa this August.  He's an Amateur in the PDGA, and said next year he'll probably go Pro.  That guy can really heave a disc.  On the 10th hole, which is 400ft, he JUST missed the basket, and that was with just 1 throw. He was able to tell after seeing me throw 2x, that I used to play tons of Frisbee when I was a kid/teen.  I have to remember to follow through with my throw, and also have my arm higher up when I throw, as I hold it too low.    He was saying that I should also use a power grip when I throw from the tee too, as the more power I throw it with, the more the disc will spin, and the further it will go.  After seeing the way this dude threw, I want to throw like that too.  He also showed me a handy throw, where I throw the disc side armed, and instead of pulling my arm all the way back like I'm going to throw a baseball, I just take it about half-way back, and snap my elbow forward, and give my hand a flick, and it will send the disc out straight, and then cause it to curve to the right. This kind of throw will be extremely handy on the 8th hole, where they turned it into a dog-leg.  Only thing is I need a new disc for it, as the only one I have that’s good for that throw I let my youngest son have.   We've just gotten into the sport really, this spring, and we already have 11 discs between us.  Course, this is nothing, as our instructor Sunday says he has about 200.  This guy knew all the stats on the discs that we had even, being able to tell us which ones were the better ones, their speed and turning ratios, everything. He was very impressive and I hope he does really well at the Worlds.   It goes on for 5 days, and there are 5 courses in  Des Moines with each player playing 1 course a day.    It was also very hot Sunday while we played.  It was 83° and humid, so when we got back to the car after playing 18 holes, I was soaked.  I got the boy and I some PowerAid to carry on the course, and we had that gone by the time were on the 15th.  We got back to the car, we had some water bottles that we had with ice in them, and they   were totally melted due to how hot the car got.  All I cared about was the fact that it felt ubber-cool as I poured half of it over my head.  Boy did that feel good!  After watching the Disc Golf© Dude throwing like he did, it makes me want to practice that much more so I can be a 10th of how good he is."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, Mr Migraine paid me a visit again yesterday.  We had a wonderful time, we all went out to the Swiss Valley Park Nature center area for a hike.  It was a  VERY  windy day, so on occasion, the 52deg weather felt  REALLY  cold.  We probably walked a mile or two, on very squishy ground. Was a very beautiful day and we had an excellent time.  Afterwards, we made our way over to Culvers. That was a good experience even.  Then we came home.  Then that tell-tale sign of the right temple started to throb.  I got up and took 1000mg of tylenol, hoping it might help some. Well, wonder of wonders, it didn't.  So, at 7:20 I climbed in bed. But...being me, an Episode of  STAR TREK: Enterprise  on that I hadn't seen, so I stupidly continued to watch it.  I made it to the end, and happy that it turned out to be a really decent and thought provoking episode.   Then I tried to get to sleep, and that was fit-full. Z*lda was working on quilt-squares or something, as I was laying in bed.  She stopped, and grabbed the ice-pack that I had handy, and I put that on my temple to try to help (think it did help some).  Then, I had that rumbling in the tummy that told me I'd best move toward the bathroom.  Huh, what do you know, my tummy was right for a change.   After the massive bought of vomiting I had, I went back to bed, and felt better for about 10 minutes. Then the hot/cold flashes started. I think I fell asleep toward the start of them for a change, and went into dreamy non-migraine pained bliss.  Think it's time to check in with the doc to see if he has any migraine meds in-stock yet, or if I should just break down and have him give me a prescription.    If I get a prescription, I think I'll see if I can get the inhaler and pill form of Imitrex.  I've found that my best luck is to take a tablet when I can start to feel the signs of a migraine, and then an hr later use the inhaler. That seems to give me the best protection.  I've had that fight off a migraine on a few occasions that way.  The doctor has the injector version, but I just cant get into the idea of giving myself a shot (shudders). I hate needles as it is, and just cant get past the idea of using one myself.  I know...I'm a wimp.  I'll stick with the pill and inhaler form of it.  So I put in another Saturday night in bed with a migraine. Got up about 8:40, so only about 13:30 hrs in bed again.  Migraines, what a wonderfully relaxing way to spend your evening."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Wow! What can I say? We went and see Spider Man 2 at the theatre last night, and it's just awesome.  The special effects for Spidey this time are incredible and very fluid. I couldn't spot any obvious jumps between live action and CGI.  The story was awesome, got a bit boring at times, and didn't screw with the ideas set with the comic book as badly as the 1st one did.  They have all the cast from the 1st movie back, with a short appearance of William DeFoe at the end.   The actor they picked to play Dr. Otto Octavious is perfect. The guy couldn't of been any better a choice if they tried, he was out and out perfect for the roll.    I must say that I'm very impressed with it, dont want to go into details and ruin it for anyone reading (there are people reading this site still I hope?). All I can say is that when this bad boy comes out on DVD, there will be a place on our shelf waiting for it.  On a side note, picked up a fun old movie that just came out on DVD last month. Wizards.  Who remembers that one?  Different type movie, but it's fun as well. Was interesting seeing Avatar the hero in action again. It's a movie that tells the tale of good vs evil (go figure) but this time, good is 3000+yrs old, is kinda horney, and gets the girl in the end (not literally, who knows might happen off screen tho)."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"I'm taking Intro to Programming, as part of my college course right now. I'm learning to write in Visual Basic.net and it's quite interesting. It has a user interface that is incredibly easy to use.  I have my first program due tonight, it's really basic and simple. It just asks for you to input your age and resting heart rate, and it returns what your training heart rate should be.  Very simple.     But I was having a mental block, trying to remember how to get my data from the user.  Then I was like, DUH, smacked my forehead, and then put it in.  For my first program, I've probably got 2-3hrs of playing around trying to remember how to get the input. After I remembered, it took 60 seconds if that, for me to have it working.  I'm so proud!  Can you say WOOHOO!  So I have my program all printed out, and on a diskette to turn in tonight, along with my 20 or so exercises that were assigned.  I'm quite happy that I have my homework 100% and ready to turn in.  It's a relief to just sit down for 5 minuets, and know, that you have nothing due right THIS instant, and can just relax.   Life is always about being busy busy busy busy busy.. It's about cramming as much into your waking hours as you can, before it's time for you to die.  You don't want to have accomplished nothing.  But....sometimes that nothing is just as important, so you can de-stress for a few minutes, before getting your nose ground against the grinders wheel.  Relax! Monday's almost done!"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"In less then 12hrs, I'm going to take our oldest son, and we're going to go see Return of the King.  I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing this.  Peter Jackson has done an awesome job with the Lord of the Rings series.  Granted, they've taken GREAT leeway with the story, putting in stuff here, taking out stuff there, totally screwing with whats really in the book here and there, but who's complaining? :-)  I'm really looking forward to seeing Shelob on the big screen. Plus the army of the dead, that'll be interesting to see as well.  3:20 is going to be alonnnnnnnnnggggg time sitting in that seat.  Going to have to make that soda last awhile.  Will post my opinons of the movie soon!"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Finally got to use the snow blower today.  I tried it Thursday night, and discovered, that it was out of gas.  So today, while talking with my Dad, I asked what the ratio should be.  You have to add 2.5oz of 2cycle oil to 1gal of gas for this little monster.  Well, I went out, started up the car, cleared off the snow, went down to my local Big A   and paid $10 for a 2.5gal gas can, and 1 quart of oil.    I made it easy on myself and just put in 5oz of oil into the gas can while I was still in the store. Made sense, I was nice and warm and it easy with it on the counter.  I figured that would work out great anyway, as when I then went to the gas station and put in 2gal of gas, it mixed it up nicely for me.  Get home, fill that bad boy up, take it out front, and then, pull my brains out to get it to start. It didnt like being cold either.     Finally got it going, and then proceeded to do the snow around our old blue beater mobile. Took care of that really fast, and I was beginning to think I might like this.  So I went past our neighbors drive way, to where I had parked our nice car yesterday, and started to clean that out.  When I left, so did our neighbor upstairs, and I beat her back, so I put our car in the clean spot in front of the house.  Z*lda and the boys were leaving shortly for a swimming party anyway.  So I proceeded to just do a 30ft stretch behind a burried in car.  I even helped by clearning the street almost up to her bumper.  It was VERY hot work though. I even did some of the street, connecting to the neighbors driveway, as I figure if it was clean, it would make it easier for us to park in front of our house.   I then went and did the side walk where I got snow on it from the street. Then for the heck of it, I even did the little sidewalk that goes between the two houses to the south of us.  I figure, it's helping out w/o being asked, and lots of neighbor kids cut through on that sidewalk on their way home from school.     Just like the BoyScout motto says ""Do a good turn daily""."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"I was home from work about 30 minutes late, to make up for doing to the doc during the afternoon.  When I got home, the family was gone. They were about 10 minutes behind me..     Z*lda said she was going to go to a garage sale out by John Deere Road. I was like, ok, sure, go ahead.  She comes back awhile later, and as I come into the living room says ""I picked this up, is it worth anything?""  Just from the shape of the package I knew it was a Palm Pilot, but not what kind. It could of been anything really old as an original Palm One or 1000, or something newer.   Boy was I in for a surprise! I take it out of the bubble wrap, and it's a Palm M515! in perfect/brand new condition!!!!  I was like OMFG!!! What did you pay for this!  She then said he had $35 on it, but she only had $26 on her, so he sold it to her for that, plus the 3-4 other things she had in her arms!!!   I checked it out on Pricewatch, and it still sells for $241 shipped! OMFG! This is just incredible!!   And it works! Beautifully too!  It's got 16 megs of memory, and runs 33mhz, and is color!   Now, in a PDA, thats awesome!  Plus I can buy one of those new style memory cards to put into it and increase it's ram. I've got tons of software installed on it, and files put onto it already (with other stuff left to transfer yet), and it STILL has 10megs of space left (has 4 megs of memory thats used I'm assuming by the Palm OS 4.01.   This is so frellin kewl!!   Now the youngest is eager as I said if I ever got a new PDA he could have my HandSpring Visor Deluxe. Now he cant wait to get it! :-)"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, most of the weekend went pretty well.  We went out to the River Walk by the Grand Harbor resort Saturday.  What a windy/chilly day to go for a stroll along the river!  And we saw 13 people who just had to be out of their minds!  We walked past the restort, and over the rail-road tracks, by the ShotTower.  We stood at the top of the north end of the sidewalk, and saw 13 people standing on the MIDDLE of the frozen Mississippi river ice fishing!     This is a ways down-stream from the lock and dam.  We've heard the river moaning/cracking before, but to see *13* people ice fishing ON it [shakes head] that just seems nuts. Especially since the temp has been getting into the 40's the last week. We had snow and rain Friday, and more rain today.  The forcast calls for temps in the 40's all week [spring is springing!! WOOHOO!!].  Well, after the walk along the river, we went to BestBuy. I want to get a copy of DVD X Copy before they are forced to take it off the shelf. It's a really easy to use program, to use with your DVD burner. You can then make a back-up copy of your DVD.  The court says it's illegal now, but why not? Why should you not be allowed to make a backup copy, so incase your original gets scratched beyond all recognition and wont read anymore, should you not be allowed to backup your DVD?  Pure stupidity on the courts side..  Then we went over to the mall, to look around in the book store   and then wonder around in the video store and the game store.  Then it was off to Bishops to do as much as we could stand to eat from their buffett  .   It was in Best Buy that my head started to throb. Bright sunlight from out side, and while I was looking at software, some guy is on a PC right behind me, with MP3's he wants to buy BLASTING behind my head.  We got home about 4:45-5pm, and the first thing I did was to crawl in bed.  Where I thankfully fell asleep. I did wake up about 8-8:30 feeling totally ready to puke, but didn't, and fell back asleep.  I got out of bed at 8am... so that put me in bed sleeping for roughly 15hrs.  Yup, thats a very productive time..  Considering I had 50 pages to read for class, and 40 excersises to do, plus a program....all for tomorrow night.  Well, I've got the first 2 sections of exercices done, still have 10 pages to read, and a program to write.  I have some after work, that I'll work on my program. I'll get the reading and problems done yet tonight.  Oh the joy of being a college student!"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, we were going to go to the 11:45am showing of Return of the King (#1 son and myself).  Well, off to a semi-slow start to the morning, we went to the 2:45 showing instead.  We took christmas candy in a ziplock baggy, got our 2 matinee tickets, and then spent $9.50 on pop and popcorn.  The theatre was surprisingly empty.  It got to maybe half-full if that by the time the movie started.  We sat through the previews for Spider-Man 2, and Harry Potter 3 (both look like they are going to be really good).  #1 son had to get up and use the bathroom 1x during the movie. I was able to make it the whole way through w/o an interruption.  Just as a side note, it started to snow as we left. We had a quarter inch of snow when we left. When we got outside and back to the car, we had 2inches or so.  The roads were slick, but not too bad a driving experience.    The movie.  What can I say?  I did like it but did get bored several times.  There were a few things that again, were blatantly ADDED to the book.  Just like in The Two Towers when Frodo and Sam are taken by Faramir to Osgilliath, the oliphants in ROTK just didn't exist. It was dissapointing, but still an interesting scene.  There were parts of the movie that were spot-on, and others, that were totally ass-backwards. Some reason, I thought Aragorn would of looked alot more kingly at the end ceremony, but he looked like Stridder cleaned up. In the book he LOOKS like the King who has come back.  I guess I cant be completely happy with what they did, who could if they have read the books.   But as a movie, if you never ever read the real thing, it'll be a great series.  Even if you've read the books, they are still an awesome series...their just not the same though..if you know what I mean.  If your a Steven King fan, you'll know what I mean lol  It'll be interesting to see how it goes if they can manage to get the rights to do The Hobbit.  Since they did LOTR, The Hobbit should be spectacular!"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Here's hoping that everyone has a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!  I'll be watching my new set of Firefly on DVD, that my family so nicely got me for Christmas! Nothing like spending the holidays with Mal, Jayne, Zoe, Book, and the gang :-)  Oh, cant forget Serinity :-)"
UXEGK7T,female,16,"I had a pretty awesome night.   Great friends, awesome food, laughs.  The realization that this title doesn't belong to you.   A surprisingly cool mom.   It definitely felt like summer with a few good surprises from people I've missed.  Sadly, you weren't one of those people. I may end up losing you, but everything will be for the better in the end."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"When we were younger we were the best of friends.  We knew each other better than we knew ourselves.  Despite months of not seeing each other because of the distance between us, we could always pick up where we had left off the last time.  We came to treasure our sleepovers more than life itself.  There are pictures of us at family gatherings and we're holding onto each others hands as though they were glued together.  We could laugh about everything, including getting in trouble because it never happened to one of us without the other when we were together.  We still go months without seeing each other, and recent pictures don't show us holding hands.  Somehow getting in trouble just isn't as funny as it used to be.  But we still treasure time together, and we still know each other better than ever.  And we're still the best of friends."
UXEGK7T,female,16,I saw you crying and I felt the same way.  I hate crying in front of people.  But I love you! I'm here for you  Good friends are like antiques; they are more precious with time.                                           -Anonymous
UXEGK7T,female,16,I'm scared for my mom.  She says she hasn't been feeling well lately and she's been really tired.  What if she has a relapse? I doubt she'll be willing to put herself through the torture of chemotherapy again.  There's a real possibility that I could lose my mom if she has a relapse.  I don't want those responsibilities anymore.  I just want to be a kid.
UXEGK7T,female,16,"I feel like we've just met.  Like we're becoming friends and we love each other but neither knows much of the inner workings of the other.  Because that's how it goes.  You love me and I love you more than words can say, but rather than knowing more about each other over all these years I feel like we know less.  I don't like it.  I'm here for you to talk to.  I won't laugh at you and I'll help you when I can I promise.  You can talk to me, I want you to.  I just want to know how you feel."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"Music is funny.  It can remind you of people or times.  It can make you feel every different emotion possible in the course of three minutes.  It can bring people together.  It can teach people about things they never knew before.  There are a few songs that remind me of when I was little.  A few that remind me of summer.  A few that give me this indescribable feeling when I hear the beginnings.  Some that I just want to scream the words to.  I love all the old stuff, and the stuff that's all new to me.  Music is amazing."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"Its been quite the few days!  It feels like the summer has already come.  Of course, the whole school thing ruined that.  But only one more day to go!!  I can't wait to get a fresh start next year.  I'm actually, in a way, looking forward to the new school year.Of coyrse, I'm looking forward to the summer more!!!!  It will be a good one, I can feel it!!  Manda, I'm here for you.  Anything you need, I'll do it.  *twiddle*"
UXEGK7T,female,16,"I love being silly.  It just lets me let go and not think about anything.  I don't care if people think I'm weird, they probably already do anyway.  I absolutely love just laughing out loud or burping and seeing someone smile and shake they're head.  ""There she goes again!"" they probably all think.  And I don't care.  I walked into a wall today.  Hard.  And I thought it was hilarious.  I wasn't embarrassed despite the multitudes of kids walking behind me.  I didn't even care.  I just laughed."
UXEGK7T,female,16,It finally felt like summer.  Spending time with people who enjoy your company as much as you enjoy theirs.  Laughing at embarrassing moments :) Driving around with no real plans or places to go.  Running around barefoot on the moon.  Giggling at things that aren't really funny.  Not caring what people think :)  Being kids with no worries.  I loved every second of it and would do it again in a heartbeat.  *You make me just as happy as I make you!*
UXEGK7T,female,16,"I just realized how much I miss them.  The awesome, giddy feeling I get inside when I'm with them. The way I want to cry when I'm hugging them goodbye because I can't handle not knowing when I'll see them next.  I truly love them, and I hope they know that."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Ah, sweet bitterness.  Haven't seen you in quite a while.     John Kerry (He's a war hero, you know) has picked NC Senator Edwards as his running mate for this fall.  This was a good move for Kerry (who is a war hero, you know).  At first, I was thinking, this will bring in the southern vote for the Democrats.  But after some reflection, I don't think this is the case.  Bush is an extremely galvanizing president.  Most people who pay any attention to politics fall into three groups.  1) They LOVE Bush and he can do no wrong.  2) They used to like him, but there is an issue or two that has made them disaffected and they probably won't end up voting this time.  3) They just HATE Bush and would vote for a block of wood with a head over him just to see him OUT OF OFFICE!!!  Now personally, I fall into category 2.  I think what he is doing in the War on Terror is a good thing.  I believe things are going well in Iraq, much better than we are hearing from the major news outlets (based upon what several people who either were or are over there have told me personally).  I think the tax cuts were a very good move, as the added economic activity brought about by them gives us a multiplier effect which actually ends up bringing in MORE tax dollars.  The two issues, however, that bother me are amnesty for illegal aliens and free trade, namely the applauding of the offshoring of American jobs.  Both of these have got to stop.  With all things being equal, I believe that Amercia would do very well with free trade.  However, all things are NOT equal.  That is another rant, though.  Basically, what I see is catering to corporations by lowering the cost of labor.  So we will end up in one of TWO classes: Wealthy stockholders & Lawers, and the rest of us (fry cooks, garbage men, and wal-mart shelf-stockers).  Now, I'm sure that isn't the intention, as that is just plain evil.  It will however be the eventual result of the current economic policies.     ANYWAY, I will not vote for John Kerry (even though he's a war hero, you know).  Kerry's (who's a war hero, you know) best chance is for the above mentioned group 2 to either stay home and not vote or vote for a third party candidate.  Edwards will help accomplish that, because as of right now, most group 2 people don't have an opinion about Edwards.  However, had Kerry (who's a war hero, you know) picked Hillary Clinton, I and most other group 2 people would crawl through a pit of poisonous snakes to vote for Bush.  So, Edwards was a good choice for Kerry's (who's a war hero, you know) VP, but I doubt it will have much effect on things, since in this election, it appears that most people will either be voting for or against Bush.     Just my opinion."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Unless one believes in reincarnation, we must face the fact that we are on this earth a very limited time.  While this eliminates some problems, like giving them enough time to find us, it presents others.     As I approached the mid point of my statistical life, I took account of where I am, what I have done, and where I am going.  One common theme echoes... regret.  Regret I let myself get caught up in the moment so much during school.  Regret at not finishing my degree.  Regret that I moved away from home for so long and lost two grandmothers and a parent while I was away (not that I have only regrets about moving away, as I have made many friends in far away places).  There are also quite a number of other things I won't go into because naming them would reveal enough to the ""them"" and thus allow myself to be seen.  Although one particular thing that stands out in my mind I feel a need to tell.     When I was living down south, a minister of my youth came through with his family and we met at a restaurant near the campground at which they were staying.  Payday was four days away, so I decided not to buy them dinner, but rather give the waitress the ""separate checks"" line.  I'm sure they didn't think too much about the separate checks issue, or anything of it at all actually.  They were probably relieved that they didn't have to pay.  After dinner, we said our goodbyes, promising we would meet again when I visited *the hidden city* again.  I didn't think anything else of it... until the morning several years later when I received a call that the minister had been murdered in cold blood, leaving behind his wife and several very small children.  It turns out he was killed by a man who ""just wanted to try out his new gun.""  Of all the things that could have gone through my mind, I keep asking myself why I didn't buy him and his family dinner that night.  Not a big deal, but still, that is one of those little regrets I carry around with me.  You never know when you meet someone if it will be the last time you see them in this life.     Two men were wandering lost through the desert, scorching sun beating down on them, hot wind blowing sand in their eyes, sores on their feet filling every step through the wasteland with a steady, annoying pain.  As they walk over a sand dune, in a valley below they see a beautiful desert oasis!  Cries of joy are uttered through their parched lips as they rush down into the life saving valley.  They drink their fill of water and eat the desert fruits to their hearts content.  After a night of blissful sleep, they awaken.  One says he will stay there, content to live out his days peacefully in the beautiful paradise they have found.  The other man walks out into the desert to find other lost and dying travelers.     How many people are we leaving to die in the desert?  Would it hurt us so badly to share a bit of the blessings we have received in life?  How many more chances will we have with those around us before it is too late?"
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Teresa Heinz-Kerry told a reporter to ""shove it"". Big deal. Cheney told a senator to go f*** himself and Bush called a reporter a major league a$$hole.  Personally, I just think it is humorous that moments before, she was talking about the tone in politics and how it had become ""un-Pennsylvanian"" and in some cases ""un-American"". Then a reporter asks her what she meant by un-American and she goes off saying ""I didn't say that! I didn't say that! You are telling me something I didn't say, now shove it!"" Ironic, as she did, in fact, just say that when speaking about the tone of public debate. Too funny!  At least if Kerry somehow manages to win the upcoming election, we'll have four years of her in the public spotlight. An interesting first lady for a change. Laura Bush is too tame, pretty much staying out of the public spotlight. Hillary Clinton was just too dangerous to be funny (not because I fear powerful women as many on the left has said, but because she was far too liberal in my opinion and she had too much of a hand crafting policy). Barbara Bush was pretty entertaining, as was Nancy Reagan, but both of them were still too subdued. Oh, the chance of hilarious First-Lady shenanigans.  The only thing that disturbs me of this is what I hear coming from several liberal sources. I've read in several blogs that people think the Republicans are ""beating up on the girls"". Hey, as far as I'm concerned, you enter the public arena in a politically active role, you are fair game. Some women seem to only want equal rights when it suits them. One thing I can't stand is inconsistency of thought. Saying they are allowed to spout off anything they want and then saying the other side shouldn't rebut them in response is like putting someone in a baseball game and saying that their runs count, but not their outs.  Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, women who step into the political arena are subject to the same responses as men. Expect it and deal with it, or get off the stage*.  * note: The above commentary is merely an opinion in response, not an infringement on some poor victim's First Amendment rights."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Whoopie Goldberg has been fired as a Slim Fast spokesperson due to her performance at a Kerry fund raiser at Radio City Music Hall.  To quote the NYT: ""Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia.""  No big deal, as lots of celebs are doing this now.  Not that I care, as they are entertainers, not political pundits, and I don't give a spit in a bucket of snot what they say.  A vast majority of them don't live in reality anyway, spending their days pretending and being fawned over.  Besides, we have the First Amendment, and they can say whatever they want, right?  Well, stop the presses!  Whoopie gave her opinion and Slim-Fast FIRED her because of it!  I'm hearing a lot of screaming that this is a violation of her First Amendment rights.  WHAT HAPPENED TO FREE SPEECH???  Apparently to these people, free speech means speech without concequences, which is laughable.  Everything we do has concequences.  A ruling that Slim-Fast has no right to fire her would be a greater affront to freedom than her getting the sack.  In spite of what we are hearing from the mainstream left-leaning media, Bush is still quite popular as a president.  Her comments could, and probably would, impact their sales.  It was a sound business decision to fire her.  We all still have freedom of speech.  I don't see the brownshirts going to arrest Whoopie for speech crimes.  She was free to say what she wanted to say.  However, I am also free to disagree and criticize, and to vote with my wallet.  Slim-Fast realized this, and their decision was sound.    Hats off to you, Slim-Fast.  Too bad your product sucks."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"You know, there are few things worse than a summer cold.    Except when it feels like it is turning into broncitus less than a week before vacation and the next appointment your doctor has free is two weeks away.  *grumble*  Oh well.  Sick as a dog and twice as ugly.  Until next time."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"HA!  I managed to identify the Outbreak Monkey!!!  According to him, this is a particular strain of illness lasts weeks.  Thanks a whole purple-piss-load, Jason.  Remind me to hock a chunky one on your keyboard the next time I catch Black Malangie.  Fortunately, it has moved out of my head and settled into a nice annoying cough that will be sure to last well into the fall.  At least for once I can be the annoying one at work. One of the worst things about being sick (other than... well... being sick) is the weird thoughts that go through my mind.  Especially when I'm in that half awake half asleep dream state.  I'll be lying there worrying about a program I was working on at a previous job, thinking I'm somewhere out in public, while the theme song to Aqua Teen Hunger Force is running through my mind over and over again.  Ah, the joys of fever delirium.  Waking up with leg cramps is always a complete joy.  Plus the two days of soreness that follows do to over exertion.  You know, if only every voluntary muscle in our bodies could cramp up at once... that would be an easy way to stay in shape.   Then there's the fact that my doctor doens't have room for an appointment until a week from Wednesday.  Yeah, thanks, I'll either be cured or dead by then, doc.  Don't forget to charge me for bothering your useless secretary who's solution to any complaint about lack of service is to ""feel free to find another doctor"".  Yeah, I will be, don't worry.  Now onto the GOOD thing about being sick... Nyquil!  Nyquil has the best thing ever written on the side of its bottle... 180 proof!  It comes in two colors: Red and Green.  And it is the only thing in the world that tastes like red and green.  Plus they are the color of Christmas, and Nyquil makes a dandy eggnog.  I wonder what is in that other 10 non-alcohol percent...  A shot and a half of Nyquil upon waking up, and I'm right back asleep.  That way, I don't have to deal with the rest of the symptoms.  In fact, I'll bet that Nyquil doesn't even do anything other than knocking one out cold for six hours.  The last time I was sick, I went through two entire blissfullness-holding bottles of the sweet nectar of Shangri-La.  Slept almost four days straight.  Hardly knew I was sick at all.  *crying-sniff*  It was beautiful!  Oh well.  The fever is gone and I'm back on my feet.  *whew*"
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Have you ever needed to put your trust in someone else?  How often do they let you down?  How often do you let them down?  How did it make you feel when they blew off something they were supposed to do for you for something ""more important?""  Here's a little story.  A man is in prison for the rest of his life.  He desparately wants to escape.  One day in the cafeteria, he has the chance to talk to the groundskeeper.  The groundskeeper is an older man who is employed by the prison, but unlike the guards, he has a soft spot for people with sad stories.  Well, the man begins to spin a yarn about how his wife is dying and his children are starving, and he was put in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  He sufficiently tugs on the groundskeeper's heartstrings and convinces him to help him escape.  The groundskeeper comes up with a plan.  The next time someone dies, the man is to feign illness and be put in the prison's hospital, which is right next to the morgue.  That night, he is to sneak from his hospital bed and hide in the coffin with the recently deceased.  The next day the coffin will be burried.  That night, the groundskeeper will come by the grave and dig up the coffin, freeing the man and allowing him to go home to his fictional family.  Two weeks later, the man hears that someone has died.  He complains to the night watch of a sharp pain in his abdomen.  The guards come and take him down to the hospital.  Right before dawn, he sneaks into the morgue, finds the casket, and hides inside with the body.  Later, he feels the casket being picked up, carried, driven, and lowered into a grave.  He can hear the clods of dirt hitting the coffin as he is burried.  He waits.  And he waits.  And he waits.  After a while, he begins to get worried.  He reaches down into his pocket and pulls out a matchbook.  Lighting the match, he finds out why he has been waiting so long.  Sharing the coffin with him is the body of the old groundskeeper.  What do you put your trust in?  Other people?  Remember, other people come and go from of our lives.  They have their own interestes, and no matter how good they are and how good their intentions, other people will occasionally let us down.  The only constants in our lives are ourselves and God."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Isn't it amazing how the choices we make, no matter how small, could completely change the course of the world?    What would have happened if the admissions chair at an Austrian arts school back in the late 20's / early 30's had decided to say yes instead of no to an application to study art bearing the name ""Adolph Hitler""?  How many lives could have been saved?  Would someone else have risin up in his place that was worse?  What would have happened had Private Barton Mitchell decided not to pick up an envelope holding three cigars that outlined the plans of General Lee before the battle of Antietem?  What would the would look like today had the South won the Civil War?  What if Dr. Percy Spencer hadn't decided to put a chocolate bar in his pocket the day he was testing the magnetron?  What if Charles Goodyear hadn't accidentally dropped sulpher and rubber on a stove?  What if Pilate had let Jesus go instead of Barabas?  What if Truman hadn't fired McAurthur and had allowed him to drop atomic bombs on China during the Korean war?  What if one of our parents had said ""Not now, I have a headache"" on the day we were conceived?  Just something to think about and to keep in mind as choices present themselves to you today."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"What is it about signs that make us give them ultimate authority over our lives?   An example: After lunch today, several people went by the mens room.  There was a sign on the door that said ""Restroom Closed For Cleaning.""  Yet the person who was going to be cleaning it was just starting in the ladies room.  After ignoring the sign and coming back out, I watched person after person walk by, swear, and keep going.  Sometimes very gingerly.  Why?  Because they gave the sign authority that trumped their own needs.   Now some signs there are concequences for ignoring, like No Trespassing, Speed Limit, and Stop signs.  Other signs, however, we should still view as still open to negotiation.  Signs stating prices, for example.  A business' ""Closed"" signs (when there is someone inside, not advocating breaking the law here).  Signs that try to modify our behavior for no apparent reason, like the ones that require us to snake through those sheeple hearders at the bank when we are the only ones in line.   Do you think that price signs on Sears big ticket items carry authority?  Have the salesman show you every single model of refridgerator... twice... then see if he is willing to negotiate the price once he's put several hours into you.   There is no ""Great printer in the sky"" who makes those signs.  They were made by imperfect people just like us, yet we still give them authority that trumps our free will.  As far as I'm concerned, unless there is a law against it, EVERYTHING is open to negotiation."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Now THIS is an idea who's time has come!!!  If Bush is serious about it, he will get my vote.  NICEVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - President Bush (news - web sites) said on Tuesday that abolishing the U.S. income tax system and replacing it with a national sales tax was an idea worth considering.  ""It's an interesting idea,"" Bush told an ""Ask President Bush"" campaign forum here. ""You know, I'm not exactly sure how big the national sales tax is going to have to be, but it's the kind of interesting idea that we ought to explore seriously.""  Republican economists who speak regularly to the White House have said that the Bush campaign has been mulling the idea of an overhaul of the tax code as part of an agenda for a second term should Bush win reelection.  Some lawmakers have floated ideas of simplifying the tax code by putting in place a ""flat"" income tax rate or a national sales tax. But those ideas have so far not gained much traction in Congress. Opponents say such a system would not be in the best interests of the poor and the middle class who would pay the same tax rate as the wealthy even though they have less disposable income."

CXSA8YM,female,27,"the first and last post about the message board thing I promise      I have been there for 3 years, have over 6000 posts, and was a moderator.  They should know me well enough to know that I am not a bitch.  I was raised w/ manners and class (a fuckload more than some of the girls on that board I can assure you)  so why do the girls that I considered friends for a long time now judge me as of poor breeding, with bad manners, etc.  In case you're wondering, it is all conveniently written in a half-assed internet advice column  urlLink here    Except not in great detail and not really very accurately.  She certainly wasn't the sole reason we went to visit that city. We went to see each other. The cookout was a ""hey everyone's going to be in town, why don't yall come to my house for dinner"" casual thing. Certainly not a party held in our honor.  And the level of dirtiness and crazy in Ms L is far far too much to detail.  You wouldn't believe me. Trust me. No one else did. But we could not have eaten in that house. Could not do it.  I have a big problem w/ potlucks and such in general. You just never know how clean someone's house is.  But to see something in person and then willingly eat there? No. Plus this girl seems a bit crazy.  I always read her website thinking she was hilarious, nutty in a fun way.  Everything taken separately is funny and just a tad weird.  Everything taken together and in real life is just too much.  So Jen, who I'm strongly suspecting is insane as well, was the first one to decide that we weren't going to the cookout.  But she is blaming me and another girl.  She has apparently been emailing anyone and everyone to tell her made up fantasy land version of what happened.  So everyone on the boards blames us, even maybe hates us.  So we've left the boards.  I didn't feel I had a choice.  Now a former stripper/heroin junkie and current cokehead/prelaw student has referred to us as the ""two founding members of the sullen homely fat girl army""  Fat girl. ok. bitchy, but true.  Sullen? Homely? I don't fucking think so, bitch. And no one stepped up to defend us or to say hey that was harsh, etc.  No one.  I wish like hell I hadn't read that.  My natural curiosity (read: nosiness) got the better of me.  I really really wish I hadn't sent the link to the other girl that the post refers to.  I keep thinking about an old saying ""the one who repeats an insult is insulting you""  And I don't want it to come across that way.  I don't want her to be hurting as much as I am hurting.  I read that last night and started crying. And somehow I didn't want to be alone in this horrible knowledge.  I'm selfish I guess.  So I'm sad. mourning the loss of the refuge that I've had for three years. Mourning the loss of good (well, I thought they were good) friendships.  Internet friendships true, but some of them I've talked to on the phone, or met in person.  Women that I thought I was happy to have in my life.  My husband says that what can I expect when a bunch of women get together? women are catty. Women are backstabby.  and I try not to believe that but am wondering. I've always been friends with men more than women. These were some of the best female friendships I've had in awhile.  I hate to lose that.  It's really really over though.  Before the fat girl army comment I thought that I could go back and post every once in awhile. but I can't do it.  I left junior high a long time ago and have no desire to go back."
