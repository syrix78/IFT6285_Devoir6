QN9H8H1,male,34,"Today's run was okay.  In the spirit of going longer and farther, not faster, I am now running ""out"" for a certain amount of time and then running back.  Today was a 51 minute 17 second round trip.  Right after I turned around to start coming back, I got a terrible case of ""buttercrack"".  For those of you who don't know what buttercrack is, prepare to be enlightend.  When a body endures a certain amount of physical exertion (such as moving or exercising), the body will heat up.  This is the same heat that causes the body to sweat.  Sometimes, the body under pressure will have an  event  in the area of the crackus-maximus.  The event is usually small and goes unnoticed.  The problem is that with the event comes a small amount of... how to put it delicately... poo-spray.  As the poo-spray sets in the crackus-maximal region, the heat (and sweat) start to go to work.  The result is an uncomfortable lubricating effect.  Buttercrack.  This is exacerbated by the motion the body is undergoing.  Sometimes on a hot day, the ""butter"" can seem to foam-up.  That's yucky.  So anyway, today I got a nasty case of buttercrack as I was about two miles out.  The whole rest of the time back was spent dwelling on how icky it felt.  Blek...  The strangest part of it was that I didn't feel a backfire from my exhaust pipe.  I think I have a leaky o-ring."
QN9H8H1,male,34,Greetings... I don't really have much to say today but I'm hoping to make a habit out of posting here.  Having a public journal might be theraputic.    Tomorrow is my birthday and I'm planning on going to  urlLink Red Robin  for lunch as a special treat to myself.  I've invited a friend of mine to join me.  I haven't seen him in quite a while.  We'll see if he decides to come or not.    I thouroughly (sic?) kicked my brother's @ss in  urlLink Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries  last night.  :-D

QN9H8H1,male,34,Crap.... I just lost the post I was working on.  I'm not in the mood to retype it.  I had a good run today (despite what I put in my earlier post).
QN9H8H1,male,34,"It's been a while since my last post.  I skipped the heavy weights yesterday and walked the pooch while only carrying the 8 pounders.  On Sunday, I walked a total of six miles and didn't use the weights at all.  Looks like two days of rest was beneficial because today was noticably nicer while hauling around those 15 pounders.  Sadly though, it was shown that I'm not quite ready to be turned loose in social eating situations.  I was at a family gathering last night and there was some really tasty shrimp and chips and taco dip.  Mmm.... I did a good job of making sure that there weren't many left overs.  Sadly though, this morning the scale reminded me of my indulgence from last night.  Ooo....   Oh well... it's a life style thing.  Every once in a while you gotta be able to reward yourself.  I've been really good for a long time so last night's excursion can be forgiven.  I just can't do that kind of thing too often."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I'm lost. I'm crazy. I'm stupid. I'm weak. I'm reckless. I'm cold hearted. I've got nothing but cold feet. I'm pathetic. I'm just a waste of time to get to know. I'm hiding myself. I always ruin everything. I'm ugly. I'm fat. I'm incredulously spontaneous. I am unorganized. I'm messed up. I'm beat up. I'm wandering in hopeless dreams. I spend my day in never going to come true fantasies. I hide my thoughts and feelings in stupid poems and in the pages of books. I stay up late so my mind can not think about my day because it's too sleepy. I ward off others so they have no chance of ever hurting me. I can't admit when I cry, weeping...     What's the use in living anymore? What do  I  have to live for? I bet if I killed myself that no one would miss me either. I bet no one would care to come to my funeral at all. I bet they'd have a party to celebrate that I'm out of their lives, 'cause all I ever do is slip up and do all of the wrong things. I'm not nice and sweet and perfect... Nope, I'm just mean, cold hearted, and the farthest from being perfect that a human being with a heart can be... I suck. I should go to hell after all of the mean things I have done. I shouldn't be alive. I don't deserve the friends that I have. I mean, they're everything I'm not. I don't deserve my friends or my family or my neighbors... Why am I living? I've got no use here on Earth! I'm a pathetic excuse for a human being! God or whoever the hell created me must have been fucking insane when creating me because I am completely and totally worthless. I'm  WEAK ! I CAN'T BELIEVE I SHOWED THEM HOW I WAS FEELING.  WHAT WAS I THINKING?  I should have known that it wouldn't help... I should have known that no will EVER understand the pain I feel... GOD, I WAS SO STUPID.     If I could, right now, I'd hurt myself... But, no... I'm not allowed to because I made some stupid promises to my family that I wouldn't do anything like that... Well, who gives a damn about what I can and cannot do according to other people?? Well, I can tell you right now, at this very moment, I do not care at all on what other people have said. All I know is that I am DYING inside right now and that I HAVE to make it stop before it all completely breaks down and all hell breaks lose. I've had that happen once before and it wasn't too pretty... I need something to releive all of my freaking feelings that go away. I NEED something to do it. I hate it! I can't control the way I'm feeling no matter how much I try. I HATE LIFE! I can't control anything that goes on in it. I can't do anything right. I'm worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Ah, I am SO annoyed. This summer is SO slow. Katelyn, in her letter, said that the summer was going by way too fast. Is she crazy? This summer has been going by SO dreadfully slow... I have absolutely nothing to do. I HATE swimming, biking, and soccer. I can barely tolerate basketball anymore. I also can't rollerblade which totally sucks 'cause if you can't rollerblade then you can't ice skate and I LOVE everything about ice skating. The sport is the only thing that I can watch on TV without wanting to leave ten minutes into it. My favorite figure skater is Michelle Kwon, hands down. I wish she'd win a Gold Olympic Medal all ready. I don't think she's competing in the next Olympics though which stinks. She's a fantastic skater though...   Anyways, I've been trying to cut my computer time down but I can't help myself... There is absolutely nothing to do. I've all ready cleaned the house, updated all of my journals and books, read from a book of short stories by Stephen King, and been on the computer. Since I hate almost every summer sport that people find enjoyable then I have nothing to do.   Ugh, my mom just came down and asked if she could use the computer. I said no. Sorry mom but I have nothing to do at the moment and I wish to use my time up in the most time consuming thing that I can find. I told her that she could have it at six o'clock which, unfortunately, is only eighteen minutes away...   I hate time. It makes me irritated. Have you ever noticed that when you're dreading something, time goes faster? Also, have you ever noticed that when you're looking forward to something that it never comes? Time has slowed down just to make me miserable, I swear. If I could, I'd brutally murder time for making me so damn upset. Well, not really. I wouldn't murder time, I'd just yell at it a lot and maybe ground it or something.   Only fifteen minutes left to type to you in... It's gone by slowly, just like the rest of my summer will go bye... Hm... Perhaps if I make myself dread school then things will speed up a little. It can't hurt me, can it? Maybe July will end and August will begin, a lot quicker to me... I just HATE being bored... I'm such a lazy fat ass too. No wonder why I rank in the 74th percentile for weight and 81st percentile for height.   Isn't that great? I'm fat and tall. The lady in the emergency room thought that I looked like I was going into the tenth grade. UGH! My mom said that many girls my age WANT to look OLDER but fuck them... Seriously, I'd die to look younger. I don't like being well developed at thirteen. It's annoying I tell you. I mean, you barely fit into any of the charts at the doctor's office 'cause you've all ready got your adult body...   There's ten minutes left until I leave you and go back to my life of boredom. DARN! I wish that there was something to do. I've run out of ideas. I've made schedules, diagrams, restrictions, pictures, essays, etc... What else is there left to do? I could always go for an hour long walk like I used to but last time some lady made fun of my hat and I felt like someone was stalking me... I'm SO paranoid...   I can't stop looking at the clock right now... Figures on why I'm not getting much typed... I have seven minutes left. Seven minutes of personal space and something to do. After six minutes now, I'll be upstairs doing completely nothing. I'll probably read a couple of books, write some more in all of my journals, notebooks, etc, watch a movie or two... There's a good chance that I'll be on the computer later too... Ah, there is NOTHING to do... I hate summer. Though school totally sucks, it at least gives me something to do...   I won't be bored afterschool, once school starts 'cause I'm playing soccer again this year! Yay! The one sport that I completely loathe and have no skills whatsoever in, I'm playing again. Yes, I just can't wait to humiliate myself in front of everyone, like last year...   Three minutes left... I'll be spell checking at one minute left... Yes, this is quite sad. Stupid time... I hate time... Wait, did I mention that before? Oh, I've mentioned it over a billion times, you say? Oh, okay... Sorry about that...   One minute left until I spell check, two minutes 'til six...   Damn, it's 5:59... I got to go...   Lost in Nowheresville..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"There seems to be no end of these tiring thoughts that keep bouncing in and out of my mind. Someone out there must seriously hate me, to punish me with long hours of thinking about the terrible, tedious things that go on in my life... Yes, someone out there, whether they be human, animal, or an unknown creature, surely dislikes me.    For some reason, the topic of religion is bouncing about in my mind right now. As a Roman Catholic I am supposed to believe that Jesus is my savior and that God created the world and it took him seven days... Yet, every day I find myself questioning my faith more and more. There are so many flaws in the stories told in the Bible. On several websites, I have read people's answers to other people's questions about God and they have written on how you're not supposed to take the Bible literally... Sorry to say, I want a religion that I can take literally, I'm not all that good at reading inbetween the lines...   I have SO many questions on the Roman Catholic religion. First of all, where did God come from? He couldn't have been there all along? And something can't come from nothing... And the Arc story... There are over a billion different species of animals on this Earth... How in world could he fit two of every one of them onto one Arc? Sorry but it's not scientifically possible...    Most of you religious freaks (no offence of course) are probably thinking that I am one of those scientist people who believe in evolution or the Big Bang Theory... I'm not. I don't really believe in any science theories about how everything was created... To me, they are as impossible as some things written in the Bible.    I'm not exactly sure what I believe in. I do know that I do not believe in God... All I really want to know is the truth of our existence. Actually, I don't think I do. There are some things that people should just not know. Sure, it is fun to guess, but hey, what's the point? I guess I don't really believe in religion. I think that other people do because they find it nice to imagine a world after death... It's not so scary to die if you know that you're going somewhere afterwards... Oh, well...    I'm outie."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I fainted during my physical. Seriously, I did. I got dizzy, stepped forward, smashed into a table, fell on my side, and started shaking. I regained sense thirty seconds later. My mother was screaming my name right into my ear. My doctor, two nurses, and Nicole stood around me. They called 911 and I was rushed to the hospital, where they made me take a couple of tests before discharging me. All I can say is that it was very interesting. It hurt a lot though. The right side of my face got hit as well as my chin. Neither of them were bruised though. Which is a very good thing indeed. The back of my neck is hurting really badly right now however... I've got a massive head ache too.   The doctor at the hospital said that I could have fainted from either dehydration, not eating breakfast, or stress. Though my sister and my mom might say that it was because I didn't eat breakfast this morning, I think otherwise. I haven't ate breakfast in probably about three years. I believe that it was stress. The visit to the doctor's was very overwhelming for me. I really didn't like it all. Everything was just very depressing. All of the things going on my life were in my mind too. Dr. Patel was lecturing me about my diet. I remember feeling angry, upset, and frustrated. I didn't need to be lectured about something as trivial as my health. There were other, more important things going on in my life. I didn't care about discussing my eating habits...   Before I fainted, I had my height and weight checked out. I'm 5 foot 5 and 1/4 inches tall and I weigh about 121.5 pounds. This totally depresses me. And I thought that I had been losing weight.  *sighs*  I guess I was wrong... Oh, well...   I'm out."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"All right, I should probably be writng this in my ""School Fool"" blog but whatever... I'm writing it all down in this one so too bad....     On September 8th, 2004, I will officially be an eighth grader. This is my last year of Middle School. In about a year I will be venturing into high school! Anyways, though my summer has been pretty good thus far, I can't help but feel excited for the eighth grade. My fellow peers and I shall rule the school... Plus, we get to have our very own wing to use. It's going to be great... Anyhow, I'm not completely wound up for just those reasons. No, I'm acting all nervous and excited because I plan on changing a lot about myself this year and I can hardly wait. When I enter the eighth grade, I'll be the person that I want to be...     Here's a list of the changes I'll be making.      External Changes=         Clothing:  For this year, I am changing my entire wardrobe. Finally, I'll escape the terrible striped pants and my mother's tee-shirts that I wore all last year in the seventh grade. This year, I'm planning on getting a larger variety of clothes. I plan on getting some knee length skirts, capris, more fitting tee shirts, nice and comfortable pants, shorts, etc...      Hairstyles:  Another thing that I am changing about myself this year is my hairstyle. I always keep my hair down. This year I think I'm going to put it more up. I'm thinking of head bands and loose pony tails. I might even do pig tails every once and awhile.      Internal Changes=         Knowledge:  This year I am going to pay attention more to my studies. Last year I sort of just shrugged them off. So, this year I'm going to study much more then I did last year so I gain knowledge and actually understand it.      Happiness :  Last year I was positively miserable. When I go into the eighth grade, I plan on being a more happier person. Instead of remaining mute when I have a problem or suggestion for something, I am going to voice my opinion. I am NOT going to be so silent. Since, not speaking made me rather unhappy around all of my friends and others, I am hoping that I'll be much more enjoyable to be with after fixing this little problem.     So, there is my list. It sounds lame, doesn't it? Ah, who cares? It's my life...     And I'm gone..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I am like so excited! Tomorrow I get to go to a theme park that's nearby with some of my friends. It's going to be awesome! I can hardly wait. I've been to the amusement park before. It'll be my second time there but I'm still totally anticipating it. See, last time I went there, it was on a school field trip with my fifth grade class. It was fun then but my group, which had consisted of Katelyn and Chloe, didn't do very much. We had went on a few rides but no rollar coasters since we were all terrified of them. However, this year I'm not as freaked out as before. I'm actually considering riding a few of them. I'm not going with Katelyn and Chloe this time, though. I'll be going with my other friends, Sarah and Bridget. Sarah and Bridget, like Nicole and I, are identical twins. Bridget, like me, is older then Sarah, except by thirty minutes rather than four. Bridget, though we don't hang out together much, knows more about me then any of my friends and that's including Katelyn and Chloe. I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets and she her's. Even though we don't hang out a lot, I feel this undeniable connection to her. She doesn't hate me for who I am. Maybe, one day I'll gather the courage to tell other people about my past, how I'm feeling, and all of that other crap. She gave me hope just by listening to me and trying to understand what I'm feeling. I hope that I gave her the same feeling.  Anyways, it's totally going to rock. Sarah and Bridget just came back from a two week vacation and since Cole and I took care of their pet, Bubbles, they're buying our tickets to get in. Isn't that nice? They seriously don't have to do that for us. I feel totally bad for allowing them. I'd gladly pay for my own ticket but they won't allow it. Gosh, I'm so happy that I know them. I'm not just typing that 'cause they're paying for my ticket. I'm typing it because of their generosity towards me, their compassion for how I feel, etc... Though I question my friendship with Katelyn and Chloe, I don't think I'll ever have to question my friendship with Sarah and Bridget. Bridget knows me better then Nicole probably does. She still continues to be my friend. I'm SO glad for that. Maybe I'm not such a terrible person afterall...  Ah, I am seriously loving my life right now. It's about time that I'm happy. I've been pretty miserable lately, whether or not I wrote you about that, I don't know... It's great though. I might not get the chance to blog tomorrow but I'll try to.  Bye."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I've done the right thing, I know I did. Then why, by doing the right thing, am I feeling rather guilty about the whole ordeal? Why? I shouldn't feel terrible about any of this, yet I do. I mean, I made the right decision. Things will work out just fine, thanks to my actions... How, after one does something the correct and moral way, can feel a bit upset of their actions? I shouldn't being feeling guilty or upset by any of this. I should just be caring, considerate, and understanding of my best friend, Kate's, actions. However, I do feel resentment to it... I don't know, maybe I'm just being weird...    Alright, Kate, my nine year old BFF, has been chatting online with this sick pervert who claims to be either thirteen or sixteen. (He's said both. Sad, huh?) They met in a Bacherlorette chat room over AIM. He AIMed her, asking for her ASL. She replied with that she was ten years old and a female. (She'll be turning ten in a little while.) She didn't give him her location just because she didn't feel like it. Anyways, he responded that he was a male, sixteen years old, and lived in Tennessee. He told Kate that he loved her and she was wooed. They became online boyfriend and girlfriend right after that. As conversations issued over AIM between them he told Kate disgusting, perverted things about his private parts. Kate asked him to stop several times  but he just would not quit. Then, today, after a number of perverted sayings, she decided that it was the last straw for him. She threatened him that if he continued with this ""gross"" behavior on AIM that she would dump him. He pleaded with her desperately and eventually won her over. However, he did not stop with the remarks. She had to threaten him several times over and each time he played her like a fool. My twin sister and I watched this procedure. Finally, after he sent her an inappropriate picture of his male private part, I stepped in. I completely told him off. There was NO WAY in hell that he was who he said he was. I had heard about these type of people, they took advantage of children like Kate. I did not want Kate to become a victim. He had been playing with her mind the entire time, I just knew it. Even if he was who he said he was, I don't care... He deserved every word that he got. After breaking up with him and saying a few other choice words, I blocked him... This completely infuriated Kate. She yelled at me that she had wanted to do it in her own way at her own time. Though it may sound mean, I knew that she wouldn't have. In my heart, I know that I did the right thing. A potentional problem was issuing. He, I am quite sure of, would have wiggled personal information out of her eventually and used it to harm her and get what he wants from her. That just could NOT happen. So, I changed it. I know that it might have been stupid, but I did what I felt was right. Hopefully she'll never talk to him ever again and we'll never have to know what his real motives are.                 I'm a little upset with myself at the moment. I didn't mean to make my friend angry at me but I didn't like the possibility that she could fall into a maybe evil man's clutches... Hopefully she won't stay angry at me for too long. I had my best interests at heart... Come on, you've got to give me something for that...   Let's journey to the brighter side, shall we? Well, really, it's not that much of a brighter side. Nicole's AIM account was broken onto by Kate's brother, my EBGF. This shocked my sister and I both because Nicole had just created that account... How could have he have known about it in the first place? Her password had seemed almost impossible to guess, too. Anyways, we changed her AIM password to something that would be hard to guess, a bunch of miscellaneous numbers. Then we went to change her e-mail address account password, just in case he knew it and had the password sent to her address. It took forever to find the right thing to change it. Unfortunately we never got to change her password. Our e-mail thingy was updated and you currently can't change any of your account information.  That totally sucks...  Anyways, it's been a long day... Kate, Nicole, and I spent the night at Kate's grandmother's  last night. It was loads of fun. Her grandma lives in the open country which, to me, is positively beautiful. One day, I want to live in the country.  It was wonderful, being there. Her home sat atop this magnificent hill. At the foot of the hill lay a tiny brook which was surrounded by weeds, wildflowers, stones, plants, and other wild things of nature. To the east of her home lay green, empty fields that seemed to stretch on for forever. I'd love to go running through those fields... West of her house was a few trees that seperated her house from a corn field. To me, it would be great fun, running through them when the corn was fully grown... Finally, behind her house were a few old barns, some trees, and a hay field.If I lived there, whenever I got bored, I'd explore them... Ah, it was wonderful. Her house, itself, was ancient. It was downtrodden but beautifully so. There were cracks in the walls and floors and no computer or any real technology but it was fabulous all the same. Ah, what I'd give to live in the country.  Anyhow, I HAVE to be going... I've been on the computer for way too long...  Cya later..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"I think I am falling in love... Falling in love with fictional romance, that is what I believe that I am doing. I am currently reading a book series that makes my insides melt. It is like one of those corny movies where the main character says the perfect, witty thing to the second main character before kissing her... I think I am turning into a hopeless romantic... Oh dear... When I grow a little older, I might actually turn away from my usual bookcase of fantasy books and historical fiction and to the mushy, gushy, romance novels!!!!!     Things in my world seem to be changing so fast. I'm loving romance novels, I started caring about my weight, I have completely different views... I thought that I would never change. I mean, I knew people changed but I just sort of thought that I'd always be the same, that everyone else would become different and that I'd always have the same interests and junk. Personally, I don't like change... It twists peoples thoughts... Like, for instance, I absolutely hate smoking for it pollutes the air and damages people's healths. What happens, if one day, I change and actually tries smoking, likes it, and then dies from it a couple of months after my first try?     It's weird that I'm posting to you about God, dreams, depression, and romance novels; isn't it? I guess you could call this entire blog thingy, 'Koala Peace: My Useless Thoughts on Miscellaneous Subjects and Other Things.' However, that would be too long of title... Perhaps something like, 'Koala Peace: Miscellaneously Me.' Well, that's a little better, don't you think? Oh, well. 'Koala Peace' is perfectly fine with me. I don't need anything more complex in order to keep writing in this blog. Nope, the simple way is the best for me.     I'm not a very materialistic person. I don't need precious diamonds, desinger clothes, shiny gadjets, and the rest of that other really expensive stuff that extremely rich people have. Nope, I'm much happier with the things I already have. I loathe change so what do you expect? Anyways, I liked older, antique things... They are full of memories. New things just seem to be pathetically big and phony. I'd rather have something that is steady and decent rather then anything big, bright, and bold...     Well, I'm outie."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"Nicole and I had the best time together today... Well, at least during the afternoon/evening part. During the morning hours we went with our dad to help clean the apartments that my parents rent out to college kids every year, so it's presentable for human habitation again. It wasn't all that bad, I guess. We spent three to four hours running up and down flights of stairs and fetching things to either fix or clean broken and/or dirty miscellaneous objects throughout the three story apartment building... That place is so spooky and not to mention humungous... Last time that I went there to help my parents out, I got lost in there... Ah, it was positvely horrible. It was SO creepy. You couldn't hear anything at all. The walls were as thick as tar, I swear. It was very spooky. I was screaming for my sister who, though I did not know it at the time, was directly a floor below me. She didn't hear my shouting at all... Weird, huh?  I'm veering off topic here... Anyways, Cole and I, got back from the apartments around 12ish. We didn't really hang out until 4:30 or so... We talked for a half an hour and then decided to take a walk to the high school that we're going to be attending after this year... Oh my gosh, we had an awesome time! We talked about everything and anything that entered our minds... It was hilarious... We bumped into my brother's old friend, who just happens to be extremely attractive, while we were walking. It was funny.   We eventually walked back home, pigged out on Chinese food, and then set off to buy our favorite ice cream at our local Stewarts. Our favorite ice cream of all time of course, is chocolate chip cookie dough! Yum, it's delicious... If you haven't ever had it before, I highly recommend that you try it... Anyhow, we ate our ice cream and talked about silly things until we reached one of our city's parks. Then we went around screaming idiotic things like ""marshmallow"" and ""teletubbies."" We're freaks, aren't we? It was awesome. Tonight we're supposed to go see I, Robot... I don't know if we're going to be able to go though... My parents are a little cranky and tired after a days work at ""the apartments.""  Nicole's my best friend... Yeah, we happen to be blood related but does that matter? Some people won't become friends with us, at the times when I'm outgoing of course, just because Nicole and I are close. I find that extremely odd AND stupid. I mean, if Nicole and I weren't from the same blood line, those people would have no problem with being our friends at all... It's ridiculous, totally... I hate it when people won't be my friend just because I have a twin. I feel so discrimminated against... Well, not really, but you know what I mean, right? No? Okay, nevermind...  In soccer last year my coach forced the twins on the team to pair up with someone else. That's totally not fair. I mean, all the other best friends get to pair up with one another, just because we're blood related doesn't make the situation any different really! Ugh, some people just really make me mad. I seriously don't understand people when they do this... It makes me really, really angry... I wish people weren't so cruel... Someone told me to go have sex with Nicole once, just because we were twins... What the hell is wrong with people?  Ugh, some people just really annoy the hell out of me...  And now I'm gone..."
ZWQIRVK,female,13,"OMG, I feel TERRIBLE. Seriously, I feel like that any minute now I'll just throw up all of the junk food that I ate today right on the computer monitor. My head is still spinning even though we left the park almost exactly three hours ago. I feel like I'm still on one of those roller coasters, dropping to my doom. The amusement park was wicked, the after effects, though, I'm not too crazy about. Before we arrived at the amusement park, things were pretty bad too though. I almost died of sleep deprivation. I couldn't even lay my head down because Sarah was talking to me a mile a minute and I felt that it would be really rude to close my eyes while she was speaking.   Anyways, let's skip ahead to the actual time spent at the theme park. We left home at around 9ish and arrived there a little before 11. When we got there we bought our tickets and all, got inside, grabbed maps, and headed to the nearest attraction, The Boomerang. The Boomerang, in case you couldn't guess, is a roller coaster. Okay, it brings you up at least a hundred and twenty feet in the air, drops you, you go through a corkscrew, then a loop, and then you do it all over again, BACKWARDS. I was terrified out of my mind. I mean, I nearly fell off Space Mountain when I was six years old and that wasn't even all that bad. How could I survive a roller coaster that was definitely at least three times as bad as Space Mountain? I honestly don't know why whenever they asked me if I still wanted to go I on I said yes. I must have been crazy. Or perhaps I wanted to face a fear or experience something new or whatever... Anyhow, I sat next Sarah. Just before they dropped us I thought my heart had stopped. All of my fears just came together. I suddenly wished I was watching them ride it without me. Well, those thoughts quickly left me half a second later when they dropped us. To tell the truth that first drop was totally AWESOME! I loved it. It felt so good. I didn't like it all that much with the corkscrew or when we did the ride again backwards but other then that it was great. It felt really good to overcome my fear of roller coasters.   Everything else there was pretty fun to do too. My favorite ride was definitely the mystery ride. It's a lot of fun. See, it's like a scramble ride, if you know what that is. Well, it's a bit different then a regular scramble ride, actually. The entire ride is in this large, green dome. In the dome, they have some dim lights on when you enter. Well, you all get in to the cars (2 people per car) and they start spinning you. They play heavy metal music throughout the entire ride which is a lot of fun to scream and head bang with. After a little while it sort of gets boring. I mean, you're going really fast and you're almost smashing into other cars and the walls but it's nothing seriously fun. At about that time, the lights go out. You start spinning faster and faster in the dark. It's getting kind of creepy but yet exhilarating. Suddenly, these bright strobe lights turn on and off. It makes everything go hazy and you start to get dizzy. Then the strobe lights disappear and everything does dim. A red search light (it looks like one from a light house except red colored) turns on. It flashes across the room. Then these really weird pictures on the walls light up The light and the pictures stay illuminated for a while before going out. You're left in the dark again. Slowly, the ride comes to a stop and the rides over with. This was my favorite ride out of the entire park. It was positively thrilling!   The only annoying thing about this adventure was the fact that everyone always wanted to stop to get food. All I wanted to do was explore the park more. It really slowed our time down. We didn't even get to explore Splash Water Kingdom which totally sucks 'cause it was getting very hot out and I really didn't feel like fainting because of the heat. I guess it's a good thing that they made me eat 'cause I probably wouldn't have ate anything at all if it had been up to me.   Sarah, won a gigantic Care Bear from an arcade game. I am totally jealous because the Care Bear was my favorite, Wish Bear. Ugh, guess what, she named him? JEFF! Jeff? Poor thing, it was renamed... I tried to win one but seeing as how I've never won anything in my entire life, I failed miserably.   My least favorite ride that we went on would either be the roller coaster, The Comet, that bobsled roller coaster one, or that stupid swinging ship. I hated the Comet just because it was just so damn rickety. It wasn't a bad ride I'll admit though. The bobsled roller coaster just hurt a lot. Each time it shifted or locked into place, it hurt you. That was definitely the most painful ride I went on. The swinging ship ride was okay the first time I went on it but after a second time I instantly hated it. It made me feel way nauseous and jittery. I didn't like swinging back and forth, it made my stomach twist and turn into these horrible knots.   Besides the rides in Splash Water Kingdom, I wanted to go on two other rides that we didn't get the chance to ride on. One was the Merry-Go-Round and the other The Rainbow. The Rainbow looked cool. It was like the swinging ship but instead of just swinging you back and forth, it brought you all the way around... Anyhow, it sounds stupid but I really, really wanted to go on the Merry-Go-Round. I've never been on one before, at least I don't believe so, and it just looks fantastic. I like the very unique, sculpted ponies, horses, donkeys, mules, etc... I'm ""too old"" for the ride now though which completely sucks if you ask me. I wish I wasn't...   Well, that's all the main highlights and low points of my adventure to the theme park that I can think of right now. If I remember something significant, I'll write it in sometime later.   Austa!"

KEM72EH,female,26,"Yesterday, I saw a few movies. Here's what I thought....   urlLink ""Mean Girls""  - Funny, probably due to the amount of talent from current or former Saturday Night Live crew. I'm partial to Lindsay Lohan since the remake of ""The Parent Trap,"" but she's also great at being mean and nasty.   urlLink ""Paycheck""  - Not bad for a film dealing with the touchy subject of predicting or changing the future. I'm keeping this one around for an entertaining action flick.   urlLink ""The Rundown""  - Who knew The Rock was so funny? Sure, he was tougher than any human could be without the excuse of superpowers (think Spidey or Superman) or genetic mutation (Wolverine from the X-Men) but the movie was still a fun watch.   urlLink ""Grey Owl""  - Good at making me want to learn more about the real guy, but they should have cast someone who looked way less British. It was one of those times where you're thinking ""How stupid are these people that they can't see through his pretense?""

I have few reservations about "" urlLink Clueless ,"" so why should I pick on ""Bridget""? And I do so like Colin Firth's Fitzwilliam Darcy.  I recorded the show when it was on TV a month ago or more, and today found time to give it another chance. I appreciated it a lot more this viewing. It was fun to see the common elements, and the modern spinning that Fielding gave to the characters, Bridget especially.  I may just track down the book now!

KEM72EH,female,26,"urlLink Tony Vincent  provides the soundtrack for this post. (Buy his CDs, they're awesome!)   Just got off the phone with my mother. She has an inside look at the process of writing a novel, thanks to the only creative present I've given her in years: a notebook with some of my insights and conundrums about writing fiction.  Tonight, her writing advice (she's a painter, BTW, not an author) was about description. As soon as I heard the word, I said, ""Mum, I suck at description!"" (Thank goodness, she didn't scold me on the use of that word. Yes, mum, your vacuum sucks. Tee hee.)  She persevered, telling me that description would really help the story. I defended my lack of skill by pointing out that many stories do well without focusing on descriptions of every object in the tale. And then she gave me a great way to boost the scenes: think of things from my own life.   For instance, in one character's apartment, Mum wants to know something about the chair. Without deep thought, I asked, ""What room is it in?"" You see, I know what kind of furniture is in the living room, 'cause it feels natural to picture my own comfy chair (which happens to be a freebie, thank you very much) as being within the financial constraints of said character. The colour, a shade between brown and beige, fits the drab, non-decorating mood of the character at that point of the tale. Et voilà, her apartment is now more interesting to my mother!  I now have a tool when it comes to the dreaded process of describing the imaginary world I create: more visualisation. And I feel ready to take on the world with this secret weapon! LOL"

KEM72EH,female,26,"The wind howled and the clouds darkened by the minute. A farmer plodded down the path to his barn, the smell of snow filling the air around him.  ""Too early for winter,"" he muttered to himself. ""Just brought in the harvest.""  A friend of his,  claimed  to be a wizard, had told him that something evil was about to happen. ""Danger will fly over mountains with the first snow. It won't be long now.""  The farmer had laughed at the proclamation. ""You're always dreaming up a new warning. What you need is a season in the fields, working the land. That'll keep your head on straight.""  When he had seen to his animals, he bolted the barn door securely and walked towards the house. He would have stew for dinner. A delicious rabbit stew, stirred frequently and kept warm by his wife. Her mother had taught her the art of cooking from an early age, and he had been extremely grateful every day of his twenty-year marriage.  Halfway to the house, the farmer stopped. An awful stench reached his nose. He turned around but saw nothing unusual. White flakes floated down to the ground and he watched them for a moment. Then his stomach growled, and he thought again of dinner. ""I'd best get home,"" he told the snow.  Something heavy struck his head, and he tumbled to the dirt. He saw a green mass, then only darkness with the second blow.  * * * * *  The survivors gathered in caves outside of town. They counted their losses: the scorched houses and farmland, the slaughtered livestock, and half a dozen slain citizens. Twice that number were injured, some hanging on the edge of life itself. Farmer Ian Morehouse, for example.  His wife Tina hadn't waited to watch the house burn; after crawling out a window, she dragged her husband's body to a wheelbarrow. Then she ran with the loaded cart. Dared she hope Ian would live past this night of hell?  ""Who were they?"" Bea Thomas asked. ""Did you see the attackers?""  Tina shook her head and soaked another cloth in water from a stream inside the mountain. There was so much blood to clean that it seemed impossible Ian had any remaining in his veins.  She heard Bea turn away to repeat her question to another woman. The two discussed the possibilities, and their theories included invaders from the south, punishment from the gods (""if there are any,"" Bea said) and even the fabled dragons of centuries past.  For Tina, the cause of the assault mattered less than the chaos left behind. She made Ian as comfortable as she could with only the two extra cloaks Bea's brother Kendrick had handed her when she entered the cave.  She fell asleep sometime during the night and awoke later to hear a familiar voice in conference with Kendrick. Was that Durwin, Ian's wizard friend?  ""What are we to do?"" Kendrick asked.  ""Stay where you are for now. Tend to the wounded, and leave the worrying to me.""  ""But how will we survive the winter? There won't be any grain or cattle left after this destruction.""  ""You'll find food enough in the woods, just as your ancestors did the last time.""  ""What do you mean? What 'last time'?""  ""About two hundred and fifty years ago. It wasn't falling stars that sent fire on your cities, though your history books recorded it that way.""  ""What was it then?""  ""Dragons.""  Dragons! Tina moved closer to Durwin, carefully stepping over the bodies of her slumbering neighbours so she wouldn't miss any of his words. She crouched on the floor not far from the two men.  Kendrick would be a fool if he let the subject drop now. Though many thought the creatures belonged only in children's tales, tonight it seemed quite possible that they had destroyed her town so quickly, with their fiery breath as a deadly weapon.  Kendrick had remained quiet for a minute, perhaps thinking the same things as Tina. ""You really think they exist?"" he asked.  Durwin nodded. ""I've seen them. And I'm going to talk with them, stop them from attacking the entire kingdom.""  ""Are you mad?""  Durwin smiled slightly. ""Trust me, Kendrick. I  will  talk with them."" Then his smile faded. ""Whether they listen is another matter.""  Tina stood and walked the few steps to the corner where Durwin and Kendrick sat. ""I'm going with you, Durwin.""  Kendrick stood ""Mrs. Morehouse - ""  ""I know what you're going to say. Don't."" She turned her back to him, giving her full attention to the wizard. ""I want to represent the town.""  Durwin stared at her, then looked around the room. ""Yes, you will do it well.""  They left at dawn. Ian had not woken up, so Tina left a message to be read to him if he regained consciousness.  ""Thank you for the spare parchment, Durwin.""  He looked down and smiled much as her father had done when she was a little girl. She had often found that the wizard had a paternal manner about him. ""I'm sorry he hasn't woken yet,"" he said.  ""He may never."" She took a deep breath. ""This journey is for him.""  ""Then I should issue a warning - you will represent all of your race when we stand before the dragons.""  ""You'll still be there, won't you?""  ""Yes. I will speak on behalf of mankind, but in another form entirely. I'll appear before the dragons as one of them.""  ""You can do that?""  He nodded and quickened his pace. When they could no longer see the caves, Durwin transformed himself. The size of the creature before Tina certainly intimidated, but she admired the purple tinge of the scales and the graceful wings. When the head bowed to the ground, she scrambled up and sat at the base of the long neck.  They flew north, passing other burnt towns and villages. In a large, snow-covered meadow outside the king's city, they found the dragons resting.  Durwin landed gracefully at one end of the field and allowed Tina to climb down to the ground. He whispered words in a strange language and she found she could understand the dragons' speech.  The dragons greeted their visitors with a mixture of curiosity and hostility, rushing forward to demand Durwin's business in that location yet not going so far as to attack him, despite their large numbers. Even though Durwin brought a human into their midst, there might a code of behaviour amongst their kind that held back their disapproval.  ""Who are you?"" they asked. ""What are you doing here?""  ""I am known in this land as Durwin. I have come to ask that you stop your slaughter.""  One of the nearest dragons, whose scales were a brilliant shade of green rather like an emerald, stepped forward. ""We do what is best for the land. These  men  plunder and abuse, but we listen to the earth's cries. The humans must be destroyed!""  ""My husband is a farmer!"" Tina shouted, discovering that she also had the ability to speak like a dragon. ""He cares for his land, but you struck him down anyway. He may die because of you. How many others were killed who love the earth? Yet you storm through the towns and burn everything!""  ""Men are a plague on this earth,"" the emerald dragon replied.  His friends agreed. One with a darker green hue said that even the farmers had less respect for the land than a dragon.  Another said, ""We are following the examples of our fathers, who purged this land before.""  ""There is no need for this,"" Durwin said. ""You will never changed the hearts and ways of men by killing them. You need to teach them.""  ""Men are unteachable,"" Emerald declared. ""The great prophet Kadris urged us to be the voice of the earth and we are.""  ""Kadris preached change and mercy, then lived them.""  The dragons all began talking at the same time. Some claimed that Kadris would destroy the race of men himself if he stood before them that day. Others claimed Durwin had not learned well enough from his ancestors if he thought Kadris believed in mercy.  ""Enough!"" Durwin called, somehow making himself heard in the din. ""I know what I preached to your great-grandfathers. It was not destruction and hatred of men!""  The meadow was suddenly quiet. Tina heard a few tentative peeps behind her; even the birds were frightened of the dragon debate.  ""What are you talking about?"" Emerald asked.  ""I am Kadris,"" Durwin answered. ""I lived among dragons many ages ago, and they passed down my counsels. Yet they have been distorted by false interpretation. I ask you again to cease your war against man.""  "" You  are Kadris?""  ""Yes."" He changed into his usual wizard form. ""I am known by many names, in various lands. And if I had been amongst you lately, I would have corrected your errant notions.""  No one spoke; the time for serious thought had come. Durwin conjured two chairs out of the air and invited Tina to sit down to tea, which had also materialised from nowhere with scones and jam.  When the dragons were ready, Durwin shared his plan for the future. There would be a meeting with the king and his advisors, where the dragons would teach men to live  with  the land and prevent its pain. Because men could not hear the earth's voice, the dragons would be required to warn the king and his subjects when their actions threatened to inflict harm.  There would also be language classes. Tina would instruct the dragons in the speech of men, and would also give lessons in dragonspeak in her region of the kingdom. The king's advisors were in charge of the rest of the realm for that task.  By the end of the week, the dragons had issued a formal apology to all citizens who had been affected by the raid. The emerald dragon had personally expressed his regrets to Tina, and had lent her a pouch of healing stones.  Ian's recovery lasted several months, during which time he met with the dragons many times to discuss farming techniques that would ensure fertile soil on a continuous basis.

DRMG6T5,female,23,"Ok, I'm much better now. Thank you. So last night was really busy, but somehow I didn't make any money. Again I'm not sure what I did to Steve, but he hates me for some reason. There were nothing but big fares going out last night, and got nothing but single digit fares all night. I actually only had 4 fares that were over $10, and 2 of them were before Steve came on. Dammit. He did send me for a $65 fare to Long Branch at one point, but before they got there he sent me somewhere else and put someone else on the call. That sucked.    Anyway, my first call of the night was awesome, it was these 4 drunken Portugese guys off one of the oil ships. They didn't tip a penny, but they were so much fun. Surprisingly they weren't rude either, they did hit on me but it was never rude. They were going from Moby Dick's to Breathless, and all they kept saying the whole way was ""Go Go, Go Go"". One of them in the back did a pretty good George Bush impression. When I told them my name, they started singing it out like the drunken sailors they were. I dropped them off and they said they were going to ask for me, but Mike ended up getting them instead. (He says the whole ride they kept asking for me though)  The next woman I picked up made me wait 20 minutes before telling me She wanted to be picked up on the other side of the building. Bitch.  Then I took a regular guy to work. He works at one of the trucking companies unloading the trucks. I guess he had a busy night, cause I never heard his call go out to go home.   Next, we were late as hell getting some chick to work at the Turnpike rest stop, which she certainly let me know about. The next fare as well, some Arab dude going to the same place that I could have grabbed together  if he had called 5 minutes earlier.   I brought I stripper to Charlie's Angels, who made my skin crawl by sucking and chewing on ice the whole way. She kept calling me ma, I think this is some new rap slang like shorty or something, I keep hearing this lately.   Willy was next, and he was so wasted he couldn't remember why I won't pull up his driveway, but he did go through his entire spiel on how I need to wait for him to get away from the car and blah blah blah.   The next call was a freakin mess. Let me give you a little back story. We used to have a driver that I was pretty good friends with, (I actually miss him a lot as now I have nobody to call in the middle of the night and bitch about work to) who had a very jealous girlfriend. She actually called me one night flipping out because my phone number was on his phone. So this was the girlfriend. She was drunk as hell, going to some guy's house, while telling me she was running away from her boyfriend. She tells me all about how this boyfriend is crazy, and threatens to kill her and steal their daughter, and all sorts of other drama. She also tells me how he cheats on her, as she is on her way to this dude's house.  I know this other driver had his problems, but the picture she is painting is a really ugly one. She didn't tip either.  I grab a 6 pack from the Main and run it over to the Mexicans on Kimball. This proves to be really difficult as TT (I mentioned him the other day) is in the bar (and drunk) and follows me to the car, refusing to let me leave. (I did manage to leave, but it was after threatening never to pick him up again)  I grabbed a guy off Woodbridge train and took him home.  Now, I get sent for the Long Branch, but before they get there he sends me to get Annie. OK I can deal with losing the good fare to get Annie, but that's not what happens. I get over to Fridays, and Annie's not outside, so I figure good, I can run in to get her and pee. So I park the car, lock the doors and go inside. The bartender tells me Annie already left, this guy passed out over here needs the cab. So as I'm unlocking the door, I feel this guy grabbing me from behind. I freaked out and pushed him off me and was just about to knock him out when I realized he was just stumbling, drunk. He's lucky. So now he passes out in the car (thankfully after I realize who he is and where he lives, since he's going to Clark) I manage to smack him awake in front of his house, he hands me some crumpled bills, (which don't include a tip) gets out and falls face down in his driveway. Oops.(I said to myself as I drove away quickly)  Back to get the girlfriend at the dude's house. Now she's even drunker, and crying because the police are at her house. I'm not totally sure why, she gives a few explanations (one of which include her calling them) but none of them make much sense, and she has me drop her off 4 blocks from her house. While I have her with me, I get another guy. This is the guy from the other night who wanted to know my life story. This guy is another one who is lucky he has limbs after grabbing my shoulder and attempting to rub it, he overtips to compensate for me yelling at him. Fine with me.  A few quiet people pass. An old friend of my brothers. And a few down moments when I finally get to pee.   Finally I do get Annie, and she's drunk as well. She says she left Friday's because this drunk guy was freaking her out. Thanks Annie I got him instead. She gets home with a minimal amount of trouble and now I can't hold my eyes open. I actually pored some water on my face on the way home just to not fall asleep. It was pretty scary. I drop the car off at the Forge, where P.C. (see post on other drivers) lives and will drive it to work in the morning, and head back to the office. I think Steve is happy he's rid of me for the night.   Gassed up and gone home. I think I'm gonna stop writing this after today, It's corny."
DRMG6T5,female,23,Welcome! Tomorrow will begin the first day of something I hope could be really interesting to compile.   See You Then!!!!
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Don't worry guys, I'll definitely be back soon, I'm taking a small hiatus from work until I can get along with Steve. I'm going back to work in the next couple of days, I promise!"
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Last night was wicked busy so I will not bore you with every last excrutiating detail, but just the highlights. I booked an even $400 and walked off with $92 in tips. (That's good)  I haven't been working much lately trying to figure out what I wanted to do, since I pretty much cry every day when I have to go to work because of Steve. So I have come to the conclusion that I will go back to working on the day shift, and only work nights on Sundays with Carmello, cause he rocks. Only thing is work doesn't know this yet. So here it is 7:15am, and I need to get up in about 4 hrs to call work and find out if this is ok, then be there by noon. Yeah, it's gonna hurt.     So my day started out at 5pm, with a call from the Calire building to the Galaxy, there are 4 girls in this building who all work there, like some kind of little cult or something. Strange.     Next I buy a pack of cigarettes and deliver it to someone's house. Someone should really market a business like this. Delivering whatever you want to your house. We do pretty much whatever you want, but imagine you are stoned at 2am, and someone will bring you a soda and a bag of sunchips, or the proverbial pregnant woman her Rocky Road ice cream or whatever. They would make a killing with the right advertising.     Then there is a bunch of drama with a driver not being able to find a fare at the Turnpike rest stop. I head over there and she's standing in the middle of the road. How he missed her is beyond me, she looked like a drowned rat.     From there I get this great little run of people going to and around Carteret. 6 calls in less than an hour. Danny (the dispatcher on at the time) just kept feeding me call after call. Mostly doubling them up. It was great.  I got someone from the train in to Carteret,  a stripper going to Breathless, a regular who works at Pathmark going home, a couple to the laundromat, a guy going to work on Blair, and another dude going to the strip club.  $51 in all.     Then a very nice lady from A&P to Fords. I take her all the time, she never remembers me, and even when I tell her I know where she lives, she still insists on giving me directions. With her I get a Mexican from the office going to New Brunswick. This would be great if not for the fact that every Sunday I take off for 1 hour at 9 to go watch 6 Feet Under, the only TV I watch, and it is now 8:30 and POURING rain. Damn gonna miss some of that. I rushed back and was only a little late. (It rocked last night by the way. David almost got killed by a psycho mugger guy. If you do not watch this show, there is something wrong with you and you should begin immediately.) (Unless you are my little cousin, in which case there is no need for you to watch it. Please don't your mother will kill me.)     Then I got back on the air, ran a few small ones, and got some food. Good thing I did this now as I did not get a chance to stop running for pretty much the rest of the night.     I went and picked up Jo-Jo next. Jo-Jo is a crackhead. He is also a really nice guy. He always pays his fare, and will generally not dick you around. He goes from his house to Chrome to get what he will tell you is just a little weed, but you do not go to the ghetto and find the black dude on the corner for a dimebag of pot. I got him, and stopped at the pay phone so he could call his guy. We drive around, and the dude is not there, there are cops driving all around us, and I'm beginning to freak out as he has me do like 4 trips around Chrome. Finally he says forget it, and as I'm stopped behind someone making a left, some black guy gets in the car. I get ready to freak and Jo-Jo tells me he called him over, just relax and drive. They make their deal, and he gets out. Thanks alot Jo-Jo.     Next I get a guy from Carteret who's going home to Jersey City, he was pretty cool, and he gives me easy directions back to 1&9 so I can grab some people from the airport on the way back. This is a good run $90 in like 45 minutes. Doubles like that are great. No wasted time.     Then I get tripled up from the train station to Avenel. Yayy.     I run over to Breathless and pick up Kevin from BHT. Kevin is a very large (and by large, I  mean very fat)  Indian guy who goes to all the strip clubs every night. He has this disgusting woman with him, who is also pretty large, but is wearing a miniskirt and tube top.  She also has her eyebrows shaved off, penciled in about 3 inches above where nature intended them, and has the space filled in with so much blue eyeshadow, it looks like grease-paint. They fight the whole way.     2 drunken biker-type dudes get in the car with the tiniest chiuaua I've ever seen. Very manly.     A few other calls happen, but not too much excitement.      And 1 airport, where are the cops when you need them. They give us so much shit, when we pull up there, just to drop off, that we pretty much need to throw the fare out of the moving car. I got stuck for 10 minutes behind some asshole who parked in the middle lane, left his dog in the car and disappeared. Wonderful.     Ok, there is probably more I want to say, but it's 8am now and I need to be up in 3 hours. So I'm going to attempt some sleep now."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Well, the night was going ok, but it ended pretty crappy.  First fare was 2 of the wait staff going from Jose Tejas to Carteret. They were pretty quiet, and live in one of the paradoxes of the world, they live on Oakwood which is off of Oakwood. Carteret is a weird town.  Next was the White Rose guy. He complained of not sleeping, welcome to my world dude.  Then a quiet kid going from town to Iselin. Tipped pretty well.   I go to pick up this Indian guy from a restaurant, and bring him down Green Street. His fare is $6.50. We get there, and he hands me $6.25. I point this out and he says ""that's all you get."" Motherfucker. This angers me. But I'm trying not to be crazy mad bitch lately, so I decide not to argue, instead I kick him out of the cab, and peel off.   Next I pick up a girl from Champps, who need to be at her train in 7 minutes. She's so happy I got there as fast as I did to begin with. She lives in Manhatten, and has just worked a double. She really wants to make her train. I get her there with time to spare and she tips $5.   The next lady I pick up is also a waitress, and has also just worked a double. She's from Charlie Brown's and smells really bad. I didn't get rid of her stench for a while.   From there I go all the way up to Inman & Grove, and find a small complex of projects. I get to the apartment I need, and see a guy heading for me. Very Very slowly, he is limping. Finally he gets to the window, and tells me the fare is gone. Wonderful.  I spend some time in the office, Carmello is just leaving and Steve is just starting. I listen to them talk shit for a while and get 1 call. It's some kid going from Maple Hill to Fords. He spends 5 minutes staring at me out the window before realizing, yes, I am his cab.  I sit in the office for a little while longer, while Steve tells me that no, he doesn't hate me, I just annoy him because I talk, and he wants to be left alone. I tell him he could just tell me this instead of yelling at me all the time.  And I guess I just won't talk to him anymore.  A call comes in for this strange little road named Rainbow Ct. They are supposed to be going to Manhattan. The road is only sort of on the map. It is not actually drawn anywhere, it's just listed somewhat in the area it is supposed to be. I drove around for 20 minutes trying to find it. Finally I find this house, they wanted the cab at 1:30, I wasn't too late. I beep. And I beep. And I beep. There are some kind of Arab dudes wandering in and out of the house. People hanging out on the front porch, no one even acknowledging I am there. Finally at 2:10 a man with the thingie on his head, and a women finally get in the car, while still hanging out bullshitting. Assholes. So we head off and they are going to Battery Park. We make it almost all the way there with no calamities. Just about there when the dude tells me that he will be going on to Long Island after we drop the woman off. This information would have been more useful YESTERDAY! So I call Steve and he agrees to do the whole thing for $150 plus tolls, they seem to be fine with this.  So I drop the woman off and get some vague directions towards the Midtown Tunnel. On my way again. FDR Drive is closed and has some crazy detour, but I find it. Head throughout the tunnel, and get on the LIE. Now the LIE is closed 1 exit before I need to get off it. Thankfully I find out that that particular highway has a service road that runs directly next to it. This helps a LOT! So I drop him off and thankfully he gives me really really easy directions back. I'd rather not be lost in Long Island at 4am thank you. He also just thrusts an entire handful of bills at me, which turns out to be close to a $30 tip after I change my route as to avoid a bunch of tolls. Woo Hoo!   I get back to NJ, and Steve is surprised I made such good time. There was traffic on the belt, but I spent the majority of the trip doing 70 or better, so it totally made up for any traffic I hit anywhere. Riding down the belt was actually pretty nice, there was heat lightning going on around me, and a HUGE full orange moon. Plus the water always looks prettier at night, you can't tell how dirty it is.    So once I'm back over the bridges, Steve gives me a call over near Menlo Mall. Well, let's just say that's not where I went. I am the first one to admit, I fucked up. Bad. This is the first time I have EVER fucked up that bad that I went somewhere so wrong, I couldn't fix the mistake in a minute or two. So he had to send someone else to the call, and the woman was picked up very late. I feel just terrible about it, but there's nothing I can do about it now. Let's just see if tomorrow suffers for it. He pretty much sent me home after that.  But speaking of home I am headed there now, I'm pretty tired after my wild duel-state sojourn. I'm hoping to get up early and go to the movies today. Well, till tomorrow..."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"I overslept last night and woke up at 2am. Hence totally missed work. That's the good thing about my job, I don't feel like going, I don't. So in the interest of posting something, I figure I will talk a little bit about some of our other drivers. Now, I don't intend to come off mean about anyone, but the truth about how truly fucked up we all are may not come out exactly nice. So in the interest of protecting those who may not know they are being immortalized here I will change their names. The very astute of you out there may be able to figure out who is who, but I will leave that to you. Also this isn't every driver with the company, just the ones I see most.  I will actually start with me. A mood-shifter can go from manic happy & hyper to pissed off, quiet & miserable with head-spinning speed. Either the nicest person you will ever ride with or the meanest.   Crazy (he actually may answer to this from time to time) - One of the angriest people I've ever met, he is banned from 7-11 for destroying the store. This is actually a pretty funny story. He spilled some hot tea on his hand and it hurt, so he knocked over the entire stock of cups they had on the counter, and when the indian guy asked him what the hell he was doing he grabbed the potato chip rack and threw it to the floor. Thankfully for him the rest of us are in there all the time so he called the office and the dispatcher managed to dissuade him from calling the police. Also for 20 something years old has the worst case of ADD I've ever seen.  Sam - A dispatcher, the only person in the world (that I know of) who can match my mood swings. When he isn't happy, he makes sure no one is happy. I like Sam, not many people do. That is one of the good things about working with him is no one else will. He has had quite a few fights with other drivers. We went out one morning after work for a few drinks, and he told me that I am one of the few people he's ever met that he considers on his level, as in not below his intelligence. I'm pretty sure this was meant as a compliment, but it didn't come off as very nice. He also isn't very nice to people on the phone. Which gets him threatened pretty often. Overall, I do really like working with him though.  Pete - Another dispatcher. Pete has the sexiest voice in the whole world. He just had a baby and his girlfriend hates me. She came to the office one day while I was sitting on the desk talking to another driver who happened to be in the bathroom when she walked in. Mind you I was nowhere near Pete, but you know how women can be. I feel bad for Pete, he deals with a lot of stress.    Abe - Abe is one of the managers, the only reason he works here is he's married to the owners daughter. He ""works"" for about 4 hrs. A day. Mostly talking on his cell phone, playing poker online, and making Pete's life miserable.   Harold - Main manager. Extremely nice, and terribly forgiving guy. Is like a 10th degree black belt in I believe TaeKwonDoe. He is amazingly patient. Abe is desperate to take over his job.  P.C. - His only job is calling the Welfare people and asking them if they are going to their appts. (doctor, meth clinic, etc.)PC will talk constantly in a straight monotone. Also drives Pete nuts. Poor Pete.  Bob - Bob works at night too. The world hates Bob because he's black. In his head anyway. He used to work for Lucent Technologies. When they majorly downsized and fired hundreds if not thousands of people, Bob was let go because he was black. Again in his head. He doesn't book much because he can never be found. Usually he is out wandering around somewhere. (in Iselin we believe) Also usually pretending to be on his cell phone having seemingly business conversations (at 4:30 in the morning.)  Ollie - Way to smart to be doing this. As a matter of fact, in testament to his intelligence, I mentioned to him the other night how smart I thought he was, and he told me smart meant ""pregnant"" in German. The guy seems to know a hell of a lot about a hell of a lot without coming off as a know-it-all. Ollie is great. He also quits drinking and smoking cigarettes about once a week. (He does these a LOT)  Donnie - Donnie works a swing type shift, he leaves not long after I do. Donnie drinks a lot. (Hey pretty much all of us do. Comes with the job I think) He kind of looks like Wilford Brimley, but his girlfriend is 10 years younger than he is and quite pretty. He's a lot nicer to me since I switched shifts, as he used to bitch I get all the good calls. If so it's only because he refuses them first. I have gotten some pretty excellent run-off calls from him. He won't want to go because he has to call his girlfriend, or use the bathroom, or stay at Metro or whatever. Nobody knows why, but hey it's his money.  Regular - This is his real handle, I'm using it cause he may read this one day, and he was a pretty good friend of mine. He talked me into taking the job. (Thanks a lot dude!) He used to be a 12-8er, but he's switched to the day shift now, so I never see him out anymore. Good guy. His thing is also drinking, a self-admitted drunk. (Again like the rest of us.)   Jim - A freelance photographer who doesn't do so well at it, I recall he was at I believe it was Gulianni's last day as mayor thing, to take pictures to sell to the newspapers, but he didn;t develop them for like a week. Jim isn't very bright (or very clean, he can be pretty ripe sometimes). There is a really funny story about him. He had a passenger in the car and had asked her if she minded if he stopped at Dunkin Donuts to grab a cup of coffee real quick. Well I guess he forgot he had her in the car because he got his coffee and proceeded to sit down and read the newspaper while she sat in the car and watched this. He needs a ride home every night, but no one wants to take him, he lives about 20 min. away and hands you like $2 if at all.   Mellow - This guy is cool as hell. He also dispatches. I love working with Mellow. He's always dressed nice, one of those people who makes sweatpants look good. Only guy I know that looks good at 3:00 in the morning on a Sunday. He works a lot. This is his second job, I don't know how he does it. He's sports guy, always a game on. (Yes even golf, on TV?!?) He's usually betting on the games I believe. He runs his own poker tournaments as well.  Carl - I don't like Carl. He's got some sort of fascination with me. I asked him out for a couple of drinks once just to be nice. (Dispatchers make you or break you, and I usually made good money with Carl.) He thought it was a date. Not quite dude. For the next week, he rang my damn phone off the hook. He's pretty new at dispatching, and he's not very good at it. I think you need just a touch of intelligence to do it if you get my drift.  Marie - Marie talks a LOT. Usually it's bitching. Scratch that it's ALWAYS bitching. Whether it's her health, or her car, or the customers, or the other drivers, it's always something. She will curse your name up and down, then be your best friend to your face. Marie HATES me. Darn. Another big drinker.  Bigpants - She's new. I don't know her that well other than the fact that she's usually hitting on all the drivers. And this the nickname they've given her on the dayshift. I hear she's leaving soon to move to Tenn. with some dude she met on the internet.   Todd - Knows everything. (Or so he'll tell you) Not a bad guy, another one I like working with, when I can get a thought in edgewise. (yes thought, not word, thought) No chance to think with him talking at the top of his voice.   Jim - Funny as hell. Jim has VERY recently started dispatching. A Lee St. graduate. (Raritan Bay Mental Health counseling, we drive a lot of welfarians here during the day.) He's kind of a manic personality, but fucking hysterical. He once told me he recently found out he's allergic to alcohol, he breaks out in handcuffs & restraining orders. I really like Jim.  I will probably use these people's real names in the posts if I talk about them, so good luck figuring out who is who. This is in no way a complete list (there are probably better than 30 drivers in all) but I'd better head off to work, so I'll be back first thing in the morning to tell you about my night. Again, please bear in mind that I am not trying to be mean in anyway about these people, just subjective. I remember once during my first week, I called Regular, and asked him if there was a single person who worked for us that was at all normal. He thought really hard for a minute and came up with a solid no. We are all seriously fucked up in one way or another, and we all have our vices. But then again isn't that true of everyone?"
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Sorry I haven't written in a while, I didn't go to work much this week. I've been feeling like shit. Switching shifts is killing me. I miss the nights a lot.  So the first call I took was this guy from Seattle going from the Sheraton to Newark. He was pretty darn cool, and tipped well. Very nice, He kept telling me to make sure I marry for money. It was a fun ride.   Then I rush back to switch into the crappy van for a 2:30 appt. These indians finally come out at 10 to 3, and expect me to load all of their 100 lb. bags into the van. Bastards. This is the trip from HELL. The stupid terror warning has all the bridges & tunnels all blocked up for ""security"". This makes it a 4 hour trip. 2 hours each way. No air conditioning. Thankfully it's like October weather, or this would have been cause to jump off of one of said bridges. Radio is broken as well. I don't think I got over 40 mph the entire trip. So we get there, I lug all of the bags out of the car, and I tell them it's $111 with the tolls. Can you believe this indian dude actually pulls $111 out of his pocket hands it to me a starts to walk away?!? I have never said anything to a fare ever about having to tip, but I freaked out on this one. I told him they made me wait almost a half hour, I sat in all that traffic, I won't get back for at least 2 hours, and lugged their bags and I'll be goddamned if they think they aren't going to tip me. So he holds out a $5 bill, I grabbed it, slammed the door, and took off. Fuckers.   I didn't get back to the office until 7:00 so I ate something.   CVS to the mall. 2 asian lesbians. They talked in chinese or something the whole way.  Then back to the office.  Liberty Tavern to Bristol Arms up by Metro. He was a drunken mess telling me all about his DUI and asking my opinion. I don't know what to tell you dude. Then he tips me $10 and insists on giving me his phone number. He never even told me his name. Whatever.   I got gas and decided to leave it at that.  I might go in tomorrow. Maybe not. Depends how I feel tomorrow."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Well, for the most part, the night sucked. Dead. Booked less than $100 tonight, and the freakin dispatcher needed a serious tampon or something. He can be so moody, and when Steve ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.  So my first fare of the night was this couple headed from Carteret to the LaMirage via Suchs Bar. I was actually quite surprised to find that the girl who seemed nothing but ignorant at first was actually pretty cognizant and empathetic. Actually a pretty sweet girl. Aside from the fact that she was headed to a cheapo motel with a  bunch of liquor and said she was going to call in 2 hrs for a ride home.   Now we head off to pick up another driver, Mary. Mary is drunk and freely admits this. She's headed from the Main to the Glass Bar. Crappy bar to crappier bar. Ouch.  Next guy complained my air freshener made his allergies bad. Sorry, but some of these people friggin STINK! My Avon Vanilla body mist goes everywhere with me! (I don't wear the crap just douche the cab with it.)  Willy. Dammit Willy's next. Let me explain Willy and my history with him a little bit. Willy has some kind of weird issue that makes him have a hard time walking. (My opinion is he makes a lot more of it for sympathy than it really is.)  I think it's some kind of rotting on the bottom of his feet. (Seriously.) So he always makes a big deal that when you drop him off you can't pull away until you have watched him walk into his house or the store or whatever. He will tell you exactly HOW to drop him off every single time he is in your car. Usually Willy insists you drive him all the way up his driveway to his back porch. The problem with this is his driveway is about half as wide as the car is with big bushes on either side. So the last time I pulled up this driveway, the bushes scratched the shit out of the side of the car, I almost got fired for that one. They were convinced that I sideswiped something and ran. Honestly I wasn't even aware of it until the next night when I was getting yelled at. It was the passenger side for one, and it's dark when I work, so I never noticed. Who would think bushes could wreck a car? So anyway he wasn't happy I wouldn't pull in the driveway, but he finally deals by telling me that I have to wait for him to get in the house flick his bedroom light. Whatever. See ya!  Then I get a Raritan Center call. It turns out to be a girl that i went to high school with and sort of ran in a few of the same circles. Grr. Not that I don't like reminiscing as much as the next guy, but I don't really like talking to people that much. She wants to stop at Walgreens and spends 10 minutes in there. She comes out with like 10 bags and somehow managed to go grocery shopping in a pharmacy.   Then I pass an hour sitting at WB train station. Yayy. Finally I manage to snag a Carteret off a train. He proceeds to light a blunt upon entering the car. Great, now I get to be tired, AND smell like pot. Avon Vanilla to the rescue!  Another hour passes, but this time I'm sitting in the office with Steve watching some LifetimeTV sitcom, (Told you he needed a tampon!) and listening to him scream at customers on the phone. This gets me sent off to pick up one of these (now pissed off) customers. The guy seems to have a hard time telling me where he lives. (Now I know why Steve was yelling at this one at least) Then in an amazing flash of brilliance he says ""You must think I'm a complete idiot."" There's hope for the human race yet.   Annie's next. She is awesome. She goes from work hopme just about every night. She always tips double her fare. She's a bartender at a Sheraton, and one of the sweetest yet kick your ass people you will ever meet. She moved into a new apartment and is looking forward to her vacation in the beginning of July, also she has aquired a really hot roommate.   Another very long hour.   Walter Drive. Screaming Woman. Hospital FAST!. Husband says ""we think it's ribs"" what ever that means, I think he did it. He keeps quietly telling her to calm down and shut up, nobody wants to hear her scream.  Young child with them as well. Bear in mind it is 4:30 am. Child is crying too. But very very quietly. Not a pretty scene. He tipped $2.00. He seemed too happy. Whole thing very unsettling.   Another LONG hour and just a regular morning train person.   Some talk in the office about another driver Brian. We are now convinced he is some kind of pedifile. He says he's just working here till he can afford his day care center. If you met the dude once you realize just how creepy a thought this is. maybe on one of my days off I'll write an entire post introducing you to the other drivers. (This could be an entire blog on it's own. Some strange cats indeed.)  Gas up and go home."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"It was pouring rain when I woke up tonight. So before I even get started for the night, as I'm walking in, there is this HUGE puddle, no scratch that, lake in front of the door to get in. No choice but to walk through. So now my feet are wet for the night, and we all know there is pretty much no grosser feeling in the world than wet socks. Please Taxi Gods don't let this be a sign for the night! Guess what...  First call is a drunk guy with one arm. He's only going around the block, but can't slur out the address. I ask him to just point the directions out. (Bad wording.) But nonetheless he tells me he loves me as he gets out of the car. This is why I like the drunks, it's nice to be told you're loved.   Then the first of many, many ghost calls. (A ghost call is when you go for someone and nobody's there.)  I pick up a girl to bring to work at a diner. She has also switched shifts, I used to take her when I was on the day shift. Now she works nights as well.   Some crazy people from Avenel are going to Linden. Well one of them is going to Quick Check and back, the other 2 on to Linden. The guy keeps trying to offer me gum, I don't know why, but he keeps insisting I take some of this gum. It almost seemed like he was pushing drugs. Maybe I should have taken the gum...   I can't take Route 1 back because it looks as though there is a truck accident and it's closed, so I take 35 back. Tim (who dispatched till about 2) sends me to Bud's Hut. Ghost Call. Main Tavern. Ghost Call. Chi Chi's. I'm pulling in the lot and he says forget it, get Jammers. I wish I wish I didn't get Jammers.  Jammers is a guy who speaks very little english and is going to Newark. He says he doesn't know how to get there. So I get directions and jump on the Turnpike.  About half way up he starts freaking out. (imagine this in broken english) ""No NO Newark 10 minutes Avenel what happened?"" So I tell him yes we are going to Newark, relax we're almost there. So from about exit 13A all the way to his house he's screaming and freaking out. I get to the exit I'm headed to and he's really panicking now. ""No No Newark Newark!"" Over and over again. Now I'm getting mad. So naturally I start yelling back at him. ""We're in Newark. Where the fuck do you think we are?"" So now we are a real special sight, sitting in line at a toll booth screaming at each other. The only time I've ever screamed at a customer this much I finally tell him ""shut the fuck up dude you are an asshole"". Contrary to what you may believe this did not make him stop yelling. (nobody ever said I have people skills.) He keeps going and I tell him if he doesn't shut up, I ain't taking his ass to Newark but to a police station. He didn't like that either. Finally we get to the toll collector and I ask him to please tell the idiot in the back seat that we are in Newark. He just laughs. Finally I get the guy out of the car and head back to sit in traffic. (The truck accident I mentioned has been cleared, but the road is still closed for some godforsaken reason.)  I should just go home now. I should re-name this site sado-maso-chick instead.  I pick up a guy at the Main who tells me all about how much money he makes working at the NY Stock Exchange. But I'm taking him from the Main Tavern (5 old guys sitting on the stools) to the City Motel Tavern (3 old guys sitting on the stools). Yeah you're rich buddy.  Then I got a guy from the Holiday Inn in Carteret who blew a tire getting off the Turnpike and had no spare. He was actually pretty cool, easy conversation all the way.   Back to the Main for 2 drunks, one of which bartends at the VFW, and usually is too wasted to get into the car, and the other is carrying a (probably stolen) neon sign. Thankfully that goes smoothly. Neon sign guy tips really well.  A few quiet people take their rides and get out.   I take Annie home, and she listens to me bitch about how mean Steve is being lately. She's always good for that. I guess it comes from 15 years as a bartender. She also offers to have him ""taken care of for me"", nice offer, but I know Annie is damn serious.   Now I'm sent to pick up on a corner in Woodbridge. Turns out to be TT, a previous driver. TT never wants to go home and literally begs me to let him ride for a while. He says he misses the job. TT took a DWI to help someone else out. He wasn't driving, but the guy who was depended on his drivers license to live. So TT took the fall for him and lost his license, and consequently his job. I feel bad for him and figure why not? So he rides along for a while.   We go to pick up the bartender from the Main. He tells another way too descriptive story about how he burned his ass falling asleep on a heating pad. People seem to get into my cab and think I want intimate details about them for some reason. I really don't. Really.   Since I'm up in the area, I grab Jen (another driver) and bring her into work. She's nuts she works 4am - 4pm. That's a crappy shift.   I get 1 airport and it's someone TT knows, his best friends mom. She didn't tip though. She's a flight attendant, and is headed to Cancun today. 1 round trip, 8 hours, and she makes $750. Where did I go wrong in life?  Last fare is a waitress from the REO home, and then to drop TT off. I get back to the office and Steve is bitching about how stupid all the drivers are. Last impressions are just as memorable as first ones. Kind of like how the last song you hear on the radio in the morning sticks with you all day...  Gas up & Go HOME!!!!!!!   PS - I never work on Saturday nights, so have a good weekend and I'll be back here early Monday morning with Sunday's events."
DRMG6T5,female,23,"Nothing overly exciting tonight, if you want the real action, check in on the weekends, that's when most of the craziness happens.  First call was a regular that goes from Carteret to the White Rose. He's always quiet when I have him, but I've heard other drivers say he comes out with some pretty weird stuff. Last one I heard was witchcraft (not Wiccan) rituals or something.  Next was this guy from Brooklyn (who says he's just visiting, yet I picked him up from ""work"") going from Charlie's Angels to Perth Amboy. He swears he wasn't in the strip club, just went there from the trucking company he works at to call a cab because it's a landmark. OK. I wouldn't care either way, but he was so adamantly swearing it without any provocation. I thought he was going to beat me cause he had to go in the house to get the money, and didn't have any personal belongings to leave for insurance. He took his sweet ass time coming out, but he did.  Then another regular, an old woman who works in the nursing home. She never looks very happy.   I picked up the older brother of an old friend from his job to the train station, but I didn't talk to him very much as I was on the phone his whole ride. It was the last day I could do so legally, as the statewide cell phone ban went into effect at midnight last night. (not that it'll really stop me.)   I switch cars since someone calls for a van job, and no one is in one at the moment. I like the van, not as ballsy as the cars, can't be taking any street races with a Windstar mini-van, but I still like the van for some reason. Comfortable. So anyway, they told the dispatcher they were 5 people, which makes it much more expensive. They were really 3 people 1 child & a baby. First of all they could have fit in a car, second, their fare could have been  at least  $5 cheaper than it was. Of course I didn't tell them this or anything since they were rude as hell. I was on my way there when the guy starts to tell me I don't know where I'm going. Which is why I have a license and he doesn't I guess. Then we get there and they decide to leave their 30 bags in the car while they check themselves into the hotel. Uh-uh, so I grabbed one of them and made her drag all the stuff out.   Then I took this Indian guy from Green Street to the Pioneer, he says something pretty funny, and true. As I turned a corner off of Oak Tree Road, there are about 10 people just wandering down the middle of the street. As I'm laying on my horn, I'm bitching about how there are sidewalks they could be using. He says yeah they never use them around here, I agree with him and he says: (this is the funny part) ""it's like one big backyard to them"" not hysterical to you maybe, but then you must have no idea what Oak Tree Road in Iselin is all about.    >>Ok so I was on my last fare here and got booted off aol, and lost the whole fucking thing. Dammit. I'll try again, but I seriously doubt it will be nearly as witty. I probably had like 1 sentence left to write.  Next was a black kid from Fords to Woodbridge, and my first decent tip of the night.   Then I head over to Mulberry Street (a bar) and find this kid who says he was in the bar with his dad and things got heated so he left. I ask him if he was in that bar, or the Elk Lodge and he says ""Oh no, I can't drink, I'm only 16 years old"". No Shit.  I grab a 6 pack and run it over to some guy, when I get out of the van and start to say something he shushes me violently, looks quickly toward the house as though someone is about to come running out of it, then looks at me like I'm crazy. Don't know what that was about.   One of the Mexicans home from Fridays.  Next I drive Mary home and she insists on telling me about the spider that bit her tit. Gross.   From there I run over to Breathless and find the Mexican who speaks great English from the other night. I have to tell you his English isn't as good when he's drunk! But he did tolerate my playing of Type O Negative's ""Unsuccessfully Coping With The Natural Beauty Of Infidelity"" (I Know You're Fucking Someone Else) at top volume.   I snagged a guy off the train who seemed quite gay, and thought it was the wildest thing in the world when I told him I was having a brain fart as to where his street was located.  There was a ghost call in Carteret which put me right near the next call which was a chick who was paying $9 to go like 5 blocks cause she was too drunk to walk it. Hey, she tipped too!  Finally my last call was to Laguardia with this chick who was going to South Carolina, and then on to Texas, California, and wherever the wind blew her from there on a 6 week vacation. It must be nice. I actually felt bad for her though. When she called yesterday to make the appointment, she told them her flight was at 8:30, so she needed to be there by 7. Whoever it was told her we would need to pick her up by 4am. Whoops, she wasn't happy she got there at 5am. 3 1/2 hours early. She just figured it was a 3 hour drive. She actually asked me what she was supposed to tip. Maybe it's me, but how do you answer that question? I told her I guess the same as a waitress like 15%. She gave me $20. Not too bad. I've gone to Laguardia and gotten $1. Hell I went to Kennedy for nothing once. Bastards.   Somehow I managed to get back to town in 1/2 an hour. (Probably illegally, but we gotta have fun somehow right?)  Like I said, Thursdays Fridays & Sundays are when you'll find all the real fun stuff, so I'm sorry if this was a little boring for you!   Goodnight! :)"

Now all these feelings are going thru my head again, about shit that happened and why it did and just stupid shit i should forget about. I thought i was gonna be ok and i was ready to move on, but obiviously not bc if i was i wouldnt be thinking about this shit n e more."

4VZFAMO,female,17,"*Breathe in, and let it all out* why do people fight over simple things? whats the point? isnt life fucked up enough without peoples insignificant problems just to cloud our minds even more? i mean theres more things to do than fight over stupid shit but yet peoples time and energy goes toward fighting over nothing. ive come to the conclusion that im not gonna let peoples ""problems"" or their ""short-comings"" get in my way of having a great senior year. Ive been thru so much stupid shit with Andrea, Deidra, Derek, Phil, Matt and the rest of those people to last me a life time. They are the only ones i know that start a fight with people over something they read in a NOTE, oh yes i said it, a NOTE! i think i went thru that shit when i was like 12 but no they are still doing it at 17 and 18, so i decided i would just seperate myself from them, bc im not gonna stress myself out over their child like behavior. Now i know what ur thinking, "" Tatji is just like that!"" Well alls i have to say to that is, Oh buddy ur so wrong. Im DONE with all of that. They only thing i gained from them was my stress level and my weight lol i need to put my body and MY life before their games bc im not gonna be the goofy 17 yr old any more after this school year. Im gonna be on my own, and i need to mature, i mean ya ill be the goofy 18 yr old but hopefully ill be more mature and maybe take things more seriously. i think at this point in my life, im really ready for something serious to happen. Ive always been the person to goof around and just take life as a joke and not as a gift and as corny as that sounds it is a gift and im gonna use it to my full advantage. Theres so much i could be doing and i should be doing it, rather than messing around and just being mixed up in stupid fights and seeing who said what and who fought who. Life is more than drama, its more than fights, its more than ""who fucked who"", its more than how much money u make, its a G-I-F-T, DONT WASTE IT!- *pillow* : )"

HGD57YO,male,38,"It was announced earlier this week that Sesame Street will be releasing it's own line of clothing for children. While at first, that sounds cute and fun and you think you can't wait to see your niece of nephew in their new Snufalufugus overalls, take a moment. I personally think Sesame Street risks turning their wonderful, educational show into nothing but one long-running commercial for their clothing line. In this day and age where kids shows are reverse engineered to do nothing but sell products to kids-- i.e. Pokemon, Spongebob, Power Rangers -- Sesame Street is one of the last bastions of pure educational children's shows. Sure, they had their products that were sold as novelties such as puppets and books, but even those things were usual packaged as learning tools. I hope Sesame Street can continue to produce the quality children's programming that they have for years, but I also know that the temptation to use the kids on the show as living mannequins will probably prove to be too much. It's a sad day for Big Bird, Oscar, Bert, Ernie and the gang. Unless, of course, they're getting a taste of the pre-tax gross profit."

HGD57YO,male,38,"If the media is controlled by the liberal left, why is it that the most prolific continuing story I've read in papers and heard on the radio over the last two years hasn't been about the war in Iraq or the upcoming presidential elections but how conservatives are being overwhelmed by the left in the media. After reading the article by John Leo listed in Maureen's post (06-02-2004) I've come to the conclusion that media conservatives have come up with a new conspiracy theory. They spend a good amount of their energy and time pointing the finger at Liberals and yelling ""blasphemer"" rather than expressing their opinions and leaving it at that. It really sounds like conservatives are saying ""We're right because they're out to get us"". A few points caught my eye.        Leo quotes a Pew Research Center survey as such: ""Pew reports that just 7 percent of journalists and news executives call themselves conservative, compared with 33 percent of the general public. The self-identified liberals (34 percent) are five times as common as conservatives in the news business.""        Isn't that a good thing for conservative reporters? It seems to me that if 33% of the news gathering public consider themselves conservative, they would probably get their news from a news source that is considered conservative. To wit: Of the 33% self-identified conservatives in the general public, how many are getting their news from NPR or the New York Times? I think they probably tune in to that 7% of media outlets that share their opinions. That's a 33% market share! Which, as far as ratings go, is excellent.       Don't think conservatives are getting paranoid? Here's another quote from that John Leo article:        ""In addition, there is debate over what ""moderate"" means in the survey. My experience is that liberal journalists tend to think of themselves as representing the mainstream, so in these self-identification polls, ""moderate"" usually translates to ""liberal."" On the few social questions asked in the survey, most of the moderates sounded fairly liberal. Asked whether homosexuality should be approved of by society, 88 percent of journalists agreed, compared with only 51 percent of Americans.""        So, moderate journalists are just liberals in disguise? Is John Leo actually suggesting that just because you disagree with conservatives on issues like homosexuality that you  must  be liberal? That a moderate can't be in favor of treating a whole cross section of Americans as human beings rather than degenerates? With John Leo its a big case of ""Us against them!"" I truly believe that people in the media should take a page from the spirit of this Blog. They should bring mainstream media back to a place where informed opinion can be expressed without all the name calling. Let's talk about the issues without judging people because of their stand on them."

HGD57YO,male,38,"During President Bush's speech on Monday night, he mispronounced ""Abu Ghraib"" three different times. Let's put aside all the political rhetoric and agree on one thing: When your leader, the most powerful man in the world, can't even speak intelligently about world events-- it's embarrassing. And its not like he screwed up the impossibly complex name of some diplomat from Arabia that he just met in passing. The Abu Ghraib prison scandal has been discussed ad nauseum in the media, on the hill, and, I'm sure, right in the white house. At the very least, his own advisors should have made sure he had it down before he stepped up to the podium. This guy is a world leader-- no, he is  the  world leader-- and it seems like the man couldn't pass a vocabulary test. I'm sorry, it's embarrassing."
EKE4P6J,female,24,"My mother came to stay with us this weekend, and we all went to Nordstrom's half yearly sale to go shoe shopping as Naya is now a size 6 and had outgrew all of her old shoes.  Naya really enjoyed trying on the shoes and looking at the bottoms since one pair had a fish and a sea star on the bottom.  So now yesterday when she had her rub-a-dub (bath) she refused to take off her shoes. So we compromised and she took off her tennis shoes and wore her Teva's instead.  then I had to convince her to take them off for bed.  And this morning she has been practicing putting her own shoes on and off, it is quite cute because she can't quite get her foot in all the way so she walks around with her heel up on top like a high heel.  First she put on her white fish sandals and we got the mail, then she wanted to put on her tennis shoes and go for another walk, and then she put on her old dress shoes and ran back and forth across the kitchen to hear the clicking sound.  After her nap when we went to Starbucks she had to keep showing her shoes to everyone.  Normally we don't wear shoes in the house but it hasn't been worth the battle to get Naya to take off her new shoes."

EKE4P6J,female,24,"On tuesday we went to the zoo. We didn't know it when we went but tuesdays are free and it was teh last free tuesday ever. So There were like 10 million people there.  I think that Naya was a little young to have to much fun yet. She did like watching the otters swim back and forth, well she liked it but was kind of afraid.  And she pretty much calls every animail a moo (cow) or a doggy.  We saw a monkey trying to pee on people, that was pretty funny.  When I was standing in line waiting to buy my elaphant ear I had Ari in the sling trying to feed him and a lady tried to get a closer look at him and realized I was breastfeeding. She was very embarrassed and apologized profusely, I kept telling her it was alright, I was standing in a public place.   Yesterday Great-grandma and Grandpa and Great uncle Tom and Teela and Kelsey stopped by on thier way home from the family reunion. Naya had fun playing with her cousins and Ari just sat contently whereever he was put.  He is always on his best behaviour when we have company it is quite funny.    Today We went to the poo (Naya's word for pool) at our old apartments.  Naya wore her flotation vest but was still a little scared .  We took the diesel volkswagen there and Naya thought that was cool since it has a fuel delivery problem and likes to die any time we stopped Eric had to keep revving it up. So Naya was sitting in the back going mrum-rum and whoa over and over."
EKE4P6J,female,24,"Today I woke up with a cold maybe? Sore throat stuffy nose and headache maybe allergies. Ari also had the sniffles, so he didn't sleep well last night either. Naya slept well though. This morning after breakfast we played with Naya's new Legos. She is starting to get the hang of them. Then we tried to take a nap because I was exhausted after a restless night and Naya decided that she wanted to stay up. I fell asleep a couple time but Naya played and cried (when I told her to lay down) for 2 hours. Her new thing is to fake cry all the time. I think she has noticed that Ari gets attention and picked up when he cries. At this point I realized she is not going to sleep and she had woken up Eric so we all got up ate and then we washed the dog. And now I am setting up a blog for everyone to see. I am going to try to write in it every night. But we will see."
EKE4P6J,female,24,"Hello again. The computer is on its last legs so I have been unable to work on it much. It is making horrible noises and I think the graphics card is going out. We have weird stripes going across the screen and all of the colors are off, plus all of the spyware problems. I was just trying to make a backup CD of my pictures while writing this and now the CD writer and the picture software aren't working either. I got the blue screen of death. Argh! I was going to upload a couple of pictures but we will see how it works.  Other than all of that life has been good. Jewel got a car so we went to the beach on Sunday and had a great time. Naya was playing on the slide and everything was going fine until somehow, I spaced out for a second and I didn't catch her. She landed OK but bumped her head on the slide. She still wanted to go on the slide but didn't really trust me anymore. So I had to hold her the whole way down the slide. I still feel bad about it, but hopefully I can regain the trust. Ari got his first ride in the BOB stroller while we were at the playground he thought that was neat since he could sit up and watch what was going on.  Another funny story, a couple days ago I thought I saw a hair on Ari's lip so I tried to brush it off and it wouldn't come off. Then I realized it was going up his nose so I tried to pull it out thinking it was just lying there. It still wouldn't come off. So Eric tried to get it and couldn't so I wrapped it a little around my finger and pulled and got it. It was like 2 inches long and growing out of his nose. I was thinking that doesn't bode well for him as he gets older if he already has crazy nose hair.  Yesterday, when I was putting Naya to sleep I was changing both kids into their PJs and while Ari was naked I blew a raspberry on his tummy, and Naya thought it was hilarious so now she wants to blow on his tummy every chance she gets. Naya has been fascinated with tummies since Eric does the ""tummy dance"", where he sucks in and pushes out his stomach really fast. Naya tries to do it to and can't quite do it but still thinks that it is the greatest thing on earth. She just loves everything Eric does. SO right now we have a daddy's girl and a Momma's boy.  Well I am going to go back to trying to figure out what is up with the computer. Wish me luck."

EKE4P6J,female,24,"It has been an eventful couple of weeks with a couple of ""firsts"" since I posted last. Naya has been learning new words left and right. Some of the pronunciations are very cute. Like money is pronounced molomny just try to say money while sticking out your tongue. She really likes to stick out her tongue on words like Alan and hello watermelon and elbow. Actually elbow and knee are her two favorite words at the moment. Well those and poop which can mean poop or diaper or pee or genitalia.  But back to the ""firsts"" Naya had her first bandaid which is quite amazing since she is over a year and a half old. But we were walking and she tripped and skinned her knee. She didn't cry she just looked up and said ""knee...Knee...KNEE"" very pitifully. Eric got to play doctor and cleaned it all up. The next day she had to wear shorts because she wanted to keep her eye on her bandaid, and the next day I had to put a new bandaid on. But I think she is over that now.  On the 4th Eric and I found out the hard way that Ari can roll over. He rolled off of the bed. After the initial screaming he seems to be unaffected by the whole incident. He did have a little rug burn on his forehead for a day or two. But I think we are going to have a very active little boy on our hands, Naya didn't roll over until she was a little over 3 months.  He has also been smiling a lot well for me at least. No one really believes that he smiles because he is still kind of a grump for anyone else. Naya has started having the occasional night terror as well. She starts crying in her sleep for about 20 minutes or so and I can't wake her up. Then she just stops and stays asleep. I think it is because her imagination is developing so well. She just isn't able to turn it off at night.  I also think she has an imaginary friend named Debby. She will sit and talk to Debby with her toys for 20 minutes or so, or she will just keep saying Debby Debby over and over again. Well that is about it for now hopefully I will keep up on this better as time goes on."

EKE4P6J,female,24,"Yesterday we went to a Heritage Festival at a church near our house. Naya was a bit young for the stuff there like bobbing for apples and ring toss, but she did enjoy the petting zoo. There were like 8 pygmy goats. She kept calling them doggy except for the black and white spotted one was moo. There were pony rides as well but she was afraid of the ponies so I didn't make her go on it. Though it would have been funny to have a picture of her on a horse looking pissed like the picture of me on the horse. Then we went to a new dog park to check it out. Raina didn't really like it but Naya enjoyed picking up apples that had fallen off of a tree. She could carry about 4 at a time. We had to keep stopping her from eating them. Today was a lazy day since it was sooo hot. The thermometer inside says it is still 80 inside and it is midnight. We played in our wading pool but it was hot as well. It has a piece of clear plastic over it to keep the bugs out so it heats up nicely when the sun shines on it."

HACER8E,female,26,"Why do I write about myself? Why does anyone write about themselves?   I'll tell you why other people do it: to validate their pointless existences. I, on the other hand, write about myself so that others will feel sorry for me. And if they don't feel sorry for me, I'll never know. That's the real beauty of blog publishing. You get your ideas out into the world, and think you're a genius, all because you get no feedback. If blog publishers were a little more picky and choosey about who could end up with an online journal, I bet only a few people would have the balls to hold their little lives up to ridicule. But no--everyone does it. It's life imitating Reality TV.  The other day, I realized I was chewing wintergreen-flavored gum to substitute brushing my teeth. And then I got to thinking, what other oral hygiene corners can I cut?  Why should I floss when I can chew on a perfectly good toothpick? No more eating corn from the cob. From now on, it's corn from the can. I don't need to brush if I can get it out with my tongue. If the dentist can yank it out, so can I. No more eating onions. What will happen? Will I suddenly become malnourished? A good ""mouth sweep"" with the index finger can do the trick. Gargling with a mouth full of water and toothpaste always fools everyone. Receding gum lines can be halted with the proper flying buttress supports. Hydrogen peroxide can brighten even the most yellow plaque and tartar buildup. Two hours before seeing the dentist, I can gargle with Listerine, eat some Cool Mints, brush my teeth several times in a row, floss angrily causing severe bleeding, eat some Certs, spray in a little Binaca, take a mouthful of Altoids, and voila! The dentist will be none the wiser..."
HACER8E,female,26,"In this day and age of child molestation protocol, love is hard to come by, especially if you never leave your house. I’ve been here for days with the doors unlocked, the shades up, and a bright neon sign saying “OPEN,” and still, nothing! Not even a homeless drunkard looking for shelter. Sometimes I wonder how my parents met—you know, before they broke up—and then I fantasize that I, too, might like to unexpectedly meet the man of my dreams in a community bathroom while I’m towel drying my hands on my blouse and he’s using the latrine. But that’s only a castle in the sky, not real life. I think the important thing to remember when looking for a life-long partner, or even a life-long tortoise, is to keep in mind that the search must continue no matter how hopeless the situation may seem or how unseemly an old prom dress may look when you’re wearing it alone at a local tavern, sitting on a bar stool, drawing little hang-man doodles on a bar napkin with a wet ring of bourbon staining the picture, like a moustache on the Mona Lisa or antlers on The Scream.  Some people never find love. These people are usually midgets. Well, nobody can see them, and they always get so defensive if someone says, “Speak up, little man!” or if they are mistaken for those painted trolls people put out on their lawns. “Bend him over just the right way, and you’ve got yourself a human lawn jockey” is often overheard at suburban cocktail parties at The Wyndie Hill Estates to the chagrin of tiny people everywhere.  I am somewhat of a stranger to love, although I’ve been in a few relationships. What matters is that I’ve never given up on them. What doesn’t matter is that I often use the word never quite out of context. Giving up on love, though, reminds me of a story—a story which I will tell you as soon as I turn this loincloth around to face the other direction. My grandfather once told me the anecdote, but when my grandmother overheard him use the word pantyliner, she interrupted to reiterate, profusely deeming his version “inappropriate.” I was pretty young when I heard the fable, and I’m not even sure those people were my grandparents, but let me endeavor to tell you as best I can, what with the loincloth and all.  There was an old man who lived in the country. His name was Battle Ax, for purposes of protecting the rights of the innocent, namely myself. He had farmed there all his life. His great-great-grandfather, Battle Ax, Sr., had settled the land, but in a tragic accident wherein his coronary arteries became blocked after consuming his usual breakfast of a stick of butter dipped in mayonnaise, he died suddenly right there at the table, face first into the leftover butter and saltlick appetizer at the tender age only the luckiest of centenarians live to be—92. Although the family assumed Battle Ax, Sr. to be the most gentle human ever to have lived, an autopsy revealed that he was really an alien and that his true name was Sir Klondike. Shortly afterwards, the boy child, whom the story is about, grew up, raised four children, and went on to become diabetic despite the family’s efforts to dissuade him from that disruptive lifestyle.  Late in his old age, the family took Battle Ax on vacation to Puerto Villarta, a little tourist city in Mexico. He enjoyed his time there immensely but became emotional when his good eye spotted a dead fish on the shore. The old man ran over and picked up the fish, whose eyes had been eaten and whose head was hollow like a whiffle ball bat, and said, “Hello, fishy, fishy. Wake up.” Battle Ax listened patiently for a response, but the fish didn’t answer. “HELLO, FISHY!” he screamed into the fish’s ear. But still, no retort came.  The old man, dissatisfied with the silence of the carp and beginning to suspect it was actually a northern pike, began shouting violently at the fish, shaking it with all the might he could muster. “Fish, I command you to say something!” he wailed. But the cunning fish said not a word. Fed up with such nonsensical insolence, he began to slap it around, banging its head against concrete slabs and scaring the gathering of children who had come to watch the spectacle.  “I did not disrespect my elders at your age,” Battle Ax pointed out to the deceased fish, knowing very well that if he kept up this rigorous activity, involuntary bowel movements might occur. “And I still respect them now,” he continued, “even though they are but spirits who play with my Saran wrap at midnight. Now, fish, speak to me. I am an old man, and my time here is not long, as my sense of sight is not what it used to be, and wasps look an awful lot like flying Milk Duds™ these days.” Unperturbed and even more unmoved, the fish was silent.  After what seemed like hours to crowd and days to the fish, the old man finally ended the struggle and nodded his swollen head in understanding. “I see,” he smiled, unaware he had just contracted viral meningitis. “Your silence is your wisdom, which you would like to impart to me before my silence is eternal. You are a clever and well-organized bottom-feeder. Your lesson I will take with me when my soul leaves my earth-bound body behind. My humblest apologies.”  Ten years to the date, Battle Ax suffered a fatal nose-picking session and died shortly thereafter.  The moral of the story that you should take home with you to show to your mother is that while the world spins wildly out of control, you sit by idly picking your nose. Where is your sense of purpose, of duty in life, and what if you forget to switch nostrils and end up with what looks to many like a problem in facial symmetry? The point is, the old man gave up. He stopped, in so many words, “slapping the fish around.” Then he died. That’s what happens to people who stop believing. And so it is with love. If you let go of the faith and begin to focus more on your education and career and less on your romantic life, your fish will never jabber on and on about silly, mundane things; it’ll only be silent—silent and wholly unforgiving…with no eyes. Remember, this is not my story; nor is it my Grandfather’s—it’s actually Plato’s account of Socrates’ grandfather’s story. No, it isn’t. But I bet I made you think just now."
HACER8E,female,26,"Even though it looks lame, ""Courier"" got me through college. Without it, I wouldn't have the worthless degree that has kept me from securing a job. Nor would I have the confidence in my abilities to write a 25-page thesis. That is, until I started using extra bold 36-point Courier font. My life without this epiphany, as I know it, would be different. I might even be in jail.      Courier established, for me and for many more students who feel that a good paragraph should be no longer than two sentences, a unique collegiate writing pattern that I will never forget. In essence, Courier taught me that the minimum spacing in between words should be no less than a few inches and that the actual letters should be girthy and elongated in width. I don't know if I can speak for others here, but this particular font freed me from the omnipresent belief we're taught starting in high school: the more words, the longer the paper. In fact, the very opposite is true: the bigger the letters, the longer the paper. I never understood why dictionaries have used such small inscrutable fonts. Why not cut the corners, use larger letters, and skip defining words that no one cares about, such as ""druther"" (combination of ""I'd rather"") and ""pate de foie gras,"" which, as far as I'm concerned, is French and doesn't belong in an English dictionary.      I think Courier also teaches another invaluable lesson, that of saying less while using the same amount of paper. Also, it is important to remember that thick paper helps your writing cause. With thin sheets, such as those found in literature and history anthologies and The Big Long Bible, a 100-page paper can appear to be the size of a Post-It(tm) note. Using thicker sheets, preferably the same size as the tree from whence they came, makes your paper, letter, or ""to do"" list look much more substantial, and let's not forget, pretty darn girthy."
HACER8E,female,26,"Actually, this is a personal blog designed for my friend, Natalie, who is still one of the few people--besides my ailing aunt--who believes in me. This particular blog might be vertically challenged, but I will add more as times continues its journey of going on and on."
HACER8E,female,26,"I've often fantasized about indoor water polo. Since I'm neither lucid or coherent this morning, I can at least bask in the thought that I am out of work. For now, since I'm completely unaware of my surroundings and cannot actualize the world beyond my couch, I am happy and unafraid and regard the future as some far-off place, a meandering destination that has nothing to do with my current situation. Unable to sympathize or even feel self-pity, I check the room for general distractions and gleefully acknowledge that reality is a social construct. Because today, my friends and cohorts, I am dazed. But not confused. I see the world and its inhabitants through a pleasant, bay window that's been installed in the driver side of my car. I tune into the beauty of a simple flower and disavow any knowledge of evil and abject cruelty. I even go so far as to say that if there is evil in the world, I am fine with it as long as it doesn't end up in my front yard. I look out into the empty street and conjure up people attending neighborhood festivities. Some of these people are carrying water balloons. The other half are carrying umbrellas. It's a peaceful celebration. I sigh the greatest sigh ever heard and turn away to visions of ample air time on TV for dogs that have jobs.      Yes, I make a mental note. There are dogs who have jobs, who work for a living. They're performers, artisans, craftsdogs, laborers, motivational woofers, investment barkers, dogs with more training than I've got. There are dogs who are employable because they have skills. DOGS. Yet I sit here, engulfed by mind clouds of happiness fuzzies, unable to attend to irrelevant matters, like feeding or dressing myself. Some of these professional dogs are fulfilled by their work. Some even volunteer or work for food, shelter, and if they're good, photo opportunities. These are dogs who are just happy to be giving back to the community, whose collective ankles they bite. Dogs who win prizes, beauty contests. Dogs who exhibit initiative. We get the Star Tribune every morning, but I refuse to fetch it. A dog will do this, and most of them can't even read. What am I lacking? Sizable canines? Paws? A smaller cranium that allows me to become agitated by the sound of a doorbell? A wicked aversion to men in uniform? A real appreciation for the finer foods in life, like liver snaps and gizzards?"
HACER8E,female,26,"In the beginning, there was Heaven and Earth. Then a few millenia passed, and a wonderful prose fiction arose, plumbing the depths of happiness, eternally ungrateful for ""the small things in life,"" and spasmodic in its praise of meatballs. It was called ""100 Ways to Have Fun with Anhedonia."" Then there was Hell.  Written by an author, ""100 Ways"" didn't reach its intended audience until after it was published and some copies were sold. It wasn't a bestselling novel in the early months of its release. With profits on the wane because the book was such a hit with the kleptomaniacal demographic, Penguin Distribution and Folks(tm) decided to pull it off the display shelves in bookstores, relegating the book to the Remainders section. Then they planned to stage a coup, purchasing every book in the store and returning them all with different book flaps in the hopes that ""100 Ways"" would have a more memorable title like ""The Angst of the Cornucopia: How I Learned to Love Again.""  Afraid that purchasing the rights to the book was, literary, a mistake, Penguin Publishers and Venal Sons decided to White Out pages in the text that seemed superfluous and vain. Fifteen years later, Dunquist Books Limited bought the languishing book from Penguin and revived the deletions. Parts of the unabridged version are as follows:  Number 12: Look directly into the sun. For a long, extended period of time. While you may suffer no side effects now, you have already permanently damaged your retina!  Number 44: Drink sewer water in Mexico. Tell everyone.  Number 70: The downward spiral in the abyss of your mind is real. Go with it!  Number 2: Never delight in a Broadway musical or take tap dancing lessons.  Number 39: Once you have climbed your way to the top, give in to childish whimsies and destroy your reputation.  Number 63: If the world doesn't understand you, you probably are alone. Take some time out to cry.  There are more tidbits of wisdom in this enchantingly great read. Packed with maxims, aphorisms, and practical philosophies, this life-renouncing novella has changed the lives of many people, propelling some into schizophrenia and many others into clinical depression, usually followed by a suicide attempt. When it first was published as a serial list in ""The New Republic,"" critics panned it. ""Very negative outlook on life,"" reported the Chicago Sun-Times. ""This list can only be described as bleak."" But readers, anxious to hear that there is no God or Afterlife because humans don't have souls, were not deterred.  Luckily, man's search for ultimate meaninglessness is still a relevant sociological and psychological topic, and this enables ""100 Ways"" to continue its unabated mission today."
HACER8E,female,26,"Certain people think I'm out of touch with black culture, but just because I may be a white girl from the decent part of Minneapolis doesn't mean that I'm not connected to the street life. I watch ""Cops"" and I'm a die-hard fan of Eddie Murphy and Latoya Jackson. I'm also proud to say that I graduated with black students and even ate near them in the same cafeteria. I'm definitely ""hip"" to the hip-hop culture. (Rocking to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie!)

Like  urlLink Johnny and Sally , I have a sizable collection of black friends, and the list of homeboys and homegirls grows every day. In closing, I'd like to say Peace Out to all my pimps and dawgs.

HACER8E,female,26,"You know, it's very hard to write in a different font. What I usually have to do is write in plain-text Times New Roman, and then highlight what I've written and set it as a new font. So don't be fooled if you think I get my ideas from switching it up--writing boldfaced, adding quirky Courier commas, italicizing everything. No, it all looks pretty basic when I'm doing the actual writing.

Otherwise, I lose my readership, my advertisers, my financial backers pull out, the value of my stocks drop like dense horse pellets, and all my shareholders burn effigies in my front yard, which makes the neighbors angry, who then call the police, which then attracts news reporters, which makes the value of my property decrease. For a writer, this is a lot of pressure. One bad article or column or bumper sticker, and my house will get repossessed. I walk a fine line with every word I write. I hope this answers your query.         Michelle from Goat Cheese, Vermont, writes: ""Your website is dedicated to competitive blogging. How can an online diary ever become a sport? And why would anyone want to air out their personal lives in a contest?""         The whole point of competition, Michelle, is to make all the people who don't win (which is everyone who entered the contest except for the one person who wins it) feel bad. The principle of competition is the driving force behind our wonderfully fair free-market economy, a sort of Darwinian theory applied to Wall Street, where many people clamor for endless commodities, but only a few get to enjoy them. It's survival of the priveleged who have great contacts in high places. In other and more words, our economy is designed to make people feel bad and hurt their feelings. And isn't that what democracy is all about? And free speech? And the right to justify liberty? Competitive blogging will bring out only the best blogs while ceaselessly punishing the bloggers who didn't win. If you can't see the point in that, I can't help you."
HACER8E,female,26,"I hate having to wake people up. It's too much responsibility. It sounds easy at the time, and that's why I don't turn people down when they ask for this simple request. ""Wake me up at such-and-such a time."" Sure, why not? And their instructions are explicit. ""Don't allow waking-state me to go back to sleep. Whatever I say, don't give me another 15 minutes, even if I somehow come up with a good excuse for why I need it."" Don't be fooled by their crafty alternate personality is their advice. And when I go to wake them up, they say EXACTLY what they told me they would say. ""Ok, just 15 more minutes."" I have a very hard time arguing with that. What am I going to say? ""No, the Other You told me that This You can't sleep in. You have to get up."" Most of the time, I give in.  And then, of course, they eventually wake up and shed their alternate ego. ""What?"" they ask incredulously. ""You actually LISTENED to me? I don't know what I'm saying. I told you I would come up with some lame plea. I LIED to you. And now I'm late for work, because you listened to me."""
HACER8E,female,26,"I can't get comfrotable. I've had caffeine and nicotine, so I'm restless. I don't want to sit still. And my mom--may she rest in peace--won't be leaving for work for another couple of hours, and in her spare time, she nags and complains. I really would rather have my mornings to myself. I like taking it easy, having my smoke, drinking my coffee, thinking my own thoughts.  Ah, here she comes, and it looks like she's forgotten not to bother me. ""Alexa, are you gonna fold those clothes in the basement?"" I swear, that's all she wants to talk about--personal hygiene and household chores. This morning, I caught her sweeping a floor that I cleaned less than three days ago. Life for my mom is all about watering plants, feeding cats, and vacuuming. So far, she hasn't said one word to me. I appreciate her not meddling in my morning affairs. But now she's talking to the cat, and that's irritating me. Every time I have a conversation with her, she always interrupts me with ""Come here, kitty,"" ""stop it, kitty,"" and ""what do you want?"" Sometimes if she wants to say something that's really important and the comment can't wait, she says, ""Oh, look at her. Isn't she adorable?"" Right in the middle of my sentence. I can't finish a story, because somewhere in the room, there's a cat looking REALLY ADORABLE. I wish there was a kind of medication available out there for people who can't shut up--a pill that makes you want to listen to people without adding anything to what they're saying. A pill that stops your own thoughts while someone else is talking. Or maybe just a pill that makes you ill every time something looks like it could be just tooooo adorable, so that you have to look away."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"After watching ""Bruce Almighty"" for the first time I was reminded again why I seldom buy a lottery ticket.  The chances of actually winning something worthwhile is astronomical / 0.  This after standing in line for 30 minutes or more, since no-one actually buys a ticket the day before. But, say, I win the 1 million or 4 million or for that matter the 15 million.  Strangely enough, there always seems to be 2 - 6 winners, so effectively I'd end up with 500 000.  With that, I can buy a middle class home, which still leaves me with paying the rates & taxes, insurance, armed response security, 2 x guard dogs, gardening services.    Then again, maybe I should just opt for the trip around the world, even if it only means getting as far as London.  Applying the law of averages of course my luggage will end up in Australia and have better in-flight entertainment ...."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"Growing up there were a few things that seemed quite obvious, regarding personal hygiene.  Little things like first washing your hair, then yourself in the shower.  Everyone has their own towel, washcloth and toothbrush.  Then along comes sharing a house with 6 other people with different ideas on hygiene.  In the mornings there was a certain routine to things.  Remember, 7 women, 2 bathrooms and none of us were into using the bathroom at the same time.  The first ones up in the mornings would be Sally and Petra since they had to catch the bus quite early.  Then Cathy would start to get ready to go to her real job, although running late was also part of her routine.  Then it was Abby and Mandy's turn. Both were students and either rode their bicyles or walked to class.  This generally meant that I was the last one to get up ( which seemed to have become a pattern in my later life as well).   By the time I get to the bathroom most everyone had already left the house.  Ah, peace and quiet and wet towels, dirty bathtubs and dirty clothes.  I'm quite possessive about my towel and finding my towel, wet, truly freaked me out.  After closing my eyes and taking deep calming breaths I'd go and get a fresh towel.  There always seemed to be a shortage of clean towels so I resorted to keeping my towel in my room, as well as my toothpaste, toothbrush and well, frankly everything that would usually reside in the bathroom.  If someone didn't have a problem using my towel, there's a distinct possibility that they would use my toothbrush too.  Then I'd walk into the kitchen and have my second deep breathing exercise of the morning.  A pig sty would have been cleaner.  I am not exaggerating.  Well, maybe I am exaggerating a little, pigs are after all uglier.  Everyone had their own set of cupboards.  Petra found the only cupboards that had keys and would lock her stuff away.  She had really nice plates and glasses which the other would just use, since once again, they'd run out of clean kitchen stuff and hey, here's some clean stuff, let's use this, without asking!  Now I am not one the neatest people myself, but it took me about 2 weeks to throw a hissy fit about the state of the kitchen.  Especially after walking into the kitchen one evening to find a big rat sitting in the middle of the floor.  Then there was the incident when someone was actually doing the dishes.  Nothing wrong with that, until she used the drying cloth to wipe something off the floor!  The difference between dish cloth and floor cloth was explained.  We had a talk about the state of the kitchen and I volunteered to give the kitchen a spring clean.  That's when I found the cockroaches.  We are not talking one or two, we are talking hordes!  I was busy unpacking all the cupboards when I noticed a few cockroaches running from under the one bowl, so I peered closer and almost did the ""cockroach dance"".  The back of the cupboard was covered in cockroaches, you could barely see the white of the wall.  These ones didn't even run away!  Promptly everything was moved out of the kitchen and I went to buy fumigate stuff.  My skin still crawls when I remember the number of dead cockroaches that we found every morning for the next week.  We were never able to get rid of the rats though.  Having 7 people in the same space is challenging enough, but then there was the family and friends to deal with ... more to come on that ..."

MYIDXUK,female,35,"whoops, tomorrow is the last day of handing in my tax paper thingies.  I've been procrastinating.  This is not a new phenomenon.  Just call me the queen of procrastinators.  It's a family trait although neither of my parents were procrastinators, or any of our grandparents.  A recessive gene, or something.  Anyway. A good friend helped me to complete the tax forms about 4 weeks ago.  All that I still have to do is sign the form and attach a detailed travel log thingy, and make photocopies of everything.  This is the bit that I haven't done yet.  At least, I've done it, but I haven't printed it out yet.  ""Done"" is such a relative thing.    So, seeing that it is after 16:00 already, it's not a good idea to drive into town to hand in my tax returns.  The reasons being that it's peak traffic, it's not safe to be in town after dark and what would I be if I didn't procrastinate until the last minute.  The cut off time is tomorrow evening 18:00.  I'm sure I'll make it by then.  I'm still beating my all time record of being 3 years late on tax returns.  A man came knocking on my door and I was actually fined!  I'll never be doing that again."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"Finally getting back to the next installment. (A bit of leave and some much needed gardening got in the way)  I did have my own room in the house, that I shared with my two cats. The same ones I have now. When Patricia moved in she brought her dog with. Some type of staffordshire terrier. The new doggy loved to come into the house.  One evening I was walking through the house with the grumpy cat when the dog decided to come into the house. I was holding Grumpy in my arms when the dog thought my cat looked very interesting, and edible. Total chaos ensued. I didn't want to let go of Grumpy since I imagined blood spattered walls and one dead Grumpy, so I held on. Grumpy did not like this situation at all.  Val, a visiting friend, was trying to get the dog out of the house while I ran down the corridor to the bathroom so I could close the door and let Grumpy go. The dog kept following me, jumping up and down like a ping-pong ball. Grumpy was chewing at my hand, no claws though since I was holding on to tightly. At one point Val screamed that Grumpy had bitten her! Eventually the disaster was averted with the dog outside and Grumpy in the bathroom.  Time to asses the damage. My hand was covered in blood. I counted about 16 holes and remembered at some point that Grumpy was gnawing at my finger, teeth scraping against bone. There was way to much adrenalin in my system to feel any pain though. This definitely constituted an after hours visit to the Dr.  Suddenly Val burst out crying since she didn't have money for the Dr and she was only a student. Well, it was either that or get some dreaded lurgy from the cat bite, or try our luck at the pharmacy for a tetanus shot. So off to the pharmacy we went. I'm driving with my bloody hand and still not feeling any pain. The pharmacist was fresh out of tetanus shots but gave one look at my hand and said, ""I best think u visit the Dr"". So we drove over to the after after hours clinic that had to call the Dr that was on standby. I could hear the money meter running.  Val started crying again because she was scared of needles. I wonder who she thought would have done the injection if the pharmacist had any tetanus shots. She went first at the Dr's office and it was quite anti-climatic ""oh, this little bite?"". When it was my turn the Dr took my hand and scrubbed it with brush! That's when the pain set in! He also gave me antibiotics and told me that he couldn't give me stitches since it was puncture wounds and it would get nasty.  My hand puffed up nicely in the next 3 days, up to the point where I couldn't close my hand since it did a fair impression of a balloon. I was still the designated driver through all of this.  For the rest of the year my cats stayed in my room, oh what joy. They would have their private little cat fights throught the half open windows with the dogs outside. That's where Stupid got his name. ""stupid cat, you really think you're going to take on a dog twice your size?""  The next installment of the story might be the last. I never know."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"Sunday, visiting my brother and his family while they were keeping an eye on the in-laws smallholding, the horses decided to go for a little visit to the front garden.  It appears that the horses have figured out how to open gates.  They were quite merrily rolling in the flower beds when we discovered them.  Now how to get them back into their camp without a rope to lead them?  My brothers idea was to chase them with a stick.  The horses do have a very averse reaction to sticks.  No he didn't hit them, just waved the stick around a bit and boy did that set them off galloping.  I was standing quite relaxed at the corner of the house to stop them from running around the house again when horse number 1 decided to play chicken. Never play chicken with a horse!  They're big and powerfull and fast!  I had my adrenalin rush for the month *chuckle*.  Lucky for me the horse stopped about 1 meter from me and gave me the eye before taking another gallop around the front garden.    I was holding the little minuture duchhound in my arms through the whole thing and she had barked so much that her voice was gone.  This is just the cutest little dog you've ever seen.  Once the horses were back in their camp and I put her down, she ran over to the fence and started barking at the horses again.  This tiny little dog was quite prepared to take on the horses.  What she lacks in size she makes up for in personality.  Then of course the best thing about visiting family on a sunday is having a sis-in-law that cooks a proper sunday lunch! *happy sigh*"
MYIDXUK,female,35,"Tomorrow is a public holiday, which is a godsend.  This means I can actually mow the lawn before my dad's visit on Sunday.   The saga of my lawn.  I believe that it has been mowed a sum total of 6 times this year.  Of which I was responsible for about 3 times.  For the rest I relied on my brother's sympathy to go and mow the lawn when I'm travelling.  Thank goodness for brothers that sometimes remember they have a sister.   When do I know the lawn is getting too long?  There's 2 signs.  The first sign is when I only see my dogs ears sticking out when they run through the long grass in the backyard.  Both my dogs are cross-chows.  The second sign is when my neighbours starts mowing the grass on the pavement in front of my house.  The issue with getting it done before the weekend is that my dad is a meticulous gardener and he'll have a heartattack when he sees the state of my garden.  Apart from the lawn that REALLY needs a bit of attention, there's the flower beds.  The flower beds are green, which is good, but from a distance it's difficult to differentiate between the weeds and the plants.  Hopefully I've put a stop to the ant colony that has (have?) infested the entire garden.  I stopped using a spray gun for the ant poison, but resorted to using a watering can.  That way I could apply more ant poison a lot quicker than walking around spraying milliliters into each little anthole.  Then again, the ants may just have gone dormant with winter setting in.  Maybe I should consider getting garden services .... Let me think about this ... naw, I can do this :)"
MYIDXUK,female,35,"For me, there's nothing as challenging as having to get up early on a friday morning when winter is setting in.  I have 3 alarms for this purpose, but this morning it did not help much.  Whoever invented the snooze button should either be shot or given an award.  Now that I'm at work and my one and only meeting for the day has been concluded I'm seriously considering some ""retail therapy"".  Seeing as the guys are off to play golf and I am so not going to be stuck in the office on my own.  It's times like these that I play with the idea to actually learn how to play golf ... not!  I just do not get the fascination with golf.  Walking around for hours with a stick and a little ball? Digging in ditches, crawling in the long grass, ducking as a golf ball zooms past? I can think of quite a number of things that are more relaxing ....."
MYIDXUK,female,35,"As winter slowly sets in I'm reminded of the comfort food my mom used to make for us.    I fondly remember coming home from school on a cold day and find that my mom had made melkkos.  It's home-made noodles cooked in a lot of milk with cinnamon and sugar. No-one can make it like my mother did.  Then there were the koeksisters, which will give any dietician a heart attack.  It's plaited dough, deep fried and then soaked in a sweet, sweet sugar and spice sauce. The secret is that the sauce has to be made the previous day.  I loved it when guests came over because then my mom would make melktert.  The closest I can come to describing it, is that it's a traditional tart with a hard crust and a soft filling of milk/eggs/cinamon/butter/sugar. It sounds a bit bland but it's one of my favourites.  Rainy days were the best.  Then it was time for pannekoek!  Pannekoek is almost like pancakes, but flatter and bigger, about the size of a small plate, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, then rolled up.  Fancy restaurants now serve it with other types of fillings with anything from mince to poached pears.  Just give me the cinnamon and sugar variety please.  As kids, baking day was a highlight.  We would fight about who got to lick out the bowl, lick the spoons and help with the mixing.  As we grew up we'd all pitch in and help for the simple reason that nothing tastes as good as when it's hot off the stove or fresh out of the oven.  Things could get ugly when all of us were home since there's 6 of us, 5 brothers and me, the spoilt brat.  Most of us have a sweet tooth and many a fight was fought over the ""last piece"".  My one brother tried to steal the last piece and hide it in the fridge.  He seemed to be genuinly surprised that it was found by someone else.  We had perfected the art of finding anything sweet in the house.  My dad would buy these assorted chocolates and then share it out when he got home.  There was a whole ritual involved with this.  Everyone brought a bowl and he would equaly share out the sweets.  Then the negotiations would start because none of us liked the chocolates with the ginger fillings.  ""I'll give you my ginger filling for your orange flavour"".  Once that was done we would each go to our own corner and eat everything at one go.  Now that I think about it, my dad might have done this to have about 20 minutes of peace and quiet.  My mother seldom ate sweets so she would put hers away for later.  Later being us going on the prowl for more sweeties!"
THJWPEJ,male,16,"todays topic. the club shaggin also known as as the shagin wagin id just thought id dedicate a blog to it cause it really deserves credit. first of all, what it is is a  small house that david, brian and his dad built 2 summers ago in daves backyard. sounds like a dorkey treehouse but its nice. it was electricity, carpet, drywalls and paint and phone and cable. so its painted like a deep redish color and there are a bunch of shelves in there and candels and places to put ur cell fones and stuff like that. its about the size of a large bathroom, 8 by 8 to be exact, so its not too big but its nice and secluded and that is key. so thats what it looks like, and the stuff that happens in there is tight too- just becasue its so small and there is nothing to do in there except  as some like to call ""taping"". just stuff that u wouldnt tell ur parents about. so there are so many good experiences in there and so many things that have gone down that i really think someone needs to get on making a book describing the greatness of it. also, someone needs to make like a plaque of sometihg that would be the tap list for all of the names of people who have taped in thurr. so if someone would please get on that it would be great. the only other thinkg i can think of that she club shagin is missing is come type of good air conditioning system as we found out a couple of night ago when everyone was sweating perfussely and personally my shirt was drenched with sweat. it was gorss, almost as gross as what goes on in club shagin which gets back to my origional point that the shagin is one of the bast things that happened in life. so i know that some will try to deny that the shagin doesnt posees some magical power of love but  i think it does and IF u havent been in there, go tthere cause i gaurantee u will have a good time"

THJWPEJ,male,16,"id just like to bring up the topic of TPing.

THJWPEJ,male,16,"the rules of life. i know many of you have never heard of them but i have and i think that you all should knw them so u can generally live better lives. the orgins of these rules start with none other then boatsky byers, and flourished over many days and random spirts of influance from many people. so pretty much they go like this  1)  get pumped  2)  come with speed  3)  get past the initial shock  4)   play the game like u aint got nothin to loose  5)  cream left, cream right, cream center  7)  worship the sacred families(kong, glotter, meyer)  8)  aint no shame  9)  put chur thang down, flip it and reserve it  10)  timing is everything  18)   Always have a latin lover  Its very obvious where these come into play, and for the most part 2 or 3 or 4 will come into play each and every day. For example, if you are having a bad day or have nothing to do, get pumped, then play the game like u aint got nothin to loose and call someone new. Now timing here is evrything, cause u have to get a hold of that person at the right time.  Lets see, in HS you really have to play the game like u aint got nothin to loose, becasue u really dont have anything.. no job, not much money, no wife, no kids, no taxes, nothing to do except playing the game like u aint got nothin to loose.   Or lets see we find Clay burrows in the Susan lindgrin parking lot like we have many a time before, we would have to get past the initial shock and actually make the situation into somehting that much better. for example, pull or a video camera and record it or picturaize it.  Pretty much, these rules of like are utility things that u should have memorized and should use because i really know that they will help your social, academic, sporting and sex life. trust me on that. so just use em cause thats why they're there"
THJWPEJ,male,16,"school dances whata great thing in life. id just lie to give so much credit to any dance/club or anything where people dance bacause they are so amazing. i got in the mood to just let loose on  the dance floor a lil bit ago because i made a GET PUMPED mix and it made me want to be at homecoming so bad. i reminded me of the sweating bodies rubbing against eachother and the beat of the bass exhoing through your entire body as hundreds of people rub their bodies in constant motion. WOW am i excited for homecoming. me and brad will have to show out so hot of dance of moves on the floor for hours and hours. SO i really hoep u all are practicing all the latest moves and getting as pumped as i am because homecoming is gonna be amazing. just picture the croded, 100 degree dance floor that is at least two times to small. and then picture get low coming on, or yea or even a little lean back and picture the amazingness and energy of everybody within a hearible distance. then picture after the dance when your body is coated in a fine salty sweat and walking outside into the brisk air and as you load the bus you are in the best mood possible. i just cant take it right now i need to be at homecoming"
YLF0EHZ,male,23,"[via  urlLink CTHEORY ] an international journal of theory, technology, and culture.    urlLink Part 1   Mutations in the Body Politic  A question: are we connected because we are collective, or are we collective because we are connected? Another, related question: in the ""network society,"" is it possible to reformat the body politic without resorting to the paradigm of modern sovereignty?  The overarching argument made in this essay is that networks, swarms, and multitudes are examples of mutations in the contemporary body politic. These mutations are structurally innovative, but politically ambivalent. In some contexts -- such as that of the various anti-globalization movements -- they contain the potential to become politically radical. In other contexts -- such as that of the diversification of international economic organizations -- they become conservative or reactionary.   urlLink Part 2   Are networks, swarms, and multitudes indications of mutations in the body politic? If so, how do they articulate the concepts of connectivity and collectivity, which have been at the heart of political theory for some time? This essay attempts to sort out the conceptual underpinnings of network thinking, and in doing so it brings together technology, biology, and politics into a set of relationships.  While networks may seem ubiquitous these days, we are still far from a thorough understanding of them as political ontologies. Much of this has to do with the way in which time and dynamic change is configured in fields such as graph theory and network science. In these fields, as in much network thinking generally, a network is taken as a static, meta-temporal pattern -- a Eulerian and Kantian view. Bergson's view of duration critiques this notion of dynamic change in networks, but this leaves us with the strange sense that networks do not exist (at least not in their traditional, static forms)."

39X1EJI,male,40,"Isn’t localization simply the process of translating your documents to whatever language you want? Get an English to Spanish (or Polish, or German, etc.) translator, and voila! You’ve localized your document. But wait, that approach has caused major problems for some companies:   The Dairy Association's huge success with the campaign ""Got Milk?"" prompted them to expand advertising to Mexico. It was soon brought to their attention that the Spanish translation read, ""Are you lactating?""  Coors put its slogan, ""Turn It Loose,"" into Spanish, where it was read as ""Suffer From Diarrhea.""  And my personal favorite:  In a Tokyo bar: ""Special today for the ladies with nuts.""  Still confused? Read Becky Johnston’s excellent definition that points out the important  differences between localization and mere translation:   Dictionary.com defines localization as a noun meaning to limit to a specific area. In businesses, the term localization usually refers to translating content; in this sense, the content becomes available for a specific area of the world.   Several localization providers do not specify a difference between straight translation and localization. However, LISA, the Localization Industry Standards Association, defines three levels of localization: translation, localization, and globalization/internationalization.  Translation Translation is the act of changing content to a new language such as changing a user’s manual from English to Spanish. ASE&T, a translation company, argues against “the erroneous notion that translation is simply ‘typing in a foreign language.’”   According to ASE&T, “The company that performs your translation is crafting your image to your foreign customers. If your documentation has taken six months to compile, revise, and edit, it is critical to allocate sufficient time to achieve similar high-quality results in a foreign language. For large-scale projects, short time lines or simultaneous release, the scheduling and management of the translation process are as important as the translation itself.”  Although translation is concerned with consistently using terms in the same document and with accurately changing to a new language, translation does not alter the original content.  Localization Localization is more involved than translation. Localization involves translating and polishing content, so it is culturally appropriate.   According to the Localization Institute, “Localization is the process of creating or adapting a product to a specific locale, i.e., to the language, cultural context, conventions and market requirements of a specific target market. With a properly localized product a user can interact with this product using his/her own language and cultural conventions. It also means that all user-visible text strings and all user documentation (printed and electronic) use the language and cultural conventions of the user. Finally, the properly localized product meets all regulatory and other requirements of the user's country/region.”  Localized content might be altered from the original content because localized content is designed for a specific region. LISA used the example of the changes that might occur when localizing a software package. “On the software programming side, screen dialog boxes and field lengths may have to be altered; date, time and currency formats changed; delimiters for figures replaced; and icons and colors adapted; to give only a few examples. What is more, in the case of bi-directional languages (such as Arabic and Hebrew) and double-byte character sets (such as those for Chinese, Japanese and Korean), more extensive reprogramming may be required to ensure that localized text and numerals are displayed correctly on the target platforms.”  Localizing involves changing the content to fit cultural expectations; whereas, translation involves only changing the language of the content. LISA also describes some of the localization changes made to chunks of content: “[T]he color, size, and shape of objects such as coins and notes, taxis, telephones and mailboxes, and buses and ambulances, traditionally vary from country to country. Vehicles may suddenly have to drive on the other side of the road, while dress codes will vary, and symbols take on a new significance. Similarly, mainstream business applications such as address databases and financial accounting packages have to be adapted to the procedures and conventions applicable in their new environments.”  Localization makes content more accessible than mere translation.  Globalization/Internationalization Globalization involves an overarching strategy for creating a global company. When a company uses globalization techniques, content becomes easier to translate and localize because the content is already culturally neutral. Many consulting companies, such as welocalize, get involved early in the content creation process. According to welocalize, this early interaction makes the content more consistent across languages and speeds up the launch date of localized content.   According to LISA, “[I]nternationalization is the ‘opposite’ or forerunner of localization. In other words, it is the process of designing and implementing a product which is as culturally and technically ‘neutral’ as possible, and which can therefore easily be localized for a specific culture or cultures. This reduces the time and resources required for the localization process, thus saving producers money and improving their time-to-market abroad. As with localization, language, technical and contents issues are involved, with project management and coordination also playing a significant role. Internationalization has now reached the point where major software publishers can release 30 or more different localized versions within a month or two of the original version, a process known as ‘sim-ship’ (short for ‘simultaneous shipment’).”  Globalized text must still be localized; however, the localization becomes less costly and more efficient. According to the Localization Institute, “Internationalization is a way of designing and producing products that can be easily adapted to different locales. This requires extracting all language, country/regional and culturally dependent elements from a product. In other words, the process of developing an application whose feature design and code design do not make assumptions based on a single locale, and whose source code simplifies the creation of different local editions of a program, is called internationalization.”  Summary Translation means changing content’s language without changing the content. Localization refers to adapting content, so it becomes applicable to specific regions. Finally, globalization or internationalization refers to writing your initial content so it is easier to translate and localize.

39X1EJI,male,40,"Ooooh, I know this one! This is where newspaper columnists make millions when their sycophantic drivel gets run and rerun in papers nationwide. Yeah, that’s what it means in print publication, but what about technopublishing? Not surprisingly, it means about the same thing. Come on – didn’t you read about RSS earlier on this wonderful blog of ours? If you need a behind-the-scenes look at RSS, Tiffani’s put all the good stuff together in one place. Read on, weedhopper…     Abstract  The following is a short definition essay of the term “syndication.”  It is written for the benefit of the non-technically gifted content managers out there, though the author included highly technical passages for lack of a better explanation.  The definition essay is separated into the following divisions: ·	Introduction to Syndication  ·	What is Syndication?  ·	How Does Syndication Work?  ·	Why is Syndication so Important?  ·	How Does Syndication Relate to Content Management?    Introduction to Syndication    Understanding syndication is easier if you first understand its origin.  Syndication began as a practice among news reporting agencies and comics artists.  Their columns and comics were syndicated, or licensed and distributed widely to other newspapers for publication (“Syndication”).  This process was practiced for many years and is still widely practiced.  However, due to the evolution in computer technology, the term “syndication” now has dual meaning—one definition for print and one definition for the web.  Henceforth, this short definition will refer only to the web definition of “syndication.”    What is Syndication? “Syndication is a process” (“What is RSS”).  It makes “a section of a website available for other sites to use” (“web syndication”).  Syndication “is a way to keep updated in real-time of changes to your favorite websites” (“Syndication is”).  The process closely resembles the syndication practiced by news agencies, but becomes more complex upon deeper investigation.     Defined more comprehensively, syndication “refers to making feeds available from a site so other people can display an updating list of content from it (“web syndication”).  It “is the process of using RSS/Atom for automated updates, another way of getting the information you want” (“What is RSS”).  RSS and Atom are examples of “feeds,” or “wrapper[s] for pieces of regularly and sequentially-updated content, be they news articles, weblog posts, a series of photographs, and more” (“What is RSS”).  These feeds contain the content for the webpages they are linked to, and are continuously updated.  A result of syndication is a webpage that has news stories.  The stories are automatically updated through the feeds programmed into the page.      How Does Syndication Work?    There are two parts to understanding syndication: knowing the process and knowing the formats.    Syndication Process  Simeon Simeonov, lead web architect at Allaire Corporation, states, “Syndication covers the process of aggregating and reselling content, data, and services.”  He further expounds on the complexity of syndication, saying:   . . . XSLT, XSL, and other transformation engines are employed to convert a system working within a narrow set of specifications to an open information clearinghouse that can interoperate with any content and data format. Affiliate management services provide a framework for exposing syndication to users of an application in a controlled, secure, and business-focused manner. This includes affiliate registration, setting up affiliate profiles, designating access permissions, syndication negotiation, and activity reporting. All these services are fully automated and remotable.    Syndication Formats  There are multiple formats of syndication, including ESF, RSS, and Atom.  Currently, RSS (or “Really Simple Syndication”) is the most widely used of the formats and is XML based (Liorean).     XML syndication is similar to the process described by Simeonov, however, the description below includes the definition and an example of XML syndication:     XML Syndication is a form of electronic broad-based publishing—meaning “distributed to many people.” Publications released in one of the many XML Syndication formats are called “feeds.” Visitors to web sites offering feeds can subscribe to the feeds using an application called a Desktop Reader.  The Desktop Reader application periodically checks information in the feeds it subscribes to, looking for new information. When new information is found, the Desktop Reader gets the user’s attention, alerting that new information is available. This behavior is similar to that of an e-mail program, such as Microsoft Outlook. The way XML Syndication functions is completely different from e-mail, but it serves a similar purpose of allowing publishers to distribute the content to a massive audience. However, since feed subscription is controlled by the audience and not the publisher, XML Syndication is incapable of delivering SPAM. If a user receives unwanted information from a feed, he or she can unsubscribe from it without any interference or further “harassment” from the publisher.  Because of this significant difference from e-mail, XML Syndication is quickly becoming the new standard for broad-based electronic publishing. Many of the Desktop Readers available to users are powerful and free to download. (“What is XML”). This explanation illustrates the importance of syndication in just one way.  But syndication has other justifications.    Why is Syndication so Important?   Syndication is a huge time saver to many organizations, giving them “the ability to deliver accurate, constantly changing content in real-time [which] helps them reach new markets and build brand awareness in their established markets. Syndication also lets organizations build stronger, more meaningful extraprise relationships, fueling improved satisfaction and loyalty of customers and partners” (Eliason).    In addition, syndication plays an important part in society, as it perpetuates the distribution of up-to-date information, informing readers of cutting-edge world developments.  But syndication is also useful to content managers.    How Does Syndication Relate to Content Management?   On first glance, you might not identify syndication as a tool of content management.  However, one writer expounded on this relationship, clearly demonstrating syndication’s importance to the people in the world of content management.  Though the following is written in relation to XML syndication, the principle applies to all syndication formats: As the publisher, XML Syndication can help you to reach a significantly wider audience and reduce overhead associated with previous distribution models. This fosters a new and much more enriching environment for organizations already distributing e-mail newsletters and updates.  E-mail requires the exchange of personally identifiable information: the user’s e-mail address. Because of SPAM, users are now reluctant to release their e-mail addresses to anyone they do not know, or will provide your company with a false or unchecked e-mail address. XML Syndication requires no such transfer of personally identifiable information.  Further, e-mail requires that you maintain a list of e-mail addresses representing your distribution list. In addition, the recommended best practice of the e-mail distribution model is to provide users with easily accessible functions to add or remove themselves from your distribution lists. With XML Syndication, publishers are no longer burdened with maintaining any such list.  Even further, e-mail requires that you conduct a transaction with one or many SMTP servers to transmit your content to users. Afterwards, the SMTP server must then transmit the message to each individual user, which is time-consuming with large lists. Services are available to perform this function for e-mail publishers, but these services are a repeating cost. XML Syndication completely alleviates the encumbrance of individualized transmission.(“What is XML”)   Hopefully you have gained a more extensive knowledge of what syndication is, how it works, and ultimately, how it can contribute to the preservation of customer service relations and the personalization of customer documents.

39X1EJI,male,40,"CHECK OUT/CHECK IN     No, this does not refer to your state of mind between the time your physics professor begins and ends the lecture.  This extended definition of check out/check in explains this practice of version control in the document production process and the various manners of implementation.    Most version control processes, whether sophisticated or manual, involve some sort of check out, check in arrangement. Some processes require manual intervention from a “librarian” of some sort; some processes are entirely automated.   It is probably best to make it clear (when applied to documentation projects) that check out, check in is a part of version control, which is a part of content management, which is a part of publishing. It’s a process within a process, which means that there are many factors that might change the intricacies of the process, and trying to define the process for every one of those factors is impossible. The definitions described here are my best at a high level interpretation of what check out, check in is and how it relates to version control, content management, and publishing.   Documentation teams use check out, check in in several ways. Most of the time, a check out, check in process is necessary when developing documentation (any sort of information product, including books, guides, online help systems, websites, web pages, etc.) in a collaborative environment. That is, individuals on a team working together on the same files or pages.    The following check out, check in approaches may be used this sort of team environment:   •	 You can’t have it until I’m finished  This sort of system allows only one person to have a particular file at any given time, preventing team members from overwriting each other's changes. When someone needs to work in a file, they check it out (this may be a manual or automated process), and while they have it no one else can access it.   •	 I have it right now and you better leave it alone  This approach does not prevent someone from opening a file that is checked out. They may receive a warning before doing so, but some automated check out, check in systems (like the one within the Dreamweaver software) allow others to override the warning and open a file anyway.  One can clearly see the innate problems within this process. The Macromedia website addresses potential problems by stating “To maximize the effectiveness of the Check In/Check Out feature, the collaborative team members must use it properly.” I’d say. A process like this one requires strict adherence to previously set standards and guidelines, otherwise the version control system it is a part of will completely fail.    •	 Let’s share and compare   Some automated check out, check in processes allow two or more people to check out the same file. When the writers check the file back in, the system compares the file, calculates the differences from the last version and applies them. If there is a conflict, it stops the writers from checking files back in, and forces them to manually reconcile the differences. I guess this system would work okay if the two writers were working in different sections of the document, but I can see where it could become a nightmare.   •	 It’s mine and I’ll check it in whenever I want  This approach deploys only half of the check out, check in process. Some teams divide files between team members, who in effect “own” their individual set of files. Each writer is responsible for his or her own working directory, so two team members working on the same file is never a problem. At designated intervals, the writers then submit their files in to an official directory, build machine - or some such location, where the “official” files live. This of course can pose its own set of problems, previously discussed in the “You’re your own Grandpa” discussion in my Version Control submission for Content Management Concepts I.   Almost every version control software supplier out will say something like “Check In/Check Out procedures are not by themselves a content management system.” (Clavister AB.)  Version control, too, means much more than simply making sure files don’t get overwritten as a result of more than one person working in a particular file. But having good check out, check in procedures is one part of an overall content management system that need not cost thousands of dollars to implement. All it takes is a well-defined process and the team’s strict adherence to that process.    References     ----. 2004. “Check In/Check Out: managing a Web site in a team environment”. Macromedia.

Take a American football and add a twist of Aussie rules, throw in liberal amounts of lethal explosives, a healthy dose of heavy metal music, scantily clothed women, and lots of alcohol and you have . . . okay, so that’s the WWF.  XSL has something to do with websites.        Definition provided by Shannon Brown.   What is it?   Extensible Stylesheet Language, or XSL, is a special kind of Extensible Markup Language, or XML. As its name suggests, XSL was drafted initially to give developers specific language tools to augment XML functionality. Neil Bradley, in The XSL Companion, gives the following concise history of XSL to the year 2000:  “[XSL] is a family of standards developed by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium). These standards emerged out of a proposal for a stylesheet language, submitted in 1997, which was to be called 'XSL' (eXtensible Stylesheet Language). However, during its gestation, this proposal was eventually pulled apart into three separate standards. The first of these, XPath, defines a mechanism for locating information in XML documents, and it has many other uses beyond its role in formatting documents. The second, XSLT, provides a means for transforming XML documents into other data formats, including (but not limited to) formatting languages. Finally, the term ' XSL ' is now properly used only to name a proposed standard for embedding formatting information in documents using XML elements.” (Bradley 2000, iii)  In other words, almost at its inception XSL split into three standards, each with different purposes: Xpath, XSLT, and a third standard that Bradley sees as the proper heir to the larger name “XSL.” Nonetheless, W3C, the body responsible for overseeing the development of XSL, still treats the XSL family as a single entity in its official definition, with three distinct parts:  “XSL is a family of recommendations for defining XML document transformation and presentation. It consists of three parts:  XSL Transformations (XSLT), a language for transforming XML, the XML Path Language (XPath), an expression language used by XSLT to access or refer to parts of an XML document. (XPath is also used by the XML Linking specification), [and] XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO) an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics.”(World Wide Web Consortium 2004, w3.org)  Pairing off the terms from Bradley’s discussion of XSL to the terms in the W3C definition, we’re left to conclude that the third standard Bradley mentions simply as “XSL” is actually “XSL Formatting Objects.” We should note that there is actually some ambiguity to current usage of the term ‘XSL’—some authors use it strictly to refer only to the entire family, while others appear to use it interchangably with XSL-FO. Nonetheless, given the differences between the three parts of the XSL family, we should take care to keep them straight. So, how do these different parts of XSL work with XML?   Transformation and Presentation   The W3C definition’s reference to “transformation and presentation” reveals key characteristics of two of the sub-lanaguages in XSL. Elliotte Rusty Harold describes the transformative power of XSL in The XML Bible:  “The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) includes both a transformation language and a formatting language . . . The transformation language provides elements that define rules for how one XML document is transformed into another XML document. The transformed XML document may use the markup and DTD [document-type definition] of the original document, or it may use a completely different set of elements. In particular, it may use the elements defined by the second part of XSL, the formatting objects.”(Harold 2001, 481)  Hence, in addition to specifying the formatting of the resulting XML content, XSL can also provide a map for turning one XML document into a second, different XML document. XSLT is the language for performing this kind of change. But why would anyone want to do this?  XSLT: An example  Miloslav Nic gives several applications in his XSLT tutorial, available online at zvon.org, which I used as the basis for the attached examples.   What’s left in XSL?   G. Ken Holman, in the article What is XLST? he wrote for xml.com, describes the difference between XLST and the rest of XSL:  “[There are] two distinct styling steps: transforming the instance of the XML vocabulary into a new instance according to a vocabulary of rendering semantics; and formatting the instance of the rendering vocabulary in the user agent . . . In order to meet these two distinct processes in a detached (yet related) fashion, the W3C Working Group responsible for the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) split the original drafts of their work into two separate Recommendations: one for transforming information and the other for rendering information.” (Holman 2000, xml.com)  We’ve already discussed the confusion in some of the literature over the entire XSL family and its constituent parts, especially XSL Formatting Objects. Given this confusion, we should try to decipher Holman’s reference to “XSL” as one of the three parts named in the W3C definition, most likely XSL-FO. In The XML Bible (again), Harold describes XSL-FO as sharing some transformative characteristics with CSS. XSL-FO, however, is much more powerful and dynamic.  “While CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is primarily intended for use on the Web, XSL-FO is designed for broader use. You should, for instance, be able to write an XSL style sheet that uses formatting objects to lay out an entire printed book. A different style sheet should be able to transform the same XML document into a Web site.” (Harold 2001, 571)  XSL-FO, then, is portable to many different formats, which makes it ideal for content managers working in many different media. Of course, this flexibility means that XSL-FO must use its own language for attribute and element commands. Miroslav Nic offers a searchable reference of XSL-FO commands, with plenty of examples, at zvon.org.   And, finally: XPath   Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means, in XML in a Nutshell, explain XPath in terms of what it does for XSLT:  “XPath is a non-XML language for identifying particular parts of XML documents. XPath lets you write expressions that refer to the first person element in a document, the seventh child element of the third person element, the ID attribute of the first person element whose contents are the string “Fred Jones”, all xml-stylesheet processing instructions in the document’s prolog, and so forth. XPath indicates nodes by position, relative position, type, content, and several other criteria. XSLT uses XPath expressions to match and select particular elements in the input document for copying into the output document or further processing . . . String manipulation in XPath lets XSLT perform tasks such as making the title of a chapter uppercase in a headline or extracting the last two digits from a year.” (Harold and Means 2002, 154)  So, XPath is the tool used by XSLT for finding and deploying parts of one XML document in another XML document. We saw it at work in the XSLT example without pointing it out—XPath is the standard from the XSL family responsible for pulling the “title” and “author” elements from the XML source.

39X1EJI,male,40,"VERSIONING   Okay, isn’t there a grammar rule about not turning nouns into verbs?  This word is clearly out of line, and I am shocked to see it in a technical writing list of terms!  Out of protest I will not provide an intro to this term and, instead, insist that it be struck from the tomes of technical communication forever and anon, amen.   Definition provided by Tim Carter.   What is Versioning?  Versioning, or version control applies to a content management system or strategy. I have found that it is identified in two distinct working environments: technical writing and software development. It is a system or strategy that tracks the revisions made to a document or software code in an environment with multiple writers or programmers. The system keeps control of the document or program so that no two people are working on the same version at the same time, and it can track when documents were “checked out” and when they were “checked in” (source control). In this way, control is maintained, the original documentation is never lost, never incorrectly duplicated, or unnecessary changes made to a down-level document.    How Can I Use It?  As defined by Anne Rockley’s Managing Enterprise Content, versioning says that each time content is saved, a new version will be created. In the sample unified content life cycles (pg 149), there would be two levels of versioning: draft version and full version. Content would remain in draft version until approved, then it would be fully versioned. Through version control, authors would be able to view previous versions of the content or revert to an earlier version if necessary. Authors and reviewers can see the complete detailed history for each item. The history will indicate who made the change, when the change was made, and the reason for the change. Similarities exist between programmer and writer versioning in that both groups need to maintain control over their documentation to eliminate or reduce lost time and money on extensive projects.    Where Are All These Versions Stored?  According to David Thomas and Andrew Hunt in their book, Pragmatic Version Control at http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/vc/whatis.pdf, all versions of documentation in most version control systems are stored in a repository. The repository is a central place that holds the master copy of all versions of your project’s files. Some systems use a database, some use regular files and still others use a combination of the two. In any case, the repository is the pivotal component in the versioning strategy.   This repository doesn’t simply store the current copy of each of your files, it stores every version of every file that has ever been checked in. If you check out a file, edit it and check it back in, the repository will hold both the original version and the version that contains your changes. Then the versions will be assigned a numbering system. For example, the first version of a file is assigned the revision number 1.1. If a changed version is checked in, that change is given number 1.2. The next changes gets 1.3 and so on.    More Contrasts and Similarities  The TechEncyclopedia at www.techweb.com/encyclopedia narrowly defines versioning (or version control this way: The management of source code, documents, graphics and related files in a large software project. Version-control software provides a database that is used to keep track of the revisions made to a program by all the programmers and developers involved in it. This narrow definition, applied to XML language, is echoed in the Versioning SML Vocabularies by David Orchard at http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/03/versioning.html. Orchard describes versioning as, “adding, deleting, or changing parts of the language.”  Another similar versioning concept comes from John Gruber in his article, “BBEdit Version Control” at http://www.macworld.com/2003/09/secrets/bbeditversioncontrol. With the CVS (Concurrent Versions System) software, writers (or programmers) can record all changes to a document and you can quickly step back to an earlier version – even if you’ve changed and saved the file many times … a personal time machine. The CVS is useful for managing any type of document. In fact, a Web site is a perfect example of the sort of multifile project that can benefit from versioning. The difference with this concept is that you can make a mistake, then easily track down and reverse the mistake using an earlier version.  Finally, the application FrameMaker provides another concept for versioning in which two distinct versions of text for two separate products. As you will see, this definition is in stark contrast to earlier definitions. Instead of one product and multiple versions, here we have two products with simultaneously different versions. In “Designing Print Documentation” by David A. McMurrey, Thomas A. Moore and Pam Renwick at http://www.io.com/~tcm/etwr2372/planners/frame/frame556/frame_variables_ver556.html#versioncontrol they say versioning is the ability to make one set of files support two more versions. Their version control “enables you to keep everything in one set of files and hide or show a particular version. This is useful if you must maintain documentation for two versions of the same product. This versioning is available only through FrameMaker and its native documentation."
39X1EJI,male,40,"A tech writer friend told me how proud his 93-year old grandma (“Grammy Bertha”) was when she found out that he had become an architect. He couldn’t bring himself to tell her that he wasn’t the kind of architect she had in mind. Probably just as well. She would not have understood that while a traditional architect designs and directs the construction of buildings, an information architect is designs the organization of a website's structure and content, the labeling and categorizing of information and the design of navigation and search systems. It’s a whole new world, Bertha.      Although the term information architecture has become a commonly used term in the world of web design, its origin stems back to the 1970’s. Long before the internet was a household mainstay, Richard Saul Wurman, a trained architect who later became a skilled graphic designer coined the term information architecture. Wurman recognized the similarities between designing a building and the problems of organizing and clearly presenting information. Just as an information organizer or information architect evaluates and arranges information, when designing a building, an architect analyzes the building’s use and designs the flow and layout so that it best meets user needs.   Since Wurman’s conception of the term information architecture, many variations have evolved stemming from a need to organize an ever increasing influx of information presented by the Internet and other communication platforms. The variations fall within three basic categories: the actual structure, the physical act of creating the structure and the community that promotes the structure and practices the act of creating it.  The following definition expressed by Asilomar Institute for Information Architecture (AIfIA) further defines these categories: “1. The structural design of shared information environments. 2. The art and science of organizing and labeling web site, intranets, online communities and software to support usability and findability. 3. An emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and information architecture to the digital landscape.”(AIfIA)  The Actual Structure  Information architecture is often used to describe the structure or the blue print behind the information. This can best be described by an example taken from Shel Kimen’s definition of information architecture, “In a library, for example, information architecture is a combination of the catalog system and the physical design of the building that holds the books. On the Web, information architecture is a combination of organizing a site’s content into categories and creating an interface to support those categories.” (Kimen)  The Physical Act of Creating the Structure              The occupation of web designer has become more prevalent, and the term information architecture has been adopted to describe what web designers do.  Because of this, “the physical act of creating a structure” definition of information architecture has grown to be the most common use of the term. The act of creating dynamic web sites that guide people through information is the foundation, as both of the definitions below illustrate. Mattie Langenburg refers to information architecture as, “taking content and creating a structure to present that content to an audience.” (Cohen)  Additionally, WebWord says, “Information architecture involves the design of organization and navigation systems to help people find and manage information more successfully.” (Rhodes)   The Community that Promotes the Structure and Practices the Act of Creating it  Information architecture also refers to the community that is affected, works within and works for the information environment. This community evolves as the value of structure gains visibility with key business members. The global information community serves as a communication link for the information architect to the rest of the business. This global community connects the architect to tools, development opportunities and research while advocating the information architecture basis. Because this definition of community is evolving, few concrete definitions exist. However, considering there are entire organizations and web sites devoted to the advancement of information architecture as a community, it warrants discussion as a definition of information architecture.  Although information architecture carries multiple definitions, the term itself is becoming more common as web sites become more complex and the need for specialized knowledge increases. Information architecture can refer to the actual structure of the information on a web page, while also referring to the roles of the architect in creating the structure and the community that supports it.

39X1EJI,male,40,"I’ve lost a lot of arguments when challenged with the “It’s just semantics” line. But what is semantics supposed to mean? Oh, now I get it – semantics is meaning!! For us CMS groupies, semantics really means that when we name a unit of content within our model, we give it a name that has meaning, This makes it easy for authors to identify exactly what content they should include. One of our teammates, Steven C, has done the digging on semantics…   “Semantic Information” is not a techno-ubiquitous term. Searches for “semantics” and “semantic information” on three tech sites (techdictionary.com, Cnet.com, and techtutorials.com) all generated zero responses. So, I turned to several print publications for clear definitions.    “Semantic” refers to “meaning.” Likewise, in technological jargon, “semantic information” or “semantics” always relates somehow to the meaning of a word, phrase, symbol, or instruction. I am in no way a technophile, but there seem to me to be at least three uses of the term. The first use has to do with programming instruction; the second relates to search engine methodology; the third reflects the way in which we’ll use the term in this course – semantics refers to the strategy used in naming content units in a unified content strategy.    First, let’s see a basic definition and how the term applies to programming instructions. The 1996 Dictionary of Computing generically defines semantics as “that part of the definition of a language concerned with specifying the meaning or effect of a text that is constructed according to the syntax rules of the language.” The 1996 Random House Personal Computer Dictionary takes the definition a bit further, injecting the element of programming instruction: “In linguistics, [semantics is] the study of meanings. In computer science, the term is frequently used to differentiate the meaning of an instruction from its format. The format, which covers the spelling of language components and the rules controlling how components are combined, is called the language’s syntax.”    The connection of semantics to programming instructions/language bridged into the 21st century (although this use may be archaic in 2004). The 2000 Encyclopedia of Computer Science uses several pages explaining the detailed instructional codes it refers to as “Programming Language Semantics.” This is, to me, an incomprehensible algebraic-looking code of Greek letters, subscripts, and arrows, all apparently designed to tell the computer what to do when it encounters various words and/or phrases. The 2001 Dictionary of Computer Science, Engineering, and Technology continues the line of thought, defining semantics as “the meaning of a string or sequence of toke symbols in some language, as opposed to syntax which describes how symbols may be combined independent of their meaning. The semantics of a programming language are a transformation from programs to answers.”   Let’s turn to the use of semantics in search engine methodology. Azeem Azhar, a U.K. writer, analyst and consultant on technology and society, published an enlightening article (4/25/03) discussing a Google acquisition. Forgive the lengthy quote, but Azhar explains well the importance of word meaning (semantics) in search methodology:        Google has purchased privately-held information retrieval company, Applied Semantics, a firm dotcom-formerly known as Oingo. It is a big deal because it brings together two competing schools, of which more below.    Information retrieval is the core of all search businesses. It is about creating software that solves a hard question: getting computers to understand human language with all its vagaries. These vagaries include: ·                    polysemy (words with multiple meanings like DRIVE or SET) ·        synonymy (different words with similar meanings like AIRPLANE and AIRCRAFT) ·        multi-word expressions which need to be treated as such (BILL CLINTON) ·                    errors, typos and poor grammar  For example, a key word search engine would find it hard to distinguish between A RED FISH and A FISH IN THE RED SEA   Broadly speaking there have been two major schools of thought. The first is one I call the statistical school and the second is the semantic. The statistical school held that context could be determined by look at statistical patterns within documents and across documents in a collection. Essentially, they use a variety of techniques to recognise word co-occurrence. So when words like DRIVE, CAR and HIGHWAY are used together frequently, we can make assumptions about the context of those words.   The other approach is the semantic approach. Here knowledge engineers build up a complex network of relationships, an ontology, that relates words together. So a CAR is defined as a type of VEHICLE and identical to the word AUTOMOBILE. A search on the word CAR will also turn up documents with the word AUTOMOBILE in it, even if they don’t mention it. Such semantic networks require a good deal of work and a lot of maintenance to keep them up to date.   So why is this relevant to Google and Applied Semantics? Well Google comes from the statistical school of information retrieval, albeit in a very light way. Currently, Google queries are not parsed very much at all. No stemming is applied, although some word proximity algorithms are used. Google does take advantage of one unique aspect of the Web: the interconnections between documents which provide a context-weighting to documents based on their link popularity. Applied Semantics will add a layer of semantic understanding that Google needs. There AdSense technology is already being used by a raft of web sites to improve targeting based on user-behaviour.    Finally, we turn to how we’ll use the term “semantic information” in designing unified content strategy. In “Managing Enterprise Content” (2003), Rockley defines semantic information as, “a component of an information model; uniquely identifies the content of that element, making it easy for authors to identify exactly what content they should include. Semantic information also enables the identification and reuse of specific content.” Used this way (and compared to other meanings), “semantic information” is actually a straightforward idea. It simply means that as we identify tags that link to content units, we don’t use generic names (e.g.  ). Instead, we use names that have meaning (e.g.  ). According to Rockley (and logically so), these semantic tags are of great benefit to authors engaged in opportunistic reuse of content units. Rockley differentiates semantic tags from metadata; we’ll explore that in Chapter 12.    In summary, “semantic information” always refers to a word, phrase, symbol, or instruction that is recognized for its meaning, not its form. In the realm of a unified content strategy, “semantic information” means that we tag content units with meaningful names.     Sources: Dictionary of Computing (4th Ed.).

39X1EJI,male,40,"ASSET RESPOSITORY    What is an asset repository?  You mean you don’t know?  Well, here’s the beef.  An asset repository is similar to a bank depository—it stores valuables, although in the case of asset repository, it stores valuable information.  These repositories are high class, elaborate, and require the same thing that banks do—lots and lots of money.  Read more about asset repositories in the following extended definition.     “An asset is only an asset when you can find it,  or you know that you have it in the first place”   Teri Ross, Techexchange.com    An asset repository is rather a combination two elements: digital asset management and asset repository.  Whereas the digital asset management (DAM) is a tool to organize digital media assets for storage and retrieval, an asset repository is where and how the data is stored, typically on “a high-end UNIX server, [with] large online storage space and high-speed networks” (Ross).  The DAM application organizes and retrieves the digital media and the asset repository stores it.    Digital Asset Management   Digital Asset Management (DAM) is a means to keep, find and secure files of text, images or sound.  DAM also tracks ownership and rights of the content and implements task management.  Well organized and accessible content results in the ability to quickly find images and data, which systemizes workflow, saving time and money (Brown).   In the computer world . . . there are systems that will pick up after us and remember where we put things. These systems will retrieve items, let us pass them around, and then clean the place up when we're through. I refer, of course, to the software and hardware systems that are called, variously, digital media management, media asset management or digital asset management (DAM) (Smith).  Digital asset management is the software and hardware needed for content management.  The location in which content is stored is the asset repository.   Asset (or Content) Repository  Actual “asset repositories” are generally found in large, high-end asset management systems ($100,000 and up).  Asset repositories are a “secure collection of the source files themselves”.  The image at the webpage below shows the asset repository as a sort of holding tank for content.   urlLink http://www.assetnow.com/index.cfm/4,437,html   A large asset repository performs like a database.  It contains: security, replication, backup safeguards, disaster recovery, referential integrity, centralized data management and a hierarchical storage structure. “Such a system lends itself to workflows that require access security, including management of rights or permissions and access for suppliers or customers. These systems require a high-performance server, a fast network and significant online storage capacity” (Brown).  Asset repositories are sophisticated and expensive systems that contain the actual content within a secure database.  This usually means higher performance software like , “high-end UNIX servers, formidable online storage, and very high-speed networks”.  This allows for “security levels, replication, referential integrity, and centralized data management. Also included is the comfort of full hierarchical storage management and disaster recovery” (Ross).     Solutions based on the asset repository model are ideal when systematizing studios with industrial workflow, managing rights and permissions (such as the intellectual property of either your company or a third party), and structuring global access by employees, contractors, suppliers, partners, and customers (Smith).   Media Catalog vs. Asset Repository  Instead of an asset repository, smaller companies often use media catalogs “that store proxies alone, indexed to the source files"" (Brown).  Media catalogs have proxies (like thumbnails) which are stored in a database indexed by keywords.  The actual source files are under the control of the operating system and are not touched.  Media catalogs are low cost, easy to install and administer and have “scalability across multiple divisions of an enterprise” (Ross).  Media catalogs don’t manage the actual content, so anyone with system access to view, change, move or delete content elements (Ross).     Media Catalog  Entry level solution Desktop or within a workgroup Organizes small collections of images, graphics and text Provides multiple access Cost – under $50,000   Asset Repository  Mid-range solution Client/server technology Wide area networks Manages all assets used in a production job (layouts, images, fonts) Files stored on server, access via DAM system only Check-in/check-out to control versions Stores assets with links for simple retrieval Cost – under $100,00   Upper-End Solutions 3-tier client/server architecture Designed to “drive enterprise on the Internet” Cost – over $100,00 (Smith)"
39X1EJI,male,40,"VERSION CONTROL   Not be confused with “revisionist history,” a popular and ubiquitous form of propaganda used to shape public and political opinion.  Version control is used to drive consistency in the development and revision of texts.    Definition provided by Kathylynn St. Pierre   Dysfunctional Families and Version Control  Kathylynn St. Pierre English 6430 – Summer 2004   Oh many, many years ago When I was twenty-three I was married to a widow Who was pretty as can be This widow had a grown-up daughter Who had hair of red My father fell in love with her And soon the two were wed   This made my dad my son-in-law And changed my very life For my daughter was my mother ‘Cause she was my father’s wife To complicate the matter Though it really brought me joy I soon became the father Of a bouncing baby boy   This little baby then became A brother-In-law to Dad And so became my uncle Though it made me very sad For if he was my uncle Then that also made him brother Of the widow’s grown up daughter Who of course Is my step-mother   My father’s wife then had a son Who kept him on the run And he became my grandchild For he was my daughter’s son. My wife is now my mother’s mother And it makes me blue Because although she is my wife She’s my grandmother too.   Now if my wife is my grandmother, Then I’m her grandchild And every time I think of it It nearly drives me wild For now I have become The strangest case you ever saw As husband of my grandma I am my own Granpa.   From “I’m My Own Grandpa” by Dwight Latham and Moe Jaffe     The term “version control” applies to everything from sophisticated technology-driven systems that manage changes in data files (source code for software programs, CAD files, etc.) to the simplest form of file management: the ability to check differences from a previous version, and to provide a layer of assurance that one person’s work isn’t overwritten by someone else’s.    Some sophisticated engineering systems have file management/control and version control systems built in, others require that separate tools be used. But according to Paul D. Sherriff of Klarity.com,  “software change management is not just for development, or QA or the operations and release group. Good documentation and change process must be designed to support the whole organization; it must help everyone to better understand their products and their jobs”.   That makes perfect sense. Everyone needs to pay attention to version control issues, and clearly version control doesn’t just apply to one department, group or industry.  The Pragmatic Programmer website says “Tools to automate change management and control (SCM tools) can only work when implemented together with corporate standards and a well-defined process.” While I’m not sure that the standards are necessary (or realistic) at the corporate level, it is clear that a process must be clearly defined and integrated with every aspect of the documentation process - from file management to quality requirements to approaches to working with outsourced content.    The definitions here apply to publication and documentation departments, where version control often simply means the daily challenge of managing hundreds of files, sometimes with many writers working on them at the same time.     It is clear that there are two ways version control is applied on a daily basis: automated change control systems, and manual systems developed within documentation departments to satisfy their unique needs and circumstances.        Automated change control systems    §	Many systems, (Wiki is a popular one) use a database back-end, which records each modification in a log. Scripts within the system access the log and follow the revision history of a file.  The log is really designed for recovery from abuse or accidents that cause widespread damage to the database, and not for retrieving the individual modifications to one file inside that database. In most publication departments, Wiki-type systems are overkill for day-to-day file management.   §	Many change control systems are marketed on the “time-machine” premise - you can look at any version of any page and then follow links to check out the entire file as it was at that point in time. Engineers like this because they sometimes follow a design path so far only to find out that their design won’t work – this way they can “go back” to the point in their development before they veered off onto the “wrong” path. Some of these keep a long sequence of revisions available and include a diff feature. Engineers like to see the complete evolution of a file that lets them start alternate evolutions at any point.   §	Software Configuration Management (SCM) refers to any collection of processes and tools that are used to effectively manage the development, maintenance, and build processes of software.     §       With Concurrent Versions System (CVS), multiple writers can check out the same files and then check them back in. When working in ASCII modes, such as HTML, this works fine as it calculates the differences from the last version and applies them. Depending on your product version and platform, it figures this out quite well. But this method requires excellent communication between team members. If there is a conflict, it stops the writers from checking files back in, and forces them to manually reconcile the differences.   §	Professional Version Control Software (PVCS) – PVCS is actually a process management tool, but some technical writing projects are forced to use it because the engineering departments of the projects they document use it.     Michael Krasowski, of The Code Component Developer website says, “Without a well understood process, no tool will solve the problem.” With this in mind, it is important to mention that adapting your process to meet an automated version control system is starting the whole process backwards – you need to establish a process that works with your department’s situation, and then find a system that meets those needs.    Manual solutions that solve day to day issues     At the risk of making an unfounded generalization, I’ll admit to thinking that most publication departments find individual and creative ways of dealing with their unique version control issues.   The size of the information product, the size of the team, frequency of releases and publication dates, all play a role in how a publication department may approach version control. But it is clear that a lack of formal guidelines poses a serious problem for publication departments. Even the simplest methods for ""getting"" versus ""checking out"" documents create huge issues that most always must be addressed even before the first page is written.   But publication departments can’t rely on their chosen publishing software to take of their needs. Some publishing programs allow writers to ""get"" a copy of a file in read-only mode and then make it write-able. This overrides the security ""check out"" feature of the system that of course, proves counter-productive later and creates even more confusion.  Where I work, our documentation team was at one time very large (before company cutbacks and layoffs occurred). We write product and system documentation for a large software product, which usually involves at least two or three major releases per year.    Like the publications departments I mentioned earlier, we devised two version control systems that meet our needs.  These are probably the simplest forms of version control and involve processes similar to what I believe other publication departments like ours probably use to meet their needs.   The first process we use involves two major activities: Checking Out and Checking In.   Check Out and Check In  A copy of all files is put on a local shared server, drive, or machine (what The Pragmatic Programmers call a “repository”) and to work on files, writers must check them out (manually, through a documentation “librarian”, through a manual registry that the writer must fill out each time, or by the writer taking the file out and then “locking” it so that only the writer that checked out the file can check it back in).    This process requires strict adherence to the process itself, but at the same time protects the team from itself - it alerts the rest of the team when someone is working on that file. The last saved version overwrites the previous version, so these alerts are absolutely necessary.     You’re your own Grandpa    On some releases, all files are divided and we’re each responsible for specific files that we “own”. Only the writer assigned to a certain file works on that file. We each keep our own copies and deliver them to a special delivery directory when it is time to do documentation build (usually once a week). Then, the build directory becomes our official directory and we are each responsible for our own version control activities. The only time this becomes tricky is when we are working on two or three releases at the same time. In this case, we have to keep three different copies of the same file and make changes that may apply to one release but not another. When we practice this method, Brian Harroff, our project manager, continuously reminds us “You’re your own Grandpa”.      So much to consider    The version control business (and it is a business in and of itself) has many facets, and I’ve explored it very broadly here and have simplified it for purposes of creating a high level definition. But the bottom line to version control, whether you are using an expensive change management system or a manual system your department has devised to meet your needs, is to remember that with a well-defined process and strict adherence to the policies defined in them, being your own Grandpa isn’t all that dysfunctional after all.

3PKULRF,male,25,"There's one thing everyone should know.  I killed a womam when I was younger and blamed it on Laura Bush.  She was nice enough to accept the blame and make up a story about self-defense, but to return the favour I had to rig the 2000 elections.  I was responsible for all those hanging chads, I ran the remote which controlled Katherin Harris, and I bribed the U.S. Supreme court with crack.  Justice Scalia sure loves the rock.  Anyway, now that I've got that off my chest, I should just point out how disgusted I am with all the blunt-smoking here at Autumn Lane.  I read in Collier's magazine that if a person smokes 3 blunts a day for a year, their lungs will have enough resin to smoke up the entire audience at a Britney Spears concert.  And it would be the best Britney Spears concert ever.  So I think it's obvious we all need to start smoking more blunts.  Britney does MANY concerts and those 12-year-old girls aren't going to have such small tolerances forever.  Who's with me?"
3PKULRF,male,25,"Well since i am the coolest kid that currently hangs out at autumnleezy and i am bored as hell right now i am going to tell yall my story.   The bars last night were off the melzabubs.  Lots of free shots at Wildflowers, that place is the shit. Thanks to Adrienne, Cooper and Maryanne for hookin it up. Also thanks to the dudes in the band who let my drunk ass sing Hotel California. (Craig knew they would) My wingman craig also had me doing silly silly things, which resulted in my getting kicked out of both Mcguinn's and Buddy Shamrocks.  Oh wait that was probably my fault. It's not easy to stand when you got the ""Doug Sway"" going on. That wall looked like the perfect place to rest. Haha. Apparently you can't be hanging on the walls at bars now a days or you get kicked out. Good thing we had enough time to get a picture with every single person at the bar hahaha. Shouts to camerawoman kimbo kickin ass and taking names.  A little scandalousness ensued but nothing a drunken birthday with good friends can't justify. (plus it was craigs fault)   Buddy shamrocks had that shit coming too because of it's stupid name.  I think i should listen to my dad and not drink hard liquor because i really cant tell you why the hell i threw that cup. Funny as hell though, i hope they don't remember me next time.  Oh and on the way home i ripped down some advertisment and then a couple of mailboxes took a beaten because, well, i do stupid things like that when im drunk. Thanks to all who bought me drinks and thanks connie for buying me dinner. Oh and thanks for the good company too, u old folks really made my 21st a great time.  Sorry for all the youngins i also hang out with that couldnt come,but your time will come and old Douglas Fresh will be there to celebrate with you.  In conclusion 1craig+1Doug+8titties=Goodtime."

3PKULRF,male,25,"I regret to inform everyone that I have been unable to post for quite some time due to a conflict I've been having with Collier's magazine.  It seemed that the owner of the magazine, John Elway (former Denver Broncos quarterback), is a frequent reader of the Autumn Leezy Blog, and he did not appreciate my slanderous comments.  I was sued for libel and instructed by the judge not to post on the blog until the case was resolved.  Well, I won the case but I'm sorry to say that the legal battle caused the company to go bankrupt, and Collier's magazine is no more.  The company's stock went from the most expensive on the market to completely worthless in a matter of minutes.  John Elway is now penniless and hopelessly in debt.  Nobody has seen him for days, and it is believed he is now living as a hermit somewhere in the rocky mountains.  So it's official.  After the longest running publication in magazine history, from its first issue in August 19, 3214 B.C. to June 14, 2004, Collier's magazine is no longer in print.  Hence, it shall not be mentioned again.  According to Collier's magazine, 97.3% of American are VERY happy to hear this.  2.6% said, ""Long live Saddam"" and .1% said, ""A woman should not tell a man what to do."""

U5YQQW4,male,13,"Today, our parents made us go to Des Moines to look at appliances for the new house. It was sooooooo boring. I really don't like going to buy appliances and things for the new house when I've already made it clear to my parents that I'm not interested and I don't mind how the house turns out as long as it's done soon. I just stayed in the car and watched Red vs Blue most of the time on my laptop until the battery ran out. Then, I finally went inside and looked at the appliances and stuff. After 5 minutes, I just went to the home theater section and watched T.V. Finally, we left. On the way out, I was amazed to see that there was a car dealership that was selling Porsches. I was like ""Whoa....Porsches in Iowa?"" Afterwards, we went to the Montage. It was pretty good. They have really good appetizers and dessert. That's basically the end of my boring day."
U5YQQW4,male,13,"^Doesn't that sound like the name of a science video you would watch in school? I think all that Bill Nye we had to watch in school got into my head. Anyways, today was an okay day. I watched Red vs Blue a lot today. I finally finished watching the second season. I can't wait for the third season to start. I'm thinking of buying the DVD of the first and/or second season. I'm not sure. The weather was really wierd today. First, it was pretty good weather up until 5:00. Then, at like 5:30, the sky got almost pitch black and it started pouring. I wasn't expecting it because I didn't watch the weather for this week. So it's been pouring since then and there was a Severe Thunderstorm Watch and all that stuff so I figured that this font color would fit the weather. Hopefully the weather will clear up by tomorrow morning. I hate waking up to rain. By the way, here are some changes I made to the blog: 1. I put a button at the top of the page so you can turn the clock cursor off because I know some people probably get annoyed by it. 2. I put this swirly thing in the taskbar and window title. I might have said this before. 3. I'm thinking of changing the music. If you have any suggestions, post it as a comment. Also, I made a post earlier with some question thingy for readers to fill out so if you want to you can fill that out and put it as a comment. That's basically it for today."

They have this new ride (a toilet bowl) from last year where you go around this bowl like thingy and when you get to the bottom, you go down this chute thingy into water. It's hard to explain. It's funner than it sounds though. There were a lot of other cool rides, too. I'll post a picture of the map of the park with all the ride names later. There was some pretty good food there, too.They had Dippin' Dots there and I haven't had it forever. They are like a ton of small balls of ice cream in a cup. It is really good. After we ate, Dev and I had this crazy idea that if we took out more air from our tubes, we would go faster. I think the chlorene was getting to our heads. Obviously, we were wrong so we went back to keeping the air in the tubes. Then, we went go-karting for a little bit. It was my first time. I've never been go-karing before. After Lost Island, Jasmine and Nina went to a movie but I couldn't go because I have Karate at 8:00 so Dev didn't go either. That's pretty much it for today."

Then, we put some flour on it and put some Axe deoderant and aerosol and stuff. It took us like 1/2 hour to get the thing to light.

4AN3082,male,37,"A Wilful Blindness         Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination.        By George Monbiot. Published in the Guardian 11th March 2003        The war in Afghanistan has plainly brought certain benefits to that country: thousands of girls have gone to school for the first time, for example, and in some parts of the country women have been able to go back to work. While over 3000 civilians were killed by the bombing; while much of the country is still controlled by predatory warlords; while most of the promised assistance has not materialised; while torture is widespread and women are still beaten in the streets, it would be wrong to minimise the gains that have flowed from the defeat of the Taliban. But, and I realise that it might sound callous to say it, this does not mean that the Afghan war was a good thing.        What almost all those who supported that war and are now calling for a new one have forgotten is that there are two sides to every conflict, and therefore two sets of outcomes to every victory. The Afghan regime changed, but so, in subtler ways, did the government of the United States. It was empowered not only by its demonstration of military superiority but also by the widespread support it enjoyed. It has used the licence it was granted in Afghanistan as a licence to take its war wherever it wants.        Those of us who oppose the impending conquest of Iraq must recognise that there's a possibility that, if it goes according to plan, it could improve the lives of many Iraqi people. But to pretend that this battle begins and ends in Iraq requires a wilful denial of the context in which it occurs. That context is a blunt attempt by the superpower to reshape the world to suit itself.        In this week's Observer, David Aaronovitch suggested that, before September 11, the Bush administration was ""relatively indifferent to the nature of the regimes in the Middle East""1. Only after America was attacked was it forced to start taking an interest in the rest of the world.        If Aaronovitch believes this, he would be well-advised to examine the website of the Project for the New American Century2, the pressure group established, among others, by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Elliott Abrams and Zalmay Khalilzad, all of whom (except the president's brother) are now senior officials in the US government. Its statement of principles, signed by those men on June 3 1997, asserts that the key challenge for the United States is ""to shape a new century favorable to American principles and interests""3. This requires ""a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.""4        On January 26 1998, these men wrote to President Clinton, urging him ""to enunciate a new strategy"", namely ""the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power.""5 If Clinton failed to act, ""the safety of American troops in the region, of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states, and a significant portion of the world's supply of oil will all be put at hazard."" They acknowledged that this doctrine would be opposed, but ""American policy cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council.""6        Last year, the Sunday Herald obtained a copy of a confidential report produced by the Project in September 2000, which suggested that blatting Saddam was the beginning, not the end of its strategy. ""While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.""7 The wider strategic aim, it insisted, was ""maintaining global US pre-eminence"". Another document obtained by the Herald, written by Paul Wolfowitz and Lewis Libby, called upon the United States to ""discourage advanced industrial nations from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or global role""8.        On taking power, the Bush administration was careful not to alarm its allies. The new president spoke only of the need ""to project our strength with purpose and with humility""9 and ""to find new ways to keep the peace""10. From his first week in office, however, he began to engage not so much in nation-building as in planet-building.        The ostensible purpose of Bush's missile defence programme is to shoot down incoming nuclear missiles. The real purpose is to provide a justification for the extraordinarily ambitious plans - contained in a Pentagon document entitled Vision for 2020 - to turn space into a new theatre of war, developing orbiting weapons systems which can instantly destroy any target anywhere on earth11. By creating the impression that his programme is merely defensive, Bush could justify a terrifying new means of acquiring what he calls ""full spectrum dominance"" over planetary security.        Immediately after the attack on New York, the US government began establishing ""forward bases"" in Asia. As the assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Jones noted, ""when the Afghan conflict is over we will not leave Central Asia. We have long-term plans and interests in this region""12. The US now has bases in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan and Georgia. Their presence has, in effect, destroyed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation which Russia and China had established in an attempt to develop a regional alternative to US power.        In January, the US moved into Djibouti, ostensibly to widen its war against terror, while accidentally gaining strategic control over the Bab Al Mandab - one of the world's two most important oil shipping lanes. It already controls the other one, the Strait of Hormuz. Two weeks ago, under the same pretext, it sent 3000 men to the Philippines. Last year it began negotiations to establish a military base in Sao Tom and Principe, from which it can, if it chooses, dominate West Africa's principal oilfields. By pure good fortune, the US government now exercises strategic control over almost all the world's major oil producing regions and oil transport corridors.        It has also used its national tragedy as an excuse for developing new nuclear and biological weapons13, while ripping up the global treaties designed to contain them. All this is just as the Project prescribed. Among other enlightened policies, it has called for the development of a new generation of biological agents, which will attack people with particular genetic characteristics14.        Why do the supporters of this war find it so hard to see what is happening? Why do the conservatives who go beserk when the European Union tries to change the content of our chocolate bars look the other way when the US seeks to reduce us to a vassal state? Why do the liberal interventionists who fear that Saddam Hussein might one day deploy a weapon of mass destruction refuse to see that George Bush is threatening to do just this against an ever-growing number of states? Is it because they cannot face the scale of the threat, and the scale of the resistance necessary to confront it? Is it because these brave troopers cannot look the real terror in the eye?                I have decided from now on to attach references to my articles.

On page 72 of the document Rebuilding America's Defenses (ibid)is the following sentiment: And advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool. This is merely a glimpse of the possibilities inherent in the process of transformation, not a precise prediction. Whatever the shape and direction of this revolution in military affairs, the implications for continued American military preeminence will be profound. As argued above, there are many reasons to believe that U.S. forces already possess nascent revolutionary capabilities, particularly in the realms of intelligence, command and control, and longrange precision strikes. Indeed, these capabilities are sufficient to allow the armed services to begin an interim, short- to medium-term process of transformation right away, creating new force designs and operational concepts  designs and concepts different than those contemplated by the current defense program  to maximize the capabilities that already exist.   http://www.monbiot.com/dsp_article.cfm?article_id=566"
4AN3082,male,37,"Found this interesting article at the Guardian:   urlLink http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1022663,00.html    Brutal reality hits home      Since Vietnam, the public has only seen a sanitised version of war. But the internet, with its unfettered access, has changed all that. Sean Dodson reports      Sean Dodson      Thursday August 21, 2003      The Guardian     The warning comes before the image. A two-paragraph disclaimer justifying some of the most gruesome images of war you are likely to see. The first image is of a boy with his legs blown off. Then there is another child - face in close-up - with streams of blood pouring down his young face. The next is the head of a horribly burned man swathed in white bandages. It is followed by the swollen neck of a peace protester, the victim of wood pellets fired from a gun in Oakland. The website adds that the suspects are policemen.  These images - and some far, far worse - come courtesy of a New Zealand website that describes itself as a ""fiercely independent internet news agency"". For several months, Scoop Media has been publishing the kind of graphic images you rarely see in mass circulation newspapers or on western television. And, until now, rarely on the internet.   Ever since Roger Fenton, a founder of the Royal Photographic Society, covered the Crimean war armed with a box camera and a letter of introduction from Prince Albert, photojournalism has been an essential part of war reporting. Fenton's aim, and that of   Prince Albert, was to provide a set of images that would restore public confidence in an unpopular war. The role of the war photographer was set.   But by the time of the Vietnam war, photography as a propaganda tool had backfired. Horrific images of the conflict turned the US public against the war. Since then, in each subsequent war, the public has been presented with images far less graphic. The recent war in Iraq was no different, with a straw poll by  MediaGuardian.co.uk  at the war's height indicating that few UK picture editors were willing to risk upsetting readers with pictures of fatalities, even if they were in the background. As Phillip Knightley wrote in the First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo: ""Although in most cases the camera does not lie directly, it can lie brilliantly by omission.""   ""To sanitise the reality of warfare is abhorrent,"" explains Scoop's editor, Alastair Thompson. ""To censor images of capture, of death, as a consequence of war, is wrong. If Scoop were to do so, it would be subscribing to the glitzy rah rah Hollywood-facade-style of reportage that the mainstream United States-based media has become obsessed with.""    The Qatari news network, al-Jazeera, painted no such picture during the war. And it could have provided a counterbalance for western audiences. But its English language website was inaccessible during much of the conflict. A denial of service attack on the site, allegedly the target of belligerent hackers, shut it down, preventing a western audience from seeing a far more bloody portrait of Iraq. That website is now under wraps, preparing itself for a relaunch later this year.   Even if you can't speak a word of Arabic, the internet allows you less fettered access to the realities of war. You don't even have to look hard. Simply type ""war graphic image iraq"" into Google and you can see some of   the most terrible images imaginable. Many are from IndyMedia sites, alternative news networks and Arab stations, but there are stranger bedfellows, too. Among Google's returns will be a site called Babykiller.com, built by US anti-abortionists who rage against the war by cataloguing pictures of child atrocities. The left-wing Scoop Media has some surprising company.   Viewing these sites throws up a number of moral dilemmas. Are you being voyeuristic? Are the websites perversely triumphal? Are they simply preaching to the converted, providing nothing but war pornography? What about notions of taste and decency?   ""Are taste and decency relevant standards when considering war?"" asks Thompson. ""War is horrible, it is grotesque, revolting and deeply disturbing. Why should it be any different for the public, in whose name the mayhem is being waged? This is not to say we did not have misgivings about publishing some images, we did.""   Each news organisation, be it a website, a newspaper or a television station, has debates about what images to show. The images of the bloated heads of the dead Uday and Qusay Hussein were only published in the Guardian and on its website, Guardian Unlimited, after much heated debate.   But even when television does portray war in all its graphic and uncensored detail, it holds it at arms' length. Channel 4's excellent The True Face of War was screened at 11.20pm. As one viewer wrote on the Channel 4 website: ""However distressing - and I can hardly write this through my tears - this programme should be shown at PRIME time.""   It is worth remembering, there is no prime time on the internet. There is only choice. Although military censorship and hacker attacks can disrupt it, a more graphic face of war is bleeding on to the internet and coverage of war may be never the same.

To underscore the threat, U.S. occupation chief Paul Bremer chose the day of the planned protests to predict that more such major attacks were likely ""when you have masses of Shia together."" Those who dared to show up despite the warnings glanced around nervously, while men armed with Kalashnikovs lined the streets and rooftops, looking for signs of trouble.....  ...It now looks almost certain that Iraq's first ""sovereign"" government will be created by a process even less democratic than the abandoned caucus system: The U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council will simply be expanded in size.  This body is so discredited here that it is called the ""governed council,"" but widespread objections have so far been drowned out by the nightly attacks.  Mr. Bremer has also managed to use the terrorist attacks to make sure that Iraq's next government will be able to do nothing but implement his orders. Earlier this month, his plan to push through an interim constitution seemed doomed, with several members of the Governing Council refusing to sign the contentious document. But after the devastating attacks on Shia religious sites on March 2, Iraqi leaders came under pressure to sign the document as a show of national unity and stability.  The interim constitution, signed two weeks ago, states that, ""The laws, regulations, orders, and directives issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority . . . shall remain in force."" The laws include Mr. Bremer's Order 39, which drastically changes Iraq's previous constitution to allow foreign companies to own 100 per cent of Iraqi assets (except in natural resources), and to take 100 per cent of their profits out of the country, paving the way for massive privatizations.  Defying Mr. Bremer's orders won't be an option after the ""handover."" The interim constitution clearly states that the only way these laws can be changed is by a three-fourths vote by the Iraqi transitional government. According to the same constitution, that body won't exist until elections are held in early 2005.  In other words, on June 30, the occupation won't end, it will simply be outsourced to a group of hand-picked Iraqi politicians with no democratic mandate or sovereign power. With its new Iraqi face, the government will be free from the ugly perception that Iraq's national assets are being auctioned off by foreigners, not to mention being unencumbered by input from Iraqi voters who might have ideas of their own. ....      urlLink  The U.S. is Sabotaging Stability in Iraq    ....make no mistake: This is not the ""civil war"" that Washington has been predicting will break out between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. Rather, it is a war provoked by the U.S. occupation authority and waged by its forces against the growing number of Shiites who support Muqtada al-Sadr.....  ....The trouble began when Mr. Bremer closed down Mr. al-Sadr's newspaper last week, sparking a wave of peaceful demonstrations. On Saturday, Mr. Bremer raised the stakes further by sending coalition forces to surround Mr. al-Sadr's house near Najaf and arrest his communications officer.  Predictably, the arrest sparked immediate demonstrations in Baghdad, which the Iraqi army responded to by opening fire and allegedly killing three people. It was these deaths that provoked yesterday's bloody demonstrations.  At the end of the day on Sunday, Mr. al-Sadr issued a statement calling on his supporters to stop staging demonstrations ""because your enemy prefers terrorism and detests that way of expressing opinion"" and instead urged them to employ unnamed ""other ways"" to resist the occupation, a statement many interpret as a call to arms.  On the surface, this chain of events is mystifying. With the so-called Sunni triangle in flames after the gruesome Fallujah attacks, why is Mr. Bremer pushing the comparatively calm Shia south into battle? Here's one possible answer: Washington has given up on its plans to hand over power to an interim Iraqi government on June 30, and is now creating the chaos it needs to declare the handover impossible.  A continued occupation will be bad news for George Bush on the campaign trail, but not as bad as if the handover happens and the country erupts, an increasingly likely scenario given the widespread rejection of the legitimacy of the interim constitution and the U.S.-appointed government.  It's a plan that might make sense in meetings in Washington, but here in Baghdad it looks like pure madness. By sending the new Iraqi army to fire on the people it is supposed to be protecting, Mr. Bremer has destroyed what slim hope it had of gaining credibility with an already highly mistrustful population. On Sunday, before storming the unarmed demonstrators, the soldiers could be seen pulling on ski masks, so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to their neighborhoods.  Meanwhile, Mr. al-Sadr is having his hero status amplified by the hour. ..."

The first is that it is irresistible; the second is that as time advances, life improves. In Iraq it is trapped between the two. To believe that it can be thwarted, and that its occupation will become harder rather than easier to sustain as time goes by, requires that it disbelieves all that it holds to be most true.  But those who oppose its foreign policy appear to have responded with a myth of equal standing: that what unilateralism cannot solve, multilateralism can. The United Nations, almost all good liberals now argue, is a more legitimate force than the US and therefore more likely to succeed in overseeing Iraq's reconstruction and transition. If the US surrendered to the UN, this would, moreover, represent the dawning of a fairer, kinder world. These propositions are scarcely more credible than those coming out of the Pentagon.  The immediate and evident danger of a transition from US occupation to UN occupation is that the UN becomes the dustbin into which the US dumps its failed adventures. The American and British troops in Iraq do not deserve to die any more than the Indian or Turkish soldiers with whom they might be replaced. But the governments that sent them, rather than those that opposed the invasion, should be the ones that have to answer to their people for the consequences.  The vicious bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad last week suggests that the jihadis who now seem to be entering Iraq from every corner of the Muslim world will make little distinction between khaki helmets and blue ones. Troops sent by India, the great liberal hope, are unlikely to be received with any greater kindness than western forces. The Indian government is reviled for its refusal to punish the Hindus who massacred Muslims in Gujurat.  The UN will swiftly discover that occupation-lite is no more viable than occupation-heavy. Moreover, by replacing its troops, the despised UN could, in one of the supreme ironies of our time, provide the US government with the escape route it may require if George Bush is to win the next election. We can expect him, as soon as the soldiers have come home, to wash his hands not only of moral responsibility for the mess he has created, but also of the duty to help pay for the country's reconstruction. Most importantly, if the UN shows that it is prepared to mop up after him, it will enhance his incentive to take his perpetual war to other nations.  It should also be pretty obvious that, tough as it is for both the American troops and the Iraqis, pinned down in Iraq may be the safest place for the US army to be. The Pentagon remains reluctant to fight more than one war at a time. One of the reasons that it has tackled Iran and North Korea with diplomacy rather than missiles is that it has neither the soldiers nor the resources to launch an attack until it can disentangle itself from Iraq.  It is clear, too, that the UN, honest and brave as many of its staff are, possesses scarcely more legitimacy as an occupying force than the US. The US is now the only nation on the security council whose opinion really counts: its government can ignore other governments' vetoes; the other governments cannot ignore a veto by the US. In other words, a handover to the UN cannot take place unless George Bush says so, and Bush will not say so until it is in his interests to do so. The UN, already tainted in Iraq by its administration of sanctions and the fact that its first weapons inspection mission (Unscom) was infiltrated by the CIA, is then reduced to little more than an instrument of US foreign policy.  Until the UN, controlled by the five permanent members of the security council, has itself been democratised, it is hard to see how it can claim the moral authority to oversee a transition to democracy anywhere else. This problem is compounded by the fact that Britain, which is hardly likely to be perceived as an honest broker, is about to assume the council's presidency. A UN mandate may be regarded by Iraqis as bluewash, an attempt to grant retrospective legitimacy to an illegal occupation.  None of this, of course, is yet on offer anyway. The US government has made it perfectly clear that the UN may operate in Iraq only as a subcontractor. Foreign troops will take their orders from Washington, rather than New York. America's occupation of Iraq affords it regional domination, control of the second biggest oilfields on earth and, as deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz has hinted, the opportunity to withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia and install them in its new dependency instead. Republican funders have begun feasting on the lucrative reconstruction contracts, and the Russians and the French, shut out of the banquet, are being punished for their impudence.  Now that the US controls the shipping lanes of the Middle East and the oilfields of central Asia and West Africa, it is in a position, if it so chooses, to turn off the taps to China, its great economic rival, which is entirely dependent on external sources of oil. The US appears to be seeking to ensure that when the Iraqis are eventually permitted to vote, they will be allowed to choose any party they like, as long as it is pro-American. It will give up its new prize only when forced to do so by its own voters.  So, given that nothing we say will make any difference to Bush and his people, we may as well call for a just settlement, rather than the diluted form of injustice represented by a UN occupation. This means the swiftest possible transition to real democracy.  Troy Davis of the World Citizen Foundation has suggested a programme for handing power to the Iraqis which could begin immediately, with the establishment of a constitutional convention. This would permit the people both to start deciding what form their own government should take, and to engage in the national negotiation and reconciliation without which democracy there will be impossible. From the beginning of the process, in other words, the Iraqi people, not the Americans, would oversee the transition to democracy.  This is the logical and just path for the US government to take. As a result, it is unlikely to be taken. So, one day, when the costs of occupation become unsustainable, it will be forced to retreat in a manner and at a time not of its choosing. Iraq may swallow George Bush and his imperial project, just as the Afghan morass digested the Soviet empire. It is time his opponents stopped seeking to rescue him from his self-destruction.

4AN3082,male,37,"This is an Article from the Australian yesterday which took my fancy. You can find it online at   http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,6187347%255E12272,00.html  A bogged-down cakewalk  THE story thus far. In 1991 a large and largely landlocked nation, coveting its neighbour's coastline as much as its oil, planned an invasion.  One secular Arab nation against another. Religion was irrelevant.  The invader had in the past enjoyed the goodwill of Washington. So it mentioned its plans to the US ambassador and, far from receiving a stern admonishment, might have felt he'd got the diagonal nod. But the world was so appalled by its thuggery  and the US so concerned for the stability of neighbours such as Saudi Arabia  that an impressive coalition was cobbled together, endorsed by the UN, to drive them out.  For all the arrogance of the leader, a man notorious for his brutalities and his ambitions to become the greatest pan-Arabic leader since Nasser, what followed was a rout.  The retreat of his army became a turkey shoot. At least 100,000 of his troops were slaughtered as, burdened by the loot they'd stolen, they headed for home.  The US failed to press its advantage and stopped short of Baghdad.  Ever since they've been steaming with anger. Given the shock and awe of bin Laden's attacks on New York and Washington, a group of so-called neo-cons, who'd been dreaming of revenge, conflate the issue of a war against terror with a war against Iraq. Deaf to regional concerns  and unwilling to be honest brokers in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict  they decide to use the Pearl Harbor of September 11 as their excuse. They prepare for the biggest military action in half a century. Aghast at the new US foreign policy  the pre-emptive strike  the wider world protests. Washington tries some inept and insincere diplomacy  characterised by bullying, bribery and blundering  to achieve UN backing. They fail ignominiously. So the US goes it alone.  Almost alone. Because the British and, astonishingly, the Australians sign up. And why not? The enemy is a tawdry, run-down nation that's been pulverised in the first Gulf War, pauperised by a decade of sanctions and effectively disarmed by a decade of UN weapons inspections. The loyal PMs are promised a quick, clean, 24-hour war. Massive bombings of Baghdad will lead to implosion of the regime.  There will be mass defections, mass surrenders, insurrection. Baghdad will be transformed into a Disneyland democracy. Not only will Hussein's hierarchy be shocked and awed by US might but so will recalcitrants in the region.  It will be a war without mistakes, a war without body bags, a war that will demonstrate the US's dominance of the 21st century.  More importantly, it will be a demonstration war, a rehearsal for future pre-emptive interventions. That is why the Australian PM thinks it's a good idea to go along for the ride. Consider the pay-offs in the electorate, in military protection, in trade deals.  But things start to go wrong, with the examples of US miscalculations and ineptitudes that bring back memories of fiascos and failures  from Vietnam to Somalia via the Bay of Pigs.  As critics warn, the war isn't a series of set pieces in the desert but promises a Stalingrad-style battle in the city.  From day one, the so-called Arab street gets increasingly restless and angry with rulers who've agreed to facilitate Washington's war. Even neighbours who detest Hussein's regime are outraged by the behaviour of the US bully.  And what is the big excuse? The weapons of mass destruction? They're neither found nor deployed. Yes, Baghdad will fall. (After all, if Hussein won't follow the script, the US can always nuke him.)  But it's time to ask the question  the question that should have kept us out of this mess in the first place.  What's in it for us? Apart from troubles we didn't have and certainly don't need.  Apart from moving up the al-Qa'ida hit list, we're on the nose in the region  with neighbouring Muslim countries seeing us as US lapdogs.  Not bad for the first six days of a war that was meant to be surgical, a foregone conclusion. Another turkey shoot. A cakewalk. Fish in a barrel.  And where will we be in a fortnight? In a month? In a year? Up the Euphrates without a paddle? Internationally regarded as a nation of 20 million affluent whites in an endless ocean of brown and yellow faces? A nation with just one big and powerful friend? Don't miss the next exciting episode."

4AN3082,male,37,"Allies split over battle for hearts and minds     April 2 2003  Cracks are appearing between British and American commanders that have serious implications for operations in Iraq.  Senior British military officers are dismayed by what they see as the failure of US troops to try to fight the battle for hearts and minds. They are also appalled by reports that US marines killed Iraqi civilians, including women and children, as they seized bridges outside Nasiriyah in southern Iraq.  ""You can see why the Iraqis are not welcoming us with open arms,"" a senior British defence source said on Monday.  General Sir Mike Jackson, the head of the army, drove home the point at a press conference in London on Friday. ""We have a very considerable hearts and minds challenge,"" he said. ""We are not interested in gratuitous violence.""  British and American troops ""must convince the Iraqis of their good intentions"", echoed British Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram. It was not clear whether he was referring to any particular incident.  British officers have described the very different approach between UK and US soldiers by pointing to Umm Qasr, the Iraqi port south of Basra and the first urban area captured by US and British marines. ""Unlike the Americans, we took our helmets and sunglasses off and looked at the Iraqis eye to eye,"" a British officer said.  While British soldiers ""get out on their feet"", Americans, he said, were reluctant to leave their armoured vehicles. When they did - and this was the experience even in Umm Qasr - US marines were ordered to wear their full combat kit.  One difference emphasised by senior British military sources was the attitude towards ""force protection"". A British defence source added: ""The Americans put on more and more armour and firepower. The British go light and go on the ground.""  British defence sources contrast the patient tactics of their troops around Basra and what they call the more brutal tactics of American forces around Nasiriyah. US marines there appeared to have fired indiscriminately, with orders to shoot at civilian vehicles.  Unlike their American counterparts, British commanders have said they will not change their tactics following the suicide bombing attack last week on a group of US marines in Nasiriyah.  The British military put the difference in approach down to decades of training as well as experience, first in insurgencies in Malaya, then in Northern Ireland and peacekeeping operations in the Balkans.  Sir Roger Wheeler, former head of the army, points to the ""experience, awareness, and skill"", particularly important among non-commissioned officers such as corporals and sergeants.  What is striking is the emphasis British military figures put on the differences between their approach and that of the Americans on the ground. They have gone out of their way to draw attention to nervous, ""trigger-happy"" US soldiers.  US marines in Nasiriyah have said they had asked British troops for instructions on urban warfare. They began using new tactics in operations around the town yesterday when they started searching suburbs block by block.  British military sources are now concerned that the experience in peacekeeping and unconventional warfare of British troops will mean they will be in Iraq long after the Americans have left, even for years, in policing and humanitarian operations.  The concern among military chiefs is that the experience will mean the US will want to get out of places even quicker, leaving the British and others to continue fighting the battle for hearts and minds.  - Guardian  This story was found at:  urlLink http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/01/1048962756690.html"

Photo: AFP    Silver stars and red tracer fire lit the sky as the  Al Shualla people washed  their dead - as many as 58 of them  were slaughtered when a bomb exploded in their  little marketplace.  Some carried blanket-draped coffins through darkened alleyways,  others strapped them to the roofs of battered cars.  But from all houses the same teary cries drifted into the chilly night: ""There is no god but God."" As each family group left the mosque, the men  faced Mecca in prayer and the lights of passing cars etched the outline of their women, standing in tight knots off to the side.  Iraqi officials insist this bomb, the second in 48 hours to hit a civilian market, was dropped by a US or British jet. The Americans are investigating; they say they don't know.  But the suffering and the grief radiating from a small crater in this impoverished Shi'ite neighbourhood in  Baghdad will make it harder for ordinary Iraqis to see the US-led invasion force as an army of liberation, rather than one of conquest.  At the Al-Noor  Hospital, 500metres from the marketplace in north-west Baghdad, tearful men held each other in their arms as distraught women yelled the names of the dead.  A man, sobbing with grief, called over and over: ""That man! That man!"" Relatives said he was referring to President George  Bush, who, in Washington, appeared to be warning of more setbacks before victory in saying: ""We are now fighting the most desperate units of the dictator's army. The fierce fighting under way will demand further courage and further sacrifice, yet we know the outcome of this battle.""  In the face of stiff resistance  and severe front-line problems - security and logistic - US commanders have now decided on a pause of up to six days in their advance on Baghdad.  The Al Shualla carnage came on  a day in which the US seemed to put aside its undertaking not to damage Iraq's  infrastructure: waves of strikes, including the first confirmed use of 4700-pound (2100 kilogram) bunker-buster bombs, destroyed much of Baghdad's telephone system.  In Al Shualla, at 6.30pm, people were busy in the  market. Ghannun Hussein was waiting for his 59-year-old father with the vegetables for their evening meal when he heard the whoosh of a missile.  Standing by his father's hospital bed later, he said:  ""I heard the explosion. I ran. All the people were on the ground; people's arms and legs were cut off, there was too much blood.""  Najin Abdula, who works at the hospital, raced to the scene: ""There was the body of a man with no head. I stopped cars in the traffic to get them to bring the injured to the hospital.""  Then he opened the door of a morgue refrigerator for  The Sun-Herald . Inside were five bodies. One young man had half his head blown away; the nose of another was gone and his flesh and clothing were torn.  As family members and hospital staff, many   in tears, worked feverishly, survivors who could talk spoke of their split-second encounter with war.  Khalid Jabar Hussein, 49, with shrapnel  in his arm, wrist and leg, said: ""First I heard an aircraft and then the missile coming at us  and I don't know anything after that. I fell down.""  Sajaja Jaafur, one of five in  her family who were injured, lay in her bed,  crying with pain as she tried to turn to face her mother. Her lovely olive skin was torn, there was a tube in her nose and a blood-stained dressing around her abdomen.  Samaan Kadhim,52, sedated with a bad gash on his back, said:""This was a civilian area, there were no soldiers. It was just a market.""  In the midst of all this, Dr Ahmed Sufian lashed out: ""Our floors are covered with blood of our people, the walls are splashed with blood. Why, why, why? Why all this blood? I'm a doctor, but I can't understand such things. They say [they] come to free us? Is this freedom?""  There was no overt support for Saddam Hussein, but all blamed the US for the  bombing.  There was no hostility towards western reporters  invited by  families to witness  their grief.  ""America did this to us,"" said 50-year-old Kadhim Ali. ""Why does it hate the Iraqi people?""

The other significant difference is that while one approach raises money, the other costs - a lot."

It took 103 years to complete. i'll post some pictures later that show some close up of these statues.  every inch of this temple is intracately carved soapstone.
Y8NGFE2,male,26,"urlLink    this is a not uncommon sight on the streets of bangalore.  you see the most remarkable things on scooters here.  above you see a family racing along in traffic (you can't really get a sense for the speed in a still, but whatever).  i'll try to get a picture of a woman in a sari tomorrow.  those are just the greatest."
Y8NGFE2,male,26,urlLink    notice the tires on the cement mixer.  they're really just metal.  this thing made such a racket riding down the street.  every couple of seconds the flap would fall off the back of the cement mixer and one of the guys would have to hop off of the cart to put it back on.

Y8NGFE2,male,26,"urlLink    this is the first in what will likely be many posts about traffic here in bangalore, which is unlike anything i've ever seen.  the streets are packed (as you can see above) with buses, 4 wheeled cars, 3 wheeled auto rigshaws, 2 wheeled motorcycles, bicycles, people,  dogs, cows, carts, and trash.  basically, gaj treats the streets like an obstacle course.  so these are the main characteristics of driving in bangalore: lanes are absolutely meaningless, there are no stop signs, few stop lights, 5 way intersections where traffic just weaves its way through, speed bumps at intersections so that cars run don't crash into each other at the speed of light (they prefer a bouncy 50 kpm), and everybody honks constantly."

MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Wow, all of a sudden I seem to have gained popularity with the opposite sex.   I currently have 3 boys (for lack of a better word) pursuing me.  It's very flattering and all, but it's kinda messing with me.  First of all, I'm not really interested in any of them, for a variety of different reasons, (not the least of which being my crush on yet another boy [mmmm....other boy]) secondly, I'm really not in a position right now where I feel like I should be focusing any of my energy towards ""dating."" (or whatever it is they're calling it these days)"
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"So I'm actually kinda new at all this computer stuff, until lately I'd pretty much relied on other people to figure out all the details for me.  I have some sort of strange  magnetic field around me that causes most electronic devices to run away screaming at the very sight of me. (this is quite a sight, especially at computer labs and cyber cafes) OK maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I can't keep a watch working for more than 3 months, my alarm clock will fail to go off when it is set, and sometimes goes off when it isn't, and computers hate me with a red and fiery passion.   Now the funny thing about this (or rather the thing I find funny, mean people who take joy in the misery of others find my predicament highly amusing) is I work with computers now, in fact, I'm at work right now (I work really really hard) last week I was having this problem with one of the programs at work, every morning as I tried to open it would do stuff (technical term)it wasn't supposed to, and every morning I would call my supervisor over (he must really hate me) and he would fix it.  Now can someone explain to me why when I rebooted it didn't help, but when he rebooted it fixed everything?  How does the computer know when it's me?  They got the computer guy over and now it works again, no supervisor approval needed, but I'm sure it'll find something new and obnoxious to do next week. This week I've been trying to get this blog started, mind you I'm doing this all by myself, without any help from my computer savvy friends, so it's a long process, with much hair pulling, and a few bargains being struck with the universe.  The good news is the universe is responding, the bad news is it seems to have a 12-16 hour delay this week.  I spent all day Wednesday (at work mind you, and I do actually have to work sometimes, it's not like I actually spent the entire 8 hours on it) getting this thing set up, only to get an error message at the end of the night as I was trying to post, naturally I assumed that meant it hadn't worked, (not a big shock to me, considering my track record)  but to my utter astonishment, when I logged on yesterday it had worked.  This made me jump up and down with glee (earning me perplexed looks from my co-workers, as well as a resigned sigh, and a shake of his head from my supervisor [he must really, really hate me]) it also gave me an overinflated sense of my computer skills, and inspired me to further frustrate myself. I decided what I really needed was a site counter, so I'd know if anyone is actually reading all this blather.  I set out on this endeavor totally ignorant of what it would entail, HTML and java script were mere theoretical concepts to me, things I had heard people speak of without ever even beginning to think they might effect my life in any way.  As it turns out, this actually could have taken place without me having to bother my pretty little head about such details, if only I'd bothered to pay attention to some other details.   ********note to self: scroll down the page before assuming all available options are listed within plain sight******** I managed to find a web site offering free site counters with no trouble at all, and proceeded to follow their directions to get set up, so far so good.  At this point I'm practically patting myself on the back, sure that all of my computer problems are behind me.  Then I get the  part with the HTML and java script options, at first I'm stymied, but I don't let my ignorance slow me down for long, I plod along until I finally find a page with all sorts of stuff I don't understand on it ""Ah-ha, this must be it"" I cut and paste the more complicated one first, undaunted by the warnings that it might not work, I hit preview, and almost start jumping up and down with glee again (I restrained myself however, I do want to keep my job) there at the bottom of the screen was a lovely little site counter.  So I hit submit and republish, and all that jazz, then I look and it's not there, ""what the ....."" So I do it again, with the same results.  At this point I'm still figuring it's just one of those things, and if I could just get someone else to hit the submit button for me it would work perfectly.  I go back and find the simpler option, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.  Learning from my mistakes isn't one of my stronger points but eventually even I had to figure I must've done something wrong somewhere along the way.  I start over, and right off I figure it out (someone give the girl a prize) I picked the wrong section, there's a special blog area cleverly hidden out of sight on one of the first pages (see note to self)  By now I'm feeling a little less impressed with my computer abilities, but at least I figured it out.  After filling it out I get a happy little message saying it was completed successfully, but then it wouldn't let me use a code, 'cause I'd already used it with the first one, and by then it was time to go home, and I could have jumped up and down with glee cause there wasn't anyone else around, but there was nothing to be gleeful about. But wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, I log on this morning and there it is, and it's working, so naturally I have to change the way it looks, and carefully examine all possible options, messing with as many of them as possible.  It's probably broken again, but I haven't had the heart to look."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Had a great Comedysportz workshop last night! We did another mock show, and I didn't feel as though I was a deer caught in the headlights the entire time.  The fact that we had an audience of 1 probably didn't hurt, hard to get any serious stage fright when there's only 1 set of eyes on you, (and a non-threatening set at that) but still I felt pretty good about it all and all.   I even had to sing twice (who's fault was that anyway?? grrrr [I'm fierce!!!]) and it wasn't too abysmal. (truth be told I'm actually kinda proud of the spagettios song) I still couldn't do an accent to save my life, (good thing that's never gonna be an issue, huh?  Just imagine it for a moment, a dark dungeonesque room, a nondescript figure, [dressed entirely in black of course] harshly whispering ""speak as if you are from France, if you value your life"" yeah, that's gonna happen) my terrible, horrible, no good, very bad attempt at french came out sounding more like er...well...who knows what the heck it sounded like, but it certainly wasn't anything even remotely resembling french. (the most embarassing part of this is that I actually used to be able to do a french accent, years ago, not a good one mind you, but still....) I even took a couple of terms of french in college (maybe I should have spent a little more of that study time actually learning something, and a little less kissing my ""tutor"") if there was an accent I could do, this would be it, oh bother. Alrighty, I promised ya'll something inane, and boy did I deliver, the good news is I managed to use the word ""dungeonesque"" in a sentence, you don't get to do that every day. (or at least I don't, and I'm OK with that.  If you somehow manage to use the word  ""dungeonesque"" in a sentence every day, just going about your business as usual, you might want to re-examine your lifestyle choices, I just don't see how that could be healthy)"
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"So I just started reading this book about Alfred Adler (I needed something to read, and we have a lending library at work, it was this or romance novels, I stand by my decision) for those of you who don't know he was a prominent psychologist in the early 20th century, once associated with Freud and Young, but I digress.       I've only made it as far as the preface right now, but I came across this little table, detailing characteristics of tough minded and tender minded temperments, I was a bit dismayed to find that I actually seem to be the tender minded sort.  I won't bore you with the entire thing, but the one that really got to me was the idealist vs materialist.       You see, I've always had this thing against materialism, don't get me wrong, I love having things, I even love buying things, but I don't love things, and I don't think the acquisition of things should ever be the focus of one's life.  You know what they say about the love of money being the root of all evil (no, what do they say?)  My Daddy was big on accumulation,  I'm one of 9 kids, he was married to 9 different women, we had 30 cats 20 peacocks, 35 chickens, and an old English sheep dog (the dog was mine) when I was a kid.  He wasn't so much into the traditional sort of materialism, he didn't need to have the nicest car, house, TV and such, but he had to have the most of everything.     On the other hand, I have a lot of respect for idealists, my mama is this great hippie lady, she does all sorts of work in the community trying to educate people on environmentalism, sexism, racism, and all sorts of political stuff.  I don't always agree with her sentiments, but I love the fact that she believes she can make a difference,  that people are innately good and that all the world needs is people who are willing to do their part to make their ideals a reality.     I wish I was more like my mama, I wish I had a cause I cared enough about to really put my heart into it.  I wish I believed I can make a difference (but hell, I can't even make dinner with any regularity.) Check it out, 3 pages into the preface of a psych textbook and I'm all introspective and stuff, maybe I should've grabbed a romance novel after all."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"I resolve not to cry myself to sleep.  This is why I find myself awake and writing at this hour of the morning, instead of in bed sleeping as I should be, I gave it a shot, it didn't work out. Please pardon my self-indulgence, but I seem to be feeling a wee bit sorry for myself all of a sudden. Normally I'm able to keep such feelings at bay by reminding myself how good I really do have it. All and all the universe has been pretty kind to me, and I have much to be thankful for, and I am thankful, but still, there are times when I just can't seem to stop myself from wallowing in self-pity and self-doubt. I feel very alone right now, very lonely, and very scared. (wow that's a lot of verys, even for me) The little voice in my head that tells me everything is gonna work out seems to have taken an unscheduled vacation, while the one that foretells doom and gloom is working overtime. (these are metaphorical voices, of course, the real voices only tell me to kill people, and bargain shop) I spent the evening hanging out with a married couple I know, their relationship is about as dysfunctional as they get, and yet, they seemed so happy, so comfortable, I miss that comfortability, that togetherness. I was so miserable for so long, but misery loves company, after all, and at least I had that. What if I never have that again? Alright, that's about enough of my whining, sorry folks."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Been keeping track of the referrals to this site, mostly people find there way here, by clicking on links from the blogs of my friends, but occationally some poor soul will unknowingly wander in, looking for something, so far, these things have been: Banditos, the refreshments Donny Darco sex+doing it (this poor person must have been sorely disappointed) girls doing it (this was #125 out of 11,000,000 how many entries do you figure this guy looked through?) everybodyelseisdoingit"
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"I don't go to the doctor very often, if I can avoid it.  I don't like doctors, don't get me wrong, I think it's great what they do, and I have oodles of respect for how much they have to know, and how hard their job is, and my doctor is a really nice guy, but I just don't like to visit him.  First of all, you have to make an appointment, which means listening to really crappy hold music for 10 minutes, where a really, really, mellow voice interrupts every 16 seconds, telling you that your call is important, and then (at least at my doctor's office) informing you that Monday's are their busiest day, for faster assistance don't call on Monday.  (Mind you, I've never actually called my doctor's office ON a Monday, but I still have to listen to this fabulous advice, personally I think they should have one of those recordings for every day of the week, just to fuck with the hypochondriacs)  Then, when you finally get to talk to one of the receptionists, once they finally figure out who the hell you are, (do they really need that much information to identify you?  I know for a fact, that there is no one else in this county with my name, and yet, I still have to divulge my date of birth, the last four digits of my social security number, my phone number, address, my mother's maiden name, and my bra size) they ask you why you want to see the doctor (so far in my life this has been a relatively embarrassment-free process, but just imagine what it would be like to have something weird going on, this, of course would never be an issue for little old moi, but imagine trying to make an appointment to discuss something like pre-mature ejaculation.  How the heck could you bring yourself to mention that to that perky little receptionist?  I mean, you know you're gonna have to look her in the eye when you go in for your appointment, she's gonna hand you that book-sized stack of paperwork she's going to insist you fill out, and she's going to  know  why you're there) Ok, you've managed to secure an appointment, at a time that is only mildly inconvenient for you (my favorite is when they ask you your preference on days, and times, and then, once you've stated that Tues or Thurs between 10 and 12 would be best for you, they ever so sweetly offer you one appointment on Tuesday at 8:15 or any number of appointments on Weds between 1 and 5) you show up 10 minutes early, just as they instructed you to, stand in line for 7 minutes while some really sweet mostly deaf old lady in front of you tries to schedule an appointment on a Tuesday between 10 and 12, and then once you make it up to the desk, they have to do the whole identification thing again, and that's when they give you the book to fill out, I'm pretty lucky  as I can pretty much just check no on everything, me and my family are all pretty healthy, but what gets me is that you have to write down why you're there again.  Especially because we all know what happens next, once they've taken the forms back, you've sat back down, and just gotten into in one of the articles in the only magazine in the lobby that even remotely interested you, the Medical assistant or Nurse, comes to take you back to the examining room, where she weighs and measures you, takes your blood pressure, and  asks you why you're there .  She does this while she's actually reading your file, where, at last count, it should already be written down twice.  Do people change their minds a lot when they're going to the doctor's office?  Do you make an appointment because your back is hurting, and then when you get there decide you'd actually like to get an EKG?  Or plan to discuss a new diet and exercise regime, but instead request a splint for your sprained wrist? Then you're stuck there in that little room, with two pictures, one of a tranquil outdoor scene, and the other some sort of cartoon with an amusing, and heartwarming phrase on it, a poster detailing the knee, and a bunch of little pamphlets.  (Am I the only one who longs to snoop around in the drawers and cabinets during this seemingly endless expanse of time?  I never actually do, I always end up reading those stupid little pamphlets, and inevitably by the time the doctor knocks on the door I've finished the ones detailing the warning signs of migraines, heart disease, breast and skin cancer, and have moved on to drug addiction, herpes, or pyromania)  After quickly shoving the pamphlet on kleptomania into your pocket, you tell the doctor to come in, he sits down, starts looking through your chart, and then, he too, asks you why you're there. You of course tell him, because your only other option is yelling at him and that just doesn't seem like such a great plan, seen as he's the guy who writes out your prescriptions, not really the person, you want mad at you.  I mean, you piss of your dry cleaner, worst case scenario your clothes come back with stains in embarrassing places, you piss off your doctor, and you could end up causing stains in embarrassing places.   He nods his head a lot, and the fills out a little slip of paper, tells you to take one of these twice a day, and moves on to his next patient."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Wow, it's been quite a week.    Monday I got a shove in the right direction from Aaron, Lillith, and Amber. I told a story that I won't tell here, it's not the sort of thing that can exist in black and white, but it was a story I needed to tell.  Sometimes I'm too damned proud for my own good, it kills me to ask for help, to ask for a shoulder to cry on.  Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart for listening and being there for me.   Yesterday morning I got up early and started packing, mostly just setimental stuff I can't live without, pictures, diaries, teddy bears, old notebooks with interesting doodles, you know, the essentials.  I boxed  all this crap up, put it in the trunk of my car intending to take it all over to my Mama's house for safekeeping.  I wasn't really planning on going anywhere just yet, but Tuesday is the only time I have the house to myself, and I wanted to be prepared.  I had a knot in my stomach all morning (more like all year, but it was worse yesterday than normal) I felt just like I always did as a kid when I was doing something wrong and I knew I was gonna get caught. (wait, I was a perfect child, I never did anything wrong...drat!)  I didn't get caught, I had all my assorted sentimental crap, along with a bunch of clothes and actual necessities packed away in the trunk of my car by the time he came home for lunch.  I think I had it in the back of my head all this time that I was just gonna leave for work one day and not come home at the end of the night.  I've been trying to get out of this marriage for awhile, but there was always one more reason to stay.  Mostly I just didn't want to hurt him and I don't do well with confrontation (I know this probably comes as a shock to those of you who I'm incessantly harassing, but it isn't confrontation if I don't mean it) I prefer to suffer in silence. (anybody have an opening for a martyr?  Anyone?)    Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. (people always say that, I had no idea how true it was)  When I walked out the door he was still begging me not to go, I wanted to turn around and tell him I was wrong, that it would be alright, we could work it out, I wanted to hold him and lie, just to make him stop, like I always do, but I'm so sick of lying, I wish all those things were true, I tried to lie to myself to make them true, but I know better.  I was bawling when I got into my car, I had to stop at the end of the street to get myself together enough to drive.  Who says you can't break a broken heart?  I didn't even know where I was going, my first thought was my Mama's house, but she does daycare, and it was right around nap-time, plus I didn't want to scare the little kids with all my hysterics.  So I went to the bar. (good idea huh?  Alcohol and depression, always a winning combination) It took me about half an hour to get up the nerve to call Cyrena, she told me recently that I could call her if I ever needed someone to talk to, and boy did I.  Bless her heart, she dropped everything to come let me cry on her shoulder, apologized for not getting there sooner, and then offered me a place to stay.  I must have done something really great in a past life to deserve a friend like her.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU  So, I don't know what I'm gonna do, or how it's all gonna work out, but I slept well last night for the first time in far too long, and I woke up this morning without a feeling of impending doom lingering over me.  And heck, I'm a girl, I believe in happy endings."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Well, if all goes as planned, it looks like I'm moving back into my house this weekend.  I'm currently trying to recruit help with cleaning and moving furniture and stuff.  If you don't have anything better to do on Sunday you're more than welcome to come over and lend a hand, or just hang out in the air-conditioning and make snide remarks.  The house is a pigsty right now, and will probably get worse over the next couple of days.  Normally I don't let people come over when it's messy, but since this isn't really my mess, and I'd really like some company, I'm making an exception."
MGYZ2KU,female,23,"Had a kinda strange night at Karaoke last night, I felt more like an observer than a participant, been feeling like that quite a bit lately actually.  Feeling lonely even when I'm not alone.  The last couple of times I've gone out to 80's night and Karaoke I haven't really wanted to go, but I want to be alone even less.  It's so strange, less than a month ago I would have given anything to get to spend a night home by myself, but now that I can, I don't want to.  Alright, enough of my whining.   Had some folks over for dinner tonight, it was nice.  I made my world famous (it's a small world, after all) spaghetti, we ate, I drank, it was merry.  I might have to learn how to cook a couple of other things, I really like having people over for dinner, but it would be nice if I could mix it up a little.    I guess I'm not feeling too talkative tonight, who'd have thought it was possible?"
LGJYAXE,male,17,Nobody likes to hear bad news.  the jeep came back all fixed up. Except for a little ity bitty problem with the engine.... So i guess the starting system needs a little work. And i guess i really want my car to just be a cool car and not have ridicullus amounts of expensive problems that consume months of work.  other than that water polo is going to state after a pretty tough sectional tournament.YAY! i promise to try my hardest to give central a state title.
LGJYAXE,male,17,"Everything is so right  i just can't explain what i feel now. Im just at ease, for the first time since i can remember. Something about running naked with mike and shouting i love jackie across a pond just make the world perfect. I am so deep in love i cant even see the surface, i dont want to see the surface.  I hope you can find that person that just makes every moment fascinating when they are there. I hope you can recognize it when it comes. And i hope you dont let it pass you by.  Ive caught the rainbow, the trick is to ride it and not fall off."
LGJYAXE,male,17,"i've got a secret that may make you gag  Heres what im thinking, im not a big fan of critisizing other peoples words but im going to do it now  This may be a surprise but every single person on this earth does things for themselves. There are the classic examples of someone selfish like a miser who everyone agrees is a selfish person. But lets think here, people do things because they want to, what makes them want to do it? Themselves. Everything you do is self obsorbed because its based on your needs. Not to put myself on a pedistal but i like to think im a pretty nice guy. And i am very selfish. How does this work? Easily, its not a parodox because making other people feel good and important and laugh is what i like to do. Its fun for ME to make other people happy. Im making people happy for my own selfish wants. It gets to the point where if i am not making someone happy i get sad. I don't like being sad, therefor, i selfishly try to make that person happy so i can feel better. That is very self obsorbed. The only difference between someone considered selfish and someone who is benevolent is that the benevolent person wants other people happy cause thats how they get happy, the selfish person only has to satisfy themselves to be happy. The greatest sacrifice in our culture: jusus being crucified was a very selfish thing. God wanted more people in heaven. So he sent jesus in to take that away so he could get more people in heaven. And jesus did it because he got his kicks off saving people.  So when you go out and say that you want to find someplace where people arent self obsorbed your living in a dream. Everyone is, its just a matter of where they put their energy. Every single human is flawed equally, its just a matter of where it is and how obvious it is.  Im on a roll, so i got another point to make.  Looking into the future does nothing except add unwanted pressure on your life. People who have great things going for them need to just step back and say wow. Not dream about how much better it could get. Because while your heads in the clouds you just may stumble and fall.  So if this applies to you shape up. Im not perfect, one of the dumbest people i know. But i refuse to accuse other people for problems only i can fix and i am determined to live in the wonderful now. I consider myself a work in progress and am determined to get better and stop complaining so much because i realize how ugly it sounds.   But that is hypocritical too since this whole post was a complaint. Oh well, at least i feel better now.   Self obsorbed eh?"

LGJYAXE,male,17,"tilted back  ive been swimming a lot lately which means i do a lot of thinking. Lucky you, i have things to share on this blog. But its kind of weird because the thoughts that hit me at 5:30 are really bizzar. i spent an hour contemplating if i could knock a kid out by swimming head first at him and headbutting him. I think i could pull it off and if im lucky id go down too.  I've got traffic court today for my huge ticket. Too nervous to nap so i decided to see what the pop music scene is up to. Theres this song that sounds clean and feel good called ""you're the only one"" It was really sad to me though. It's this girl singing about this boy who she laughs at the size of his dick and generally puts him down, but he's allways there to hold her hair back when she gets drunk and pukes. What the fuck? I really wouldn't feel sad if the opening line was, ""Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground.""   and this is what passes as love"

LGJYAXE,male,17,testing  I'm really hoping that i will be able to stay with this daily walk thing. It's really nice to get some energy out in the nice weather. I got to think a lot and listen to birds....far out.  But one thing i was thinking about is how people can change for the worse. I was talking to an old friend today and they just started talking. And they didnt stop. And there wasnt anything important to what they were saying. Someone who used to be a pretty cool person is now obsessed with the filler in life. Its kind of sad.

LGJYAXE,male,17,"i can almost touch it  I was driving today and spotted 6 dead birds in the road along my 15 minute drive. And I'm thinking that's really sad. I wish birds would be a little bit smarter and stay away from cars. Nobody likes dead robins in their street.  I found out today that i really hate the idea of people depending on other people. Or more specifically one person depending on another person. I can understand attached, and i can understand favorite people to be around. But as soon as people start depending on one sole person something is fucked. Because people let you down. There are no exceptions. I'm not saying to not have faith in people. But i am saying that you set yourself up for an unecessarily bad time if you become dependant. People need to fix their own problems and then move out in the social world, not expect the social world to fix their problems."
835XWJW,female,17,"OK, well quick blog on New Years Eve...tonite is the big partay!  I'll probably come on here and write some more, and have my friends write some stuff (maybe).  Gosh crazy day today, woke up (barely slept, ahh my back, my legs, my hips hurt SO BAD :'(...) ate, showered, and went to run errands with my daddy.  Well I got to drive but that also means be yelled at and criticized on every mistake...o well I guess I have to put up with it.  Well so we went all over grocery shopping and stuff, because we're having two parties at my house tonite, mine (upstairs) and theirs (downstairs) fun fun fun stuff eh!  well 3 ppl still need to RSVP but i think 2 r on vayk...and i owe the library $12, plus i have to send out my xmas cards (a little late but o well)...oh and we forgot to get milk. fun stuff huh?? ok, my new years resolution (so far my only one i rele wanna publish): to be more upfront and honest with people because it just makes better relationships and a lot of the time the truth hurts but its way better to know... ok i think im done preaching :)"
835XWJW,female,17,"gotta love how i dont write in here for like..10 days and now i write twice in one day.  im just not sleepy but not awake enough to do homework.  so instead im gonna ramble in here and write one of those weird entries thats gonna make chrissy shake her head at me.  mostly ive been thinking, is there rele a point to life? i mean yeah the point right now is to get good grades, have some fun and get through high school so i can go to a good college so i can get a good job so i can retire etc etc. its like a neverending chain.  its kinda weird too how wut i do today can impact what i do 50 years from now (aka vacation in florida vs make fries at mcd's) so of course theres the material point to life, which is of course due to the desire to live comfortably and have enough money for everything you want.  then of course another point of life is to have fun because nothings really worth it if u arent having some fun.  so far, the point of life is to have money with which to entertain yourself. basically, anyway.  but honestly, when youre 60 years old looking back are you going to think ""YES! i aced my math test back in 11th grade"" no youre going to think geeze i locked myself up studying rather than go out and have fun.  which is more important? is either one really all that important or is there something else that makes you look back on everything and be happy you experienced it? the psychologist erikson theorizes that humans go through different stages of development and each one has two possible outcomes, one positive and one negative.  almost like a video game where you have to pass the next level and sometimes u barely make it but you dont have as many lives or gold stars in the next.  well, the last stage in his theory is shame vs integrity.  shame is when u look back on life and realize it was a waste and integrity is when you are able to look back on life proudly and accept everything in it, the good and bad, as an overall experience, and appreciate it.  so what does it take to reach that stage and attain integrity? i always wonder.. if God knows beforehand whether we are going to choose him or not, and therefore whether we will go to heaven or hell...why not skip the whole ""life"" part of it and just go straight to wherever we're going to end up? i mean obviously God has his reasons because its not like hes going to realize o thats a better idea let it be so and poof its like that but i mean, i cant help but wonder..  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~"
835XWJW,female,17,"Hi.  To let you all know how my wonderful lovely morning went...well I wont go into too much detail about the beginning but I was woken up like 5 times by my family for like no reason at all.  Then my mom went to breakfast with her mom, and my dad woke me up to yell at me for not having done anything for Mother's Day.  First, it is 9am, how duz he know I dont have a dozen roses hidden in my closet?  I mean I didnt, but still, if i had...lol ok thats weak i know.  But ok, second, he asked why I didnt get her anything and told me how disappointed he was.  I mean I went shopping WHEN? And I am HOW broke? (Not in the last couple weeks and VERY) And I mean, yeah I could have planned on going, but its not like i can drive anywhere.  (""Hey mom, will u take me to buy ur present?"") But, being half asleep and not rele wanting to get into it, i nodded and did this weird ""mmmm"" sleepy noise.  THEN, my dad goes off on me about talking back to him bcuz hes right an blah blah, and i was like no i wasnt saying anything besides mmm... sheesh.  Then my dad was about to leave and thot of more to say so he turned an came back and i got another round of it.  I swear, my dad shud b a preacher.  He has these total sermons.  Its like even when I agree with him on somtin he has to explain why and go on and on and on.  Oh, and my last complaint on this is, how much duz he think i care that hes disappointed?  I get a 4.0 and he asks why I got a B in one class(i have AP spanish), I clean my room and he asks why my desk is still messy, its like theres no way to please him so i stopped trying like 10 yrs ago, so his disappointment is kinda just there not rele affecting me.  I'm still ""good"" but its for me not him, bcuz im the one thats gonna get into college with good grades, etc. Anyway ya that pissed me off.  Other than that i went to the mall with my bro to get my moms present (We got her estee lauder makeup she wanted and even tho i didnt buy enuf for the free gift the lady gave me two for being ""such a nice girl"" haha!) I know I said i dont care hes disappointed, an i dont, but i know my mom wud b rele sad if we ignored mothers day, so i figured we shud get somtin.  Other than that I've been doing HW, i have this project on Guatemala (where i was born) and omg I had to do history of it and its sooo horrible, they had this rele bad civil war and this dictatorship and so much stuff, and this is around when my parents were alive, its no wonder we moved here.  Yeah, and mothers day dinner tonite, where were gonna surprise her with her gifts and roses and card yay how touching... back to homework *Arleen*"
835XWJW,female,17,"well, to add to my fantastic night, my hair is basically straight again, except it has just enough curl left to be grossly poofy wavyish.  the only way it stays curly is if i get it wet and then wait until its dried a little but still wet enuf and put just enuf mousse in (too little duznt hold, too much weighs it down) then adding gel and hairspray where it tends to not hold the curl in well and yeah, so basically i have like 1 day a week where it looks alright and the rest of the time its a wavyish mess. fantastic, im glad my parents blew their money on that. the one good thing right now is...ive got a plan :)"
835XWJW,female,17,"ok well today nothing huge and dramatic happened for me to vent about... but its halloween and it was pretty fun so i figured i shud write at least a little.. well to begin with it was a calm and boring day but turned out to be rele hectic.  i woke up (thx alyssa, calling me at 9:40-crack of dawn hehe) had breakfast, then went online for a bit and did my bio hw.  then i looked thru my yrbook, showered an watched tv. then kate came over an we left for scary movie  3.  after that we were gonna go to sav ons cuz i was sposed to get candy for trick or treaters.  well she had to get somewhere so she just took me home an i drove myself to sav ons rele fast cuz i was sposed to hang out with alyssa for a bit.  well sav ons didnt have a lot so i got hte best stuff i cud for the best price an went home.  it wasnt enuf tho so i went to wal mart looking for mroe and got a lot more.  well by the time i got home and set out the candy it was 5.  ppl were sposed to come to my house at 6 for trick or treating.  well i went to alyssas for about a half hour and raced home to change an do my makeup.  wel i went full out pirate johnny depp (mustache an beard an all) and then we went trick or treating.  i kno it duznt sound so hectic but it was cuz i was like ok i was sposed to b at alyssas at 4 but it ended up being 5, then i had only a half hour to get into costume so i had to finish while everyone was here...it turned out to b a lot of fun tho, so yeah. i got a crapload of candy too. lol  well im gonna go play some addicting game brandons sending me...bye all, night ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~"

835XWJW,female,17,"Chapter1 Once upon a time Chelsea owned a chappy named ""I plead the fifth"".  She called him fifthy for short.  One day she forgot fifthy at her awesome fantastic friend Arleen's house.  Arleen was going to return fifthy the next day, after lacrosse practice, but forgot because she had to run some errands.  By now fifthy was very sad because he missed Chelsea so much!  Arleen and Chelsea didn't see each other all day, so poor Fifthy had to stay at Arleen's house for another night.  The next day, tragedy hit: Chelsea left for the river.  Fifty was stunned, and had no idea when his beloved owner would be back.  He packed up his things, thanked Arleen for her hospitality, and left.  He was going to find Chelsea. Chapter2 After almost a week of hitching rides with snails, Fifthy was at the river.  He made a beeline for Chelsea's river house, and was stuneed to find it empty.  Brokenhearted, he began to weep in heartwrenching sobs.  He wondered if he would ever see Chelsea again.  All of a sudden, he felt a tap on his shoulder.  He turned, and looking at him was a kangaroo. ""Hello"", she said.  ""My name is Poneloosa.  I was wondering why you're crying, maybe I can help."" ""My Chelsea!"" Bawled Fifthy.  ""She's gone!  I don't know if I'll ever find her!"" ""Well,"" Said Poneloosa. ""I saw a Chelsea leaving a few days ago.  I think she said she was going home to San Diego.  I'm on my way there, so why don't you ride with me?"" Chapter 3 Chappy peeked out from Poneloosa's pouch.  They were in front of Chelsea's house.  He climbed out, thanked Poneloosa, and turned excitedly towards the house.  He saw Chelsea's car and smiled.  He was so excited to see her.  As Poneloosa spread her wings and flew into the sunset, Fifthy hopped towards the house.  Just as he was about to ring the doorbell, Chelsea opened the door and scooped him into her arms. ""Oh my Fifthy, I've missed you so!"" She cried as she smoothed down the folds of her dress.  ""I love you Chelsea!"" Cried Fifthy.  And so they walked hand in hand into the house, overjoyed to be together again. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ *RLeeN* ~~~~~~~~~~~~"
835XWJW,female,17,"Allison and Kate ended up coming over.  Meggie cudnt bcuz she has her behind the wheel tomorrow at 7:30.  Well we watched About A Boy it was good but a little drawn out, I fell asleep a few times but I got the general idea.  Then we played charades which is rele funny and then Drew came and picked up Allison an Kate.  I didn't do my spanish reading, i read about 3 of 15 pages.  That swing is too comfy, and it rocks a little so it's like ok u cant read like that.  The story I'm reading is boring too.  But i decided i will finish reading it tonite and do the questions tomorrow.  even if i have to stay up rele late. i mean how long can it take? 1 hour at the most...if it even takes that long (hopefully not).  who gets homework over vayk neway? cmon ppls.  and ok y is it getting hot out?  it was like in the 80s today!  isnt january sposed to b cold? sheesh.  cmon, pls b cold. cold is good. i promise!"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"so I realized a couple of minutes ago that i have gone the entire day without talking to anyone.  It feels strange, I have lots of things to tell but I seem to be so busy that I never get a chance to talk with anyone, but I think about telling people stuff and then I forget that I haven't actually told them yet...does that happen to anyone else?"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"What an evil fun day today is.  I came in, said Hello to JB and haven't said one word really since.  She told me that her therapist got angry with her for using her arm to much, and that it was going to land her back in the hospital.  The entire time she was telling this story she was talking with her hands...hee hee.  Currently she is on the phone with the payroll people who since they just re-did the system won't put her on because she will be leaving at the end of the month.  It's really funny.  Her doctor also said that she shouldn't be driving and she was fishing for a ride from me, but I am not going to offer.  If she asks me, then I might consider it, but I will not offer.  On the way to work today I saw the coolest stencil, it was 2 skeleton's kissing.  I wish that I had a digital camera so that I could take a picture for you.  I am considering getting myself one and buying it at RCWilley with my account---maybe a birthday gift to myself? Hummm... like the idea. Oh gotta go, she's coming"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"It feels strange not having to do anything in particular each day.  This week has been strange- and yes I know that it is only Monday-but I am going on a week here at my parent's house.   I have read a bunch--mostly Harry Potter at the moment-I have forgotten how many times I have read those books by now.  And I just finished another one, so I am trying to decide what to do now.    My family and I went up to Spanish Fork today and saw the movie Signs--it was pretty good-with a twist. Tommorrow is Jimmy's appointment with the therapist and my parent's want me to go in and talk to the guy before the session.  I think they think that is will help the therapist understand Jimmy better if he meets the eluvise older sister.     There are odd little things that I have to do before I go back to real life but I am spacing them out along the week so that I will have something to do each day.  How do housewives do this everyday?  TV is boring-but we did get the Cartoon Network finally-but that even gets boring after a while.  The laundry is already done and the house is clean and it isn't time to start thinking about making meals yet.  I could spend my time writing emails to everyone that I know, but I don't have anything else to say.  The only reason why I continue to type here now is that I like the sound my keyboard makes when I type- I feel useful and productive.     I think that I will give my turtles a bath.  It is nice to share a room with them again.  Back in the dighouse in Turkey, the fan that was in the lab made this tiny squeak each time it oscillated-it sounded just like the noise that the turtles make when they are restless in their tank.  So whenever I was working I would hear that noise and think of them.  Sometimes when I look at them and talk to them-yes I talk to my pets- I half expect them to smile back at me.  Maybe I have had too much of Harry Potter and the cartoon network..."
B0IRWHX,female,25,"NO blogging for a couple days, but I think that my extremely small readership will probably not notice.  Forget what happened at work, because it has lost all relevance.  What has occupied all of my thought has been Kani, henceforth referred to as a bastard.  You might remember me mentioning that he had asked me to edit a speech of his, which was just awful, and I was hoping that with my comments that he would completely rewrite it.  No such luck, in fact yesterday he sent me another version (almost exact to the first one) and announced that he had wanted to send it out for the Fourth of July.  This open letter that he has addressing to Minister Nesreem Berwari of the new Iraqi government was awful.  And even though I wrote 3 pages of edited comments and begged him not to send it out the bastard did anyway.  If you want to read it, the address it www.kurdistan.org/Current-Updates/berwari070404.html  I hope that it makes you as sick as it made me.  My mom was even outraged by the letter and sent him an email....  this is what she said: Kani,   I have been a long admirer of you and the work that you have been doing with your American Kurdish Information Network. You have opened my eyes to issues that I had never before even considered. I enjoy most of your writings.  However, the piece that you are about to send out on the 4th of July, is NOT one of them!  Debbie had shown me the first draft and also the second, and asked my reaction. I could not in all good conscious stand by and see you degrade your self, your cause and Kurds in general with  ""An Open Letter to Nesreen M. S. Berwari"".     First of all, you sound like a love sick puppy, disappointed because Nesreen Berwari did not fit your vision of a perfect ""Kurdish"" woman.  Heaven forbid that an aide would walk her out to her seat, be gentleman enough to carry her presentation and help her into her seat. She is a woman, hence female.  She is from Iraq, hence an Iraqi.  She is Kurdish by heritage, but forgive me, as much as one would like there to be a country that Kurds could call there own, there is NO Kurdistan the country.  I fail to see the problem with her not considering herself a Kurd first before anything else.  From what little I know of her, she has done much to help women and children, both those who are Arab and Kurdish as well.  She is a political figure, who is walking a tight line in this changing current political climate.  She is well educated and well thought of.  She is making a difference in peoples lives. While you may have been disappointed in the way that she entered the room at the International Conference at the American University on Iraq, the problem is yours, not hers.       You also make other references in your  writing which are troublesome.  You consider yourself a ""junkie of political news relative to the Kurds"", how DEGRADING is that!  Yes you may know much about a lot of issues that most Kurds don't, but as The Director of the American Kurdish Information Network, you should!  By making such a comment, you degrade no only yourself, but all the issues and causes that you have worked on in the past and will to do in the future. You make a fool of anyone who has worked with you, supported you emotionally or financially. I hope that you are better than that! You make references to Kurds being ""slaves"", your sarcastic remarks about Minister Berwari's meeting with President Bush,  references to American History, ""the milestones of human liberty"" and Saddam Hussein.  While I don't agree with a lot of thing that President Bush does, he too walks that tight political rope.  Peoples of all nations and nationalities have been considered slaves, not just Kurds.  Read and think about American History in all it's glory and splendor and times better forgotten.  While we, as a nation, have done much good in certain areas, much bad has been done also. No one is perfect by any means.  Liberty has it's costs as well as it's milestones. And while not everyone is interested in American History and the history of the area they currently live in, don't put them down because they like to go ""shopping"".  Much can be learned about people by watching how and what they buy.  I find your comments about Saddam Hussein were not appropriate either.   One of the most disturbing references is when you talk about your sister as a ""retard"".  According to The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, retard means to ""delay the progress in"".  Your sister was not retarded because she could not tell time, she was never given the opportunity to learn!  A BIG DIFFERENCE!  Many women, no, most women in third world countries, are not given the opportunity of an education.  And by who?  Men!  Men are the only ones that need an education, the only ones with the authority and a voice to make a difference, right?  WRONG!!!  Who educates the children, men?  NO, women do!  Society, while trying to keep their traditions, must change it's backward and old world thinking and come into the twenty-first century if things will truly change.  If more women were given the opportunity of an education, I dare say that this world might be a better place for all to live in.  It would definitely have a different outlook on things.  While you have your issues with Nesreen Berwari, she is at least trying to make a difference.   Kani, sometimes people are so close to a subject that their vision gets cloudy and they have a hard time seeing the total picture.  I know you live and breathe your work. Maybe it's time to take a break.  Rethink how you could help more people on a larger scale.  Go back to school for your Masters. May be then, you would be able to look at things in a slightly different light and be able to help more Kurdish people achieve the liberty, freedom and hope for a new future that they are desperately trying to achieve.   Sincerely Yours,   But when I read the version that he sent out even after I had begged him not to, I am not sure that I can describe how I felt, like all of the help that I had given him meant nothing.  It was awful watching him ang himself with his own words.  I sent him an emai afterwards, I said a lot of mean things, but I felt that he had proven all of them to be true.  He made a mockery of all of his hard work.  This was the email that I sent to him after he sent out his ""open letter' to the public...  How can you look in the mirror every morning?  Do you realize that by witnessing ONE SIMPLE act you have accused Minister Berwari of being like SADAAM HUSSEIN?  A man who oppressed, tortured, and murdered your Kurdish brothers and sisters in Southern Kurdistan for over 30 years?  Shame on you, Kani.  By allowing M. Berwari to have her assistant hold out her chair for her (gentlemen-like behavior) you have equated her to the murderer of 5000 hapless souls in Halapja.  Forget about honoring the memory of your fellow patriots as you like to call them, you have disgraced them by making such an extreme and erroneous comparison.     I know full well that the Kurds have gotten the shaft over the centuries.  They have been oppressed, misused, murdered and misunderstood.  The public cares nothing for them, this is where you step in.  I understood your life's work to be furthering the cause of your Kurdish brethren.  I have watched you for years work yourself to death in this most noble of causes.  But today, with your letter, you have destroyed everything that you have worked so hard for.  It makes me sick to my stomach and it breaks my heart.     I thought that with the release of Leyla Zana, that things for the Kurds were ""looking up"".  I guess that I was wrong.  Instead of capitalizing on that good fortune, and capitalizing on the increased Kurdish influence in the new Iraq, you criticized everyone who is trying to do a bit of good in such an extreme way that you have become heartless and cruel.  You have proven yourself to be a child unable to deal with his own frustrations in this world.     So tell me Kani, what good have you done for the Kurds lately?  Have you been coordinating with various Outreach groups across the country?  Or have you been waiting for them to come to you?  Have you been writing grants to that you can expand your programs?  Or grants so that you get help in that office?  You cannot keep running this one man show forever, especially now as you are obviously showing signs of major burnout.  That helps no one.     And while I am on the subject of money, let me digress a bit to your treatment of women.  Let's forgo the comments that I have already made in defense of Minister Berwari.  How about your sister?  Yes, she is not retarded (an odious word) and she is a victim to the system that she was brought up in.  Yet she and her peers are bringing up the next generation of Kurdistan, if nothing is done for them now, what hope is there for the future?  Have you already forgotten the lessons that Leyla Zana and M. Berwari have taught us about the power of education for women? Try to do something for your sisters, do something not just complain.  You came to America because you saw the opportunity to affect change, so do it.  Women, that is where the ""big bucks"" are, that is where you can get the general public and their pocketbooks involved.     I have always been willing to help you, all you have ever needed to do was ask.  And I am sure, given a little time to calm down, that will always stay the case.  But I can no longer stand by, and adore you absolutely, when you need someone to buckle down and tell you when you have done something wrong.  This email has hurt, deeply, to me and maybe to you.  But your open letter was wrong in every sense.  Your logic has reduced you to the level of the very people you hate.  Right now, you are dead in the water, you need to change (and fast) or pack it all up. Yours,   I had bad dreams all night.  Kani was a tryant and threw me out of my own house in the rain.  When I began to dance outside in that rain, he came out, even more angry with me than before.  And I was banished from my own home.  I have felt hollow all day.  Last night I cried so much, I don't really feel like I am here.  My mom and I watched a movie called Ali Zaoua about Morrocan Street children, I cried more than I probably should have.  It was still a really good movie.  We tried to sent up the tent that we bought for the next time we go out to the rocket show it was pretty cool, but putting it up and taking it down was probably really funny to watch as everyone was griping at each other.  It wasn't bad too bad, normal for us, but dang Jimmy takes everything personally and has been pouting all day.  SO I must go and help my mom, we are getting ready to bar-b-q."

The fam is down for the weekend and we went to the aqaurium (which I believed to have been finished-but it is only a ""preview"" at the moment) and the plantarium (which is where we took the pictures from below).  It is very rare to get pictures of my mom, so you should feel extra extra special that you got to see her. My dad and I both agree that it is an excellent picture of her and we plan on using it in any way that we can.  I also got a photo printer, which is quite nice. However stupid salesman man really doesn't know his stuff.  He told me that there would be paper with it, and there wasn't.  Good thing that I bought extra.  And the type that I bought was for postcards, so we are going to send the extended fam the postcard/picture things.  Grandparents will just love it! Well I should go, Mom's up and the bathroom is free.  Jimmy wants to get more hermies today, but I think that Mom is just going to kill him if he brings up the subject anymore. Later"
B0IRWHX,female,25,"So last night I finished Justine by the Marque De Sade, and even though I have been reading it for over a week or so, last night was the first night that I had a dream that stemmed from the book.  I dreamed that my Dad was mad at my Mom for the debt he had accrued from some finacial scheme he had undertaken.  To get back at her he allowed the people he owed money to, to come and rape her. He wouldn't tell me how much he sold her out for, and I suspected that he did it for free.  I  was so angry with him, because he had no sympathy for her, and said that it was  all her fault to begin and that she was being justly punished.  It was a very disturbing dream, espeically because my father was so angry in the dream, and I had never ever seen him so cruel.  Stupid De Sade.  Anyway Justine is an interesting book, and if you have a strong constitution I would recommend it.  But be warned it is highly pornographic, coupled with a lot philosophy.  Justine is an orphan who is highly religious and very protective of her ""virtue"", but her naivite makes her a very easy target and she seems to constantly finding herself to be a  sex-slave for every weirdo imaginable in France.  I know that you are supposed to  have compassion for her character in the book, but by the end, I just wanted to slap her upside the head, and I was glad that she died at the end.  Thinning of the herd and all that. I am going to read more of De Sade's stuff because it is quite interesting, but I am going to read a light novel next and then go back to it.  The dream was very disturbing so I need to cleanse the palate a bit. So today is Tuesday, of the work that I need to finish for today it will take me  less than 15 minutes.  It is just barely 9am, and I have already read all the newspapers.  And today I am finally getting my root canal, yeah.  I know that sounds strange, but I have been waiting for over a month for it.  And I have finally gathered enough funds-without my parent's help-but they gave me money for it anyway just in case--They are so good to me.  So that's it for now. Later"

B0IRWHX,female,25,"No fumes today, ahumduallah! Mom was in town for a meeting yesterday and so Jimmy was at the office with me most of the day, I love him, but damn he is annoying. Mom gave money for food, so I had fast food with Jimmy and then after work we went out to eat again to IHOP, man I came home and all I wanted was an apple, but I was still nauseuos from the fumes at work and didn't eat it.  Since I was with my Mom I missed the workout group.  So I thought, what the hell, let's do an exercise tape.  I did Tae-bo, for the first time, it was fun and I was kind of proud that I almost made it through the whole tape.  I had to do a lot of walking because I couldn't do more than one set of kicks with my knees.  I am sore today but I feel good.  I am only going to put myself thru that hell once a week.  Hakan came back today and was really really mad at JB because his travel checks weren't all ready and those that were, were screwed up somehow.  It was really hard not to laugh as I watched her trying to cover her butt.  She really doesn't know what she is doing I think. Hakan stated his frustration with the bureacrucy at being ""stuck between Bush and Debra"" hee hee hee Roberta is back today as well.  I really missed her.  She spoke to me a little in Turkish but I just couldn't form any decent sentences today--I really have to work on my stuff or I am going to completely lose all that I have worked so hard for.  I told her about how I was kind of bored and that I had spent 3 days scanning in text for prof. Sluglett.  She said that I was really nice for doing that especially because it isn't part of my job.  And you know, it isn't.  A lot of the stuff that I do everyday really isn't part of my job.  I find it very difficult having a job that does not require you to think.  So I am going to make a list of things to do when I am bored, which unforuately means that all I am doing lately is stuff to do when I am bored. What lovely fun my life is. I am purposely going to do nothing at all until 5 today.  Just sit. I have some new pictures to put up, maybe I will get to that tonight."

B0IRWHX,female,25,"Well I actually did something this weekend.  I know, I know, you are all wondering how I manage to have a sicial life, but yes it is possible.  Friday night I went with Stephanie and Ryan to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show, they weren't very in to it though, so I kind of felt stupid for doing the Time Warp with as much vigour as I did but oh well.  They also won't let you bring in your own props anymore, you have to buy them.  It wasn't too expensive, but packing your own stuff has always been a kind of hightlight. Then Sat. night I went to Halloween party given by the secretary of the History dept.  She was concerned that I wouldn't come if Bradley was going to be there, but the idea didn't bother me at all, heck, I lived with the guy for 3 weeks without him talking to me civilly, a couple hours at a party would be nothing.  The party was nice though, I didn't talk about school or work the whole evening so it was kind of relaxing. So, I am still enjoying the wonders of the DSL line, the new thing in music downloading.  A friend told me about this free site and that has been my fasination most of the week."

Funnyboy88: i didn't get raped on my walk home! knivess out: haha dude you're lucky!! knivess out: my walk back home was not so fortunate knivess out: but i kinda... enjoyed it  So after another shitty night of work on Friday, and I went down the shore with la familia on Saturday for a fun-filled weekend filled with fun!  Lots of beachage.  Chillage with the cousins.  Hot dogage.  Sun-burnage.    On the 4th, we had our annual US jello dessert, its a jello mold of the all the states.  However, in its making, it got messed up, with half of the country mushed up and destroyed. ""This is what will happen if Bush is reelected"" - me.  my sister: ""Global warming!""    Then that night on the boardwalk, with the fireworks, I met up with Shannon.  We walked around the boardwalk and went on the amazing sea dragon ride (my 2nd time that night, first with the cousins).  I love that ride.  Then after more walking, we FINALLY got in contact with Marc and found him.  More walkage.  It was so sad.  Marc and I, standing next to each other, tried calling each other's phones, but it wouldn't work.  We both had full service, used the area code, and everything.  So ghetto.    Then I walked home by myself (hence the rape joke above), hit the sack.  Then hitting my balls got boring and I went to bed.

09O854L,male,17,"Thursday - I watched Wrongfully Accused, a Leslie Nielsen movie from 1998. I remembered it being hilarious. But I was really tired when I watched it, so it didn't seem as good. Maybe its not as good. Probably a combination of both.     Friday night - worked.  blah blah blah    Saturday - to the shore we went! The ride took about 2 hours. I drove since my sis lacked her license. After you spend a while going 60 mph and above, and then you have to go back down to 10-25 mph cause of traffic, the car acts weird. Sometimes when it shifts gears, theres this loud boom found and feeling from the bottom of the car. It's like the car wants to go 60 and not 15. But it provided some entertainment during the traffic. we saw a father and son peeing on the side of the road. we rolled down the windows and yelled, ""YOU'RE PEEING"", just in case they didn't know.     After a day on the beach and dominos for dinner, I met up with Marc on the boardwalk. It was mighty fun. We played skeeball and tore the place apart. If you got a score of 260, you got a free game. Marc really sucked, but after I taught him my technique, he kicked ass too, and we racked up a bunch of free games between the 2 of us. What a thing to brag about, eh? We also played some air hockey (a dollar per game, WTF). I think we played two games, and we each won one. Next, we went to the Air Circus toy store and played with about every toy in the store. There was this creepy girl who kept trying to play with us. She would pick up one of those jacob's ladder toys and play with it as if it took skill.     Then at the counter they had these amazing prank things that shock you. They had a shock pen, measuring tape, and cigarrette box. Marc tried out the measuring tape one and he dropped it and screamed from the shock. Quite funny. The pen and the cigarrette weren't as strong though, but still great. The pens were 8.99 or two for 12, we did the 2 for 12 deal and each got one. So if you wanna borrow a pen from me or marc this coming school year, WATCH OUT. I already got a couple people with it at work. We had soo much fun with the pens on the boardwalk. Haha. Probably too much fun. The shock is strong enough to travel through metal, so we came up with the genius idea of shocking the metal railing of the boardwalk and seeing everyone leaning on it get shocked. We were sooo scared to try it out. We fantasized over the idea of the entire board walk railing shocking everyone, with people sitting on it falling off backwards and such. So we finally tried it, only to learn that the shock isn't strong enough to travel that far. :(     Then sunday it was work. blah blah. This girl I was kinda eying (kinda, as in I was still trying to get to know her), I learned she smokes. It may not seem like a big deal, but I dunno, smoking says a lot about a person. It's a pretty dumb and dirty habit. I got off work at 4. It was amazing not having to be there for closing, which entails tons of cleaning. I spent the rest of the night watching I love the 90's. GREAT show. Michael Ian Black is god. Hal Sparks rules too. A lot of daily show people are on that show. Mo Rocca, those 2 blonde hair women who comment a lot, and this other dude who used to be on it back when Craig Kilbourne hosted.     Marc and Mari introduced me to Isketch.  You basically play pictionary online.  Its sooooo fun and sooo frustrating when you can't get it.  Play it sometime.     Question of the day. and please comment your answer.  WOULD YOU EAT MY SHIT FOR A BILLION DOLLARS?  Marc: Yes.  But you must add sweet and low first.    Jess: You'd be insane not to."
09O854L,male,17,"For the summers of 2001, 2002, and 2003, I attended Camp Walnut at the Walnut Street Theater in Philly.  At the end of every summer, we'd put on a play.  My first year, I was in the development group, and the other 2 years, I was in the Theater Performance division, which puts on a show that does not involve singing.  Camp Walnut helped me grow so much as an actor.  Before Walnut, I had potential I never knew about.  It opened doors for me.  In the fall of 2001, I was casted in the lead cast of the school's fall play.  Coincidence?  I think not.    I've also built good friendships there.  I still talk to a few of the campers I met back in 2001.  Well this year, sadly, I opted for having money (aka working at casellas) over attending camp walnut.  It was a tough decision, but I need money and work experience.  I decided it would be fun to drop in one day and say hello and such.  Today was that day.  It was soooo nice.  I got there at 1:00, knowing the campers were at lunch, so I decided to walk towards Wawa, the main place of foodage for the walnutters.  Across the street was Austin, my fellow improv champion, whom I shouted for his attention.  He had the biggest ""wtf"" look ever haha.  From there, I met up with all the other campers, reunited at last.  It was so awesome seeing them all again.  Sam, austin, kristen, anne, jon, tom, gretchen, sara, macrena, jamie, will, frank, and everyone else.  It was like I hadn't missed a thing.  After they ate lunch, I went with the group where they were set to do warm ups and rehearse.  We did freeze improv, and it was sooo funny.  Good times had by all.  Many a good chuckle.  I even got to revive my role as Prince Tartaglia (the character I played last summer) for a brief nostalgic moment in one scene.  From there I watched them rehearse the show they are doing, ""Taming of the Shrew"".  I did that show in the fall of 2002.  I was Lucentio, and coincidentally, Austin is Lucentio for their version.  It was so weird watching them do that show, because all the lines were coming back to me, and I was comparing all the blocking compared to how we did it.    You know on SNL when the former cast members come back for a special cameo or host?  It felt exactly like that.  Like I was the ""special guest"" haha.  It'd be really funny if I could do a quick walk on role during the show.

We all agreed it was seriously one of the funniest nights of our lives.  I seriously never came closer to pissing all over myself.    We ordered cheesesteaks from my local pizza place.  There had to be something in those.  We were literally high on life.    After dinner, we did something that I cannot reveal...yet.  But it is a comedy classic.

Soon after the call, I went online, only to learn that Jess somehow got convinced into driving her sister to OC the next day too, and she will meet up with us. Suddenly, Mari joins in, and getting a ride from me, the group was assembled!    You know when they make movie sequels with missing cast members (kinda like my urlLink  matrix rehashed ) ? It was kinda like that. No norm, bryan, shannon, or andy. They wanted more money to appear in the sequel, heh. However, we lacked the ""new guy"" that shows up in the sequels, but thats cool.    I had a blast. We hit the beach immediately and it was soooo nice. It was a little on the too hot side, but the water was sooooooo nice. I could've died happy then in the water. It was super super warm. It didn't even take a second to get used to the temperature. No jelly fish, no seawood, lots of piss, ah so beautiful. Jess actually fell for the ""deep spot"" trick in the water. You know, when you get on your knees in the shallow and go ""omg, theres a deep spot here!"" Yeah.     We grabbed some food on the boardwalk, went back to marcs, changed into our civilian clothes. Then we watched Dr. Phil. What a funny show. Well, its not supposed to be funny, but it was cracking me and Mike up, as everyone else watched in seriousness as issues were conquered and uncovered! Then we got sucked into part of the evening news, and after a sad story about this little girl that was shot in the city, it was like ""WEEEE, LETS GO ON THE BOARDWALK!!""     We had planned to go on some rides, but by the time we got there, my mom called me, informing me of when I needed to get home, so we didn't really have time to go on the rides, so after ice cream, it was back to marc's house, which is a long walk. And mari and I were off back to home. Mike, jess, and marc stayed, planning to leave 10ish.     And now I'm here...    work tomorrow.      back to the grind.    I'll try to get some pics of the event from Mari.      Oh yes, how could I forget.  There was one phrase we said 5 million times.  ""NOW!"" - arnold, in terminator 2.

09O854L,male,17,"Ok, so now that you are wondering ""what the mother fuck?""    Dear friend Andy Keith has mono. And all he does is lay like a blob in bed, by himself. So, Mike and I decided to pull off a covert operation. Using white trash bags, we cut up these wicked costumes to make ourselves look like we are from the Centers for Disease Control. The day before we went shopping for gas masks.     The Berlin Mart had real gas masks for 43 dollars. Nope. Raul's army and navy shop also had expensive real ones. Party City didn't have any toy gas masks. So we were really depressed. But, as I pulled up to my house, I see Louis Kang's dad mowing his lawn, wearing a perfect mask! I asked him if he had any extra, and he gave me some. One of the most amazing coincidences ever. He could've picked another day to mow his lawn, or even another time.     So in full gear, we headed over to the Keith house, went right in, ran up the stairs yelling ""MOVE MOVE MOVE"", and burst into Andy's room.  Andy looked really out of it and confused until he realized it was me and brower.  He was still pretty dead though.  So after running around the room with the vacuum, pretending to pick evidence and look at the ""readings"" on the vacuum, and zapping down andy and his family, we sat by his bed and talked to him.   It felt nice to visit him and make his day brighter some how.  After, I kinda joked with Mike, ""I wonder if he even realized who he was talking to.""  His voice sounded pretty funny too.  We wanted to record it but oh well.    The day before I went to lunch with shannon and brower at the Palace Diner.  I enjoyed the meal, but it was so pathetic.  It took the three of us a good 20 minutes to figure out who owed what for the bill.  We kept moving money back and forth, exchanging, passing, switching, making a tip pile, taking from that pile, AH IT WAS HORRIBLE.  And we are smart ap/honors class students too.  The table next to us found it entertaining.  It was kinda weird when espn, which was playing in the diner, started showing 9-11 footage.  It was all ""hey we are friends laughing together"" and then the tv starts showing the creepy 9-11 footage of the planes going into the WTC and people running and crying....it just felt odd and inappropriate heh.    so yeah."

Everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong.  Every single order, there was either some confusion or mistake, or the customer was being a pain, etc.  I was so frustrated.  I'm a really easy going guy, but I have never been thaaaat pissed in a long long time.    Today, Sat, I worked the same shift and it was so much better.  Everything ran smoothly, I wasn't stressed.  I was a happy camper.  Still only 2 deliveries though so I only got like 5 bucks on tips along with the usual 5.50 an hour.    Tomorrow through Thursday, I am gonna be on a family trip to Massachusetts. Hopefully it will be fun.  We always end up having amazing food on our family trips.  Bloation from eating way too much.  I invented that word and my dad, a stomach doctor, says he's adopted it into his practice.  Maybe a boring museum or two.  Lots of head-phonage in the car.  Got my 20 gig Rio Karma all set to go.    So, don't miss me too much.  I shall be back.    Thursday was the last day of school, and we had our English final.  I got an 86, and a 94 on my final essay, which is truly amazing for me in ap eng.  I still got an 88 for the year, and an 88 in ap government, but I got all A's for the rest my classes.  Awesomeness."

I wear my commute jacket this morning stock up my helmet and gloves and go down only to find out that all that exists is a braided steel pad-lock professionally cut and sliced. No trace of the motorcycle exists anymore :( They took everything :( cover included. Mofos :(   And this when I had just started getting really excited about motorcycling. Had even signed up for the Keigwins@track 2 day novice school happening this thurs and fri :( Had to cancel all that. I have had motorcycles for three years now and I finally caved in and over the weekend bought the tank magnetic bag etc from Road Riders....   I should have wisened when they tried to break the lock of the R6 on two occasions at Elan, and moved into a place with a garage. Instead I go from the pan to the fire.

On the bright side tough, does this mean it is time to upgrade? :))   Philosophically, will we ever be able to establish a classless society as portrayed in one of my fravorite series ""Star Trek""? Will we ever be able to establish a soceity based purely on job functions. A utopian world with plenty of everything for everybody?

1RFEQHW,female,26,"I'm not a ""morning person."" And when I say ""morning, "" I'm talking around... um... let's say 7' ish so imagine waking up at 2:15 a.m. !?!?!?!             Well, here I am.              In one hour I am leaving for the airport with Austin (who luckily is still sound asleep!) to fly back to Alabama. I won't be writing while I am gone so please forgive me. Read a book, a newspaper, or something else in my absence.             Continue praying for my mom (and my dad!). My dad's health is very poor and my mom is still dealing with this ""colon"" issue. We won't know a whole lot else about her condition until they go in to her colon sometime this week.              I will be there to help take care of them both and am leaving behind my husband and Jacob.              Pray for my flight if you are reading this today. It's going to be a loooooong day for me and Austin.              I will update you as soon as I return."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"Today will be eventful. It is Austin's last day of school for the year. He is already in ""mourning."" He says, "" No school?"" and then puts his face into his hands and cries. I think he will be a wonderful soap opera star one day. :)      My days will be quite different having both the kiddos home through the summer. This may very well be the time that I need medication for sedation, or better yet, that my children need medication for sedation. Is that illegal? ha.         We woke up to beautiful sunshine and blue skies today. I think Benji was beginning to wonder if the sun did shine on this side of the U.S. It's supposed to warm up to about 78 today and then hit over 80 the rest of the week. Ben is freezing while the rest of us are melting!    Josh just took Ben with him to a lunch for pastor's in the area. All the local pastor's from all denominations get together once a month for prayer, encouragement, and a meal. It's as it should be. They leave their differences at the door and come together to share what they all have in common... a love for God and a desire to see the lost saved. I hope Ben leaves as encouraged as Josh does each time.    Tonight I will be at a dinner for all of our Pastor's wives from church as a farewell to our senior pator's wife, Jodi. Their last day at our church is next week and I think I am still in denial. Jodi has been my mentor and my ""spiritual mother"" for these past 3 and a half years. I've never known a person who displays Christ consistently in their life like Jodi does. Saying goodbye to her is going to be sooooo hard. She will still be my mentor, only from a distance, but I will forever cherish all the numerous ways she invested into my life and my own ministry.     She has taught me the principle of sowing and reaping. She has lived her life sowing into the things of God... loving people, praying for people, discipling people, sacrificing FOR people, and giving to people in so many ways. I honestly don't think I know anyone who is more giving. She is the ""gift givingest"" (is that a word? hee) person I have ever known. She gives tangibly and spiritually.     I have seen up close and personal what it means to ""minister."" It's not about standing up in a pulpit and preaching. It's not about being called ""Pastor"" or being recognized. It's not about how large (or small) your church is.. it really is about the tears you cry over other's burdens, the sleepless nights praying for other's, the hospital visits at 1 a.m., sitting with someone as they weep at the altar, forgiving someone that has hurt you so deeply when all you have done is love and given.     Jesus summed it up best ( He has a way of doing that!), "" I did not come to be served but I came to serve.""     So if you desire to be important, to matter, to be a leader.. than you must be willing to be a servant first and foremost.     Jesus displayed it when He came to lowly earth, lived as a human man for 33 years although He was God. Dying the death of a criminal for sinful man (for me!).   Jodi has displayed it as well. I long to be that kind of leader and minister.     So when I grow up, I want to be just like Jesus and Jodi! :)"
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I can't believe I have actually managed to make it on here to write in this blog thingy today.    I was up laaate last night with our youth pastor, Tyrone, and his wife, Amy. I have been sucked in by peer pressure and influenced into watching the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies by my husband and our dear friends.   I thought I was strong enough to resist but the honest truth is, I really am weak.    Okay, well the HONEST truth is, I told my husband I would watch these movies if he would allow me to get snacks, so I was prompted by food. We had peanut m & M's, twizzlers, crackers with cheese, chips and salsa, and peanuts. A very nutritious snack night.    I actually liked it (we only watched the first one). I was thoroughly and completely lost the first 2 and a half hours but by the last 45 minutes I was catching on. Apparently there is a master ring that controls things, bad folks are after it so the good folks are running. Very intense premise. ha ha!   I went to bed at 1 a.m. wondering how in the world this movie will end. Then of course, I had dreams all night about elves and such... for some reason I was on the ""bad team."" Wonder what that means????    Anyway, I woke up and have been cleaning my house upside and down ever since. The toilet is clean, the tub has been scrubbed, the floors have been swept, mopped, and vacuumed. THe dishes and laundry are done (minus the ones we are wearing right now).     What event has required all this work from this poor Cinderella? Ben arrives in a few hours (as if an 18 year old boy cares about how clean a house is!), and tomorrow night we are having a big barbecue for people at church.     So I did all the cleaning so that as soon as everyone leaves tomorrow night, I can do it all over again.    *sigh* The work of a woman is never done. ha!   There is my day... give and take breaking up a few fights between my kids (which just so happen to be upstairs right now wreacking havoc and killing one another).   I better go and assess the damages.   Have a good weekend!"
1RFEQHW,female,26,"About 6 weeks ago, while I was praying, the Lord told me that I was about to go through some difficult and painful times. God is definitely not a liar but I am so thankful that He loves me enough to prepare me.      I think I am going through the storm of my life right now but regardless, I know God will see us through this.     One thing I have learned about storms (growing up in the Southeast teaches a lot about storms), is that although they are dark, scarey, and can seem overwhelming... they will pass.        God has continually given me these verses in Isaiah:     "" Fear not, for I have redeemed you, I have summoned you by name, you are mine. When you walk through the water I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you, when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. The flames will not set you ablaze. For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Isreal, your Savior.""        If you pray with a sincere heart that God will grow you and give you a deeper love for Him, don't be surprised when trials, hardships, and suffering come your way. Because this is how I will grow and this is what will cause me to grow deeper in my love for God. And it's worth it.        I heard this a while back and this has become my life's purpose statement:      "" To obey is my objective... to suffer is to be expected. His Glory is my reward."""
1RFEQHW,female,26,"So in light of my recent ""blah's"" experience, I have decided to laugh as much as possible today.      The best way to do that is to watch stupid movies that are absolutely ridiculous but still make you laugh hysterically, read dumb jokes, or better yet, watch someone else fall trip and then watch them pretend like they didn't.  For some reason, I think that one of the funniest things ever in life is when people trip or fall down. Is it mean? probably, but nonetheless, I am always amused by it.     Today at church I watched someone trip, look around to make sure nobody saw (not realizing I did), and then walk on as if it never happened. I laughed for about 10 minutes.      I also caught the tail end of one of the stupidest movies, "" Zoolander.""      My favorite line (now thanks to my cousin Ben) is: "" Do you ever wonder if there is more to life than just being really, really, really, really good looking?""      Such deep thoughts.      Then, of course, always reading Jack Handy's deep thoughts make me bust a gutt.      Here are a few of my all time favorites:     "" It takes a big man to cry.... it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man. ""      "" Before you judge someone... walk a mile in their shoes. Then you'll be a mile away from them, AND you'll have their shoes.""       "" Consider the daffodil, and I'll be over here looking through your things.""       "" The face of a child can say a lot.... especially the mouth part.""       Okay, have you had enough? Quite possibly you have to be blonde and from Alabama to enjoy these thoroughly.. I'm not sure.       But either way. Today God gave me many laughs just when I need them. He has to be a humorous God. Look at some of His creatures (especially a few that I'm related to-ha).       Laughing has been good for my soul today!      stay tuned for tomorrow's weekly highlights if you dare!"
1RFEQHW,female,26,"We are preparing for the big 4th of July celebration we are having here tomorrow evening. We will have lots of food, lots of family, lots of games, and lots of fun. We always look forward to it every year. And God is being especially nice to us this year as we have a CLEAR forcast.. No rain and about 80 degrees. Perfect!     We have so much to be grateful for and so much to celebrate for living in this country. There are times when I think my life is tough and I have it rough until I see these little children in Mexico (our church is there on a Mission trip) who literally eat dirt and garbage. Oh God, forgive me and help me to always have a thankful, grateful heart. You have blessed us with so much here in this country. Help us to appreciate it and appreciate you.      This has been a challenging week for me but nonetheless, God is so good. The words of this song really spoke to me this week:    "" Blessed be your name, in the land that is plentiful, where your streams of abundance flow, blessed be your name.    Blessed be your name, when I'm found in the desert place, though I walk through this wilderness, blessed be your name.    Blessed be your name when the sun is shining down on me, when the world is all as it should be.. blessed be your name,     Blessed be your name, in the road marked with suffering, though there's pain in the offering, blessed be your name.""     So my prayer in life is that when I have little or a lot, when life is wonderful or miserable, I will never fail to bless the name of the Lord.     He is just as worthy to be praised in the desert as he is on the mountain top.     God's goodness doesn't depend on my circumstances. God is always good. I am grasping that truth quite possibly for the first time in my life lately. THAT my circumstances and situations in life do not change the core of God's being.     Hopefully, the circumstances and situations will change ME- I'm the one that needs changing.     Anyway, everyone have a wonderful 4th of July and praise God that we live in a country that allows us the freedom to praise and worship God."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"I had to share my news about my mom. Her procedure was Tuesday and she is going to be fine. Apparently, she just had an infection in her colon from diverticulitis. They will be treating her for that but she is on the mend and doing great. Thank you for your prayers!     We've had a beautiful week here in the Pacific Northwest with awesome weather. It's been warm but not miserable. We've been swimming a lot this week and will likely be back in the pool this afternoon.     I'm having lunch with a friend from church today. It's a neat little restaurant with a ""country"" feel. The best part is there will be no children there- I can eat in peace. Imagine?! ha!     I haven't been sleeping too well the past few nights. Between a certain 4 year old crying out in his sleep and our motion light in the backyard going off, it's hard to sleep. Are you feeling sorry for me yet?     Austin has a dentist appointment tomorrow. He's always done fine at the dentist so hopefully he will continue in that tradition. He starts back to school in 4 weeks- I think he's ready to go back and have his routine again. He starts at a different school this year so I am praying he transitions well.     We have started the official birthday countdown for Jacob. Typically 2 months before his birthday every year, he begins asking how many days are left. He starts to plan what kind of cake he wants, what friend's he wants to attend, and what toys' he needs to increase his happiness. I don't know that I've ever seen a kid more excited to celebrate their birth. ha! He did ask me the big question a few weeks back. He said, "" Mom, how did I get into your tummy when I was a baby?"" So I did what any good mother would do. I said, "" just one minute"", grabbed the phone, called his dad at work and said, "" Josh... Jacob has a question for you."" tee hee. Apparently Josh satisfied Jacob's inquisitiveness by explaining that "" God put you there.""  So I suppose that's enough said! *wipes forehead*      This weekend is the yearly Bethel Open. Josh will be playing in a golf tournament. He's looking forward to it. I don't know why. I tried the whole ""golf"" thing once. It's a lot harder to hit that tiny ball than it looks. I decided I didn't like golf after that experience.  My husband's hobbies just make no sense to me. It's either him hitting something (like golf) or him being hit (like paintball). Shopping makes so much more sense. :)      Well, I need to hop in the shower before my lunch date. I hope you all have a wonderful Thursday and weekend!"
1RFEQHW,female,26,"At the demand of my Aunt Beth, I decided to write in here today. ha ha! I have to give her something to read while she's at work. *snicker*    Yesterday was Father's Day and we had a nice day. I called my dad and talked to him briefly. He opened up his gifts while I sat on the phone with him. Times like that make me miss being so close to my family!   It was nice and sunny (and HOT, 90 plus degrees). We had a good church service yesterday. We had students from Northwest College come witht their band to lead our worship. They rocked the house. Ben looked at me and said, "" wow, I wish we had a cool church like this in Alabama."" It made me smile and feel grateful to be a part of such a wonderful church!    We went and spent the day at Josh's grandparents' with all of his family. We had lunch- at which Ben commented on how different (actually he said WEIRD, ha) our food is up here. We make lots of salads here, in the south ""salad"" means a green salad with lettuce. Up here salad can be anything.. pasta salad, fruit salad, bean salad, etc.. We ate a full meal and then had a big water fight outside. There were water balloons, water guns, and some people got down right dirty (AHEM.. JOSH!) and pulled out a hose. The nerve of some people!    Jacob threw a water balloon at me but it failed to pop, so I threw it back at him and he cried out, "" Your my mommy, I can't believe you did that to me on purpose!"" He was heart broken that a mother could do such a thing. I figured I was teaching him a good lesson about life.. you can't trust anybody. ha!    Later on we came back home, called our Pop to wish him a Happy Father's day and then went over to the in laws to eat ice cream. They had 5 different flavors ( to which Ben had all of them-ha), and then sat outside as the boys' jumped around in their little pool with all their clothes (and shoes on). We sat back and laughed and watched. I figured it was something they would always remember... the day mommy and daddy let us swim in full body clothing and tennis shoes. Their shoes are still soaked!     It was a great day. I reminder of the blessings of our dad's, what they mean to us, all they've taught us.. but most of all a reminder of our true Dad, and how He always loves us and is always good to us even (and especially) through the difficult times.        Today is my husband's birthday. He turns 30 (shhh... it's a secret), we actually have to be at a church dinner tonight at the Olive Garden so we won't officially celebrate until tomorrow. If it were up to Josh, we'd just put this day off completely. ha!     I did wake up early to bake him some blueberry muffins and iron his clothes before work. He's always so good at spoiling me, I figure he deserves it on his birthday.           Well, I'll update you on Josh's big day tomorrow. I'm headed outside to sit in the sun and let the boys' swim again only this time in a bathing suit!."
1RFEQHW,female,26,"Do you ever pray so hard about something (or somethingS) and feel like God must be holding his ears or that your prayers hit the ceiling only to fall back down on the floor?    No? well, maybe I'm the only one.    This is where I honestly have been the past few days. There are a few things that I have been praying earnestly about for over a year and have yet to see ANY change (in the physical realm at least). And yet for the last three months, I have felt that God is doing SOMETHING behind the scenes to get this accomplished.. and yet I still can't tangibly see any difference.    It gets down right frustrating. And I just believe in being totally honest with God so I just told Him that. I came before a Holy God and the Creator of the Universe and told Him that I am frustrated, confused, and don't understand what He's doing.    I even told Him, "" Why do you ask us to pray when you don't seem to answer?!?"" It really wasn't so much of a question as it was a remark.    Thankfully God loves me enough to allow me to have my 3 year old temper tantrums. I might as well just throw myself in the floor and kick and scream. Actually, hold on a minute, while I try it. It might make me feel better..    Nevermind, I don't have the energy to do that AND pick myself back up.    So, I had this little ""issue"" today and hoped God would magically do something to open my eyes to see that He is answering my prayer over this issue. But nope, instead He did what He usually does.. He lovingly reminded of how faithful He has been to me and in His wisdom, brought back to memory all those prayers HE has answered.   I will share a few that He brought to mind:   1) A few Christmas's ago, we had no money for Christmas presents. I mean we were broke. I had been praying and asking God to work somehow and do something but felt pretty discouraged and assumed He was just teaching me to be content. ha! I went to the mailbox that day and received a letter. It had no return address. I opened it up and inside was a $500 money order. A note read, "" This is from the Lord."" NOW, I realize somebody had to have sent that but to this very day, we have no clue who it was and believe it came straight from God's heart.    2) Our couches were falling apart. I mean literally they were coming apart. There were strings hanging all over the place, rips, stains, etc.. We had bought them 10 years used when we married and after 2 kids and 5 more years, they were just gross. I lovingly referred to them as the ""crack house"" couches. They honestly looked like they could've come from there. ha ha.    The thought occurred to me last summer that I could PRAY for new couches. I mean, what would it hurt? So I wrote down in my journal and asked the Lord that if at all possible could he work a miracle for us and provide us with new couches.   A week later, a drunk driver ran through my in laws living room in his truck. He hit their couches but did no damage at all to them. Just because they were hit, the insurance company replaced them so my in laws gave us their couches that were only a few years old. They are nice and matched my colors perfectly. I knew it was straight from God.    3) Jacob was old enough to start preschool but we couldn't afford tuition. I never said a word to anyone about it but I did pray that God would provide a way. Jacob thrives in that type of environment and really needed that time away from mommy. A friend of mine from Alabama (now living in North Carolina) was talking with me one day and asked me if Jacob was in preschool yet. I simply said, "" No, not yet."" Then she said, "" Well we would love to pay his tuition if you want to put him in one."" Totally out of the blue. He began preschool this January and loved every minute of it. Another answered prayer straight from the heart of God.   4) This one is really awesome because it wasn't even a prayer, but more like a ""thought."" This one still boggles my mind.      I had bought some new walking pants for Christmas that I just loved. The only problem is that they were too long on the bottom. I wore them once and then put them away because I realized I was dragging them and getting them dirty. I thought, "" God I wish I knew someone that could hem these for me.""   That same week I was at church when an older woman from church, Glenda, came up to me and said (these were her exact words), "" You know, I've been thinking about you a lot lately and praying for you. For some reason I just feel like I should ask you if there is anything you have that I could hem for you."" I about fell on the ground. I told her the story and she was relieved because she was sure I would think that was a strange request.    She took my pants, hemmed them up, and they fit me perfectly now.    God didn't even need me to verbalize that one, He heard my thoughts.    "" Your heavenly Father knows what you need before you even ask.""     After thinking of all the many requests God has answered in my life, even the small ones like new couches and hemmed pants, it left me with the absolute assurance that GOD DOES HEAR ME. But most importantly, that He knows exactly what I need,when I need it, and how it needs to be done.     So maybe this waiting on Him is actually teaching me to trust in His wisdom instead of question His character.     *wipes forehead*, Man, this growing up thing is so hard! :)"

There is synchronization!! Order! A pattern!! IT'S A MIRACLE!! YES!!!  No! ...It's mathematical. They are not synchronized because they are being controlled by order, they are synchronized because there are only so many seconds in a minute & in that one minute, 180,666 drops must fall on that one little over hang. Mathematically, synchronization must happen. It would be more of a miracle if no two drops happened at the same time.  Look at yourselves as raindrops. If a million of you pray that your best friend gets well and he does, you think, ""THAT IS ALL THE PROOF I NEED! THERE IS A GOD! THAT'S THE PROOF!"" But, when you consider the fact that a million people are praying over the same situations, a sick friend, it would be more amazing if EVERYONE that was being prayed for DIED! Now, when you point out to the person of faith, incidents where the person being prayed for does die, Then the person of FAITH say's, ""It must have been God's will."" Well, here is a question. If there is a GOD, Isn't everything his will? Can his will be changed by mere mortals? Aren't prayers futile? It makes no since. I would like to see at least ONE person of riligious faith state. ""I believe in GOD, but I don't believe because it's the logical thing. I just believe & that's all there is to it. I will not enter in to an argument of reason & logic with this belief, because, it does not fare very well in such an exchange.""  You see, the Gods cannot live in the confines of the RATIONAL mind. That's why it depends on FAITH. If God could be proven by science, then FAITH is worthless. Once you accept that your belief is fueled by FAITH ALONE!!! Not human logic!!! Then you can start trying to understand what the make up of Faith is.  This is why the atheistic view will always win the rational, logical, conscious perception debate. It runs parallel to the age old Chaos V.S. .Order debates. CHAOS (Atheist) vs ORDER (Religious) Chaos (NO GOD) allows the possible existence of order & synchronization, but recognizes it as just a small fiber of Chaos & Random. An anomaly if you will. Order (GOD belief) does not allow chaos & random as a possibility. For chaos & random just appears to be chaos & random, but only if you take them out of the context of order as it’s all encompassing origin. Chaos & Random, through this perspective, are believed to be just a part of ORDER . You see? This is the proposed argument! If Order (GOD) is the origin of ""what is"", then chaos & and random are actually planned and are, there for, just tools of order & synchronization. They are not what they appear to be! They are not, in fact, chaos or random! So there is NO chaos! & there is NO random! There is only order! & that suggests a divine plan, an architect to all that is around us! A God perhaps!  That was a nice perspective but let’s get real! Check this out! If Chaos & Random (NO GOD) is our origins, then that opens the door to ALL possibilities, including, the occurrence of Order & the occurrence of Synchronization. Now, can order & synchronization exist if it's just a part of Chaos & Random? YES!! Now, Can Random & Chaos exist if it's really just a part of order & Synchronization? The answer is ....NO! Because you can't be outside of order & synchronization (GOD)! If that is the all encompassing cause. But, you can be anything if the all encompassing cause is chaos & random. Since we have no proof of origin, then it makes more since to embrace a philosophy that is open to ALL possibilities, as opposed to embracing a philosophy that closes off valid possibilities! ............................................!!!!"
2XYKSTV,male,35,"urlLink     An inauspicious beginning...     I shall start these photo-essays somewhere in the middle.  In Hannover, Germany I went to the formal gardens.  Nestled in these gardens was a Hedge-Labyrinth.  Recalling Borges and his obsession with labyrinths, I decided to pay him tribute by entering.  The above photo is a shot of the entrance... not so bad, right?      I entered and proceeded straight to the middle.  No options to turn left or right, no outlandish twists and turns, just a one-way path to the middle.  Wow.  I was a tad disappointed, so I smoked a cigarette and tried to find my way out again.  ""Try"" being the operative word.      It took me 45 minutes to get out of that damned labyrinth.  It was insane.          urlLink     The gaze of DESPAIR...   As you can see, I was a bit frazzled in the above photo.   I FINALLY got out of the thing and snapped this lovely gem of a photo:         urlLink     Relief never looked like a hedge-arch...until now.     The moral of the story... DO NOT BECOME OBSESSED WITH BORGES!  Brett, take heed!"
2XYKSTV,male,35,"I read Italo Calvino's  Invisible Cities  in Venice.  The book is short and the concept is rather abstract, so the environment I found myself in lent itself quite well to Calvino's flights of fancy.  Brett posted a  link to an essay some time ago that discussed at length the artistry of Calvino and Borges.  I read that essay eagerly and wholeheartedly agree with the author's glowing praise of the two authors.      I have heard Calvino referred to as ""the poor man's Borges"".  I think it was Anthony Burgess who called him ""Borges on a bad day"".  I find these comparisons rather harsh.  Calvino and Borges, while both writing fiction that deals with the fantastic and the abstract, have totally different styles.  Borges was more of a minimalist than  urlLink Ray Carver  and his stories dealt with concepts like time, eternity, and myth from the perspective of the interested but aloof observer.  Calvino's fictions are full of whimsy and wonder.  They have the feel of fairy tales where Borges' stories read like wonderfully erudite newspaper articles.  Perhaps that is going too far, but to suggest that Calvino was the lesser writer because he was unable to grapple with the ""Big Questions"" as authoritatively as Borges did is nonsense.     Before I get to the actual review, I would like state that Borges is certainly my favorite of the two, but this is not due to any percieved superiority of craft.  With MiloradPavic, I  assert that Borges was the best reader of the last hundred years.  A reader who happened to have the ability to succinctly and capably share his interests, much to the benefit of all readers.     Invisible Cities  is a book with only two characters.  Well, three.  The bulk of the text sees Marco Polo recounting his travels to various fantastic cities to the emperor Kublai Khan.  The emperor eagerly listens to the foreigner describe cities that are by turns appalling, wonderful, unbelieveable, and tragic.  As the book progresses, it becomes clear that Polo is in reality describing only one place.     The chapters are all quite short, and each chapter consists of Polo's recollection of a single city.  These recollections in turn fall under one of several headings, including ""Cities and Memory"", Cities and Desire"", ""Cities and Signs"", ""Thin Cities"", ""Trading Cities"", ""Cities and Death"", ""Cities and Eyes"", Cities and Names"", ""Cities and the sky"", etc. etc.   Many of these headings are repeated throughout the book, with each city described shedding new light on the theme.  Interspersed throughout are the thoughts of the Emperor, who is presiding over a dying Empire.  He debates whether Polo is humoring him with these fantastic tales or if the foreigner wishes to illustrate something more meaningful with his memories.  The reader, however, soon learns that Polo (Calvino) is trying to tell us all something.  The Khan's empire is our planet, and both appear to be dying out.    The final passage is key:  And Polo said: ""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.  There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.  The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""     A"
2XYKSTV,male,35,"Finally i wean myself from that damned computer game...   In the attempt to extract some bit of truth from the small portion of details that i've dredged up from the internet and a handful of books on secret societies, alchemy, magick, lost science, and the Great Hidden History of Humankind, i throwing up my hands in despair yet again. I've had more own blog for ages, but over the months, it's narrowed its purpose to music alone... rock-pop at that. In messing about with the origin of the Rosicrucians, one author proposed that the invention of the original Rosicrucians is akin to a proto-Situationist movement. Since the only exposure i've had to that word recently has been through obtuse comic boos, i had to look that up. Now i find that the Situationists were the sucessors to Dada and Surrealism. One Situationist, Guy Debord, published a book covered with sandpaper, so that it would damage whatever it was placed against. This immediately brought to mind some music that i only recently discovered, the first album by the Durutti Column, which did the exact same thing with an album sleeve. Oh.... back to music.   It frustrates me that i abandoned so much of the world to muck about with the recorded musical efforts of a bunch of people i've never heard of when there is supposed to be so much more that i must learn about this world. To obsess over such minutae seems foolish. However, either i naturally gravitate back to music, or there is some other holistic reason, that every idea and concept is reflected in another aspect of the human experience. Human history is too vast and too detailed ever to be comprehended by a single human mind. Is that why we constantly steal and reinvent ideas? The punks paying homage to the Situationists with their abrasive media coverings is the same damned thing to the Rosicrucians finding ways to cram their invented alchemies with references to the Kabbalah and Egyptian magick. I do believe in innovation and creation, but i do wonder exactly how much we have lost and perverted through the years.   Aw, fuck it. I don't quite know what to do with myself, not even how to struggle with how much i don't know and how to accept that."

Zurich is the most beautiful city I have visited thus far, but my own tendency to self-distruct has kicked in yet again.

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I have blessed an eager young mind with Michael Moorcock,  gratis .  I'm certainly not claiming that Moorcock is the greatest fantasy author, but I can recall that stumbling on to the Elric books led me on to much more ""valuable"" stuff.  The truth is that I'll always remember Moorcock fondly.  I devoured most of his stuff, leaving out only the Dancers at the End of Time series (which I'm told is an oversight on my part) and Gloriana (which is impossible to find).  I have decided to start using this space to review books.  I've read quite a few good books in the past few months and would like to share my impressions of them.  Be on the look out!

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I finished this book last night.  Since this was my first taste of Orhan Pamuk, I'm not sure how it stacks up to the rest of his work.  I will say that I liked the book and I do plan to reread it.    Going in, I expected a book that dealt overtly with the issues of identity, East vs West, and the slave-master relationship.  All of these issues were indeed covered, but the treatment was subtle.  Pamuk, rather than beating us over the head with his ""message"", really let the philosophizing recede into the background.  Only in the last chapter were the themes really discussed in an overt fashion.  The story is ostensibly a text composed in the early 17th century and found in the 1980s.  The narrator, a Venetian slave in Instanbul, is captured and eventually given to a Turkish philosopher who happens to look exactly like himThe two collaborate on ""projects"" for the Sultan, into whose favor Hoja, the Turkish philospher, desperately seeks to fall.  As the years pass, the two become more and more alike.  A crisis finally causes them to trade places... or do they?  A few thoughts:  - The concept of ""science"" in the book is ambiguous and is at times almost a bogeyman.  It was invoked almost as a deity at times, and I thought that the awe with which Hoja regarded ""western knowledge"" was a neat trick.  Pamuk seems to be saying that in the East, new and potentially powerful knowledge replaces ""God"" as a concept.  In the West, the argument can be made that ""God"" has become just another Cartesian category that some are concerned with and others are not.    - The relationship between the two men was odd.  They were not friends, and yet the slave-master relationship was not totally present either.  Hoja's interrogation of the Venetian (it is odd that I cannot recall his name...was it even given?) read like introspection.  When the time came for the two to ""switch"", I found myself thinking that it was unnecessary.  Maybe I was reading it too literally...  - The ""switch"" itself recalled Borges... it was not a change of identity, but Hoja took the Italian's past and the Italian (the name thing is really bothering me) took Hoja's future.  That added a dimension of uncertainty.  Was the change real?   - The final chapter was certainly the strongest of the book.  While John Updike (the windbag) writes in a blurb that Pamuk's ""intelligence and introspection suggest Proust"", I am more inclined to compare the book's themes to Borges.  But then again I was never able to slog through Proust, so John Updike might be right.  This last thought was pointless.  I recommend the book, but ""My Name Is Red"" by the same author seems like the better place to start.  Writing this review makes me think that I need to reread the book to really get a handle on it.  B+ for now..."
2XYKSTV,male,35,"A pentagram does not have to be pointed downward to be a pentagram.    I'm certain that i read that many of the references to black magick with the downward pointed pentagram is a relatively recent innovation, probably only in the 20th Century. It's probably in that Manly P. Hall book, but that's in Husser right now.   urlLink This site  seems to have a relatively moderate history of the pentagram. Eliphas Levi Zahed (aka Alphonse Louis Constant) is one possible lead on the dark symbology connected to the inverted pentagram.    Freemasonry is also connected with the pentagram, but it's proving difficult to find a good link that demonstrates this without the author attempting to prove that Freemason's are Satanists."

A3ZYG05,female,17,"Its 9:09 Sunday morning.  My parents are at church with Grammy and I am sitting at home.  I think I'm going to go the teen mass tonight at 6:10 with Stephen, John, and Maggie Rose.   I hate Sunday's.  They're always so boring and a little depressing because you know Monday is coming.  Luckily, I don't have to work on Monday.     I went to go see The Bourne Supremacy last night and I was a little disappointed.  It was kind of the same old, same old, run-for-your-life-even-though-your-innocent story line.  In the first movie, he had Marie and he had to figure out who he was and why these people were trying to kill him, and the audience was along for the adventure in his search for Identity. In this movie, we knew the whole time that he was a falsely accused CIA agent and it was just him running from the bad guys.  The action was good, the acting superb but the plot needed work.  And what the heck? Hollywood took some liberties with the book when they killed off Marie.  I wonder what their thinking was behind that.  I could understand if it would kick Jason Bourne into revenge mode, but it didn't really.  Sure he was sad and mad and upset but he was just trying to figure out why they wanted him, he wasn't really out to get them.  All in all, this movie is doomed to Tinsel Town's sequel fate- 2nd movie, 2nd best.  While I was at the movie, I saw a poster for a new Johnny Depp movie called  Finding Neverland .  It's about the author of Peter Pan and his inspiration for writing it.  Kate Winslet, and Dustin Hoffman also star.  Hurrah for a Depp Movie!  I only have to wait until Catie's birthday Oct. 22 (sniff sniff).  Gasp!  what if I wait all this time and it turns out to be a terrible movie?  So far the movies I look forward to ( The Notebook, The Bourne Supremacy )  always seem to disappoint, so I'm going to underestimate this movie.   Finding Neverland  looks pretty lame, and that Johnny Depp guy, no one ever understands his weird movies.  And Kate Winslet?  She made one worthwhile movie, she'll never make another Titanic again...   ahh.  I think I'm going to go read my book now,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.   Oprah's new book don't you know.  Until next time, Toodles.

I scoured the Web for speed-up tips, and one of them seemed to help (turn off real-time word count), but I wanted a more permanent solution. I wanted a fix that would hold up in the long run. I wanted... a version update.  I go to the Microsoft Web site and learn my version of word -- ""X"" -- is woefully out of date. I should really be using 10.1.5, which apparently is the height of coolness. I tried to download it, only to be informed that I really should download 10.1.4 first. Fine, I say.

0CAT92G,male,24,"I didn't think I was going to be able to make it. After a week of trying to make good progress on my paper - but failing - I found myself at home last night, with about three pages complete out of a 10-12 page paper.

Me : Because I  choose  to. (Trinity kisses me) The point is, I won. I chose to keep going, and I finished the damn paper, and it was pretty good, and I drove to school and turned it in at 12:09 p.m. (there's nothing like the jolting CA-CHUNK of a time-stamp machine to remind you that whatever goes on in the Matrix has consequences in the Desert of the Real).  Okay, my laptop battery was dying so I just went to plug in my laptop and as I was bending down to find the outlet behind the bed I somehow got a paper cut on my eye. I think this a signal that I should go to sleep.  .\.\ @"

0CAT92G,male,24,"""Soda causes diabetes! News at eleven.""   Be wary of statistics. For a long while now, I have noted with amusement various statistics meant to frighten, cajole and persuade. At first glance, these statistics are frightening, but a dose of cynicism and a little bit of thinking will go a long way.  Sensationalism runs amok at eDiets.com: ""Now here's some scary news: Harvard School of Public Health research indicates women who drank at least one sugar-sweetened soda a day were 85 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who drank less!""  Well, yes, I don't doubt the veracity of the study. Upon cursory glance, it seems quite legitimate  isn't heavy sugar consumption linked to diabetes? Yes and no. People who consume a lot of sugar are generally overweight, and obesity is definitely a cause of diabetes. But simply consuming a lot of sugar will not, in itself, cause diabetes.   Then, it is very likely that ""one sugar-sweetened soda a day"" will not cause an 85 percent jump in the diabetes rate. One sugar-sweetened soda a day, coupled with an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, will. This Harvard study found a correlation, not a causation.  Not convinced? Look at this snippet from an  urlLink AP article :   ""According to [the] study, the women most prone to gaining weight had increased their consumption of sugary soft drinks from less than one a week to more than one a day. On average, those women gained nine-10 pounds in a four-year period. But women who cut their intake of soft drinks gained an average of three pounds or less.""    Honestly, I am not entirely sure what this means. Did the study organizers pick the women most prone to gaining weight and ask them to increase their soda consumption more than seven-fold? In any case, it is clear that there is a very fundamental question here: What caused the increase in diabetes  the increase in sugar consumption or the increase in weight?  In a nod to fair and balanced reporting, the AP quoted a press release from the National Soft Drink Association that responded to the study. The soft drink makers called the study ""unconvincing and inconclusive"" because it raises questions over ""factors that could create inaccuracies."" The article stopped there, but a quick skim of the  urlLink press release  provides the needed details:   ""It is unknown whether or not this study adjusted for all of the above risk factors for type 2 diabetes or for other risk factors sometimes referred to in the medical literature such as high salt intake, high blood pressure, alcohol intake and high fat intake. If this study were adjusted for all of these confounding factors, it is doubtful it would show any risk for developing type 2 diabetes from soft drink consumption,"" said Dr. Richard Adamson, vice president for scientific and technical affairs for NSDA.    The moral of the story? It's easy to fall victim to scary statistics. Respond with your mind rather than your fears. Always look at both sides of an issue. And don't believe everything you read."

0CAT92G,male,24,"I am in the midst of a fundamental shift in my world view. Maybe. Possibly.  You see, I don't want to admit it because that would mean I'm not the rabid conservative I've always pretended to be.  But we all knew that already, didn't we? My ""conservatism"" springs more from common sense than from any particular ideology... and yet I have embraced the conservative cause, which so often corresponds with the Republican cause.  I'm not sure I want to do that anymore. I am beginning to have serious misgivings about our foreign policy, about the war in Iraq, about our place in the world. I watched Bill Clinton's speech on CSpan yesterday, from the Dean fundraiser out in the fields of Iowa, and I found myself agreeing with him more than I disagreed.  I still disagreed  -- just not as much as I used to. When I saw that most of the things he said made a lot of sense, I cringed despite myself. But I knew a shift was taking place.  I am still a conservative, and still a Republican. But only moderately... and if I ever ran for office, I could probably run as a conservative Democrat. I don't know. This is all very confusing.

W68579V,male,24,"it's like there's a birthday every other day this month.  well, maybe just today and the day before yesterday.  so there's adam, who to be really honest, when i first met him, i thought was sort of a goofy, maybe a bit of a nerdy guy.  i don't think that it was any vibe that he gave off himself, because he's definitely not nerdy, i think he just reminded me of, looked like another guy i knew who was a bit nerdy.  anyways, i met adam at the beginning of my junior year of college, christian education was one of my majors, it was a major that required completion of a ministry internship in order to  satisfy the requirements for graduation, so it was getting to the point where i'd have to think pretty long and hard about what i would do for it.  actually, that's not true at all in fact.  growing up, in junior high and high school i'd volunteered during the summers working on the rec staff at kids camps back in texas for sid, who's a pretty awesome guy in his own right, so i'd pretty much made up my mind that that'd be what i'd do for my internship;  i'd done it before, it would fulfill my requirement and it would be easy to do again.  so anyways, i was taking to adam one morning after church, after church, i guess i woulda been afternoon by then, and i think we were talking about school or something like that and i mentioned that i had to do an internship for my CE major.  but like i said, my mind was pretty well made up as to where i'd be, and that was most definitely not illinois, so when he proposed that we have lunch that week to talk about the possibility of me doing my internship ther, pretty much the only thing i was excited about was the prospect of scoring a free lunch.  if you know me, or have stalked me for an extended period of time, you know how that ended up, i did end up spending the summer in illinois, interning there, having adam as my supervisor and mentor.  i never expected that i would develop the kind of relationship with him that i did, even with his family.  even though i was the intern and he was the supervisor, he made obvious the fact that he cared not just about what i was doing for him and the church and stuff like that, but he cared about  me , good gravy, he let me live in his house; how i was doing, what was with me, i could always count on him to shoot straight with me, even with stuff that wasn't easy, which is more than can be said for others i've encountered, even in the profession i'm in, but that's another entery for another day, i guess.  all that put more succinctly, there are a handful of people in this world whose influence i can point to and say spending time with that person changed me profoundly.  i learned a lot about how people should relate to each other from adam.  thanks adam.  feeling: grateful thinking of: 2 S 361 Glen Park Rd, Lombard, IL 60148 music: ""escher's world"" chagall guevara"

W68579V,male,24,"simplicity,  real  simplicity, lies beyond complexity.  at least that's what i learned in my very first freshman theology class.  in intellectual endeavors, simplicity seems to be the goal, analysing things to their most basic units, to the point of  sui generis  is what is largely sought after.  what i've found in talking to people about an assorted number of things is that people often mistake the simplicity that hasn't wrestled with complexity as a satisfactory simplicity, or perhaps even worse yet, stop prematurely, remaining mired in complexity.  pride creeps in and people taking themselves seriously like they do, they aren't willing to let go of the conclusions they've drawn.  i've noticed that it seems to be particularly problematic as far as perceptions of morality go.  instead of understanding the complexity of what makes certain actions good or bad, i.e. the condition of the heart, people are way more comfortable having a list of things that are either good or bad, good people do the good things, and people that aren't good do the bad things.  that's to say nothing of what determines what is good and what's bad, because what i've observed is that the good people get to determine what's acceptable and they have a penchant for imposing those ideas on those around them.  the prevailing outlook on the part of people who seek goodness through the mere following of rules or avoidance of situations judged to be evil or unwholesome seems to be that goodness comes from self-denial. that is to say that people who are good are good, at least in part because they abstain from activity that is ""bad.""  so what happens is that a standard of goodness isn't defined as itself, but rather it's only defined relative to what it isn't, which is bad.  thomas merton had a quote that sort of describes the [somewhat] unperceived pitfall of people who think that way, saying:   merely accepted, suffering does nothing for our souls, except, perhaps, to harden them.  endurance alone is no consecration.  true asceticism is not a mere cult of fortitude.  we can deny ourselves rigorously for the wrong reason and end up pleasing ourselves mightily with our self-denial   what we find is that when self-denial and abstention from certain activity doesn't have a foundation, it becomes an end in and of itself, as opposed to a means to the end of becoming a better person.  the result is that people reduce the meaning of good to the mere absence of badness, simple yes, but it's simplicity that comes from oversimplification as opposed to wrestling with complexity.  i never want to be a good person.  feeling: irritated thinking of: what a badass dunx is music: ""if that ain't country, i'll kiss your ass"" david allan coe"
W68579V,male,24,"so it's been a year.  it's kind of nuts that i ended up here in the first place, when i started my senior year, southern california wasn't even on the map as far as places i thought i'd end up after graduation.  the drive started a couple days earlier, left dallas around eight in the morning friday august 30th.  the first day was pretty easy, no real rush, i figured on being on the road about ten hours or so, driving through the most cosmopolitan cities texas has to offer.  i mean abilene, midland, odessa, el paso?  that's four potential sidetrips right there.  it wasn't so bad really, west texas has this charm to it that i think only texans can appreciate, so i enjoyed it.  the next day was miserable, pretty much all day the desert, spent the heat of the day crossing the entire state of arizona.  both nights i spent at motel 6's, friday in deming, NM and saturday in palm springs.  it was sunday morning, palm springs is about a hundred miles from long beach, and leaving there at half past seven that morning saw me roll into long beach around nine.  that was a year ago, september 1, 2002.  a  year .  i remember having my lil car packed to the gills with pretty much everything that i owned, coming out here, not knowing a soul, having a job, but no place to live, stuff like that.  i feel so far removed from that now, but at the same time the memory of that is so vivid that perceiving the amount of time that's passed since then is nuts.  time fascinates me, it's so paradoxical.  we always have it, yet somehow there's never enough.  we curse clocks and calendars that move too slowly and then find ourselves shocked by how quickly they change.  i remember reading a calvin and hobbes comic when a few years ago, calvin was talking to his dad about getting older and how people slowed down as they aged.  calvin told his dad that since he'd have less and less time as he got older, he'd want to go faster instead of slower.  i remember being a little kid and thinking that a year was  such  a long time, and how once i got to high school and college, it would seem that i could blink and miss one.  one of my professors in college explained that in a way that made a lot of sense, when you're five, a year is a whole twenty percent of your life, even at age ten, it's ten percent, no small fraction itself.  as you get older, a year makes up less of a fraction of your life, so perceptually, they seem to go faster.  that only explains one side of the paradox though.  it seems to me that the longer you live and the more you experience, the richer, the thicker your experience with time is.  being bound by time and aware of how quickly it passes puts us in a position where we have to reconcile that with trying to fit so many experiences and memories into that framework.  your brain and your heart become so engrossed all that's taken place in the time that's passed, which sort of accounts for those moments where a week seems like a year.  i'm not sure abilene even had an olive garden.  feeling: calm thinking of: FM 1382 between I-20 and US 67 music: ""acquiesce"" stavesacre"
W68579V,male,24,"so the strike is over.  what i'm talking about is the grocery store workers strike that started back in october.  hindsight seems to bring clarity in places where it was lacking previously, since the whole thing started workers lost, i hear, over three hundred million dollars in wages, i don't know the toll it took on the stores, i know business was way down, mostly because with minimal staffing and picketers outside hassling everybody, shopping at union grocery stores was little more than a pain that could be avoided if there was a stater brothers or food-4-less anywhere near.  the other fallout is that i'm not shopping at wal-mart anymore.  the whole reason for the strike was wal-mart's expansion into the grocery business coupled with their non union status which enables them to offer lower wages and fewer benefits and make the grocery companies squeeze their workers to remain competitive.  the workers, wanting to protect themselves, strike when the upcoming bargaining agreement proposes to cut their benefits.  that i didn't have a problem with, but i did get rubbed the wrong way when i went to albertson's early in the strike to get something i wasn't able to find anywhere else and a picketer asked me not to shop there until the strike was over.  that i understood, but it's sort of ridiculous to ask people to not shop where you work and then to come back when you want them to, i mean you're actively driving business away from the company that employs you.  i went grocery shopping last night, which is the first time i've had to do that since the strike ended at the beginning of the month, and upon reflection, i decided not to go to albertson's, which is where i went before the strike and to instead go to food-4-less, which is where i went during the strike.  i'm not entirely sure why i chose to do that, i think it's the slight segment of my personality that's vindictive, i mean if the stores and workers could hold out on each other and the general public for five months, i figure they deserve at least that much from me.  feeling: a cut on my fist thinking of: completion music: ""rigged on a fix"" rancid"

W48QVCZ,female,23,"Feeling a bit down...    I don't know why... maybe the fact that 3 of my best friends are all obviously in on some joke that I'm out of (see comments link two posts below)... but I feel really down.  I know that it's in their right to have huge inside jokes without me because I don't talk to them as much as I could (or should for that matter).  But I've been so friggin' busy and have just been a huge bundle of nerves for the past week (because of stuff going on with my Grandma) that I don't really feel it's entirely my fault.  What's been going on with me?  Well, number one (first and foremost) my Grandma is much more sick than we realized, and the doctors STILL don't know what the Hell is wrong with her.  I mean, they know that she's old, and that she's having atrial fibrillation (A-fib), but it's not her heart.  Yes, you wouldn't be the only one to think that sounds really contradictory.  In addittion to all this... their previous thought that she had a minor stroke got thrown out and they said she had a minor heart attack.  However, the doctor has now said he thinks she probably suffered a minor stroke AND minor heart attack.  His remedy initially was medicine to control her A-fib.  Then the other night when I went to go visit her he came in the room while she was having some tests run, and told us something we didn't really want to hear.  He said he wants to put her on Coumadin.  This is a drug used to thin the blood.  What's the big deal?  Well, for one thing, she lives alone an hour away from any of her children.  So, if she ever falls, it literally could be life threatening because her blood would be thinned and she could bleed to death very quickly.  So, we've all been a whole jumble of nerves.  In addition to all that mess that's going on, I've been doing the whole school/work thing.  I've been doing okay in my classes and I'm doing great at work... but, I'm REALLY wearing myself thin.  I go straight from school to work (after a bite to eat, of course) and then I leave work and come home to eat, do homework, take a shower and fall into bed.  Very rarely do I have ANY extra time to just sit around... and when I do I fall asleep.  For example, last night I came home... to an empty house.  I got something to eat... I came to my room and turned on the tv with every intention of watching some tube.  However, at about 8:30, I fell asleep... and I didn't wake up again til around 12:30, at which point I mustered up enough energy to change my away message, brush my teeth, and fall back into bed.  The only upside to anything right now is that I don't have to worry about going to music lab on Fridays anymore... however, now I need to use some of that time to go to an elementary school and observe special ed kids for my exceptionalities class field experience.  ARGH!  It's never-ending this semester... and next semester is going to be even WORSE!  Mainly because I'll probably do band... although, I'm thinking of waiting until next school year altogether.  I don't know if I can do this...  and now I'm going to go look at cars (probably next weekend) so I'll have car payments to make... and I won't be able to take summer school most likely because I'll have to work and there's a good chance I can do the summer camp with A.S.K.  And it hit me last night on my drive home from work.  This is what the rest of my life is going to be like.  I'll ALWAYS be busy.  I'll never have a moment of rest... ever.  Just when I think I'll have a break, I'll remember something like, ""Oh... I have to make the lesson plan about the '3' multiplication tables for Thursday,"" and there I'll go again.  (sigh)  And this doesn't even include the other confusions that jumble my mind every day, all day, during the week.  So... question... if we're not doing X-men for Halloween... what ARE we doing...?  Cause, I only have next weekend and the following weekend to put a costume together now.  I'm going to take a nap now, and then I'm going to do music theory homework, study for 2 music theory tests, study for an exceptionalities test, make something we need for work, do all of my sign language work, and I'll probably have a couple meals during the rest of the weekend if there's time."

All of ya'll mean a lot to me, and I can't thank you enough for all the birthday wishes!  :-)"
W48QVCZ,female,23,"Today I had a fairly productive day...  I went and picked up my paycheck from SAUM, then I came home and ate some lunch.  Then my Mom and I went to the grocery store to buy some things... needed something for dinner tonight and all.  So, tonight my Mom and I are going to make some homemade chili... MMM.  Tomorrow the plan is for me to go buy Target (I need a couple things) and I also need to go try and find some new bras.  Heh heh... I know ALL the guys who read my blog wanted to know about my bra purchasing... ; )  The rest of the week is still undetermined.  I was thinking of giving Naomi a call and going to dinner with her Wednesday or Thursday or something... I dunno.  We'll just have to see on that one.  So... a couple days ago this body was found in SA... someone was driving by and noticed something on the side of the road on fire.  They took a look and noticed it was a dead body someone had dumped off and set on fire.  So, by hearing the street names of a near intersection (both were farm roads) it sounded like it was right near the ""spot"" Joe and I used to go to.  I'm not sure, but I think it's very possible.  When they showed the little map thing, it really looked like it was the place.... that's so weird.  I mean, this body had two holes through the head...  Whew... anyhow... Oh... I actually did pretty well on my midterm in lab...!!!  I got a B, and I really thought there was a chance I'd end up with a D or F.  So, I came out on top with that one!  :-)  I'm just really happy that I'm getting a week of rest... and on that note, I shall go and help my Mom get dinner started here in a bit... :-P"
W48QVCZ,female,23,"My finals are finally over!  Now I do the HAPPY DANCE!  YAY!  My biology 2 final was really not bad, of course that may be in part to my studying for 2 days!  :-)  Tuesday I had my World Civ final, and I must admit, I was really very scared about taking a blue book exam for a final.  It was so much easier than I thought it'd be.  My essay ended up being about 3 1/2 pages long.  The identifications part wasn't bad either.  When I turned in my blue book I also got to find how I did on my paper.  I got a B+... pretty good, considering I seriously thought I'd get a C-.  :-)  I didn't really read the book till the week it was due... and I didn't type it out or put anything thought into it REALLY until about 11am the day it was due.  And I had to have it turned in by 5pm.  hehe  I'm so bad.  If I would've put more effort into it, I would've pulled off an A+... which is the norm for my papers.  I love writing... but only about things I like... and I can openly admit I don't like history... let alone the comparisons on the Crusades and Jihad.  BLAH!  Anyway, the last final I had was this morning at 7:30am.  ACK!  I hate early finals... but, I think I did okay.  Not my best, mind you, because I was really not as prepared as I should have been... but I sorta burned out... I just kinda knew that I didn't have enough time to REALLY learn some of the concepts... well... not learn... to keep them straight... Anyhow, so I just sorta said, ""This is how it is..."" and finally went to bed, because it would've done me less good to stay up all night studying.  Anyhow, I'd say I knew about 80% of the exam.  Which is about how I did on the other 3 exams.  So, with luck, I'll pull of a B in that class... if not, then I'll settle for a C.  He was a difficult, but AWESOME professor!  The only good thing about waking up so FRIGGIN' early, and being at school to take a final that FRIGGIN' early, was getting to see and chat with Mike.    Check this out!!!  Last Weds. morning (last day of Psych class) I was sitting on the bench outside of the lecture hall.  I was sleepy, so I decided to let myself doze for a bit (I had an hour).  There was this guy sitting next to me on the bench, and he was reading some intellectual magazine (like I think it was a modern sociology mag or something of that nature... didn't pay TOO much attention to it).  So, I curl up, and I was sitting sideways on the bench (the back of the bench was on my right side...) I had my knees up (so I was curled up) and I used my red hoody jacket as a blanket and leaned my head on the back of the bench (on my right).  So, I dozed off, and having no perception of how much time had passed I decided I should survey the area and see how many people had showed up for class (more people, less time till class started)... anyhow, about 20 feet away, standing along the outside wall of the lecture hall is Mike... looking dead straight at me... staring... when I noticed... he tried to play it off, and sorta looked away, but kept looking back.  It sorta weirded me out... I'm not used to people WATCHING me sleep.  Anyhow, there were only a few people there, so I laid my head back down and dozed off again...  now... this next time I came to, I again opened my eyes to see how many people were out there now... and I almost peed on myself... because no longer was ""modern sociology"" guy there... but Mike was sitting RIGHT next to me, and watching me sleep... I was sorta taken aback... but, then he sorta just smiled at me, and asked, ""Did I scare you?""  And I said, ""Sorta... being that when I saw you before you were about 20 feet away... and now you're 2 feet away... and I didn't even hear that other guy leave... or you come sit here in his place....""  OY!  Then I couldn't close my eyes anymore... I just couldn't.  I was too freaked out that he would watch me... and he STILL kept looking over at me... like I couldn't see him... and he'd get this gleeful smirk on his face... then he'd sorta look away... one of the last times he looked at me like that, I looked right at him... and I asked... ""what, silly?""  and he made some comment about how he was ""taking in the moment""  it was so odd... he also kept doing miscellaneous things to like, try to keep him busy... and he at one point had a piece of paper and a pen... which I have NO IDEA why he got it out...  I don't KNOW about this guy... he seems so odd... but it intrigues me BEYOND belief.... I also was talking to a girl that sits in front of me in Psych, and she frequented SI sessions and got to know Mike a little better than me... and anyhow, she was saying she felt bad for him, because she didn't think he was with any family or anything for Thanksgiving... apparently he's adopted, or something... and I didn't quite understand... she was being very vague, I think she started feeling bad about talking about him... but I think he knows his birth family... and he wasn't able to be with EITHER family (adopted or birth).... so sad... Anyway... that's what's happened since last week...  Comment if you must...       urlLink  postCount('11Dec2002');"
W48QVCZ,female,23,"I'm messed up...    And that title's no joke.  I'm an emotional wreck.  Why?  Don't get me started... don't EVEN get me started.  This all roots back to a bad part of my life which I'm trying desperately to forget... unfortunately that ""bad part"" reared its ugly head, and caused me to think about things that I haven't thought about for the past 9 months.  I'll be okay eventually... it's just going to take time.  Fortunately, I have good friends who have given me their perspectives on things... and while I sorta wish that it hadn't come about the way it did... in the long run it will be effective and helpful.  So... on to happier things...    Yesterday I got the new  urlLink 311  cd.  It's okay... not the same as the other ones, though.  It's not as energetic and in-your-face, but I think it may partly be because I haven't listened to it enough to really get into the songs.  What did I do today?  HAHAHA  Excuse me, but I had to laugh because I didn't do much of anything.  I woke up at like, 12:30... I talked to my Mom about the aforementioned ""bad part"" of my life... cried a lot... went back to sleep... woke up... talked to Melissa... worried that Jennifer was mad at me... called her to talk about it... cried on the phone (which was embarrassing, because I hate crying in front of people... or having people hear me cry... but I just couldn't help it this time)... got things with that all sorted out, though... and well... then I ate, because my Mom had been bugging me all day to eat something and I figured I probably should.  Yep... what a great day, right?   Tomorrow... me and Melissa (and hopefully Jennifer, too) are going to  urlLink Canyon Lake  for a while.  Probably not a LONG time, because well... eh.  Then, I don't know what we're doing afterwards tomorrow night... we'll just see.  I'm hoping that the more I do, the less time I'll have to think about other stuff... and hopefully that'll turn out well.  Anyhow, I don't have anything else to post right now... I'm just hoping everything gets better by next week.  I'd hate to have a crappy birthday because I'm wallowing in sadness about this whole thing."

D15GI1X,female,26,"I had a discussion with darling the other day. Asked him why must there be evil on earth.   If God was powerful, why can't he remove Satan and Evil from earth so that everyone can live happily everafter?   I know this sounds very fairyish and idealistic. I asked Uncle Wuts the same question. The answers I got are as follows:   Uncle Wuts said: God is a fair God, and as he loved us,  his children , so much, he gave us a choice to choose either to be good or bad. That explains why some of the angels deferred and turned evil.   Darling said: There is no such thing as good or evil. We are all sons and daughters of God. And since we are all images of him, and theoretically since we are evil, thus God is also evil cos we come from him.   I hope to find the answer one day. Through reading the bible and talking to God.   I know I will."
D15GI1X,female,26,"I realised how easy it is for one to take things for granted. So many examples that I can think of:  1. I take buses that cruise on the Nicoll Highway to work every morning. The whole journey takes about 40mins. After it's collapse, all these buses were redirected to BeachRd/Lavendar area, and becos of that, jams are common and I needed twice the amount of time to come to work. On that fateful day, I was attending a first aid course at St John's Ambulance quarters at Beach Rd and was less than 1 km away.  I never expected such a solid highway that I have been travelling regularly for the past 8 years to collapse, but it did.  2. My mum and dad loves me so much. They provide for me physically, financially and emotionally since I was borned. But guilty as I am, I admit I hardly have time for them. I seem to be always stuck with work and committments. But come to think of it, who are the people who loves me most in this world?  3. When I was at Mizpah, water definitely didn't come easy. The mains will only release water on alternate days from 5 to 7am only. If you miss the time, the whole Lumos gang consisting 20 oddof us would have to scrimp and save H2O for the next two days. Not enough water for washing up, bathing, brushing your teeth, doing laundry, cooking and flushing the toilets. Can you imagine that when the only thing you have to do to get free flowing water in singapore is to pay $ and turn on the tap to enjoy this priviledge that many poor people around the world are not entitled to?    4. The blackout night. We find blackouts exciting, especially if it comes once in a blue moon and for a short period only. Cos it's then when we can start fishing out our torchlights, candles and portable electrical applicances that we usually would not use on electricity days. Just imagine if we have blackouts every night. Would you still enjoy it? Maybe it's high time I start appreciating the currents flowing through my mains..haha  5. Being a Singaporean. I am proud to be one I must say, and LOUDLY. Have heard tonnes of complaints about bureaucratic governments, endless fines, exorbitant taxes, increasing electricity and water bills, escalating road charges, stiffling education system etc etc. But think of the flipside. Wondering if we even remember to praise the government for our secure living environment, clean water, beautiful HDBs, loads of greenery along the roads, pretty airport, safe medicines, colourful NDP celebrations, clean environment, low crime rates ... Do you?  6. Thanking  God .  We curse when things go wrong. We unconsciously petition within our hearts when he does not answer our prayers. We rather listen to strangers who say things we like to hear instead of God's words. Praying and bible-reading are seldom priorities in our lives. If not for God who created us and granted us the niceties of the world despite our sin-ladden bodies, would we still be here?  Seriously pondering about these..and many more. Maybe it's high time I adjust my priorities in life.  Life is not only about living for oneself."
D15GI1X,female,26,"Whew! I just finished a big piece of work and  it was good . Felt really fulfilled and satisfied the moment I clicked 'sent'. haha..that's me. A workaholic at times, cos I can work and work and don't feel the pinge in my stomach.  I love my work, more importantly my company and the people I worked with. This  dream career  didn't come easy. Found it after I have been through some rough patches after graduation. And probably that's why I value it so much :)  I look forward to coming to office each day, maybe becos I find meaning in the work that I do. Now I seriously understand Uncle's meaning of  Passion for Work .  Wondering how are you, Uncle? Kindof missed you. Maybe I shall give you a surprise visit one of these days. Looking forward to that startled yet happy face when you see me :)  I am about to get ready to go to the gym. Missed my Yoga last night and felt REALLY disappointed. So am going to make up with practice at gym later on.  Oh ya, sorry Dad, for postponing Father's Day celebration. Don't doubt our love and sincerity, cos we love you!!!"
D15GI1X,female,26,"I love the feeling of blogging in the morning. I think partly becos of the freedom to type, more time to stop and ponder, and also becos the laptop is always occupied by my sis at nite.   The feeling of opening your eyes and realising that dawn is here without the reminder of an alarm is fantastic. Have been doing that for the past few mornings and  it feels extremely good . Remembered your Confucius saying.   My mind is usually clearer in the morning too, so less junk on my blog..haha  Just read my sis's blog and realised that she has an identical layout as mine. That's my youngest sis; Angelia-lookalike, and more like me compared to my other sis. Alot of commonalities in terms of dress sense, character, personality.. maybe becos we were produced by the  same factory ..haha..and most importantly I find it easier and more comfortable to talk to her. Trust her more since she can keep secrets.  I finally slept for more than 7 hours last night. Dropped dead on my sofa after I reached home last night..and slept and slept..continuously from 11pm to 7am!! 8 full hours! That's probably why I feel really energised now :)"
D15GI1X,female,26,"finally got to watch spiderman today.was quite shocked when i reached the ticketing counter at PS at 2pm. it was packed to the extent that i thought they had all come to welcome an idol, maybe my  indian idol  ..haha..if you know what i mean..hahaha  reminded me of the time we were waiting for vincent and jason to check out the train schedule to Allapey at a railway station in India. me bugs and darling were just standing there stoning and talking. suddenly a bunch of indian kids popped out from nowhere and started surrounding him, asking for his name, signature and photograph..haha..that was why we named him  THE INDIAN IDOL**  thereafter.   **note: only in india, k..hahaha  managed to get the movie tickets in two minutes without having to jostle with the crowd. my secret: visa gold card. haha priority queue. no time wasted. quite impressed cos i hardly ever used that card.  this is our first show together :)  despite falling asleep on his shoulders, i kind of enjoyed the parts i watched when i was awake. find certain parts quite funnee, especially some of the lines mentioned by the cast, which were similar in context to my relationship with darling.

5LYQBTQ,male,27,"I don't really have an idea for a good post today so I thought I'd post some quick thoughts on random subjects.  1. My daughter, Isabella, is growing up way too fast. That being said, I love this age (15 months) that she is right now. She's saying a few words now ""dite (light),"" ""uh-oh,"" ""hey"" or ""hi"" and the occasional da-da (which is always music to my ears). She started walking kind of late (in my view at least) but now she's really getting around and getting really brave. She has three more teeth coming in, all on the top (two of which are the front two). Raising her is, in a word,  awesome.  It's also a daunting task for my wife Shannon being the stay-at-home mom. I really appreciate that role a lot more than I used to and I think it's one of the most important things parents can do if they are able. I love my two ladies very much.  2. Iraq is now a sovereign nation now. A note passed to Bush had the words ""Let Freedom Reign"" scribbled on it. I don't know who wrote that but what a historic day for Iraq and what a perfect sentiment. I'm still nervous about this whole thing and I don't know that things are going to get better overnight. I think, in the long run, this is a crossroads for the Middle East. They have two choices: freedom or terror. I pray they choose the former.  3. On another political note, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is coming to our local theater (we have one 8-screen theater in a town of about 13,000) this weekend. I actually thought about seeing it but I really have no use for propaganda films. Michael Moore says the film is an op-ed piece. That's his opinion and he's free to express it. More power to him I say. He will not, however, be getting one red cent of my money via a trip to the theater or on DVD. That's my protest. I always thought that people who protested ""The Passion of the Christ"" should've just shut up about it and not payed to see it. That probably would've stopped many others from seeing it because once it became a hit, everybody wanted to see it.  4. I watched ""School of Rock"" (on loan from Mike Weisensteiner-thanks Mike) this past Saturday. Hilarious movie. Jack Black is a little over the top but in a good way. It made me want to pick up my electric guitar after it was over and rock out a bit. That's the sign of a good music movie to me.  5. We also rented ""Welcome To Mooseport,"" ""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" and Disc 2 of Season 3 of ""The Sopranos""  this past weekend. ""WTM"" gets 2 1/2 stars out of four. Funny but not hilarious. ""BCCT"" gets the same. Maybe I was just too tired but Larry the Cable Guy is funny for about 2 seconds before I lose patience. Jeff Foxworthy is always funny to me. The other two guys, ... eh, whatever. Episodes 5-7 of Season 3 of ""The Sopranos"" were excellent. (I don't get HBO so I'm renting the seasons on DVD a bit at a time). However, one episode that prominently featured the Bada Bing club and its goings-on disturbed me a bit. Shannon doesn't like the fact that I like this show or mob movies in general. After seeing that episode, I can see why. Still, the writers never glamorize the lives of these people. They show them as they are, warts and all. I still think Tony will die in the last season. You reap what you sow.  6. I got a big picture of Christopher Walken to put in my basement. Shannon thinks it's creepy, I think it's awesome. ;-)  It's a lovely day in southern Indiana and I hope it is wherever you are."

Other steaks were similarly prized at Php200-300. Other dishes we ordered were paella valenciana and baked white oysters.   I think I'd recommend the place, if you're looking for a relatively cheaper date place and willing to go as far. As ambiance goes... the place is dark and candlelit.

3PLAE2J,female,26,"Okay. I have a dental appointment at noon with my good friend Bok. Sniff. Because...I have cavities.

Last week, I had my teeth cleaned by Bok, of course, after I cleaned  her  teeth muna. Thus the discovery of those pesky cavities. See? Even dentists get cavities. It is very, very disconcerting to be IN the dental chair, instead of being chairside. One feels very vulnerable, cold, helpless. Yes, I'm actually quite afraid of dentists.

The frame was literally around his neck. I didn't actually see it happen, but from the kwentuhan alone, total weirdness. Parang Looney Tunes. Kulang na lang may brand na ACME yung frame. Sa sobrang gulo ng pabitin, which is the VERY nature of a pabitin game, the other kids didn't notice that the frame was stuck nga and they still kept tugging for prizes, pulling the kid's neck in different directions. Buti na lang the kid was okay, scratched up lang siguro ng konti. But I'm sure he won't play pabitin again. Ever.

3PLAE2J,female,26,"I got this idea from the wonderful site that is  urlLink  Craftster.org ! Basically, you take a hardbound book, take out the pages, replace it with lining that you either sew or glue. Then glue everything to the book cover, add clasps or whatnot, then boom! Instant clutch bag. The link to the online tutorial isn't working anymore, but next time I find it, I'll post it here.     For my variation, I used black elastic, and an old button. I glued them inside the lining for clasps. Reader's Digest condensed books cost only Php50.00 or less at a used books store, and the old ones from the 60s to the early 80s have covers with nice patterns. For my lining, I used leftover scraps of cloth which date back to my childhood.

PQW3SJ6,female,47,"Mom and I went to visit my friends from   urlLink  Kosovo      last night.   We haven't seen them in almost two years, I am guessing and I was feeling very badly. We met when our     urlLink  Fellowship    sponsored the family as refugees from the   urlLink  war in Kosovo   . We all became friends as well as sponsors and were torn when half the family went back to Kosovo. We were saddened further when Qamille, the grandmother of the family died a few months after returning to   urlLink  Pristina   , their home.   However, before the family left, the son and his wife had their first child, Kosovare. In fact, I was there for the birth, giving me the chance to have the most memorable experience in my life.   The eldest daughter returned home to Kosovo a little later, and gradually we lost touch. The family here, though, was growing. Another child was on the way. Sadly, Altina was born at 16 weeks, and despite a valiant struggle for life, she died months later, at about the date she should have been born, had fate not intervened. It was heartbreaking for all of us who felt so close to the family. It was devastating to see the impact on the young parents.   According to   urlLink  Muslim tradition   , there is a lengthy preparation before the funeral and the preparations are carried out by members of the Muslim community, friends and family. The preparations include the washing of the body and wrapping it in a winding cloth. I was really honored to participate in the preparations. For me, the fact that I had seen one of their daughters into the world, I felt that I should be there to help another out of the world. It was sad and beautiful, and gave be the chance to experience another facet of life that all of us face but rarely so closely, at least in our Western Christianize culture.   I saw the family several times after this, but one thing and another kept us apart.   On our last visit, I played with Kosovare, then aged 2. We watched the air-balloons go by... one crashed on the side of the building, and we had a lovely time. However, I was conscious that this was our first visit as friends and, yet, despite our being so easy with the family as their sponsors and considering ourselves to be friends, I didn't want them to feel obligated to be friends.   Last week, I got an email from Advije in Kosovo, updating me on her life and that of her family. She has a 9-month-old son named Andi. The family is well, and all was well. She also told me that the young couple here had another baby. I was thrilled, though sad that I hadn't been able to participate in the birth this time around.   I called Agron and Nexmije and Mom and I went to visit. It was a terrific visit, not the least because of the presence of Klevis, two weeks old. I found that our relationship is firmly that of dear friends and I needn't have worried about them feeling ""obligated"" to be friends. We are and it is wonderful.   Nexmije said that she regretted my not having been with her for the birth. They had tried to call, but didn't have me new phone number and my old cellphone was no longer working. Ah well, Klevis is hearty and healthy, and that is all that counts. As you can see below, he is a beautiful, beautiful baby.     urlLink      Klevis, age 2 weeks"

PQW3SJ6,female,47,"I went out to the drugstore this evening. I meant only to be a few minutes, but it was the kind of night that demanded a road-trip.         The sun had more or less set by the time I got my shopping done. I cranked open the window and cranked up the music and headed out. I didn't have a real idea of where I wanted to go, but I think that was the point.          A few weeks ago, I made myself a ""Driving Music"" CD. The first song, ""  urlLink  Stoned   "" by Blackie and the Rodeo Kings (I've mentioned them before). I must have played that 10 times before moving on to the next tune. Actually, I played a number of tunes several times, and that was just fine. Let's see.... ""I Can't Stand the Rain"", ""Summertime"" and ""Take a Little Piece of My Heart"" by Janis Joplin; ""Memories of East Texas"" by   urlLink  Michelle Shocked   ; ""Joan of Arc"" and ""Song of Bernadette""   urlLink  Jennifer Warnes    (Leonard Cohen songs); ""Peter's Dream"" by   urlLink  Lennie Gallant    (Even though the tune was written by Gallant, my friend Chris Angel does it better. Unfortunately his version hasn't been recorded, yet); ""Chelsea Morning"" by Joni Mitchell; and ""Barracuda"" by Heart.          Because of all the rain we've had over the last while, the air has a very musty smell to it, which wasn't the most pleasant part of the drive. Still, it was the first time in a long while that I have gotten out of the house, on my own, just to drive, something I relish. In one respect, I really enjoyed it, but I think it would have been more satisfying to have someone along for the ride.         I think back to the days when a couple of friends and I would pile in the car, smoke a few joints, and just drive. I think I miss that. Actually, it's about the only thing I DO miss from my teens and early 20s. Aside from the sense of freedom I had with a few close friends, they were pretty shitty times for me. I do miss the driving around with no place particular to go, though. I miss a few of those friends, too.         I started thinking about who, in my circle of friends today, would be my choice of driving-around friend. I hate to say it, but I can't think of anyone who is free to just pick up and go out, anymore. Everyone either has family obligations or would think it was a nuts idea. ""You want to WHAT?....""         Siggghhh."

PQW3SJ6,female,47,"The sky was so beautiful, this evening. I wish I had been able to run home for my camera. Unfortunately, I was running late, and by the time I was on my way home, the show was over.   It had been intermittently cloudy and sunny today. At sunset, huge, dense, white clouds were starting to boil up in the east. To the west, were big black storm-clouds. To the south, flat, dissipating clouds. The ones to the east were tinted with pink and gold from the sunset. The ones to the south were black and red.   The whole scene reminded me of what I once heard described as ""an almighty sky"".   There was a painter who used to have a show on TV many years ago. I wish I could recall his name. He used to have an instructional show on oil-painting of the ""starving artist"" genre. However, he was so exuberant that one was almost impressed with the paintings. He used to refer to various elements in his paintings as ""an almighty mountian"" or ""an almighty tree"".   Hence, tonight's sky being and ""almighty sky""."

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Happy New Year...and all that Jazz.  Hey everyone. It looks likke I'm alive and kicking once again, mostly to ring in the New Year. Of course,  it was about ten seconds of fun. And then Anna and I kissed. Ha. And everyone but Jared missed it. Haha. You poor saps. Then of course the three of us looked at each other and all said ""So, back to Melee."" In which Anna proceeded to kick my ass at. Then, like the manics we are, we went outside and laid on the FREEZING cold driveway. Man, sometimes just being with your friends kick some major ass. Not even a huge group, or anything. Friends have obviously been the best part of '03, as has the news, and CC, all the way. And what's to look foreward to in '04? My senior friends garduating, Acting in the play, CC, Art Camp, and maybe a bit more writing, and but of course, driving and turning 16. March 21st. Don't forget it. Hopefully, I'll win an Oscar on my birthday, maybe. Hah. Don't laugh, because one day I'll be famous.  -[Steph]-"
S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Car trips are boring, and so are boys under 18.  Well, we have our first GRIPE. Which I whole-heartly agree with.  Jessie, my devoted fan (No...really...she is.) ""Yeah music!"" - Jessie.  I am sure she meant me.  Make a gripe about people who are like ""I LOVE YOU! MUAH MUAH!"" to their   boyfriends/girlfriends/goats/etc after like a day.  Mer.   xxx   Oh goodies. An amazing GREAT GRIPE. Congrats Jessie. We love you. Here goes.   Have you ever been walking down the hallways at school, enjoying YOUR school day (Does that happen?) when you see a couple making out...in the corner....of the hall? Tounges obviously whipping out everywhere. Does this not make you ill? It sick and gross. If you want to make out, go do it in the comfort of your own home, not in a public viewing area. Okay. Kiss. No tounges. No touching. And don't be all like ""AWWW!! I love you baby!!!"" Because you know what, I don't feel like seeing your friggin' PDA all the friggin' time. Go into the bathroom, for the love of God! My virgin eyes, Gosh, seriously. Don't do it in front of me, and if you do, next time, I will rip our lips off. Violently. With a chainsaw. I seriously, seriously hate it when people are making out. And i'm not a boyfriendless person either. When was the last time I was all up on Casey and making out? Never. Because it's not....it's not nice. Try me with kindness. I don't like your tounge, or your make-out partner's tounge. KEEP IT IN YOUR MOUTH. GET IT OUT OF MY FACE!! Tounges don't like company, not in public. THEY ARE NOT SOCIAL BEINGS.  They aren't Fraggle's for God's sake. They don't live and mine in a cave and seek help from a friggin' talking trash heap. They like to be alone, in public. When they're in your home, let them go wild, lick all you want. Just not in front of me. Never in front of me. I HATE IT! Do it in front of me and see what happens.  Just like...don't have sex within my bubble. That's right people. And my bubble is the whole room. That's right. Mine.

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Well, this is like my first post. I'm not too sure what all to say, but you know, Josh better hurry up with the layout. Because, I hate waiting for it. I also really need some sort of photoshop or adobe? Yes, please, thankies, It's needed badly. Enough about this crappy layout, here's the day. Period by period.  First Block: Honors L.A. - Mrs. Heffner. No Josh, and others, she isn't related to Hugh. Shove it. Well, we watched Lord of the Flies, the um, one from 1963, which totally kicked ass. It was riddled with comments from Anna, Nick, Duc, Tiffany, Courteny, David and myself. Yeah, although Duc fell alseep, along with Anna. I hit Anna a few times with my jacket until she stole it from with. Which left me freezing to death in my ""I heart Nerds"" shirt. Oh yeah, loads of fun. I think Duc likes Anna, just a thought. He's all tall and stuff. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the slackers, (which would be Anna and myself) were happily informed that our five paragraph essay wasn't due until thrusday. And that's why Mrs. Heffner rawks.   Second Block: Speech and Debate - Mr. Huff. For those of you that have heard me speak of Mr. Huff, let me infrom you that he rawks. He does scholars bowl, and he makes fun of us and them all the time. He had nicknames for everyone. You can't know mine, so don't bother asking, Bizznotch. So, we like talked about prejudice and like racist and biased jokes. Normal speech and debate stuff. It wasn't a very exciting class today. Well, I have homework for it. I mean, Mr. Huff always makes funny side comments. And everyone is really passionate, I mean, I am too, but they think about their points, I just kind of cover over what they said, it's annoying, and I don't like it. I mean, I can be smart, he even tells me I'm smart and that i have good points. Just, the thing is, so does everyone else, and they speak on impluse. I hate speaking on impluse, in front of a call. Embrsassment nation. Well, I'm a dork anyway. It doesn't matter all to much, I have a good grade in his class, and he'sa great teacher.   Third Block: Honors World History - Coach Waters. No wait, that's Coach Satan to you. He's like demon-nation man. He's a good teacher, I have really high marks in his class, it's just, he bugs me sometimes. He's one of those, ""I'm the only teacher you have, and the only class you should care about is this one."" kind of teacher. I mean, last time I checked, I had like a 90, but then i got a 99 on a project, and then a 50 on homework, and prolly a like 75 or 80 on a test, and then a 91 on this other test. And a 98 on theis work project thingie. Oh, he assigned another one. On Perisan Wars. Gag me. Please. His class is hades, I swear. I mean, whatever, he's just...arg, Evil. Well, I love to vent. But he really is. Anna and I goofed off all period in the Media Center. Jessie asked us about cheesecake with a pen up her nose. It's like she wants to belong, a bit sad, don't you think? I wish, she'd poof away, take some of her annoying followers with her. One more year, and she's gone. Thank you for high school drop outs.  Fourth Block: 2D-3D Design - Mrs. Neal. Oh, before fourth, Duc hugged Anna. I teased her. She so likes him. Duh. I hope Anna doesn't read this. I LOVE YOU ANNA!! So this is the end of the day. I ended up with a headache at the beginning of class arguing with Jon about who this drummer kid was. I had no idea what he looked like, or who he was. Whatever though, I stopped after a while. Jon, Jimmy and myself carried on a convo about me lacking a boyfriend. Thanks guys, that put a real damper on my day. But you know, I told Jimmy what I was looking for in a guy, including brains, which is a major must-have, and he told me he knew someone. I sort of gasped. I wrote my numbers down and gave them to Jimmy. It's a Parkview dude, but he's like a juinor, I think. Or a Sophomore with a car. Yes, he's got a car. Cha-chingy. Someone cashed in, and I think it was me.    Well, the only other thing is tonight is the Season Premire of EVERWOOD!! EEeeep!! I'm so excited!! I can't wait, so i'm trying to get some sleep. I know you see how well that's working out. That and a layout. I can't expect much of Josh though, he's a lazy ass gifted kid with too much homework. Get a life Josh, get a life. Get a life and throw a party. And finish my layout. Oi vey, so tired. Here's an update:  Music: Gob -Lemon-aid Mood: Excited and overly tired. Game: Poker, still.    Lastly, The GRIPE OF THE DAY, the title is thanks to RFR, watch it in the n. Check out the n at www.the-n.com  Gripe:  Annoying people that are..annoying to say the least.

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"More to life.   Is it easy to say when you see yourself being hated, that you very well might be? It's sort of sad to view it like this, but it seriously could be true, couldn't it? Sometimes, and mostly when your in high school, you see yourself as always being judged. Now, what if your friends did this judging to you? I'm not all too sure where I'm headed with this, but, I'm sure you'll see this. For some reason, I'm feeling left out from ""Haterfest '03!"".  I have NO idea why. Okay, maybe it's because a lot of my friends are there, but some of them aren't. What of them? I'm just being how I was born to be. Except, I was invited. I just thought it would be logically to go to sleep early and then, you know, go to movies on Sunday, seeing as I have a meet tomorrow. It just had planned to go see a movie with Alex, Jared and Anna. But it's empty. I know half, or more, of the people at Homestaying think I'm a self-rightous bitch. Okay, I'm not saying I'm not, becasue you know what? I am. But it is so worse when other people tell you that you are. It's just annoying, so I should be glad I'm not going. Okay, wait, this started out as a drespressing post, and now it's like ""I'm happy I'm not going.""...I call it horomones, mood swings, whatever you want. But I do feel okay that I'm not going. I don't really need to surround myself with the large amount of idiots that will be present, do I? I think not. Plus, it's not like Jessie cares if I show up. So, it's more or less dejection. Oh. Dejection. Wow. Now I'm really happy about not going. I'm so odd. I never thougt I could, like do this, without the help of my shirk. I feel good. It's not like anyone wants to see me there anyway! It'd be like, breaking a taboo. Oh, well, does that mean I should? I could just see myself walking in and everything getting reeeeaallly silent suddenly. Wow....it's Ever After all over again, except, no prince, no di Vinici, no kick-ass costume, and no long hair...which would just strip the plot from that AWESOME movie anyway. I could compare it to The Princess Bride. Which would also kill that movie. Okay, Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail. Yeah, the part with the French people! The ones that throw the cow. Yeah. People throw cows at me. I'm such a sad person, seeing as I'm listening The Dead Alewives, and talking about Monty Python. And seeing as the skit was...McGregor Kilts, I suppose it wasn't that bad. Oh yeah, ""Have fun sleeping.""...piece of shit...    ...I need a punching bag....

S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Annoyed, yes.   Ah, it's that time in every Shiloh students life that we all spend cramming for our exams. Our Midterm exams, the thing that can make your grade, or break your grade. So, right now, I'm sitting here listening to terrible music, and trying to cram info that I have no picked up over 9 1/2 weeks, without any of my notes, infact, without any information pretaining to the two WONDERFUL subjects in which I happen to have these exams in. Both of my core classes, with is like, so great, since they're on the same day. I can't complain too much. I mean, I'm reviewing for L.A.. And stuffing my mind of pointless history. Pointless history on pointless things I'll never need unless I'm on Jeapordy or I'm a histoian. Which means, God, save me from this class now. We all have those thoughts. But, since these 9 1/2 weeks went by so fast, what's to say the next 9 1/2 won't? Coach Waters, that's who. The satanic teacher that I have been oh-so-lucky to have teach me. As he reminds us daily, making us write long papers on relgions that we really don't care about. Making up do pointless speeches in class, for our peers to kindly sleep though.And then of course, there is the singling out and embrsassment of students, through a method he calls ""Roulette"". Sooner or later, I'm going to start playing that. With a gun. It's bad enough he's my World History teacher, making it impossible for me to get an A, he has to be at every Cross Country meet ever. His daughter runs. Comparison is never fun, and when you're slow, it's worse. It's bad enough I suck period, comparison is even worse. I've already measured up slow to the other 40-something girls on the team, why compare more? Because, it's a torture method. The only perk about this class is having Anna in there with me.  See, the thing with that is this. Anna and I had no classes together for the first...3 days. No lunch, we weren't even on halls close together. Then one day, Anna shows up in my first block. And then we have thrid together. We are...happy...about that.   Anyway. Hey, write me, and I'll be sure to answer. Gotta Gripe? Please, feel free to share.   Ja-na!"
S10ZJFQ,female,16,"Flavor of the week.    As for life, we see a lot of these, well, i see a lot of them. Short term relationships. It's the way to go if you ask me, unless, you decide to get attached. Attachment is something that no human being should do without consulting the person they've become attached to. Attachment is just like love, a grave mental condition that half of the teenagers in my high school suffer from. Which is the extact reason I've totally given up on love altogether. Finding your soulmate could take years, finding your lifemate could take decades, which I don't have time for. I refuse to go out looking for love now, because I'm totally convinced I can't find it out there. Love is just a stupid thing in my mind. You have someone else to support you, but aren't friends for that? So, you have sex. Get a condom and a friend without a STD and have a ball. Get birth contorl for God's sake. Love is just a painful and pitiful emotion. If you love someone, don't draw a heart around there name and yours, draw a circle, because a circle can never be broke, but a heart can be.     Well, bit of the winter break. i have nothing else to do but Run later, or just sleep. Which sleeping is sounding better and better to me right about now. Well, besides those things, I'm starting to write my book in my free time these few weeks that I have off from school now. Being in high school is a sucky thing, like, when you're in Advanced Acting. If you ask me, too cut-throat. But hell, they got themsleves into a hell of a lot of pain with me, they want the role, too damn bad, I've learned not to crumble, say all they want, They'll eat there words. When I'm famous...one way or another, I'll get there. Newspaper, books, movie director. See you there, this is just High school, deal with my insight, bitches.

""ill know you really love me if you have sex with me"" that's such bull that is self seeking and rude. So obviously its not the love the Bible is talking about! The ""love"" that is portrayed in America today is not love most of the time its lust! And its every where in the media. I watched 4 movies on Friday and every single one had a scene that was a sex scene or implied that the people had sex and almost every time after the people would be like ""I love you"". This makes me mad cause sex is something to be shared between two people who are married and only those people who are married. That's the way God intended it to be.    Like and Love two different things  When you love someone is unconditional supposedly. I mean kids my age sometimes do not like their parents but still love them all the same cause they are their parents. But that is a different type of love then ""I love you"" and even in that case I don't think that you always like the person. I mean I bet there have been times when my parents didn't like each other for things said or something done but they still loved each other. So when kids who date each other for like a week are like "" I am so in love with him or her"" its normally not true. I mean I would say that I am guilty of saying that before. But now that I have come to this conclusion I don't think I will so openly use the word love towards people. Except if I'm talking about the Christian sense of loving people in which we are suppose to love everyone like we love ourselves. But I'm defiantly going to think about it before I use the phrase ""I love you"" with some one again. Think about it  if you have any comments write me at punkchique53@aol.com later"
O8WR4EE,female,15,I was watching Daria today. I love that show its soo funny. They were talking about Romeo and Juliet. Daria was teaching a class and one of the students was like you agree that Romeo was a crazy guy in tights who was stalking the girl he met at the party to then. I was just like that is just funny that anyone would think of the story in that way even though its a tragedy. Well email me at punkchique53@aol.com if you have any comments like always.
O8WR4EE,female,15,"Friends  Friends, I think is it what  helps get or have gotten us through middle and high school.  Having good friends can be one of the most important things in someone's life. I mean if you hang out with the wrong set of people they could help in steering you down a path you don't want to take and pressure you into doing things you don't want to do.  I have an awesome set of close friends!! I mean Kylie is my number one girl and I love her to pieces and can tell her almost anything. Alex is my closest guy friends and I trust him and he trusts me and that is a very important thing with close friends. I mean honestly if  I didn't have my close friends I probably wouldn't be here right now. I mean that in all honesty. Kylie has helped me through so much stuff from school to boys and I feel kinda bad for her to have to go through all that stuff with me but she is my best friend and has always stuck by me. So I LOVE YOU KYLIE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND EVER!!!!!  Richie is good when I need a laugh. He is a little insane at times but hey what can you do he is Richie. Well I don't know I have a lot of friends but I'm only writing about a couple today. I almost forgot one but yeah Renea she is my little friend and almost knows to much for her own good I sometimes think. I can trust her with stuff in all confidentiality. Ok I'm done later."

O8WR4EE,female,15,"Confession  Jeff talked about confession tonight at church. How we should not just confess to God but to other people the sins that we are struggling with. And as I was listening  I felt a strong pull to confess not really to people but just to God and just to be open with Him, even though He already knows about it. The reason I think God wasn't calling me to confess to people like Jeff had said to do was because He knew it was something I first needed to confess to Him. I think that He also knew I didn't really trust any of the people we were suppose to go and confess our sins to 'cause I don't really know or have a friendship with any of them. So yeah I think that what Jeff was teaching was a good concept but that it is not the only way God forgives or helps people heal. So yeah that's all I'm going to type on that."
O8WR4EE,female,15,Word of advice be careful of the words you use.....and the things you say/type.

Leg Ache  - walked  a lot . been walking for  4 hours  had a mini round island expedition. took half day leave today.   1st stop: Kallang Sector - collect my pocket pc. I was told that old battery was bloated, sigh, I charged overnight. WILL NEVER DO SO AGAIN. Almost got lost at kallang sector. Was searching for the toshiba building around for more than 20 minutes... Half way through my journey I prayed 'papa, bring me there quick' then I found the 'promised land' within short time. THANK GOD! When I got there, suddenly found the aircon so cooling, the first time I went there, found it super cold as I was wearing bermudas.  2nd stop: KK hospital to sign as a surety for Hannah. she's going into nursing, signing a bond with KK.   3rd stop: Ang Mo Kio - had arranged to meet Pearline at 5pm to pass her the key to Rix's house, as she had cg there. THANK GOD i called her at 4.30, she told me her cg was cancelled.   4th stop: Plaza Singapura  (Shopping Spree)  bought contact lens case (3 colours: purple, transparent, turquoise). Hand cream and comestic brush at guardian. then went to buy ear piece for my Sony Ericsson handphone. (I walked from PS to Bras Basah)  5th stop: Bras Basah - went to buy a note book for my sheep, so that she can copy sermon notes and cg teachings. (Walked from Bras Basah to City Hall to take train)  6th stop: Heeren - meet my other sheep for dinner. she wanted to exchange a smaller t-shirt and bought a T-shirt at 37 degrees, promised to wear it together with her tml... washed it just now, hope it dries fast enough.   tat was some travelling, right?   3. Backache - due to too much walking, i guess. i was wearing a pair of ultra flat slippers...  4.

7RCKXOE,female,24,"hee, as the title suggests, 24 years ago, I came to this earth... 10 months before that, God knitted me together in my mother's womb... And His grace is still working in my life...  So many things that I want to Thank God for: 1. The air that I breath - Everyday I wake up I breathe another breath of God's mercy  2. My mama - for the loving care she dispenses -  got a photo of us at my work desk     3. My papa - for he has given his best to the family  Thanks to him for the yang yu zhi en     4. My kor kors - although we used to fight (bite them) when I was young, we are like frenz nowadays... keep disturbing each other *winks  5. My job - I believe that I am not working in my company by chance  6. My friends - primary, secondary, poly, uni  they have been in my life, all for a purpose! Gotta lead them to God!     7. My church friends - so surprised that ""French Fry"" called me just now to wish me happy birthday, so priviledged to have ""mouse"" as fren, shared few secrets with her, ""Eeyore and DZ""  always ""entertained""  with their jokes, for many many more people in my unit.  8. My shepherd and sheep -""meow"" is a good shepherd, while Sherry contributes cold air. Although they always  stumble  me with their brand of lameness.   The chance to serve God in His church is indeed a precious one. Thank God for His grace, love, faithfulness, providence.    No Greater Love    You loved me, when I was so unlovely   You sought me when I was lost   You showed me how much you really love me   When you bought me at the highest cost      There's no greater love than this (x2)   That a friend would give his life for a friend.      There's no higher sacrifice,   That a man would give his life      You have paid a precious price for me."

YAOMQ5O,female,23,"So what I thought might possibly be a date definitely is not.  The guy who asked me out on Monday just emailed me and made it very clear that it was going to be me and 4 guys.  Also, he just wanted to let me know that if I wasn't comfortable with that, he wouldn’t be offended if I didn't want to go.  I am so confused.  The way I interpret that is, ""oh no, now she is going to think this is a date and I DO NOT want to go out with her at all, even if someone paid me.""  So much for the self esteem boost."
YAOMQ5O,female,23,urlLink    What a great looking famliy!  urlLink
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"I didn't think that I wanted this new position in the detector lab so badly, but the closer my interview gets the more anxious I am. All three of the heads of the department are going to interview me at once, which will be a little intimidating.  I can just picture it now.  All three of them will be sitting behind a large shining mahogany desk staring down at me in a rickety rolling office chair with orange upholstery.  The room will be a little dark and shadowy except for the one bright hanging lamp above my head.  They will ask me questions about how to calculate the current flowing through a huge looped circuit and as the beads of perspiration start to develop on my forehead I will look to the ceiling trying to remember some fact I found trivial in school that would now impress them and show them I am worthy of such a prestigious position.  Yikes!  My interview is at 3 this afternoon in Boulder, so by 2:30 this work week will be over for me.  I'm heading down to Durango for the weekend with a group of friends, so there won't be any posts until I get back on Monday."
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"Alright, so the quasi date was supposed to happen last night.  I worked until 5 (way later than usual) and then went home.  It was a downpour, so I had already decided to bail on the invitation to play Frisbee golf.  At around 6 the guy called me and asked me if I still wanted to go.  I politely declined citing the torrential downpour as my excuse.  Plus, I just started a book that is proving to be way cooler than I thought it would be.  This is how the conversation went:  Him: so we are probably going to play at 7 Me: Umm, I don't really think I want to run around in the rain Him:  yeah, that’s what I told the guys, but they are still going to play so.... Me:  Well, I really don't want to be outside, so maybe we can just hang out some other time.  Thanks so much for inviting me, but I just don't think so.  (this is me trying to end the conversation) Him:  Well, how was work today (this was him trying to keep the conversation going) Me:  Not bad, (me confused at why he didn't take the hint that I didn't want to talk more)  What proceeded was about 20 minutes of him trying to ""get to know me"" like we were on a date or something.  You have to understand that I HATE talking on the phone.  I just can't do it.  It was bad.  I kept trying to make jokes and after everyone there was a little pause of silence like he didn't think they were funny.  The whole vibe I was getting was that he was really interested in me.  I just don't want to lead this kid on at all because he is the type of guy who is just so nice I would never want to hurt his feelings.  Also, he is too nice, I would probably never want to date him either.  I'm just trying to avoid all romantic entanglements this summer.    So when I finally got off the phone I was drained.  I tried to tell my roommate about it, but she was busy falling asleep while cuddling with her boyfriend, so she really didn’t give me the sympathetic response that I needed. I tried to relate this concern of someone maybe liking me and me not liking them to Eric, but he was of no help either.  He just said, ""Well, I don't know what to tell you.""  Maybe it is still too soon to go to him for guy advice.   Anyway, I read the whole evening and then went over to steal some of Brett's butterscotch chip cookies.  They were delish!"
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"I never write anything really interesting in this blog.  Lately it has just been a report of what happens to me every day.  To tell you the truth, I really don't think it is all that interesting to record the minutiae of what happens to me every day.  From now on I will try to limit myself to significant events that happen, or interesting thought that cross my mind.  If you want to know what's really going on with me, you can email me or even call.    My friend at work made me a copy of his mixed CD.  He is really proud of his CD creating ability.  Granted, it is cool when you put together a mix that has just the right feel, and every track builds on the one before it to make it a cohesive piece, but its not like you wrote the music.  I don't understand how one can take so much pride in putting together a CD, but he does.    I went to lunch with friends today.  I had a crush on this guy at work a year ago, and I haven't seen him in months. He was at the lunch and when I looked at him and talked to him for a while I was mystified by the realization that I was ever even slightly attracted to him.  What did I see in him? Maybe he's changed, maybe I have, but now I have no attraction to him at all.  It is weird when you look back at the people  you were interested in and you are completely confused by your old self's taste in the opposite sex.  Ya know?"
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"So I'm pretty sure the universe is completely balanced.  This morning I got into work and hated my job. I was hating the guy I work for and the stuff I'm doing and just everything about work.  Then, my functional manager called me.  Turns out I got a 5% raise that will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of July.  All of the sudden things don't look so bad.  Work is worth coming to every day.  Hooray.  I spent the rest of the morning wandering around campus talking to friends and enjoying the perfect 75 degree, blue skies day outside.  Then I went and got my car's registration renewed.  It was only $300, when I was expecting it to be $400.  Nice."
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"Just in case anyone cared, my new favorite treat is cold apple pie and hot chocolate.  Apple pie is alright on its own, and so is hot chocolate, but combined these two into a mid afternoon snack and you have a glorious explosion of ambrosial goodness.    (I am fully aware of how strange I am)"
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"Right now I am reading The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum.  Ordinarily I would never read this type of book on my own, but it came HIGHLY recommended by a good friend, so I’m giving it a whirl.  It started out kind of slow, but is getting better.  It is obviously a “boy” book, as the only female in the book is a clear conquest of the protagonist.  Actually, at first I was really turned off by the whole captor/captive love affair, but at least the chick has turned out somewhat intelligent, so maybe I’ll hold my feminist judgment until I’ve actually finished the book.  I saw the movie, but it is A LOT different from the book.  I can hardly even see a similar thread between the book and movie.  Why does Hollywood need to dumb down the characters to make them more palatable for the general masses?  Do they think we are some kind of brainless horde that can only appreciate sensationalism?"
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"So the Monday morning blogs are going to be really long because I don't have the internet and home and I come in early to use my work computer to enter all this stuff.  Just and explanation for the curious.....  The surprise part for Sarah went of without a hitch.  It was so fun to just have a group of close friends sit around and talk.  For some reason lately I have been cast as the court jester of my friends. I feel like I am the person that everyone is sitting around watching and waiting for them to say something funny.  I haven't been that person for a really long time.  I am not a ""yellow"" personality at all, but lately I feel like that is becoming my niche in the group.  Maybe it is because everyone else is dating someone so as the token single gal I feel like I have to perform to tear their attention away from their significant other.  Well, whatever the cause, I am quickly becoming the amusement of the group. I'm not really sure if I like it yet or not.  Stay posted.   So get this... Last Sunday (as week ago) my friend Greg invited me to go out on his boat on Saturday to do a little water skiing.  I love water skiing, so the promise of this activity is what sustained me through the hellish work week.  Also, I was my friend Sarah's birthday so I invited her and Colin to go with us.  I thought this would be fine because Greg told me to invite a couple of people. Anyway, I tried calling him Wednesday, then Thursday. I still hadn't heard from him, so I called his parent's home number.  I was that desperate.  I got a hold of him and he told me that his cell phone didn't get reception at his parent's house (where he is living for the summer between years of med school).  I thought, ""Convenient"".  Anyway, I lightheartedly asked him if we were in fact going to go out the next day.  He informed me that he actually had already invited other people, so there wasn't room for me.  I felt totally rejected. I hate it when I get ditched because it drags up fairly painful memories of high school parties that I didn't get invited to, or group outings that I was ""mistakenly"" not informed of.  Anyway, he was sincerely apologetic and said that we'd go next weekend, but how am I supposed to really believe that he wants to hang out with me.  Whatever.  His loss.   Instead, we went to the Denver Zoo. It was really fun and kind of disturbing at the same time.  One of the gross things that happened, that I can write about without getting totally nauseated, happened in the gorilla house.  We were just sitting there watching the gorillas, when the big male kind of rolled over and puked.  If that weren't gross enough, he then started to use his index finger to scoop it back up and eat it again.  This was totally nasty, but not the end. I guess he thought that the finger to the mouth technique wasn’t effective enough, because he then proceeded to lower his face to the cement and in two great slurps he sucked it all back up off the floor of his less than sterile cage.  I was gagging and had to look away or the little blonde headed 6 year old in front of me was going to have Katie puke all over him.  I really don't do well with that stuff.    An equally disturbing thing I saw at the zoo did not occur inside a pen, but amongst the onlookers.  I was just casually walking down the wide cement path between the snow leopard and the zebras when I saw it.  There was a four year old boy sitting in a stroller.  At first this looked normal until I noticed that this kid had a full on Mohawk.  The sides of his head were shave and everything.  The odd thing was that the parents looked totally normal.  I was totally confused.  Obviously this child was not going through any kind of self exploration or teenaged rebellion.  The parents had to have done that to their own kid.  I was totally confused.  What is this society coming to when normal looking parents give their kid a Mohawk.  Is this going to become mainstream?  If so, what will punk rock kids do to be ""different""?  Get a crew cut?    Sunday I was getting ready to go to church when I checked my phone and realized that I had a message.  It was my ex-boyfriend.  He had been spending the weekend in Utah at his brother's wedding.  His flight landed at 10:30, which was very inconvenient as church starts at 10.  Anyway, he was planning on taking the bus back from the airport, but he called me and left the most pathetic message I have ever heard in my life.  He said he was sick and couldn't take the bus and would I please come get him.  This was a serious dilemma for me.  Keep in mind that a month ago I asked him to take me to the airport before a week long trip and he said no, so I ended up paying $60 to park my car out there.  Anyway, it only took me a minute to decide that there was no way I was going to leave him sick and stranded at the airport.  He is my best friend here still.  Anyway, I told my roommate Amy about it and she said I should just let him figure it out on his own. I told my parents I was helping him and my mom thought it was a bad idea.  I got him home, went to the store to get him some sick person supplies, and then we both took naps at his house. Boys are such babies when they don't feel well.  I spent the whole rest of the day doing the mountain of laundry that had steadily built up to almost unmanageable girth.  It took me 5 hours.  I was going to go back over to his house to watch a movie, but I had a headache and went home.    I really wanted to go to church so that I could be rude to those guys who snubbed me for dinner last week, but I guess my immaturity will have to wait.  Darn."
YAOMQ5O,female,23,"Last night Eric took me to the Incubus concert for my birthday.  It was AWESOME!  I really love that band.  Brandon Boyd is a little weird, but for the show it was great!  I knew almost every song (they played some from back in the day when I didn't listen to them yet).  They played Drive, which was the song that introduced the band to me.  In the middle they dropped out all the instrumentals and two voices just harmonized and counterpointed the melody.  It was so cool.  Plus, it was great to go with Eric.  He is the best, and except for one awkward moment when we leant toward each other a little too close to hear what the other person was saying, everything felt completely platonic and fun.  I don't know why, but sometimes that kid can still make my stomach do a flip flop if he looks at me right.   I don't think that means I'm not over him, I think it means that I still think he's attractive, which is true.  I mean, the kid is hot.   I was going to go waterskiing before the show, but a storm decided to roll through during the precise hour I was out on the lake.  Bummer.  Tonight I am going to bed early.  I have to, I'm just exhausted.  Maybe I have mono."
CZUDUF7,male,23,Zenith   A few minutes ago the sun reached the highest point it will rise to in the sky in 2004.

CZUDUF7,male,23,"Had a bit o' fun yesterday afternoon. As I left the library I noticed it was five pm - just the time Helen finishes in the chippy in Beaumaris. I thought I'd drive over and suprise her - otherwise it takes her about an hour on the bus to get home. So I did. But I didn't know when she finishes or where exactly she works, but as Beaumaris is quite small I thought I'd give it a shot - well, it was a challenge! I parked opposite the bus stop on the main street. I didn't want to just sit there like a lemon, so I planned on waiting for only two songs on the Top 40. Just as the second song was ending, lo and behold, Helen appears! But she goes into the Spar shop. At this point I notice a Rolls-Royce parked in front, and a plan forms...  Quickly parking the car round a corner, I run back and wait opposite the Spar, behind the Roller. The plan is to wait for Helen to come out, quickly run round the front of the Roller, sit on it and ask 'wanna a ride home?', a la the Toyota Corolla adverts. However, the local lads are all hanging around on their FS Saracens outside the Spar, and soon notice me. At one point I thik I see Helen paying at the counter, so I sit on the bonnet of the Rolls. Minutes tick by. Helen doesn't emerge. Soon, one of the lads rides over and starts trying to poke fun at me. However he is exceptionally dim so it's not much of a challenge to rebuff him. He asks my name. 'Bob', I reply. What a dumbass. He thinks I fancy the girl who works in the Spar! I go back to leaning on the wall after he buggers off. Then one their older mates putters across on his moped, and asks if I've a problem. After asking him to repeat several times because his helmet is muffling, I inform him 'no, not at all', which leaves him rather flummoxed. He leaves too. After a while, the boys get bored and ride off. Thank god for that.  Anyway, I'm beginning to think the Spar has a second door I haven't spotted, so walk up a bit to see if I can spot Helen - she's reading the mags, naughty girl! Then it occurs to me that being a Sunday and all, the buses don't come very often and she's probably just killing time. I'd stil like to do my joke if I can though, so I crossed over to the bus stop. I can just read it without going in front of the Spar - next bus isn't for a half an hour! Then, because 'm so nice, I decide to creep on her inside the shop and make her jump. Just as I get to the entrance she turns round and come out. Cue me hidind behind a big column in the entrance, and walking round one side of it as Helen goes round the other! Then I creeep up to her at the bus stop - don't half make her jump! She's over the moon to see me! She's very tired - she worked at the chippy all Sunday and Saturday, then worked the bar in Verdis in the evening, so she's very glad of the lift. We agree to go running later.  When I came round to go for a run an hour later, she'd fallen asleep! She's very determined though - she got up and got changed (with me in the room! - but I didn't see any more than what I saw lat Wednesday, so it's hardly a big deal). We had a long run - 45mins - and my knee was agonising for the second half. It's a real shame - I love running with Helen and she loves coming with me. The pain stops as soon as I stop running and today it barely hurts at all, so I'll just grin and bear it for now. Don't think I can keep it up for long though. In the evening I watched 24 - superb - then went to PC room using Sandra's card, and surfed for MP3 proggies.  Today was a bit of a disaster - been very lazy. Spent the moring in bed fiddling around with CD rippers - few of them worked :(, but now I've got a good system to make MP3s with. Didn't even have breakfast until 11 - how lazy is that?? Napped and read (3001 - finished it) until about three, when I forced myself out of a kind of shame to get up. Went for a walk and saw the ponies in the field. Then cut the walk short after the ponies slobbered all over me to go home and clean it off :), then came down to the library, where I'm writing this (very long) entry."
CZUDUF7,male,23,"Bought a digital camera today! A Nikon Coolpix 2500, for just 150, from Currys. PC World nearly had me going all the way to Chester in search of the offer, until I remembered that PCW and Currys are part of the same company!  Also been spring cleaning the last few days. Cleared & cleared the area outside my room, and burnt (cool fire!) the boxes in the corridor."

CZUDUF7,male,23,Always another way   I burnt Caroline (the Russian) a CD of the bleep test that I  urlLink downloaded  from the internet (and added a few choice songs too afterwards :) ). She was overjoyed when I gave it to her. We're going to use it to do our own bleep test in the sports hall when we're next in!
CZUDUF7,male,23,"Back t'gym   Returned to Rivermead for the first time in five weeks today. Thank god, they've stopped playing MTV RnB (which just looped the same six songs over and over) for Q, which is mostly indie. Yay!  Made it at 11.59am, which is handy as it costs 1.80 from noon onwards :)  This is a different routine from my old 3x6 - quicker and, frankly, more enjoyable.   Squats  100kg 6 (well I just had to check I could still do it - felt good too!), 90kg 8   Wide-grip pull-ups  6,4   Db bench  18kg 11 (oops) 20kg 8   Db shoulder press  14kg 8   Cleans  3x3 30kg (that's a lot of threes)   Bent-over bbl rows  30kg 8   SLDLs * 60kg 8  A quick, effective whole-bod routine. I like :)  *Not sure if I should mention it, but when hurriedly loading the barbell for SLDLs, I idiotically hung 30kg on one side then took all the weights on the other end off - of course the bar flipped up tw@tting me in the face. Lesson learned!"

CZUDUF7,male,23,"Been loosing a little sleep over Iraq, I will admit. I'm a very empathetic person - Concorde, TWA 800, 9/11, even the Estonia, nine years ago, all cut me up bad.  Slept most of the morning, and ached like hell after the monster session at circuits last night. Tom thought it would be a good idea if we went outside for the warm up, and we ended up doing sprints up hill! The equivalent of a good intervals session for me. And then we did the circuits! Amusingly, circuits is becoming something of a dating agency. Last week Tom asked Bethany out, as this week another guy asked the girl I'd gone round with out in that usual, falterting crap-guy, style! It's funny, I didn't mind at all. It must be the Prozac!"
CZUDUF7,male,23,"So many things have happened since I last posted! There was the Rumi magic concert, the chaplaincy bbq, and then this last week the picnic to the woods with the big rope swing and then our trip to Sea Zoo with Joanna, Gareth and Sandra, followed by that late night when it was hot. But now I'm home in Reading visiting my folks, and missing Sandra and Sasha my hamster like hell. I'm here for a few days, then I'm supposed to be going to Bournemouth to visit Ruth, before returning to Bangor on the 28th. But I desperately want to return to Bangor before then. I guess I have to go to Ruth's though, I've said I will and I've got some of her stuff, plus I'm giving her a lift back! Maybe I can get her to come back a little earlier though. Sandra leaves for Germany on June 6; so little time left. As it is, I hate it here in Reading, after Bangor it's big and scary. I'm afraid to go out the garden gate!"
YIVJED7,male,15,"Being the nice day it was today, I decided to take advangtage of it and play some badminton. I've had a badminton net that has remained unused for quite some time now. My sister and I tried to put it together, but it was too complicated (read as: we were too lazy). So rather than going through the trouble of playing with a net, and with rules for that matter, we just served the birdie around. It was fun. My mom joined us after a while. We must've spent an hour playing, and I was pretty exhausted by the end. Yes, exhausted from  badminton . Man, I'm out of shape. :P"

YIVJED7,male,15,"Ketchup! I mean... catch up! It's not much, but I did make two  urlLink Oddities  catch up comics."
YIVJED7,male,15,"I went down the street to some generic resteraunt. Ate some yummies. The real reason I went, however, was because they were having some open mic thing down there. I though that sounded neat, and it's not like I have much better to do on a Thursday night. And it  was  nice. They had, like, three guitar players who were  really  good and two singers what were very good as well. They mostly did country and blues stuff, which really isn't my type of music at all. But I usually find that talent is undenyable and more or less enjoyable on some level."
YIVJED7,male,15,"That's right. I've become another victim to the addictiveness of  DRUGS  RAGNAROK ONLINE. Ian found me a snazzy private server and gave me some burned discs, so I wouldn't have to go through the  tedious  download times. Since, I've become completely hooked. Resistance is futile. Ragnarok has claimed my soul. :(   But other than that, pretty typical week. Worked. Made comics (Need to do two catch ups though! Oops!). Read. Idled on MSN all freaking day. Spending the day CHI-LESS. I swear, if I was stonger, didn't care about going to jail, and lived across the ol' Atlantic, I'd go and give BT a little Urza Smash. *TERRORIST THREAT, TERRORIST THREAT* Oh, just kidding. I would never do such a thing! *LIE, LIE, LIE* Hey, shut up. *OKAY*"
YIVJED7,male,15,"It's been a busy few days. Especially with relatives over. First, on Saturday, my gandparents came. We went on a walk in some marsh. Which sounds stupid. And more or less  was . I still got some pretty pictures though. I'll post them here if I can get the digital forms.  Sunday, there was some anniversary of some aunt of an aunt that I don't really know. But I didn't have to go. Thank god. OLD PEOPLE  SMAAASH .  Then, Monday, my uncle who's in the navy came home. But my grandparents don't know, because it's a surprise! OMG, the secrecy. Anyways, he'll be staying here till Saturday when we throw my grandparents a  seeecreet anniversary party  of their own. That might actually be fun, because apparently, I get to take pictures and video tape stuff. I'm  so  doing commentary. :D"
YIVJED7,male,15,"Since I didn't go to the Wednesday Market this week, I'll be doing it on Saturday instead since I'm a greedy, greedy person who wants money. ;) After which, I'll be going to my sister's and spending the night. Thus, y'all probably won't be seeing much of me, and I probably won't be able to make a comic. So, you know, unless one of my five readers would like to make a guest strip, no Saturday comic. S'right."
YIVJED7,male,15,"Besides waking up ridiculously early and working till complete exhaustion in the hot summer sun, today was a pretty good day. I don't know what is about Portland, but I'm quite fond of it. The architecture is wonderful, and the way the sun shines onto all the adjacent brick buildings is simply beautiful (I'd make that sound  less  corny if I wasn't so tired). I never really noticed how diverse it is though. I mean, Maine is definitely one of the least diverse places in the United States, but I did see quite a few different races and ethnicities. Some French (maybe) lady even bought some plants from me whilst talking some kind of... Franglish? That was pretty weird. She called me ""bebe."" WTF? XD  So after a long day of selling plants, we packed up and went to the bar that my dad frequents. While he talked to his friends, I attempted to find the comic store that the guy at the Casablanca Comics in Saco also runs. With no prevail. I'll have to find a map, since that part of the city is FREAKING HUGE. And the people that live around there scare me. Thugs.  I'd go to sleep now, but going to sleep at 9:00 is a sin. Even for an atheist."
YIVJED7,male,15,"So I ended up spending most of today planting stuff for my dad. Not  exactly  how I like to spend my summer days, but hey, I get paid. I planted about three rows of plants. These aren't little kiddy fun-time rows though. These are  huge, monster, commercial farming  rows. It was hot and the rocks were hell on my knees. Even with knee pads. So I'm pretty exhausted and dirty right now. I think I'll go take a shower. A nice, cold shower. And then I'll drink some lemonade. Yesss, lemonade."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"My girlfriend has been gone for two days now, going on third, and now she's telling me she wants to stay another day to visit a friend of hers. Yeah. At least I got to say an extra goodbye, because she had to leave a day later than originally planned, and I just happened to run into her at the train station as she was leaving. Sometimes the sun just seems to shine a bit brighter, even when it isn't.  I was at work Friday; then I got absolutely drunk with my old friend (the one who was passing out muddy hugs at Roskilde). We watched cheesy anime, jumped around to Orgy and assorted punky delights, then fell asleep to an SVCD of Futurama episodes.  The next day, on Saturday, I was at work again for a few hours (we close at 3pm on Saturdays); then we repeated the process, sans the jumping around. On the other hand, we watched an absolutely spectacular piece of Japanese cinema, entitled  urlLink Mini Moni - The Movie , whilst drinking beer. To say that it didn't floor us would be to say that the ocean isn't sorta wet, but the real shocker didn't come until the credits had finished rolling (whilst amusing outtakes were shown), when one of the main characters appeared on screen, stuck her face obscenely close to the camera, and softly uttered: ""To tell you the truth ... I'm a mango.""  At that point, we realized that alcohol may have been too weak a drug of choice for us.  In other news, working at a record store has acquainted me with the following works of art that I am currently in the process of delving much, much deeper into:  Dillinger Escape Plan  - ""Miss Machine""  Deadsy  - ""Commencement""  Mnemic  - ""Mechanical Spin Phenomenon""  Plus, I just got a hold of Tweaker's ""2 AM Wakeup Call"", though I haven't listened to it yet.  Shit, I miss her. A whole  week?!  Yeah, as if I need any  more  mental anguish."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"So last night, the lead singer of my band and I got very drunk on red wine, went down to the dorm bar and asked if we could do a little late-night performance. So we dragged my stereo, keyboard, computer and his guitar and amplifier down there, played four or five songs for drunk hiphopsters, and had a blast. Then, they offered us a real gig with our real band while giving us a beer. The bar men, that is; the hiphopsters were just troublemakers and left shortly after we stopped playing (which they weren't really paying attention to, anyway).  Earlier this week, L. and I went to B.'s house and got trashed. Actually, we sat outside in the sun drinking beer in front of B.'s house for a good thirty minutes, because B. apparently went to the park with all his friends and forgot we were coming ... not that we're complaining. L. threw up early on and went to sleep (although, from all the noise we were making, he probably didn't get a lot), whilst someone managed to convince me and two others (including B.) to run around the house naked. Ah, to be young again... and also a robot.  My girlfriend is coming home today. Yay!"
N85DQ0I,male,23,"Pardon the theatricals; I just felt like saying it. Of course there are many other great anchors of my sanity in the world than my synthesizer.  But I hear all this great music in my head. At least, what I  think  is great music. Actually, let me re-emphasize that: what  I  think is great music. But whenever I do, for some reason, I'm always miles away from my synthesizer, where I can comfortably record it, lest it fall prey to my abhorrently bad memory and be forever lost in the haze of great ideas that could've been, but never were.  For instance, right now I have this great idea for a 12/8 up-tempo march-like rhythm with a staccato guitar chord on every first beat, which would sound right at home with those lame-ass garage bands that radio stations frequently mistake for rock'n'roll. Then, once the build-up to the chorus is done, let it simmer for a while in some freeform ambient thing for only one bar, and then explode in the most fiery distorted mess you've ever heard, with cymbals a plenty, thrashy no-chord guitar frenzy, and — by all means — throaty screaming. And then, once that's done, go straight back into the radio-friendly 12/8 up-tempo thing again.  See, descriptions fall appallingly short. It sounds horrible on paper. But it sounds brilliant in my head. I wish I had my synthesizer so I could show you all.  I have a feeling everybody has this symptom. Some are even less fortunate than I, in the sense that they can't even bring the music in their head into something tangible they can show others. Man, that makes my heart ache, thinking of all that brilliant music going to waste."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"This must be the umpteenth time I've tried to get a working blog going. Don't ask me why I keep torturing myself like this.  I suppose the incentive, this time around, was that my paternal grandfather recently passed away, and my grandmother told me about the diary he kept. It wasn't an earthshatteringly profound and philosophical diary; it was just the ""went to the yard, then had dinner"" sort of diary. But — I'm the nostalgic type. I like to reminisce. I can't help it. I even look back at the old, failed attempts at blogging and think, ""Oh, is  that  what I did that day? How cool."" I even keep old photographs. I mean  really  old. Of people I don't even like. There, now you know it.  So I remembered why I even wanted to start a diary in the first place. Just to be able to go back, a year later, and think, ""Oh, so that's what I was doing on that particular day."" You know, the tried-and-true practice of wallowing in the past instead of keeping your head level on present day tasks. It all works out.  Which means I think I'm finally at peace with what this shit's supposed to be. It's not supposed to have any point. Therein lies the point, or rather, the absence-of-a-point of a diary. Truth be told, I'm not sure why I'm even publishing this online instead of writing it down in a calendar, and the only reason I can think of that'd answer that is, I don't have a calendar.  This'll be nothing more than a recap of what I've been doing. Nothing incredibly fancy. Just like any other blog.  Detractors may break my kneecaps now."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"I thought it was supposed to be good news when the temp agency phoned me at 9am yesterday morning, telling me to report to somewhere at 2pm, because they'd finally scrounged up a job for me. Little did I know what anguish and stressful suffering I was in for.  I've now been there twice (once yesterday, one today), and I've already come up with at least a million great things I want to say when I tell these people I quit. Such as ""you can take this job and shove it"", ""this is the worst job I've ever had"", or — my personal favorite — ""oh, by the way, this job sucks - would you fire me, please?"".  Actually, to be honest, there were a lot of them far more creative than that, and I gleefully anticipated every response I might get, expecting my smile to rise in tempo with their ire.  But, I'm getting ahead of myself. See, it's basically an assembly line gig for a big supermarket chain. I'm working at the main warehouse for this chain, where all the groceries and shit gets distributed to all the individual stores around, oh I dunno, this island, I suppose. Might even be the whole country, but I doubt it.  Anyway, here's my job:       - Shit comes down a chute      - I pick shit up and place it neatly on a platform      - Once said platform is full, I launch it      - Platform returns empty      - Repeat  Sounds easy, right? Well, it is. If you don't count the facts that the hours are lousy, the stress is insurmountable, the shit comes in all different sizes and shapes that just never, no matter how hard you try, will fit onto this fucking platform, and on top of everything, they tell us that this is just a training period and they'll knock up the machine to double speed next.  After two days, every limb of mine is sore from crawling up these goddamn chutes to release some shit that's gotten stuck, and after eight hours of trying to squeeze various oddly-sized cardboard boxes full of cat food and marmelade onto one all-too-small platform after another, I simply cannot wait to tell management — and the temp agency — where they can stick this fucking job.  A couple of my coworkers were talking about how they've figured out why they're hiring temp workers for this gig instead of simply just hiring people, and the answer is of course that the work is so hideously tedious and stressful that ordinary employees would simply leave too quickly. The logic, apparently, being that temp workers are more desperate for the cash and can't afford to leave so soon — and, sadly, they're right.  Did I mention that this job starts at 3pm and ends at 11pm? And we only get a half an hour break? And that, while you watch those two last hours tick away, you'd dearly wish someone would come up to you and tell you you're fired, just so you could go home early?  But my salvation awaits.  I went to the local record store today, and it just so happens there seems to be a fairly large number of openings there.  Tomorrow, I'm giving them a ring and see if anything positive turns out from this.  If not, then maybe, if you live in the area, you might read about a guy who went nuts and tried to stab himself with a tin of tuna."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"I've been accepted to RUC, on an international education. My girlfriend has been admitted to English studies at Copenhagen university. I guess that means I'll only be working at the record store on weekends, but everyone seems surprisingly non-plussed about that. Of course, they were all stoned at the time I told them ..."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"After work, not only the big boss (the guy with the job interview), but also the guy in charge of the local store I work at, got me stoned.  I guess that's how the music biz works.  Following that, my girlfriend and I sort of double-dated over  urlLink some cute, computer-animated nonsense  with a nearby-living friend of ours and his girlfriend.  Not really an action-packed day, but there you have it."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"My girlfriend was out last night, so I shared a bottle of wine with a friend of mine. Then he left, and I shared the next bottle with myself. Then, I walked to town and requisitioned a third bottle. And upon my return, I spent the entire evening listening to loud music, watching music videos, and harrassing the lead singer of my band on IRC.  Now, I am one hung over honky, waiting for my folks (and widow grandmother) to come pick me up, which will happen in approximately twenty minutes.  In other news, I've managed to get  urlLink WordPress  up and running. Now I just need to learn how to configure it, and I can escape this blogging hell once and for all. Muhahahahaaa!  (I was planning on spending the morning doing a nauseating  urlLink Kapitalen Klash -track, using the Futurama sample in this posts title as a starting point, but I couldn't find the sample anywhere, so my inspiration left me. Oh well. I think the world has enough noisy half-assed hungover industrial music for now, anyway.)"
N85DQ0I,male,23,"I've spent the last two days coming from work, stoned, making angry, angsty industrial music, as part of the band  urlLink Mekanik Kampf .  We've done two songs so far that are almost done, save for a few tweaks:   March Mein Führer  A reworking of an old track of our leadsinger's. He did most of the work; I did some synth; then we collaborated on editing and mixing.   Substance Abuse Whore  A new track, written from the ground up. I laid down probably half the beats, did most of the synth work, wrote 70% of the lyrics, and then we collaborated on editing and mixing this one as well.  And I've written the synth line for a third track, which is definitely in the silly 80's genre, so it'll probably be a hidden track or something. I laid the ground work for it yesterday (lead, bass, drum programming, for both verse and chorus, as well as an ambient intro), and he's tiddling with it now as we speak.  It's fun doing a project like this, because the guy is very serious and enthusiastic about the music. Lyrics-wise, it's the same ol' hate-the-world slop, but it's nice to be able to get rid of the last bits of teen angst that may still be left in me."
N85DQ0I,male,23,"urlLink Stranger than Paradise  was the name, and the mud rose high during the raging rain showers and coursing winds that, occasionally, allowed extended pockets of calm, sunfilled moments to filter through. Although the rain and wind were determined to cause damage of biblical proportions, our camp held up, thanks to the valiant efforts of our camp leader, who constructed a veritable Titanic of a fortress for us to remain warm, snug, and — above all — dry throughout the festival.  Too many good memories to recount in detail, but here's a few good ones:  - One of my friends got blisteringly drunk, staggered to the stage of a poetry slamming competition in the Spoken Word tent, signed in under a pseudonym he'd made up on the spot, and proceeded to jackhammer his way through an improvised headscratcher of a monologue, which centered around an offer to strip naked with the assurance that he was really going to do it, with an impressively straight face. The contents of this monologue, which lasted all of 45 seconds, got him boo'ed off stage, receiving the lowest possible grade imaginable. Consequently, the monologue — which also included a ""magic"" act that involved him throwing a coin in the air and then catching it, throwing his arms out grandiously upon succeeding — became the source of staple catchphrases in our camp for the remainder of the festival.  - Our most punked-out camp member, whose idea of a psychedelic experience last year was ingesting four times the recommended dosage of stomach relief pills, started each morning with a shot of 70% proof illegally imported Absinthe, then vigorously insisted that everybody else who got out of their tents do the same. I'm pretty sure he wasn't the only one who brought Absinthe, though, because an alarming amount was being gleefully passed around during the first two days (which remain a fuzzy haze in my memory), and there was still some left on the penultimate day.  - David Bowie cancelled and was replaced by — hang on to this one — Slipknot. Yes, the metal band. Talk about a genre switch.  Plus, they had to be specially flown in to perform at 7pm for the festival, then immediately get on a plane to perform in Germany at 2am.  - Another of my friends, who usually has a reserved, shy demeanor about him, took a tumble in the ankle-high mud pools that had formed all over the festival grounds as a result of near-constant rain showers. Blisteringly drunk, of course, as well as ridiculously stoned, he attempted to offer himself up as a huggy bear for any Norwegian girls passing by. It wasn't until my girlfriend, also absurdly inebriated at this point, started pimping him out to various passer-by's, camera in hand, that things really took off. Eventually the rain forced us inside, but the mud hugging party will forever remain a special event.  - A similar event took place the night before, when the mud was barely forming and the terrain was still easy to traverse. Two friends of mine — one was tripping on shrooms for the first time and having the time of his life, and I'm quite sure so was the other one — started handing out hugs to everyone who walked by, claiming it was in the spirit of the festival. The punch line here, if one can call it that, is that, in sobriety, everyone of us are reserved, sarcastic, bitter husks of people, of varying degrees — the punch line being that the hugs were handed out with genuine love; no tongue-in-cheek. A special, rare humanitarian moment.  - Then there was the beer situation. Everyone had basically put down an order to two of my close friends, who then went to Germany two days before the festival began, and made the purchase (beer being significantly cheaper when you cross the border). Of course, this meant smuggling way more beer than allowed across the border, but despite being held up at customs check, they somehow managed to employ the Jedi Mind Trick and were allowed to continue. Approximately 100 cases of beer (24 cans for each case, most of them Gold beer) were brought to camp. Everything fucked up, all the cases arrived at the camp simultaneously, and out of fear of thievery (having that much beer at a festival in plain sight is like putting up a neon sign outside your camp, saying ""We're Ignorant Dolts - Beer Is On Us!""), we stashed them all in the tents with no consideration for who ordered who. After a shortlived drunken debate, everyone just sort of agreed that all cases were deemed Public Domain, and the rest of the festival ran surprisingly smoothly under these conditions. Who would've thought the spirit of solidarity could be sparked out of the drunken paranoia of not having a morning beer when you woke up?  - A tape recorder, three drunk people, and an empty side of a tape. What to do? I know! Let's go around the festival grounds (which, on our side, was primarily occupied by foreigners from other Scandinavian countries) and enquire about their sexual orientation. And let's have the drunkest of us three kneel down in the center, promising the interviewee that, should the questions cross his/her threshold, he/she was encouraged to administer punishment to our kneeling companion. Everything went great until we stumbled across a young girl who proudly exclamated that she liked being fucked in every bodily orifice you can squeeze an erect penis into. We kinda felt that couldn't be topped, so thus ended the game. We named the tape  Boogie-Lise's Videodagbog , which is only funny for Danes so I won't bother explaining. It was originally supposed to be a festival diary, but every night we'd get drunk and forget all about it, so it only ended up containing the initial entry, and then half an hour of nonsense about Swedish bisexuality. I, for one, hope I never hear this tape sober.  - My girlfriend, the sweetest thing, got absolutely drunk after a show involving hip hop and Muppets, and started jumping around in the mud like a little 10-year old girl, and taking pictures of everything that awed her. I've never seen anything cuter.  - And, of course, being able to go to sleep with my girlfriend every night made it all so much better.  There are tons of other stories, of course, but these are all I can think off of the top of my head. The rest will have to come later.  For now, I'm home with my folks, having all the mud washed out of my clothes. It's back to the real life, which I dread enormously. First thing tomorrow: I make good friends with the social institution that will, hopefully, be paying next months rent. Wish me luck."
OI21F2X,female,26,I really loved this snap. I somehow felt it resembled a painting. Some wierd activity was going on in the sky. Can you try to figure out what the clouds look like?  I thought I could see a cat preying on a duck. What about you? 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink scenery_3 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink swapna bolleboina .
OI21F2X,female,26,"The summer course on reading has made me feel enthusiastic about readign again. After a very long time I have started to enjoy reading.   Well, reading was just a hobby for me and I never liked to stick to books all the time. For that matter never like to do anything at a stretch.  But somehow I am improving my reading and analysing skills through this class.  Was just wondering about my school years and the books I read. Frankly speaking,during my school years I used to spend very little time reading. But that little time was spent reading champaks( I luved the illustrations) some old chandamamas which my Mom had collected from the time we were too young to read. Other than that I luved browsing through the magazines my father bought. And of course ""WISDOM"" was a real good book. I luved to read it and it for sure enhanced my general knowledge and my thinking.   As I had an elder sister I did not have to worry about buying or borrowing books for the coming year.As she graduated to a higer class all her text books were mine.And during those times we had very interesting stories for our supplementary books and texts. So most of the time I used to read my text books ahead of time( well not the text but the supplementary texts which had very interesting stories by various Indian and international authors).  It was again a sort of peer pressure( or rather jealousy or maybe sibling pressure:)). My sister used to use the context of these stories which she had for her class and I used to feel j. And then as soon as I could grab them I used to read them and boast that even I knew Trojan war and Don Quixote.I wanted to be ahead of her or rather tried to oversmart her but was never successful:).   However, I am glad to have read all those books in my formative years which contributed a lot in improving my vocabulary, my creativity and my memory( I still remember them:).In fact the best part of my supplementray texts were the biographies of the authors.I now feel that those biographies had influenced me to a great extent. In fact they have developed my inquisitveness to relate a person's background to his achievements.I learnt a lot from them and had a crush on quite a few:).     We had a lot many stories written by some of the famous Indian authors and Premchand was my favourite. I really liked his stories. They almost often spoke of the struggles of the people in those times.Well, somehow I had a crush on Premchand at that point of time and liked all of his stories which I read. I also liked  ""Macbeth"", ""As you like it"" and "" The merchant of Venice""  by Shakesphere. Leo Tolstoy was another favourite author of mine.  However the most favoruite books of mine were those written by ENID BLYTON. I loved to read her books. They were all fantasy stories wherein the trees could grow candies:) and the town always had some or the other festival of some sort.  The charachters were very funny and interesting.There were gnomes, pygmies and  what not. I just can't remember any now. But I used to love reading those books. Her stories always an interesting end with a moral.  Thus a part of my childhood was spent in reading some real interesting stuff. But I just can't remember as to when I stopped enjoying reading. Could be somewhere in the seventh standard when the fear of board exams were induced in me. However, it's always nice to think back and remember those times especially when I have to read similar stuff for my student. Needless to say I enjoy reading them even now and wish my text books were as interesting as the Enid Blyton and the Munshi Premchand stories:)."
OI21F2X,female,26,"It's been quite some time since I blogged in and wrote something. Well,wanted to get into some serious stuff but will be writing on it after I am done with my summer class. Proffessional knowledge would be more beneficial than my experience in this situation. However, I am just enjoying some change around me. Feels like I am in India now. It's so hot. 99F and scorching heat. But the best part is the beautiful flowers and plants which bloom all over the place. They make the whole summer look so beautiful. Well, had been to the Mormontrek heritage festival.Not a great thing happening around but it was kinda interesting. Well, in case you didn't know anything about Mormons, they were the first pilgrim fathers or the Europeans who travelled in handcarts to settle at different places in the United states.  The whole last week was a busy one attending classes and working at the International center. Well, a part of the activities of the summer clinic was to introduce oneself to the whole class. And the way it was done was quite interesting and funny. Each person was told to say something about themselves and then were asked to share three artifacts which they cherished the most. It was funny for me cos sharing three or more artifacts or something about themselves would hardly give a glance into that person's personality. Any way each one brought their stuff to school and showed them to the class. The interesting thing was that almost 80-89% of the class brought the pictures of their husbands/boyfriends/girlfriends/family members,football or something to do with the ball games, books they like to read/are reading and of course the T-shirts to represent the school or the place where they work. Well, so it seemed that almost all of them had the same tastes or things they think of to share.   However I was no different but I tried to be different( this is what I always try to be). I am not a great fan of cricket or a ny ball game nor do I have a family. Well, I would luv to share the pics of my parents and my siblings but I had none. So was wondering what could I take to the class to show everyone. Well, I remembered that I had carried my hat which was gifted by this girl from Mizoram. During my visit to Delhi we became very good friends and on the last day she left a straw hat for me as a rememberance. I had carried it all over ot the US with me. Though I never used the hat often it was something I really liked, so I carried it with me. Well, I had my diary which was quite old but it is important as I share my apprehensions, my excited moments and some real important introspections and happenings in my life. In fact everything I write in it will give the reader an analysis of what was going on at different periods of time. And then what more.... hmm yes, I have the habit of collecting flowers and leaves unique to a certain place. Well I did have some which I had pressed and kept in my book so decided to take them . And then I had my T-shirt which was gifted to me for tutoring undergrad students in psychology. So here I was with more than three artifacts to share with the class:).  Of course thus tried to be unique in my own way.But do u think it really did tell something about me to the class? No way. I am more than what I tried to show to the class. Well, I feel everyone was something else than what their artifacts spoke.Of course their artifacts did represent something about them but for sure didn't give a true picture of the person. Now I can't understand as to why I am so bothered about the true identity of each and everyone.But I was just wondering as to why everyone one thinks in a similar way or for that matter why do we differ. Sounds puzzling but .....ok now if I start again then I will be talking about the cultural diversity and stuff like that. It's late in the night and I will stop here."

OI21F2X,female,26,"As I was flipping through my diary and reading the contents of it, I felt like sharing this hypothesis of mine. I always thought that an equillibrium in the reactions of a person makes him more better.The Newton's third law of motion which explains about the equillibrium in the action and it's reaction can be applied to explain human behavior too.  Most often my experiences assert the point that no one is an introvert or an extrovert.Pertaining to the behavior of a person, I assume that every person can and usually acts in the opposite way which might be unusual about him. It is rather the situations or the comfort level which determine the behavior of the person. Subconsciously every person acts and also reacts to the same action in the equally opposite way. This in fact brings harmony and balances his mental level.Though the degree and the duration may again vary but every person has to be expressive and also reflective or pensive.  A person who is a very complying and obliging employee can be a bossy person at home or with a certain person. This brings about a balance and harmony in the individual. This happens to me several times. I behave in excatly contradicting way in different situations. Especially in a new situation I might be too quiet and have that innocent and ""ignorance is bliss"" sort of an expression while my roommates would have just the opposite interpretation of my nature.My periods of chattering have to be balanced with placid periods.  After reaching the peak of saturation and undergoing all sorts of tragedies without reacting, the person has to break into tears or react in opposite way to ventillate his emotions. This also balances his mental stature.Well, this again proves it: Every action has or should have an equal and opposite reaction."
OI21F2X,female,26,"As part of my coursework I have to cover topics based on cultural diversity and the efforts to be made to make everyone comfortable,merge all the differences at the same time help each other to relate to their culture and heritage.    Now I was just wondering about the diverse cultures we have back in India. The different religions and the different castes. The different languages and the dialects.The different physicial features and etc.. etc.. Of course the one thing which unifies all is that we are of the same race.Now, what comes into my mind is that we never had a class wherein we are taught about our diversity, how to cope up with the tamil language when you go to Chennai(it's really hard to survive if you didn't understand Tamil),how to relate yourself to the Indians from the eastern part(Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh etc..) and how should you mingle with a parent who is of different religion.(No offense on the regions or religions I mentioned please..I just wanted to make my point clear.)   Moreover we never fail to associate with our family background and culture and our language and dialects.It seems we have a natural tendency to adjust ourselves according to the situations and diverse cultures. Now my question is that if we are far more efficient in amalgamating everything and are far more efficient in merging our differences why do we still have the class and religious feuds? Why do we still have riots and curfews?"

1F7C1PZ,male,23,"Thank god its finally over... BUt, it was not a good experience... I admitted myse;f to my own hospital, my own ward which i work. I was so touched that my colleagues actually booked a single room for me... hehehe.... I tried to make everybody's life easier by doing my own stuff like admissions, took my own BP.. almost everything, basically was like a staff nurse in charge of myself.  Was kinda bored coz i came alone.. but then i hang out with my colleagues and help out with the so called ""backstage"" work. Seriously I was very nervous... Then abt 4pm, Shah came.. yeah Shah the air steward guy... yeah the one who frantically tried to stop me from getting into Arse's hungry stomach... but Arse ate me anyway... He brought his GF along.. shall not discuss that, Nas will get really super angry if he noes,  doesnt like me to talk abt shah's gf that much. He brought me apples and longans???? which obviously i wont consume so i ""donated"" it to my colleagues outside... they were pretty happy.  I basically ate and slept..  NExt morning was the operation. I went down to OT at 12pm.. it felt weird, totally weird that i was pushed on the trolley... ok i had to agree with my pateints that yeah.. it was irritating when they started asking me abt my particulars... coz they kept asking and asking again.. Went from induction to anaesthesia area... met this anesthetist... DR Lee Pang.. eyah... i looked at his name tag.... coz HE'S DAMN GOOD LOOKING!!!! He helped me to get my Ot gown sleeve off.... OH MY GOD!!! kwakakakaka...... haha... no lah hes just trying to set my plug and the sleeve was in the way.Next i saw my surgeon... Uncle Chan Yew Meng..... yeah i picked him to do my tonsils. The nurse gave me anaesthesia... and it all came back.  When I did my squint eyes when i was about 4 years old... they tried so hard to get me to go to sleep. I remember there was this malay male staff nurse... said "" adik, put on the mask brethe in and out... just think ur with the care bears floating ard"".... AND I DID THOUGHT OF THE CARE BEARS!!! So when I was in the OT yesterday I remembered the whole scene again.. and yes i thought of the care bears... and the next thing I knew it felt like in the matter of minutes... "" Annisa, Operation over.."" And I got difficulty in breathing and it felt like an asthma attack....so the missy gave me Ventolin:Atrovent:N/S Neb abt 5 minutes... felt so much better... i was more concern of the nause rather than the pain.... then i was sent back to the ward. Sister Chan picked me up.  and she wasnt of any help at all... I vomitted blood which smelles horrible... and i vomitted again... it was so traumatic... I hate puking and feeling dizzy... and best of all thats when i got lots of visitors. Nas, my sis, Arsyad, Juliana, Usha and my parents and uncle came... it was like.... i got a headache... tyhey left abt 9pm. so i went straight back to sleep... Karen and Santhi was on Night so they came and checked on me..  I woke up abt midnight. I felt so much better. I came out met sister Aziah. I ask Karen to remove my drip... and i went back to sleep.. I was so giddy still...  and im giddy now... going to lie down cont tomoro morning.... and my mouth hurts... i cant yawn!!! damn!!!"

3R8IB78,female,25,"I've been going through a lot of ""stuff"" in the process of packing.  I have found many things I'd forgotten about along the way.  One is a notebook I used to carry with me everywhere.  It has everything in it:  Phone numbers, love letters, audition information, cartoons, random thoughts.  I've had this notebook pretty much since I moved to New York, so you can imagine the stuff that's in it.  I decided not to toss it.   Another thing I found is a song that was written for me.  I'd like to share it with the world, as it comes from the absolute happiest part of my life.  A man I once loved wrote this:   I'm starting from scratch I feel so brand new And I've never been happier than when I'm with you. I stare at you silent, deep in your eyes And I know you see the me I lost in all of my lies  I could walk with you forever Each second I see something new And I'd be the happiest man in the world If I could stay right here with you.  A kiss on each corner, a walk around noon Each moment is beautiful because of you My hands are so rough, tongue ties everywhere But with one look from you I could dance in the air  I wonder just what you see When you look into my eyes 'Cause I've spent the past years convincing myself There's nothing in me but goodbyes  But now I'm with you and I hope that you'll stay To laugh with me, cry with me, share every day So, I'll hold you close and whisper in your ear: That when I breathe you in it's magic, my dear.  I could walk with you forever Each second I see something new And I'd be the happiest man in the world If I could stay right here with you.   To the composer:  Thank you for everything.

3R8IB78,female,25,"Tonight I saw Stephen Sondheim's  Assassins .  It was amazing.  Two things really struck me as extemely moving and unbelievably well thought-out.  The first is the use of a projector image of JFK's assassisnation onto the white t-shirt of the Lee Harvey Oswald character, just after he is convinced by John Wilkes Booth to kill the president for all the attention and notariety he could ever dream of.  The second is the idea that all these people did what they did for the love of another human being.  John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln for the love and adoration he wasn't getting as an actor.  Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate Gerald Ford for the love of Charles Manson. (Isn't that messed up?!)  John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan to show Jodie  Foster how much he loved her.  In the play, Oswald finally decides to kill JFK in order to win the love of friends and family, instead of committing suicide.  Love is a very powerful thing, not ever to be taken lightly.  It makes people crazy in every possible way."

3R8IB78,female,25,"Man, Talon's most recent weblog post and Geoff's response to it have really put me in a funk.  It generally talks about women's behavior in regard to relationships.  I can't help wondering if what's going on between Geoff and I instigated any part of that post.  The thing is that we (women) can't make adjustments, can't fix things unless men express to us through words (not telekinesis) that something is bothering them.  I know that I've always been willing to listen to anything a guy I'm dating has had to say, but the problem comes up when he won't say anything.  I can't help feeling that if Geoff had been honest with me about this last situation, instead of just assuming I could figure out what was wrong even though he wasn't telling me, I would've been able to better deal with it.  Instead, for two weeks I was left guessing and trying to put the pieces together.  It was rough, at one point I worried that he was dead.  It drove me absolutely insane.  The good news is that I'm recovering.  The bad news is that the only way I know to recover is to become cold and distant - two of the biggest complaints about women.  What to you want me to do?  Wallow in my sadness and grief until I die?  Forget it.  Yes, I'm sad and hurt, but I can't continue to waste entire days wishing that I could fix things.    So to answer Talon's question:  I can't speak for all women.  However, what I want is someone who likes me, who is willing to grow with me through the good and the  bad , because there will be bad.  Someone who understands that relationships are never stagnant, but ever changing and is willing to let go and ride the waves. Someone who can teach me things and wants to learn from me also.  Most importantly, I want someone who will let me try to make them happy.  Men have walls too.  So when I find one who will let those walls down, I'll know I've done well...    I've never been one to group all men into a category.  I've known too many, I guess.  I've met a few men that I could be willing to spend my life with.  But the thing is, it's such a careful balance to find that perfecct relationship."

9NHKLUS,male,16,"As of today, my grandpa is a remarkable 90 years old. In celebration of his birthday, my family will be meeting at our grandparents' home in Columbus, Kansas for lunch tomorrow. I'm really excited to see my grandparents and cousins again, for what will be the first time in about eight months. We normally only see each other during Thanksgiving, and occasionally we visit our cousins in Tulsa, Oklahoma, so this should be nice. The only downside to this visit is that we will only be staying for a matter of hours. Everyone seems to have obligations the next day, so it has been hard enough just to set aside a few hours. Anyway, we will be leaving for Columbus around 8:30 tomorrow morning and returning sometime in the early evening.  So, for what's left of today, I wish a happy birthday to my grandpa, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of my family tomorrow."

Just watching all of the seniors get their diplomas made me look forward to next year. Not only do I look forward to graduation, but I'm also excited about all of the things that I get to do as a senior. Yeah, that's pretty sappy.  My school year came to a close today, as I took my first and last final in Precalc/Trig. Luckily, I pulled through with an A on the test and an A in the class. Along with the A that I got on my chemistry test on Tuesday, I now have a 4.0 GPA for this semester, which was completely unexpected. I seriously thought that I would get at least one B this semester, but somehow I saved myself at the last minute.  On another note, my photo teacher let me borrow a Lomo LC-A for the summer so I can test it out and decide if I want to focus on Lomo for my portfolio next year. I'm surprised that he would trust me with it for the whole summer. I think I'll go sell it on eBay.  I guess I don't have any exciting plans for the summer, now that it's here.

9NHKLUS,male,16,"It just doesn't get any better than Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. The series between the Flames and the Lightning has been great so far, and there is no telling what will happen in this game. I expect at least an overtime or two. You never know who will be a hero in a game like this one, but you can be sure that guys like Jarome Iginla, Martin Gelinas, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis, and Vincent Lecavalier will be great. And of course, Miikka Kiprusoff and Nikolai Khabibulin will be tough to score on, as they have been for the entire series.  Althought I have been pulling for the Flames to win a cup for Canada (although I'm from the US), a win for the Lightning would be just as good. Anyway, the puck drops in about fifteen minutes, so be sure to watch. I'll be back for an update after the game.   UPDATE:   urlLink Fedotenko scores both Tampa goals   Alright, that game sucked. Until the third period, that is. I was all geared up for a great game, win or lose for the Flames, and I got crap. I wasn't upset because the Lightning were winning, but simply because the Flames didn't seem to be playing. Finally, when the third period rolled around the Flames got with it and scored one from the blueline! But it didn't matter I guess, as the Lightning went on to win it. Anyway, I'm happy for guys like Andreychuk who are winning their first Cup after such a long career, and for the young guys like Richards, Lecavalier, St. Louis, and Fedotenko. Also, I guess I should be happy that a team in the US won. Hopefully everyone watched the game, even though it sucked most of the time."
9NHKLUS,male,16,"For the past week or so, my brothers and I have been trying to come up with something (anything!) to do for our dad on his birthday and Father's Day. But, as always, we were short on ideas and short on money. When his birthday came around and we were without a gift, we were forced to settle for making him dinner and dessert. Now that Father's Day is here, we are yet again unprepared. So, I gave him the next best thing to a gift. I made him some more food. Pancakes and eggs to be exact. I also made an extra effort to go to church with him this morning for the first time in over a month. It was the least that I could do...   Anyway, here is another free gesture. Happy Father's Day dad!"
9NHKLUS,male,16,"Today my grandpa turns an amazing 81 years old. It's interesting to think of all the things he may have experienced in his lifetime; from the Depression of the 1930's to the present. I'm sure that he would like me to acknowledge that he shares a birthday with Michael Jordan, which he often mentions around his birthday.   Happy birthday grandpa! Here's to many more great years."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I've done very well this week - only 1 really late night at work!  I haven't exactly been shirking my duties, at least I've been trying to devote some long-overdue time to some of my charitable activities - oh! and having a facial! Wow! Did I need it!?!  I was buffed and rubbed by Anna - delightful, wee thing with mad Bjorkish bunches - I decided against the hi-tech lifting doobrey! My looks may be fading but I'm not ready for that yet! I opted for the deep cleanse instead. It was heaven! I nearly jumped off the table when she started the shoulder massage! But after a minute or so, it was bliss - I particularly enjoyed the ear-rubbing thing she did - it only lasted a few seconds but my ears haven't been touched by human hands (I still controversially use cotton buds) for almost 5 years - you just don't realise what you are missing sometimes!  I've decided that I deserve a bit more pampering - that's rather a radical turn-of-thoughts for one who hasn't really felt worthy of self-attention, let alone that of others, for some considerable time - so I've booked another for next month - and I have absolutely no guilty feelings whatsoever, which again is refreshing.  The calming effect of the massage had beneficial side-effects in addition to that of my complexion - I went to work in a much better mood than I'd left it the night before! Snapping at my secretary over 25p really isn't how I like to run my ship! Well! Honestly! She could see I was up to my neck in it, trying to get everything ready for my 30-odd (some more odd than others) families that I had moving today, and all she could do was hover for 5 minutes to talk to me about a minor (25p) discrepancy on a Completion Statement! Can no-one else ever see the Bigger Picture? I was more concerned that my 3.8million pounds worth of property would move.  Eva has played a minor, potentially disastrous role in my week. I foolishly sent her 2 photos of diametrically opposed men who I've chatting to - both very charming in their own way - to see what she thought.I wrongly assumed, given that she works for a large corporate venture, that she would be reasonably computer literate and that my emails would remain private - and in a way they did - save that her replt that she ""preferred the lanky one!"" was sent not to me - but to the hunky rugby player! Fortunately, he has a fine sense of humour and a well-developed competitive streak - so she may have done me a favour in the long run - least I now have a potential new salsa partner - our lessons start in 3 weeks. Wonder how many pounds I'll lose by then?"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I wasn't exactly skiving off early tonight - I mean, ok, so I went to the hairdressers at 5 o'clock but he is a client so it was just like I was still working reeaaallyy! Albeit whilst having my roots done and a few blonde highlights dotted here and there (and he did it for free on account of that fact that I was still working!!!)   He's lovely, my hairdresser - Danny - handsome, funny and unstereotypically straight - what's more he's newly single and gets changed into his football strip to blow-dry my hair! And I don't even have to pay him to do it, he's just getting ready to go straight to his 6-a-side game as soon as he's finished de-HattieJacquesing me - when one of his mates or his equally dishy (and also remarkably unhomosexual) brother are there too, passing the masking papers or holding the ceramic straighteners, I can think of nowhere better than to relax from the rigours of a stressful week. Bliss in a bottle!  There'll be more about Danny over the next few months - very hush! hush! But I'm quite excited about it - professionally of course.  Tonight is the first time in almost a month that I've left the office before 8. I'm on nodding terms with the homeless guy who sleeps in next door's entrance - good job he hasn't got a lap-top or I'd probably be considering accepting a date from him! I've been spending so long at my desk, I'm due a company catheter by June! I'm really not complaining - I love the job and I am very aware that it is not expected, or wished of me, but being a new job, I'm all eager and anxious to make a name for myself. The downside is that where I am usually prolific enough during normal hours to keep 2 full-time secretaries and an assistant busy, doing all this extra means that I ideally need a small army to get through the work I am producing - so it's self-perpetuating, the more I do, the more there is to do, the more I fell I must do!   It's working wonders for my weight-loss! I finally managed to find 2 minutes to heat up a tub of soup at 4.15 tonight - I literally had chance to take 4 mouthfuls inbetween answering the phone and signing letters before I had to dash out ( 15 minutes late, but then when am I ever on time) for my Danny Date. So really it's a win-win situation - the clients are happy to be moving, I'm loving the feedback from the agents, and I'm rebabeing all at the same time! Must confess the first 2 are coming quicker than the last but Rome wasn't built in a day - and nor were my fat reserves!  I rang Eva from the office last night, apparently she's being trying to contact me for a couple of weeks but didn't want to leave a message on my musical answerphone. We are seriously considering hitting Leeds this weekend - her new, pleasingly unusual boyfriend is away working (in Dubai, comedy, can't imagine what his stand-up routine will go like - no I don't even want to try!) so we are toying with the idea of getting the girls together and spending some long overdue quality time with one another. Mind you, if it's anything like the other week, we'll get too pissed on champagne to bother to get ready and end up dancing around her living room to Bay City Rollers, with a bit of Dolly, Madonna and Kylie thrown in, culminating in me emoting wildly to Neil(God)Diamond. My kind of night!  But tonight I will be mostly wearing my dressing-gown in the vicinity of the sofa, watching TV (until my brain goes numb) and wishing that fantastically rejuvenating head massage had been more global."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Horrible day! Yuk! Yuk! Started badly - didn't get out of the wrong side of bed, just got out too late! Thank goodness my secretary is trained to give me a wake up call when I don't appear within half an hour of my ETA!  I finally did battle with the dreaded Sasser worm last night and had a bit of a cyber fest into the bargain - well it was his birthday! and he is very cute! Anyway, the birds were up before I was even tucked up - must remember not to do that on a school night again! But it was fun.  Culminated in some awful bully of a client - someone else's, not my own - calling me to tell me how dreadful I am and that if he can't move tomorrow he is blaming me personally and expects me to pick up his hotel bill if he can't move into his new des res at the exact time of his choosing! I was incredibly calm, polite and expect a nomination for Customer Service of the Year award! I apologised that I had been unable to see my client ( his buyer) at the precise time that he had been available to come and see me, and tried to explain that my diary had been solidly booked - being a Dentist he might have understood! - I had seen him at the first available opportunity this week - 10.30 Tuesday - and promptly dispatched my final searches and cheque requests - the fact that a leading High Street lender cannot guarantee my client's mortgage money will be with me tomorrow is a result of the crazy state of the market - not my fault, nor is the fact that the undoubtedly-clever-and-talented bully of a Dentist has booked his van despite advice to the contrary from his own solicitor! He nearly got to me, just 'cos I was so tired - my instinct was to scream, rant, rave and cry - all at the same time - but I took a leaf out of Eva's book and she would have been so proud of me! My secretary hugged me afterwards, and the Law Grad who I'm training at the moment has started looking at me in awe - my boss promptly cancelled his registration with this guy's practice and supported me 100% ( he is so lush, my new boss!)   I'm over it now - and infinitely proud of my power to not cry when all I wanted to do was curl up in a ball under my desk and sob for England!  Tonight, Matthew (Peter, David, and Dean), I'm going to be Ali McBeal - but without the fab clothes, protruding neck bones, phantom babies and boyfriends!  Thank fuck tomorrow is Friday!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"It's the weekend - official! Nadia has won - I wept - fuck knows why - but I did! I thought my days of weeping at Andrex adverts was over but I guess I'm still soft. I have made a conscious effort to stay away from BB this year - I really am not in the slightest bit interested - but Jack kept coming through with titbits and I eventually succumbed.  Do not think for one minute that the new TV has anything to do with being able to watch the Final Eviction! Fuck! No! The Olympics and Restoration Final only!  I counted up what work I had left on my desk tonight when I sneaked off at 6.20 -  7 contracts to check (3 of them are big 'orrible ones) and 2 files from hell. That is the lightest my desk has been in the last 10 years at least - wish my scales would match it. I used to get anxious at this sort of time - that nobody wanted me and that I would be sad and redundant within the month - but I have learnt from experience that this time of year is always a bit slow and that it soon starts to flood back in when the hols draw to a close -it seems to have started, I've opened 9 new files in 5 days  - that's far less than I was doing a few months ago - but much more manageable - especially with my super-duper Lisa.  So what do I have planned for the weekend? - absolutlely sweet FA - Result or what? I can sleep in without conscience - my wedding outfit is sorted and if worst comes to shove - I can always give Eva&Roger an IOU - I know exactly what I want to buy them - but having spent a few hours surfing the net and only finding the type of thing in the £150-800 price bracket, they might have to wait whilst I save up or think of an alternative. It will be fab whatever it is!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"Rush! Rush! Rush! That's all I seem to do at the moment - even my nose is streaming at a rate of knots. If I'm not dropping off kids, I'm picking them up, or making them pack-ups, or washing their clothes.     I treated my car to a rinse through the wash, she's sounding almost as poorly as me so I'm being uncharacteristically nice, before having a quick nap in the car wiating for the kids to stop snogging. Net result - I left work at 5.30 but never actually saw the inside of my lounge until after 10.30. Great for weight-loss! I always try to see the positive.     I can't even look forward to the weekend particularly - having booked us all on a day-trip to London. We have to catch the coach at 7am, which means a 6 o'clock start (!!) and won't get back home til 11ish. I hope St Swithin's on a career break!     On the plus side I've done 4 swears today, bought the girls on reception a big box of posh chocolate biccies in the hope that they'll keep passing them my way - it all helps toward the Send Jack To Spain For The Entire Month Of August campaign! And I've had some more emails and texts from Cute Suit - all unsolicited (no pun etc) - and my new office is now vacant and just waiting to be decorated and recarpeted for me.     There's a bit of a power struggle going on between my long-standing secretary and my new assistant as to who gets the seat closest to the Lord's right hand - or my side door as the case may be - I may have to interevene and decree that Jacquie gets it - from a practical point of view it would be convenient to have Lisa within hollering distance - but then Jacquie knows when my face says Do Not Disturb - Important Cute Suit on Line 1!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I must be the only person not watching the England-Croatia match judging by the groans and cheers I can hear from the pubs outside the office - and they are all quite a way off so I dread to think what is happening out there. I was keeping up with it on Yahoo Sport! but it froze at 43 minutes - I think we've just gone into the second half having equalized. It sounds like I'm missing an exciting match -typical!  But then how many people will turn up for work tomorrow having polished off 4 client reports with 6 full tapes for their secretaries to get cracking on. I'm interviewing tomorrow so I need to make sure I'm on the ball (no pun intended, see above). I hope England take the lead, my lovely new boss might show his darker side if not, and I wouldn't wish that on the poor interviewee.  Right! It's 9pm - I want to get out of the office and back to the car before the ugly Northern yobs pour out of the pubs, braying for blood. and more importantly bafore my friendly little off-licence man shuts!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"The party went reasonably well. The 28 or so teenagers were well behaved and polite in the most part and my hot dogs and Nigella Onion Mush was well received. There was only one casualty - Laura was a bit pooorly, bless her. I put her to bed and kept a close eye on her - couple of hours later and she had made a remarkable recovery. Boo was bouncing off the walls a bit too but she managed to keep her dignity.  I was a bit concerned when I discovered one of the girls was still in Year 6 - I think she was someone's younger sister - but she tended to hover around the kitchen near me so I think she was pretty safe. One of the boys was a bit older too - 16 - just left school - he didn't look it - but he was fine - think he was after one of the girls.  They were all nice kids, very chatty, I can't be doing with shifty quiet ones, and they all slept down the garden in the tents eventually - apart from Victor, who had mixed really well but had the common sense to grab a comfy bed.  It was all cleared up and back to normal by the time I surfaced this morning. The kids had all gone home, camp had been broken, all the cans and bottle tops had been picked up and even the brazier had been swept out. Jack had even hoovered. I think they had such a good time, they were keen to keep on my good side so they can do it again the next time Mum and John go away. I don't mind as long as they stay down the bottom of the garden and don't disturb the neighbours - that's my job when I have a party every couple of years.  I'm cooking traditional Cottage Pie for Victor now. I had thought about doing a proper roast but the fridge is so full there would be nowhere to keep any leftovers. Jack will pretend not to like it but will clear his plate soon enough. Then strawberries and ice-cream. I like all this entertaining lark!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"He's gone! Ca c'est formidable!!! It was well worth getting up at 4am and standing around the council car park. I started to get a bit nervous when they still hadn't driven off after 50 minutes, one person was late (and for once it wasn't me - we were almost first there).  Victor had swapped seats so couldn't see us, so I saw our opportunity and Jack & I legged it back to the car and drove off at speed, just in case there was a serious delay and they tried to make us take him back again.  I went straight to work. The car park attendant was a bit surprised to see me pull up behind him as he was unlocking the gates, specially as my make-up was still in its bag and not yet on my face.   I always really like early mornings, I must try and see more of them at the start of a day instead of on my way to bed.  I had a pretty cracking day all round in fact. My new assistant started working for me, the decorator was booked and came and started measuring up my new office - I'm getting new carpet, paint, furniture and have been given the green light to go to IKEA and buy whatever I want to make it a bit more homely, and something else happened at the very end of the day that I don't want to say too much about just yet, in case I jinx it, but I am really really looking forward to tomorrow lunchtime.  Talking of which, I must get my beauty sleep - more important than ever. I have new shoes, eye mask chilling in the fridge for the morning, and I'm about to paint my nails. Zippadee do-dah, zippidee day, my oh my..............."
3D8MI3M,female,33,"I did it! I pulled the rabbit out of the hat - again! God! I'm proud of myself sometimes. I managed to complete the nasty old down-in-the-mouth dentist's sale so he could move into his new hutch with his buck-toothed wife - I did it for my own client and the other lawyers in the chain - part of me was really quite annoyed that such a horrid bully boy got his way but then I'm a better, more charitable person than him, and the gratitude it afforded me from my colleagues and the agents was worth it. My lovely new boss even gave me a bottle of champagne as a reward for my stupendous efforts and forbade me from going anywhere near the office this weekend - much different to my old boss who would have taken the credit for it himself somehow - and then promptly asked me to spend my leisure time writing some banal report for one of his many pointless meetings.   I'll give you an example of what he was like - there was one night last winter when I was staying late trying to get some urgent things on tape. It had been snowing all day and there was no sign of it letting up. My old Scroogey boss popped back into the office, probably to ring a girlfriend or pull himself off in the boardroom and was most concerned to see me still slaving away at 8pm with the prospect of a 30 mile journey home along country roads. He was clearly worried I might not make it in the car (or indeed back again the next morning) so he kindly informed me that he had no problem with me......booking into a hotel? staying the night in the guest room given that he has a huge 5 bedroom house and there's only him and his adorable long-suffering wife left at home? go home straight away before the weather worsened? No!!! It was quite acceptable for me to put some of the chairs together and sleep in one of the backrooms! I could hardly believe what I was hearing!! And to think I stuck it out for 7 years!   So now the weekend is upon me again - I cleaned the house last week so I can't do that again for a good few months! CM is staying at his mate's so I'll pray they stay up in his room surfing for porn or something rather than getting themselves arrested! Saw most of my friends last week and I haven't done anything since deserving of an anecdote to amuse and entertain them. Can't think of anything I want to buy - (Christ! My depression must be lifting! never thought I'd hear myself saying that!)My ex, my safety blanket when I'm terminally bored, is working away so won't be around to play with me. So I'll just have to sleep late, lay in bed even later reading the new novel recommended to me or finishing the last one, and generally slob out - no phones, no demanding clients, no pushy pseudo-lovers! Singledom has its advantages!"
3D8MI3M,female,33,"It's almost 8pm and I've just finished preparing my completions for tomorrow. I don't like to cut it that fine, there are enough things that can go wrong and cause enough stress for me as it is, without the prospect of having forgotten to request mortgage funds and not a hope in hell of getting them in time for the clients to move. I've never actually done that in over 16 years but there's always a first time, and I seem to be chasing my tail so much just lately that it could strike at any time!  Fingers crossed, they all look reasonably ok -  a couple of estate agents haven't got their bills through to me yet so they may have to wait a few days to get paid - so there are some benefits to being overworked! Cup half full, girl. me!!  My lovely boss and I have interviewed a potential new Personal Assistant for me tonight. I'm not sure whether she'll take the job - she is likely to see it as a step backwards given that she is currently running the show at another firm, albeit by default when the solicitor left and wasn't replaced immediately. She's probably not quite ready to be in the deep end with us big fish yet and is floundering about a bit, a few years under my expert fin and she'd have the makings of a good career - but anyway, we'll see what happens. She's very tall, slim and blonde - and did I mention 21? -but she's got massive feet - canoes for shoes -I like to know I'm better shod than my junior team players. Listen at me - Eva's coaching is beginning to play off - my first instinct was to say ""underlings"".  I'm off home now, still another 45 minutes drive but the scenery is really pretty and if I'm lucky I may just see the sun setting over the Humber Bridge. I've done really well the last few nights and more or less gone straight to bed when I've got in rather than sitting chatting to interesting cyber-hologram men. I've had a really stressful long day today and know I've got an even worse one coming up tomorrow - normally a trigger to reach for the Shiraz to help me forget about it - but I've got to be up early to take my car to the garage. I'm getting a hire car while it's in the plastic surgery unit. Not sure what but the lovely lad from the hire company promised me something of a higher grade than a bloody awful Corsa or Fiesta! I'll probably get an Astra! Oh well, I can just pretend I'm a Sales rep as I drive across the Pennines tomorrow night! It's got to be better than being a Conveyancer on the last Friday of month before a bank holiday and half-term!!"
95M00OF,male,35,P.T. test today PU 47 SU 29 2MI 19:18 fuck.
95M00OF,male,35,"So when do I stop being afraid when things are going well?  I know, I bitch and moan about it a lot, but that;s when disaster seems to strike at our relationship.  Of course, right now disaster is striking the damn car.  Spent over a grand on it this summer to keep it running, this morning on my way to Caldwell and it over heats.  Again. The only part of the cooling system I HAVEN'T replaced is the heater core, and guess what blew this morning?  I'm going to have to keep it another five years just to make the repairs worth it."
95M00OF,male,35,****later in the day********  Just woke up from a nap and my head's still fuzzy.  Spent the morning cleaning ang fighting with Beth.  Why is it that she can so easily push my buttons?  And she's only 11.  7 years of this shit to go. . . .
95M00OF,male,35,"All right, I know why I was so crabby today.  Well, partly.  The heat today was fierce, it's still over 100 at almost 11pm, but that only exacerbated the crankiness.  The little detour on the way home from Betsy and Andy's may have been a bit out of the way, but it was right on the map. ; )"
95M00OF,male,35,"Ya know, things only get more intense.  Between bouncing house payments, losing a job, and having dreams where I have fabulous sex with a former co-worker (until I get caught) I'm not sure which way is up anymore. Oh yeah, don't forget blowing the engine on the convertible so I have to ride my bike into work, and NOW, after the driest winter on record, it decides to rain like the bejeezus every day.  But only on my commute.  aahhh.  if ya can't bitch to the computer, who CAN ya bitch to?"
95M00OF,male,35,"I needed a journal, and here it is.  This is mostly for my benefit, a way to sort out without having to leave the computer.  If anyone gets frustrated because I'm not posting fast enough, get over it.  This is my brain, and if you wanna peek, you'll do it on my time and my terms."
95M00OF,male,35,"Cyn asked me what the next step is.  It kinda threw me, I thought we were still exploring the first one!  I told her I wanted to start dating again, but it's difficult to plan anything when I have no control over the budget.  We may (budget allowing) have worked out a solution to that, and rather painlessly, too.  She liked the idea, I haven't told her it was the ONLY thing I could find the remotest bit positive about separating.  I still think the whole idea sucks, but we seem to be putting it on a very back burner.  I just want to push it off the stove alltogether.  We seem to be heading toward the path to healing.  What worries me is that whenever we seem to be on the right road, something sideswipes us right back off of it.  I'm beginning to think that a successful relationship is not one that stays on the right path, but one that can traipse all over the universe, and never lose track of where it's towel is.  Or something like that.  I haven't written much, nor have I let her read this journal.  It seems strange that anyone in the world can read these words, but the person I am closest to doesn't know where to find them.  Then again, She knows where my paper journal is, but won't read that.  I guess it's the same thing.  I'm not likely to put anything REALLY incriminating in either.  I operate my private life like a spy, nothing in writing, destroy any evidence.  It's a little hard to destroy my brain, though."
95M00OF,male,35,"Bad dream last night.  I dreamed *I* was the one who was raped by Craig.  And as I was trying to tell about it, I was so afraid I was lying about everything.  I think I'm doubting my sanity"
95M00OF,male,35,Hmmm.  thanksgiving +2.  What am I thankful for?  I'm still alive.  that'll do for starters.
95M00OF,male,35,"Worship is a relationship.  I have come to suppose it's like being a kid, and telling your parents how great they are by showing them how much and how often you want to be with them.  I have this image of Koshka when she was about 14 months old.  I'm in the living room, trying to get a fire going.  I have the baby gate up so she won't get in.  I don't want her in the ashes, making a mess (again), and I REALLY don't want her near the almost non-existant fire I'm building - or so I think.  Koshka is pulling on the gate, rattling it in its frame, and whining.  I'm getting so frustrated, both at the stupid fire, because it's cold (and, truth be told, the firemaker.  I was a boyscout, for goodness sakes!)  and at the constant rattle & whine.  So, compassionate man that I am, I turn to my precious baby child, the delight of my life, and I say sweetly (and at the top of my voice) ""What do you WANT?!?!?""  She stops rattling, stops whining, raises her hands and says, ""I want you.  I want a hug.""  I'm tired of 'intelligent' worship.  Tired of not being able to experience the emotion of God's presence.  I want to sing, weeping to God.  I want to be able to lift my hands, and not be aware of what is happening.  I want the Holy Spirit to take control of my worship, leaving 'me' (or, rather, my self-consciousness) out completely.  But I think I may have ruined that for myself.  I so distrust emotionally based decision making that I've tried not to be influenced at all in that way.  Coming from a dually emotionally based spirituality (in one service, ""Do you  FEEL  the Saviour tugging on your heart?"", in the next, ""That is my Testimony, because I  FEEL  it to be true."") I despise(d) the 'stirrings of my heart'.  I learned not to trust my emotions in other areas, it was only a matter of time before my spiritual life suffered the same hit.  Opening up to emotion opens me up to pain.  I've had enough of that.  Also, I don't trust what I feel as much as what I can reason.  I don't have to feel God is there, I can, by reading the Bible, know intelectually that He exists.  Some people reject that argument, but it is enough for me.  i have no problem with reasoning out the exegetical topics in Scripture, digging into a passage, arguing an interpretation.  In a Bible study, if someone says ""I feel . . ."" I usually say, ""I don't.  Prove it.""  I get such satisfaction from really tearing apart a piece of text - what does it mean? What is the writer saying? what is the historical significance? How does it apply today? I don't want to emotionalize my Bible study, I like it just the way it is.  But Worship!  Getting together with a bunch of people who believe - or don't - with the sole purpose of praising God - like paying proper homage to a king, to   the   King.  Or being by myself, so in the moment with God that He speaks!  To me! I love listening to music, it gets me there so much faster than anything, but it seems that right before I break that barrier where I'm in the real, palpable presence of the Almighty God, something interferes.  I can rebuke it all that I want, but all that does is draw attention to the fact that I'm no longer giving all of myself to honoring God.  there's that little piece that refuses to give over.  it's the one that - seemingly benign - wants to analyze the lyrics for doctrinal compliance.  Or starts listening (appreciatively, of course) to the harmonies rather than unselfishly adding to them.  Every time I get the urge to raise my hands, I suffer from the most frustrating catch 22.  If I  don't , I have to concentrate on quenchng the feeling, the desire, the longing of my hande to lift of their own accord.  If I  do , I wonder who's looking at me, if they're thinking I'm putting on spiritual airs (which is what  I  cynically tend to think).  This happens whether or not anyone else is raising hands, or dancing, or crying, or being the least bit expressive.  My worship is repressive.  I don't try to repress anyone else, at least I hope not, but I do a heck of a lot of repressing of myself.  It helps that I play the drums in church - my hands are busy, I have an excuse.  It would be very difficult for me to raise my hande between paradiddle flams! Well, maybe not flams, if I was creative enough! :)   But now I have the opportunity to lead the worship team again.  If I do so, I want to lead, to lead the entire congregation right into God's living room, into His kitchen, to use His bathroom, and to know where the family towels are, that it's ok to use them.  But to do that, I have to know the way there, I have to be a frequent enough guest, that I feel at home, ready to kick my shoes off and scratch my toes,as it were.  I know the way, but there seems to be a barrier right at the doorway.  God's inviting me in, I can see the coffee and muffins on the table, the sofa looks just perfect for leaning against, but I can't get through.  I know the way, but I'm not comfortable there.  The hell of it is, it's a barrier of my own making.  I even  put it there.  I devised my own 'Don-gate' to keep me from where I don't belong.  Where I could get hurt.  ""Is He safe?""  ""Safe?  Oh no, He's not safe.  But He's good.""  Dear God, sometimes finding you is like trying to smell the colour 9.  Expand my senses to make it possible.  I can't get this darned gate out of the way.  Take it down, I want a hug."
YD6P057,female,24,"Game 7-There I was, in the Lightning locker room, waiting to interview players during the locker room celebration. It was mayhem on the ice as Bolts players took turns posing for the picture that would go down as their all-time favorite: the Stanley Cup military press. Ten reps of 35 pounds won't build big deltoids, but they make the sweetest photo. AndreychukI was in the locker room with two other reporters, the benefit of working for a network rights holder. The next time the Stanley Cup is awarded, NBC will be the U.S. network airing the celebration, so this might have been the last time I'll ever be in that position. The room was empty. Then, in walks Lightning captain   urlLink  Dave Andreychuk   . He places the Stanley Cup in the middle of the locker room, then leaves. Maybe he had to pee or something. So the Cup is just sitting there in the middle of the room. No one else was there. Just the Cup. It was a very surreal moment. The Cup runneth over in an emptyeth roometh. Eventually, slowly, players made their way in.   urlLink  Brad Lukowich    put his little girl in the bowl, bringing tears to his wife's eyes. Eventually, Andreychuk came back, and I interviewed him for SportsCenter. He said, in so many words, that he had just played his last NHL game. To go out with a Cup like Ray Bourque did in 2001. Then we were sprayed with champagne, which ruined my $75 suit (I think it was   urlLink  Jassen Cullimore   ). The interviews were over, and the room was getting nightclub crowded. Before I left, I took off my suit jacket and had Lightning winger   urlLink  Chris Dingman    sign the back of my white shirt with a blue Sharpie while I was still wearing it. Dingman is a good friend of our boy   urlLink  Shjon Podein    , and he became a friend to me during the 17-day final series. My souvenir from the 2004 Cup final is a white dress shirt autographed by Chris Dingman. He wrote: ""To John, Podes' bedfellow. Chris Dingman."" Dingman PodeinPlease let me explain. Podes has good friends on both Calgary and Tampa Bay, so he decided to pay tribute in true Podes style. Before leaving Minnesota for Calgary for Game 3, he painted his entire body red, put ""Yelle 11"" on his back, and sported a red Jofa hockey helmet sans the padding. And made it through airport security. Let me clarify that: He spray-painted his entire body. Podes couldn't find body paint so he risked poisoning himself for the good of the team by emptying four cans of Krylon on his skin. Anyway, he flies on the plane painted red, walks around Calgary all day painted red, and goes to Game 3 ... painted red. Of course the best part for me is when I met him after the game for a nightcap; he was very easy to find. A hostess doesn't often hear, ""I'm looking for the guy spray-painted red and wearing Hakan Loob's Jofa helmet."" Pretty good chance you are the first guy to utter those words to her. Well, Podes needed a place to stay for the night and I said, ""Stay with me."" So, Podes comes back to the room and collapses from his long day in my bed. The only bed in the room. Now what? Well, the beds are Montana wide. You could comfortably fit Ken Hitchcock, Melrose and Mark Hunter in there without incident. So, I tuck myself in on the other side and call it a night. You could have laid four Stanley Cups between us. Really! Anyway, Podes left at 6 a.m. to catch a flight. I woke up around 8. As I pulled the curtains and let in the day's light, it looked like a homicide had occurred in my bed. Podes left a body outline of red paint on the sheets. I was sure the Calgary police would have me arrested and questioned by noon. I waited until the maid service arrived to explain the giant red blotch on the sheets, and I remained a free man. As an addendum to this story, Podes shows up in Tampa Bay painted entirely blue with ""DINGMAN"" on his back before Game 5. The story is basically the same as above. And now you know the Chris Dingman autographed dress shirt story. NHL Awards night"

YD6P057,female,24,"So, my best friend from high school is getting married next Friday. Yes, the date of her wedding is Friday the 13th. Uh huh. In high school we would sit around and dream about what our weddings would be like. Who would be in our bridal party. And who would be maid of honor. She was the first of us to get engaged. She picked her wedding party leaving a few of us out. Mainly me. I know she has a large family and her sisters are in the bridal party along with her college friend. We went and paid for trips to Vegas to celebrate the nups, offer support and hopefully be included in the planning process. Nope, left out. Helped gather the music from our old high school choir teacher. Not a huge task, but it took time out of my day to help. Not a problem, because I like to help and figured it would come back to me. Then a few weeks ago, I found out the our other best friend from high school/college was asked to read at the wedding. Ouch. I immediately went into FUCK YOU mode. Pissed off and hurt. Initially I didn't like her husband to be. I thought he was rude and pompous. But at a wedding we all attended a few years ago, he came up to me and apologized for past doings. I was shocked, surprised and completely flattered that he actually cared. I then let things go and began to see the reason why my friend fell in love with him. He puts her on this pedestal and just adores her. Anyone can see that. So, knowing that, I am going to stop having a pitty party and take me not being invited to be a part of the wedding as a hint that it's not about me. Her wedding has nothing to do with me. Which I always thought it would. But in the end, it's just about her and her fiance. And if I hear one more person say the reason I wasn't allowed to bring a guest is because they want me to ""rekindle"" the ""flame"" between me and her brother, shit will hit the fan and I will get so drunk, I will puke everywhere. Who cares! SERIOUSLY, SHUT UP!  So, the only other person who reads this blog is sgl steve1. At first I thought, how funny, SINGLE STEVE reads my blog. Weird, how did he find it? He tried chattin me up and everytime he would IM me I would laugh cause Single Steve was trying to chat with me. Why? I didn't know, but what I did know is that I was flattered that someone/anyone would contact me because of this web log. And then I thought, how weird that someone is contacting me because of this Blog. I am crazy and who wants to contact a crazy person?!? Well, I guess Steve did and we continue to IM while at work. I recently found out that his screen name SGL Steve1 doesn't mean Single Steve. However, I don't believe him. :-) And will continue to believe that SGL Steve means what it looks like. I sent him a pic of me and I think I have completely distracted him with my self portrait! LOL Yah, I don't think so. Again, I am a crazy lady.  I am trying to get my friends to start up Blogging. I think it's a great way to relieve stress, take your mind off of things at work, procrastinate, bitch and moan. Thanks Mandy for introducing me to the wonderful world of blogging. Now, I just need to figure out how to load pictures. Anyone want to help me with that?  I am going to the Mountains this weekend to hang out with JD and my uncle. Plan on doing a lot of relaxing and going to the rodeo. I think we are going bowling tonight. Should be fun. It's my first sleep-over with JD at his place. Kinda freaked out. Not sure how this is going to work. So, I packed a huge bag of shit. Not really sure what to bring. Let's hope for a real bed and bed frame. Nothing like sleeping at your quasi-bf's house on a mattress on the floor. Screams bachelor to me. Yah, I know I am prissy. That's right. Who knows why JD would want to be with a girl like me. He is so outdoorsy. For fucks sake he is going to Antarctica to be a fireman for 5 months. That's awesome, but I would rather decorate my new house.  New dilemma:  Dated a guy for a few months earlier this year. Was completely crazy about him. Things were casual. We would see each other a few times a week, maybe. He is completely career minded and goal driven and always busy with work. It completely consumes his life which eventually became the death of us. It's not like we broke things off, we just faded out. Had called and emailed a bunch of times, he never returned any of them. Until last night. He called as I was tanning. Left a message. I, of course being very smitten with him, called him back. We chit chatted, and agreed to meet up sometime next week. ARG! Why now? He told me that he was most likely moving to Thornton. He then said he was moving up north to be closer to me! HA HA... Nice line. Oh who the hell knows what I am supposed to do!  I am off to think...  ARG!  HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!!!"

YD6P057,female,24,"Bunny Survives Explosives Ordeal  (AP) Lucky the bunny is living up to her name. It had seemed like luck had run out: Strapped to a powerful explosive with a lit fuse, Lucky was tossed into a lake.   But the explosive didn't blow up, and the rabbit was pulled out of the water.   Now Lucky's owner and his friend face misdemeanor charges of animal cruelty after photos of the July 13 incident surfaced on the Internet.   Nick Sigmon, 18, and Paul Collins, 20, are accused of taping an illegal M-1000 -- a large firecracker equivalent to a quarter stick of dynamite -- to the rabbit and throwing her into Lake Don Castro.   Sigmon said he fished Lucky out of the water to save her from drowning. But prosecutors charged the two lifeguards on Wednesday. Two other men who were present during the incident may also face charges.   'I think that a lot of people are judging us without knowing us at all,' Sigmon said. Asked why he fitted Lucky with the explosive, he said, 'Um, that's a real tough question to answer.'   Sigmon said he adopted the bunny after almost running over her with his car, but can no longer care for her because he's starting college this fall at University of California, San Diego, where he plans to study biology.   Someone found the photos on the personal Web site of one of the suspects and posted them on Craigslist, the popular Internet bulletin board, where the House Rabbit Society in Richmond saw it.   Lucky is recovering at a foster owner's home, where she's snacking on hay pellets and doing well."""
YD6P057,female,24,"I left for the mountains straight from work on Friday around 5:30. I didn't make it to my final destination until after 8. Traffic SUCKED, bad! Most of my time was spent on this side of the divide. Thankfully I had good music. While sitting in traffic, I heard something outside yelling. I turn and look and to my surprise I find some guy hanging out his window waving to me. For sure I thought something was wrong, like a flat tire or something. But it was nothing of that nature. This guy is smiling and waving, and then yelling out his window to me telling me how ""smokin"" he thought I was. I giggled, blushed, and smiled back. However, we drove side by side for 4 hours. So, it was 4 hours of him and I trading smiles. He asked for my number, and I can't believe that I gave it to him. We chatted, he asked me if I knew any good jokes. He then asked if he could buy me a drink!?! WHAT, I was going up to the mountains to spend time with my new lust, and this guy in the white truck comes along. Why now? Feast or fuckin famine! It's rainin men, so I guess when it rains, it pours! I reluctantly agreed to a drink. We pulled off the side of the road to meet, and had a nice time. Turns out this White Truck Guy (WTG) works in Erie, right where I am buying my home. Kind of thrilling, exciting, flattering. I'm blushing right now. Giddy really. For many different reasons.  Had a great time in the mountains. After the marg with WTG, I went to my uncle G's house. We went down to this new posh bowling alley to have dinner. It was good actually. Not like the regular bowling alley food you might find down in the city. This place was fancy. 7+ plasma flat screens, rock and stone fireplaces, great bar and eatery. It was pretty. JD met up with us and invited a few of his friends. It was fun. I kicked major bowling ass beating JD in the second game. We then went home to JD's. Saturday I got up and went back to uncle G's and painted all day. G is gutting his house and I wanted to spend some time with him. It was great. We then went to the Eagle County Fair and Rodeo. It was awesome. Ever seen a guy ride horse bare back? It's so violent and insane. It looks like the horse and the cowboy are going to snap in half. Frickin fantastic. It amazes me that the horse and the cowboy make it out alive. I had such a fun time, screaming and yelling that I have lost my voice today. Love it. I sound all sultry and yummy. LOL. Sunday I was sat in front of all of JD's friends. JD said I needed to be ""approved"" by his friends. Not sure how I faired. Guess I will find out soon enough. I was more quiet than usual. I didn't want to step out of my comfort zone and make a complete ass of myself. All of his friends were really nice. I can tell they love JD a lot. They want to make sure he is happy. I really like his loyalty to his friends and family. It's a very attractive quality.  My boss is out again. Only 3 of us in the office today. It's nice. Very quiet.  It's taken me almost two hours to write this blog. Why? Who knows. Might as well publish this to get it off my desk. :-)"

I love leaving work early for a good cause, like getting sloshed at a bar.  Yesterday I left early for a pedicure.  My feet were actually distracting my work.  I had to leave early to regain my focus!  Plus, my boss is out sick and well, it's easier to leave early when she is gone!  FYI:  I shaved my legs today.  Yes that's right, the day after I had a pedicure.  Yes, the little woman prettying my feet had to deal with my hairy legs!  HA SUCKER!  I gave her a $10 tip.  She deserved it.    Last night I went to bed at 10:35 and I wasn't even sick.  I usually only go to bed that early when I am sick.  But I guess I was just that tired.  Justin called at 11:30 and I must have sounded drunk.  I was so out of it.  I wonder what I said to him.  Let's hope to God those 3 little words didn't slip!  Yah know, Let's Do It.  :-)  Found out last week that my best friend is moving closer to home.  She got a job in Billings which is only 7 hours from my new house in E-town.  So, I guess that's better than Milwaukee.  Closer at least.    Getting my chop cut hair done this week.  Thank the dear lord for that.  I look like a bowl headed freak.

YD6P057,female,24,"urlLink Randomly Organized Thoughts  Friday, July 09, 2004   This is from mytrafficnews.com.  My mom and I thought it was Hee-Haw-Highlarious!  Enjoy... Gobble Gobble     Friday:      The best way to spend the last few minutes (or hours) of a holiday-shortened week, we think, is to goof off. Hey, goof off with us, as we take a jaunt through what's going on that might tie up traffic tonight. Get comfy; there's a lot going on.  First, there's the 12th Annual LoDo Music Festival, blocking off 20th through 22nd Streets from Blake to Larimer next to Coors Field today and tomorrow. Today's music starts at 5 p.m., and the official site warns against bringing such things as cans, fireworks and turkey legs. You heard them, people, NO TURKEY LEGS!  C-470 and Morrison Road could be packed during the rush hour because of a 5:30 p.m. show at Red Rocks with The Allman Brothers Band and String Cheese Incident. By the way, both are ""jam bands"" which means this concert will probably be about 9 songs and 47 drum solos in only 7 or 8 hours. Whoo! Turkey legs are OK, but only from free range turkeys.  Meanwhile, the Amphitheater on Fiddler's Green Parkway will host the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, as they play the music of Led Zeppelin starting at 7 p.m. If the Internet is to be believed, this really is happening. Next week a banjo and bagpipe band play the music of Ice-T. OK. We made that one up, but it seems about as likely. Cornish Game Hen legs are OK, but no turkey legs. Sorry.  But wait, there's more! The Pepsi Center not only has Cirque de Soleil in the parking lot at 4 and 8 p.m., but Women of Faith are in the Can itself, starting at 7 p.m. Don't expect all the typical swearing as attendees scramble for the last parking space that will actually fit an SUV. But watch for a lot of grit teeth and a growl of ""I'm going to PRAY for you SO DARN HARD!"" Whole turkeys -- if very, very flexible -- are allowed at the cirque, and for the faith event, well, you can bring whatever food you want as long as you promise to send us the recipe and it's OK if you used Miracle Whip because we can't cook without it either.  Most of these events repeat tomorrow, with one addition: John ""I'm a turkey leg at heart"" Fogerty plays tomorrow at Universal Lending Pavilion. We mentioned this yesterday, and a MyTrafficNews family member wrote in and thought our ""secret code"" was another lame joke. It's not! Click the link below and enter the secret code COACHF in the Special Promotions window; you can get one or two tickets for only the service charges.  Another reader wrote in and said that Fogerty is great, but he's excited to see the other act on the bill: Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers. ""Nothing like songs about tequila,"" he writes, ""and, well, more tequila!"" Except maybe a Turkey Leg ballad.  We're excited about the show, and we're not sure what the rules say, but we're bringing turkey legs. They can have our turkey legs when they pry them from our cold, wrinkled up hands! And even then we'll keep all that yummy seasoning and the juices that drip on our hand! So there!  If you have a fear of crowds, hide in your closet and eat turkey legs until the weekend is over. Otherwise, get out and have some fun; there's plenty to be had. We'll either see you Saturday night at the Fogerty show, or right here Monday afternoon. Until then, thanks for reading!"

885ELY7,female,27,"boo our webmistress is away doing her thang with laser beams and thumping music.   we've been talking alot about the martian species - insightful and some hilarious.  but i'll like to add my two cents' worth on Venus.   it's friday but it's like an attack of sunday evening blues - more misery is yet to come...  state of mind: light headed eyes: unfocused mood: crap legs: bloated by water retention tummy: ditto eyes: puffy boyfriend: very scared work: a mess  the effects of 'flow comes to town' are astounding. ok it's not my first time bleeding. but i've been on the pill for quite a while, and usually that treats you kindly - no zits, glowing skin, no cramps...like it didn't happen.   This is what i found on a website to dispel fears on having periods: On average, only about four to six teaspoonfuls of blood are lost during each period.   WOW - so little? i feel like i'm losing half a tank here!   driving on now...just needed to get that off me chest.  if i don't see you girls over the weekend - have a blast =)"
885ELY7,female,27,"Extracted this from   urlLink   www.romanceclass.com           What is a Crush?      Crushes are sort of easy entry-ways into the world of strong emotions and relationships, without having much of the scary risk involved in really dating someone.         People have crushes on their teachers, on actors, on band members, on scout leaders or pastors...       A crush involves admiring someone from a safe distance. You feel a hugely powerful emotion, stronger than anything you've felt before. You obsess over this person. You would die for them. You think about them constantly. You are thrilled when you are near them and miserable when you are away from them. You desperately want to tell the person how you feel - but are frightened of it at the same time.     If you're involved in a crush - enjoy it! We have ALL had crushes over the years and they're something you look back on with great fondness. Look at what makes your crush special. Those qualities that you admire in your crush are qualities that are very special to you, and it's very important to learn what those are. It helps you when you look for a real boyfriend or girlfriend to date, to know what you are drawn to.     Also, learn how to handle your feelings. Most of what a crush is about is learning that you get POWERFUL emotions in relationships - and that you need to deal with them. Just like you learned in earlier years how to deal with strong anger and strong sadness, you're now learning how to deal with strong feelings of attraction. You're learning that it's a nice feeling - but that it's a painful feeling if you let it take over your life. You need to be able to balance those feelings with the rest of what is going on in your world.     As hard as it might seem right now, your feelings for your crush will even out over time. It usually takes a few weeks to a few months, but you will learn to bring them under control. And as you learn more about life, you will find someone that is your own age, and actually someone you can *date* to start to become interested in. When that's the case, you can work to be their friend, and then their best friend. And it's at that point that your interests change from a crush to a real, meaningful relationship.          Oh no, will I survive even a few days???"
885ELY7,female,27,"I'm counting down to 6 too!!!   I've got an interesting weekend lined up...   With blurberber's recommendations, i'm picking up some melantonin from the drug store and will cross my fingers for a good night's sleep tonight.   For tommorow, i'll be visiting a relative of mine - somehow she's related to my Grandmother and she owns a pottery shop.  I'll be getting my hands dirty and will try to learn the art from her.  That will probably take up my entire day....  hmmm.. drinks tommor evening anyone?   Sunday...*drifting away*   Could be interesting day.  An ex-neighbour of mine had invited me out for a boat trip with his friends.  He mentioned that the group will consist of people whom I've met at the pub beside my place.  I'm crossing my fingers for a particular guy to turn up.  *butterflies*   Well, in any case, even without his presence, I'm sure i'll have a blast.   I'll just cross my fingers for some other hot bods!!! hehehe...  I'm definitely looking forward for some salty sea breeze on my face....ahhhh  astro : you just have to start going out on little adventures!  Take up projects to participate together. I'm sure there are many things that can be done, cheaply! picnic at botanic gardens, take a bukit timah reserves hiking trip, take a little junk boat out, visit some of our offshore islands...just to name a few.

885ELY7,female,27,"memememememememeee!  it was an overall kick-ass night, but the cherry on top was that i could feel ngak and i are actually more comfortable with each other now. perhaps its a good thing that he's not wanting any commitments at the moment, so that we have a timespan to be friends. god knows ive had enough of fast-forwarded relationships which failed because they lacked the basis of friendship.  highlight of the night was when he was having a break from singing - val, ngak and i were outside in the corridor taking silly pictures of each other. oh yes, more nice couply pics will be up for viewing very soon, sweeties! oh yes, more hugging was required to snap said pics. ;)  we must have been out there for a bloody long time because by the time we came back in, joyce and berber had vanished. :P   *** berber darling, i just wanna say that YOUR VOICE ROCKS! ***  we hungout till almost 5am. yes yes.. i know im doing the ""wait as long as i can"" thing again. but i cant help it. and it just doesn't feel right if i go home early fridays anyway. but ok, i gotta have some restraint, so i'm just gonna let myself do this on fridays and saturdays. NO MORE LATE WED'S!  or other weekdays for that matter!  i made it in to work 1130am. not so bad huh? will be meeting val and ngak later today too... :)  *** special BIG HUGS to boo *** cheer up! kitty SOON will be ok... with u caring for him, he'll be well in no time!"

885ELY7,female,27,"I was harassed by a weird-ass shit-face monkey...     Sitting in KLCC, having my sashimi lunch and sipping my green tea away, I was waiting for Craig to swing by KL to pick me up to Singapore.  Oblivious to people around me, I was totally relaxed and deep in thoughts till this shit-face, dirty looking young dude approached me and asked if he could sit in the next table.     It was strange.  There were a gazillion of tables at that cafe and this dude has to pick the one beside me!!!!     ""May I take this table?"" he asked.     I shrugged and nodded.  What else could I say?     He sat down, shuffles around a bit, turned to me again and asked, ""May I have your number?  Oei!  Your number!  Can I have your number!""  ""Oei! Oee! Number number!""     At first I thought I was hearing things cos he was kind of soft.  Shaking my head, I motioned him to go away.     He left.     But not for long.     He came back... This time, he didn't asked if he could join me or to take that table, he just sat down beside me and looked at me from head to toe.     and he whispers ""Hey, your number.  give me your number lah... oei""     I asked the waiter for help.     But this dude in turn asked the waiter to bring him a coke.  As a paying customer, the waiter couldn't ask him to leave.     I got to give it to him.  He's got some brains.     Anyway, he took his time to drink his coke while whispering to me.     I could have left that cafe but I just didn't think I should be the one leaving,  I liked that spot so, I just completely ignored him.     I drew a sketch of him on my notebook.  Occasionally he looked over my shoulders.     When I was done, I smiled, flashed the sketch to him and I told him that I'll bring it to the police.       He ran off.     I don't know if it's my sketch that was that horrendous or he panicked cos I'd mentioned the police.     Oh well.... *Shrugs*"

5DYC0UK,female,23,"sigh, so finally the weekend is here - well, almost - I'm in the office - bright and early this morning, 7:00 a.m.  I'm so behind on my work...seriously. I ended up staying in the office until 7:00 p.m. last night - I probably wouldn't have left if Ryan hadn't called and distracted me.  I was in my ""zone.""  So, I'm here until 12:00 and then it's back  to the MRI. I think I've decided that I don't want to come back after it.  This week has been total bullshit with teh doctor situation, so maybe I deserve to take the afternoon off.  Or maybe I'm just creating excuses :-)  Weekend plans - god knows tonight what I'll end up doing - my Gilmore Girls DVD is finished so what am I going to watch now? :-)  Saturday I'm heading to Ohio to spend the day with Ryan, and then Sunday - MUST work on my resume and cover letters.  It's truly sad to think I already have to think about next summer, but I must.  Until then, I have my Starbucks in hand and I'm ready to kick some ass this morning!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Ah, can you have a case of the Mondays on Tuesday?  I think so!  B/c I sure as hell do!  Got up this morning at 5:00 a.m.....b/c I'm insane and went to work out, and well, now I'm sucking down the caffeine like nobody's business trying like hell to wake up.  Must not mess up today...yesterday was an awful day at work.  So I messed up big time on an order...really bad bad and stupid error, and the funny thing is that I did it a month ago so I don't know how I did it, and back then I was still learning what I was doing here.  So, I got ripped a new one by the judge...by in a nice way.  It's almost worse that way - being reprimanded politely...it's like the boss from Office Space.  ""Yeah, um...we're using the new cover sheets on our TPS reports from now on, mk?""  So, hopefully I can stay out of trouble today.  But like my nephew so wisely said to me yesterday ""mistakes happen.""  7 year olds can be so wise sometimes!  Going to watch a bunch of junior high girls attempt to learn how to cheer later with Andrea - for those of you who don't know, she coaches 8th grade cheerleading at her school so I'm keeping her company...my life is JUST that boring, yes it's true!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Wow, so I didn't think I'd be sad, but I'm actually getting kind of sad to leave.  Only a little over an hour left here - I've been working on the same order all day :-)  It's kind of the shittiest thing I've ever written b/c I only had a day to listen to the evidence...oh well - it isn't like the Judge isn't going to completely change it anyway :-)  Today hasn't been too bad...kind of boring but that's good for a last day.  My coworkers took me out to lunch at the local watering hole, Syds, fine dining, I tell ya...after work, I go pick up the nephew to come spend the night at grandma's..so that's always fun.  I still have some packing left to do - god, I'm so tired of moving!!!!  I expect ALL of you to come see the new apartment when it's all settled.  OH, and get this - I already have two assignments for the new school year.  I have reading to do in Evidence and in Administrative Law.  Hilarious.  I don't have the books yet even.  Law students are all work and no play, you know!  Or at least it seems!  I'm determined to start this school year off well with the homework - no skipping and no falling behind like last year.  Don't want to have any more Jessi Spano moments like I did last year (ha, for those of you who had to witness those, I'm sorry!)  Well, better finish my final decree for the Judge!  Who wants to get a drink to celebrate?"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Morning folks.  So, Alaina is TIRED this morning...well, it's almost afternoon, but I'm still tired!  I had my MRI yesterday.  And well, I thought that since I was so nervous that it would be best to take 2 instead of 1...ha ha..well, I'm still out of it if that's any indication of my drug tolerance.  And then I had another doctors appointment this morning...so...my only question is..is it Friday yet?  Seriously!  This weekend was fun though - I got to spend Saturday with one of my favorite people - which was fabulous, and then Sunday I ""tried"" to help Erika move, but sometimes it's hard to do that b/c it's like there are too many cooks in the kitchen if you all know what I mean..I think that's why I like to move on my own - you can do it the way YOU want it done. And I spent the remainder of Sunday freaking out about Monday's impending MRI.  I guess you could say the good news is all the bad stuff is done for the week, right?  No big plans...suppose to go see Andrea coach cheerleading again today but that all depends on how awake I can keep myself...the drugs still haven't worn off completely!  I tell you, if I was a hardcore pain killer addict, we'd have some issues!  well, it's time to go to lunch with the jury!  write more later!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Yay!  Last day for work this summer!  VERY happy about this - I mean, I'll miss people here but it's nice that I'll get a break for at least a little while...a week, but hey, can't complain, right?  So, today, I still have one more order to write and put out - and then organize my desk and return stuff.  I wish I had someone who would meet me for lunch somewhere b/c today's a ""go-to-lunch kind of day.""  But alas, no such luck.  I got a futon frame, desk and dresser last night for the apartment.  I'm almost all set - we're moving stuff in tomorrow and then meeting Ryan for lunch/dinner :-)  I get to spend the evening with my favorite little guy, the Collin-man.  So, this weekend should be pretty good!  Until then, it's my last divorce that I must write!   Good luck Jame at the Opening Ceremonies today!!!!!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"SO, I'm still in Noblesville, but my stuff is now almost 100% moved into the new apartment.  My parents and I went to Dayton to bring my dresser, desk, and a futon, and my dad pretty much set everything up.  I have to say, it's actually looking like an apartment now.  There is now somewhere people can SIT, isn't that amazing?  I move in for good on Tuesday, which I'm both sad and excited about - talk about your mixed emotions!  I am having a house warming party for two with one of my favorite people, and then comes the unpacking and the dreaded homework.  Yes, I actually have two assignments already, can you believe it?  I think we all know when I'll get around to that, though....Sunday evening ;-)  Actually, no, I'm hell-bound and determined to get this semester off to a good start.  Slacker Alaina isn't allowed to come out and play at least until October!   And Congrats to Marie on her acceptance to San Francisco!  I'm so sad to see you go, and I'm going to miss you a ton, but maybe this will give me an excuse to come out and visit - I can see both Marie and Sarah!  I'll miss you though, and best of luck!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Ok, so it's morning, and I'm sitting in my cubicle, yet again, trying to think of a way to motviate myself to work.  At least I got the Starbucks this morning and at least I'm not still tripping off of xanex post-MRI anymore.  But it's one of those rainy days where all you'd rather do is be inside watching movies.  Definitely not one of those rainy days where you want to be sitting in an office working on divorces.  Anyone have a good way of having the day go faster?  It's going to be an 11 hour one today.  Night court.  Always a good time to be had by all, but I must make up the hours missed for the MRI and the appointment yesterday.  Anyway, so I did get to see the cheerleaders yesterday with Andrea - they're not half bad, but I am considering finding some riddilin (definitelynot spelling that correctly), grinding it up and putting it in their sports drinks.  I don't remember having that much energy or even being that annoying when I was in 8th grade...maybe I'm wrong, but seriously...these girls are very annoying.  Hmm....now I realize why I never would have made the ""cheerleader type."" I'm just too serious or cynical.  Imagine that :-)  Well, must work.  I don't want to, but....we can't always get what we want, now can we?  Maybe tonight will be fun and I'll see people I know be before the judge for possession or public intox!  Ha, that could be entertaining!  Laters!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"So, I'm starting my last week at the court house.  It feels weird that summer is almost over, but I'm definitely ready for it to be over.  This summer has kicked my ass, but I've come out the winner, I think :-)  Only have a few more divorces to work on and then it's no more divorces for awhile! Yay!  So, the weekend was great!  Didn't do much Friday b/c of the whole doctor incident that day...but Saturday was absolutely wonderful.  Thank you to Ryan for showing me the sites of small-town Ohio.  :-)  I've been a smiling idiot since Saturday...yesterday, well, I said I was going to work on my resume, but I ended up doing everything BUT that until like 8:00 p.m.  I did do some work, though...so at least I can have a small sense of accomplishment in my job search.   As much as I'm excited to leave - I'm also sad that I won't be seeing certain people for awhile...Erika, my family -yes, every single one of them - and I'm sad to leave my niece and nephews b/c the twins were just getting to know me and I'm going to really miss my little buddy, Collin ;-( sniff, sniff...maybe I can move them all with me?  Not likely...but it's a nice thought....well, better get to work!  These divorces won't write themselves!!  laters!"
5DYC0UK,female,23,"Ok, so you know how I said I would kick today's ass? Yeah, opposite. I had a CAT scan done today instead of an MRI, but the CAT scan did NOT go well. They inject this dye into your veins to do the x-ray; well, my first vein couldn't take it so it ""blew"" and the dye got all in my skin - and it HURT like a bitch. And I was already scared to death when I got in there so I freaked out. I mean, total panic attack, I couldn't calm down. We tried the other arm and that worked but I was already well past upset by the time it came to that. I have been to the doctor, been poked and prodded and x-rayed three different times this week, and I just want to scream. My arm is swollen and will be for some time apparently.  So, I need a good weekend dammit. I'm back at work b/c I feel bad about missing so many hours, but I can't concentrate worth a crap. We'll see how long this lasts. I'd like to go take a nap now, actually. Outside, that is b/c it's BEAUTIFUL out there! No one should have to work on days like this (quoting Ferris Bueller). I think I might need a drink tonight and a bunch of hugs from a certain someone tomorrow."
5DYC0UK,female,23,"I think I might celebrate every day as the last ______ of this week.  Who knows...so, I'm getting ready to start my work this morning.  Another day, another divorce!  Not much going on today except I have ANOTHER doctor's appointment and then a meeting with Judge Dredd to discuss everything from this summer - yeah, I'm really really looking forward to that meeting (note the sarcasm).  You know, it's a good thing that I have insurance with all these doctors appointments I've had lately.  At least at this appointment I get to bitch to the doctor about Friday's screw-up.  Yep, I have pictures and everything.  Those people at the Imaging Center are going down!  ha ha...don't mess with a law student!  Anyway, hopefully I'll be able to make it to my nephew's purple belt karate class - I'll miss getting to go to those classes.  The kids are so funny!  Well, alas, I suppose I should work...I already drank my coffee for the day and I have to let it wear off before my appointment, so I don't have anything too fun to look forward to today - Starbucks is my favorite part of the morning!  It's like Cheers there for me - everyone knows my name! :-)  Laters!"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Well I am back from Toronto!  It was an interesting two weeks.  I did a heck of a lot of shopping, I now own 4 more pairs of shoes, 2 new skirts, a sweater, a tank top, a jacket, a t-shirt, and other things I've forgotten about already.  I only really saw downtown T.O. once, we drove around a bit and I saw the tower and part of Yonge St., I spent most of my time in Brampton.    The first weekend we went up to Sault Ste. Marie for a wedding, the drive was 8 hours, but we had fun and even stayed in a hotel with a 5 1/2 storey water slide!  They had recently re-filled the pool so the water was only 16 degrees celucius!  When I went down I could barely breathe the water was so cold and you had to lie down flat because the slide was so narrow!  Eek!  The second weekend we went to Niagara Falls, it was pretty and then we visited his grandfather.  On other days we went to movies with his friends, played glow-in-the-dark mini golf, went to the mall, worked out, and hung around with different groups of Stephen's friends and their girlfriends.  I'll write more later, but that's all for now.  *trying to adust to Pacific Standard Time*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Wow it has been a long time since I posted anything!  Not much other than school is going on though.  I'm doing pretty well in my classes and my classmates are okay.  I'm taking kayaking and arts and crafts as my selective skills for Outdoor Rec.  Stephen and I have been together almost 8 months now!  I wish this post was more co-herent, but I have a head ache and I have been studying for two midterms for the past few hours.  I'm gonna see the boy tonight, yay!  Other than that not much is happening.   *studying, studying, studying*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Hmm well lots has happened since my last post.  Stephen and I broke up after just over 11 months together, he's not a bad guy, but the breakup was for the best.  We were fighting a lot and he kept saying that maybe we weren't right for each other and that I was too insecure and needed counseling.  In the end, he broke up with me over the phone because he was jealous of my friendship with another guy and he had misplaced anger from a past relationship that ended badly.  Currently I am seeing a guy who lives near me, his name is Colin and he is really sweet.  We started off running together and quickly ended up spending most of our time together.  He is 26, has blond hair, blue eyes, and a really nice body.  Of course looks aren't everything, though his smile was the first thing I noticed about him when he sat down next to me and started talking to me the night we met.    When I first met him, I thought he was really hot, but I wasn't interested in anything other than friendship and a running partner.  He tells me he wanted to get to know me when he first saw me; it's sweet but a bit unnerving at the same time.  So far we have had lots of fun, we have gone running, snowboarding, clubbing, played darts, foosball, and pool, gone to parties, hung out with his friends, taken trips to Tofino and Squamish together, gone out for dinner, and basically spent tons of time together.  We've only been dating a short time but we've both said, ""I love you.""  Most people are skeptical that we'll work out but I'm being optimistic, I could get my heart broken, but if I don't at least try then I'll never really know.  Colin is very passionate, he loves me, surfing, his friends, his family, skateboarding, skiing and being active.  I worry about the boy sometimes, he strikes me as someone who jumps into things without fully weighing the consequences of his actions, but then again I'm often accused of being the same way.  He tells me that I'm his true love and he wants us to be together a long time, I can hear the emotion in his voice, I'm just concerned at times that he doesn't realize the high expectations I place on people.  I'm not the easiest person, I can get disappointed and while I give my friends a lot of patience I'm not known to take much crap from guys I date.  I hope the boy doesn't get hurt, I don't want to have another ex, but I do expect more integrity from my boyfriends than most girls.    In other news, Heidi and I spent the weekend in Portland!  We drove down Saturday and had tons of fun!  We went shopping, checked out some bars, had giant drinks at Red Lobster, and talked to tons of friendly Americans.  I bought some Victoria Secret body spays, vanilla mints, appletini mix, a gap ball cap, an Abercrombie shirt, crazy US junk food, and Jack in a Box antenna balls!  We stayed in Portland, shopped there and in Seattle, Burlington, and Bellingham.  It was really cool I had never been on any road trips with Heidi and I would definitely do it again, we talked about going to Cali this summer!  As for school, it drags on; I'm acing everything although sometimes I wonder how!  I go out constantly and am having so much fun in my social life I just hope I don't reach a point where my grades suddenly take a nosedive.  Ah well, it is Outdoor Rec and people don't generally fail!  *listening to Blink 182 - I miss you*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Back in school again.  Outdoor Rec is fun, but trying to find a balance between work, school and social time is getting difficult.  Last week we went on a 4-day voyageur canoe trip, it was great we swam in the ocean, stayed at a camp with cabins and showers and learnt lots about plants and animals in Indian Arm.    Stephen and I have been together for almost seven months now!  Yay, he's so sweet.  I'm going to see him tomorrow night; hopefully I'm not too neurotic about my studying to enjoy it.  I just have to keep telling myself I'm a smart person and I'm going to do well.  It is only navigation I just have to remember how to calculate a few things and use my compass properly and it will all be over soon.  Work is slow today, my boss isn't in and I can't do much on my project without his input.  Here's to catching up on other stuff around the office!  Well I should go mail stuff.  *over thinking school and trying not to panic at the same time*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Perhaps the insanity is nearing an end...Colin's new female roommate has given her notice that as of the 1st of June she will be moving out!  Yee-haw!  The bigger news is I'm moving in with Colin as soon as she moves out!!!!  Man is she irritating though!  She moved in the middle of April and has caused so much drama I'm surprised that Colin hasn't lost his mind!  The first day she moved in she spilled beer all over the couch cushions and didn't clean it up, the couch just reeked of stale beer a couple of days later.  The next day she locked herself out of her room, she didn't have a key to the lock on it but she locked it behind her anyways and kept calling Colin to get him to open it for him, but he didn't have the key either.  In the end, she had to get one of the other roommates to force the door open, but didn't even have the decency to phone Colin and tell him that she was in, so we ended up coming home early from our night out for nothing!    Things went okay for another few days and we were thinking that maybe she was just a bit ditzy.  Unfortunately, she blew up a few days later.  Colin had some friends over working on Lee's car in the driveway until pretty late one Wednesday and she flipped because she said she couldn't get her 8 hours of sleep and absolutely HAD to call in sick to work because she was tired...boo-friggin-hoo.  She and Colin had a big discussion and determined that after 10:30pm on weeknights it would be quiet in the house.  This seemed to work out well for a week or so, but then Colin and I went away for the weekend for a surf trip and came back to another explosion.   While we were away, the smoke alarm needed batteries (how earth shattering) and the sink started leaking (heck these things happen, one day at the frat they were fixing the sink and just left us a hole with no faucet for 24 hours).  When she came home, Colin asked to speak with her about the new lock on her door.  He told her that as her landlord he needed a key and gave various reasons as to why.  She stated that if that were the case she would give her rent notice.  If that wasn't over the top, the next stuff she had to say was both insulting and insane.  She said that anyone going in to Colin's room would have access to the key and specifically said ""Cryssie could go into my room"" um sorry I respect people's privacy and have never given her any reason to think that I would ever touch any of her things.  At this point, I was in the shower cleaning out the wetsuits, so I overheard everything, but she couldn't see me.  I was steamed over her accusation, but opted to talk to Colin and not her about it.    As I was finishing up with the wetsuits I noticed the time, it was about the time she usually got ready for bed so I decided that to be considerate I would leave some of the wetsuit stuff unfinished so that she could get ready for bed and I would finish up after she was done.  Well, she took one look at the mess (it wasn't that bad, just a bit of water on the floor and a Rubbermaid bucket by the toilet) and started slamming doors and kicking the Rubbermaid around.  I told Colin why I left the stuff out and he helped me clean up after she got out of the bathroom.  I also told him how insulted I was by her insinuating that I would go into someone else's things and said that I no longer felt welcome in his house and wanted to leave.  He asked me not to punish him for her actions and said that he would talk to her, so I decided to stay the night anyways.  She also accused him of not paying rent and using the roommates' money to go surfing with.  She actually went and talked to everyone in the house and asked him or her what he or she paid and complained about stuff to him or her.  Colin wasn't please and felt that she was trying to turn people against him for her benefit.  He assured her that he too pays rent and told her that he did not appreciate her running around talking about him behind his back.  Colin and Her Royal Highness did not talk for a couple of days, but when they did, it seemed that the chaos and fighting had finally ended for good.  She gave him a key to the room and apologized for dragging me into her rant about the lock.  While she didn't apologize to me directly, I was willing to move forward.  Colin went away for to Whistler this past Saturday and returned to find a note on his door informing him that she was moving out.  We assumed something had gone on over the weekend to piss her off, but neither of us was sad to hear that she was leaving.  It turns out that she had just found a place on her own that was cheap.  Apparently, she had always wanted a place to herself but had previously been unable to find one in her price range.  All seemed well, until yesterday morning.  I woke up around 7am to shower, but thought that she was in there, so I assumed she had chosen to shower earlier than her usual 7:20am time.  As I presumed she was done I got in the shower around 7:20am and was calmly rinsing my hair when this wild banging began on the bathroom door.  Since it was crazy banging and not a friendly please hurry I need in knock I chose not to respond verbally, instead I just hurried up and got ready to get out as fast as I could.  Colin, hearing this banging got up to see why someone was terrorizing me first thing in the morning.  She then started screaming at him to get me out of there because I don't pay rent and it was her shower time and she only had 15 minutes until she had to leave and so on.  I emerged from the bathroom as soon as I was sure I wouldn't run into her and went into Colin's room.  He looked at me and said, ""Don't say sorry, just say Surrey.""  We looked at the clock, my entire shower had taken under 5 minutes and she didn't even go into the bathroom for 10 minutes after I had vacated it!  I think she wanted to blame me for her not getting a shower....aigh!  I hid in Colin's room until I heard her go into the bathroom because I didn't feel like being screamed at.  Colin called me later on that day to make sure I was feeling okay and told me that he thinks she's psycho and is glad she is moving out.  Later that night when she came home, she tried guilt tripping him.  Her boyfriend broke up with her and then she went off on Colin that she thought that when she moved in they were going to be friends and that he would go surfing with her and blah blah blah.  What a dumbass, if you treat a guy's girlfriend badly why is he going to want to invite you anywhere?  Ah well when it all comes down to it I won, she treated me badly and he stuck up for me, so while the drama was unnecessary, all's well that ends with her moving out!  I haven't told my parents that I'm moving out.  I think it will go over like a ton of bricks tied to a herd of elephants, but I've been arguing with them for the past while and I think it is the right decision to move.  My mother threatened last week that she would throw my things out onto the lawn and took away the car for a week over my supposed offensive tone of voice!  Yikes, I'm only 23 going on 24 on the 31st!    Yesterday after all the drama, I saw Melissa.  We had a crazy driving filled day.  Our round trip was over 300km!  We went and played mini golf and arcade games at a theme park, ate dinner at a Chinese Buffet, shopped at Ikea, and played card games at her house.  It was tons of fun and I even got a hole-in-one on the 18th hole that won me a free game!    The weekend was pretty good too, on Friday I went to the Roxy with Nikki, Kim, and Michelle, it was somewhat dull at the club, but it was good to see Kim again!  On Saturday, it was the infamous Hose Reel festival (read giant friggin beer garden) and I finally went this year.  I met up with Allea, Wendy, Heidi, and Adrian and we drank, lay in the sun, and listened to live bands.  Afterwards Allea and I went back to Heidi and Adrian’s, chatted until 1am, and ate Greek food that we ordered in.  On Sunday, the very hung over boyfriend was back from Whistler.  We went for Thai and dessert with his friend Peter and his wife Evelyn.  It was nice to see them again and it was interesting to try my first Thai dishes.  Monday was great too!  Colin and I both had the day off so we slept in and then made a late breakfast with his downstairs roommate Bryan.  After that we ran errands, played pool and darts at the Legion, planted a garden, and I washed Colin's truck while he mowed the lawn.  After all that Heidi and Adrian came over and we had dinner and looked at my surfboard and some cute Colin and Cryssie surf trip photos!    To conclude this very long post I'll just say that I'm very happy right now and am optimistic about living with Colin!  *listening to absolutely no music because I haven't bought new headphones yet*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"What happened since Friday....well I met Stephen's friend Colin, he seems nice.  We all went to Anton's for dinner on Friday, yay pasta.    On Saturday I met up with Kimi, Stu, and Wendy for kayaking and a short hike.  It was fun, I can see myself becoming a kayak guide.  After kayaking I went to Ikea with Kimi and Stu, we had a meatball dinner and then shopped.  I bought Stephen an ice cream scoop, maybe he'll have less bent spoons!  That night I slept at the boy's, he's nice and cuddly!    On Sunday I went to the waterslides with Paul, it was kinda cold but at least the lines were small.  After that we went to dinner with his parents for their anniversary.  It was the first time I had snitzel, it wasn't bad, but I don't think it'll become a staple in my diet anytime soon.    On Monday I worked from home and then went and got my backpacking tent, woo-hoo!  That night I cooked dinner for Stephen, I even found really good de-alcoholized wine.    Tuesday, being Canada day I was in the parade, it was fun, but I accidently bonked some kid in the head with a lollipop!  Later on I went to Danae's and we had a get together and acted like idiots in the wading pool, 23 and I still find wading pools amusing!    Today I'm at work as usual, nothing exciting.  I'm going to spin class tonight, but other than that I have no plans.  *sitting at a desk wishing my work would do itself*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"I survived winter camping! It wasn't half as cold as I thought it would be, but I'm still more into summer camping.  My class went up to Marriot Basin for the weekend and built an igloo, snow caves and even summited a small peak!  I was a great weekend but I'm feeling a bit exhausted from all the activity.  Colin and I are doing well.  I saw him a couple of hours after I got back from my trip when he got back from surfing in the states.  We have a really good relationship, we see each other quite a bit but I don't get sick of him.  This week I get to meet his mother, she is coming out from Ontario for a week.  We are all going to have dinner together on Wednesday; I'm excited and nervous all at the same time.  Colin thinks that his mother is going to like me, I certainly hope so, but I'm still a bit jittery about the whole thing.  Colin and I have spent so many nights together it is driving my parents nuts.  My mum is concerned, but really, it isn't too much of her business.  I really enjoy spending time with Colin, but it will be much easier during the summer when I don't have to worry that it'll impact my grades.  So far, my grades are still straight As, but I have a gigantic midterm tomorrow that I am pretty nervous about.  I guess the main thing that I am nervous about is being in love.  I can find things about Colin to complain about, but I don't want to break up with him.  I love him and I know that no one is perfect.  He is the best guy for me and he is sure about me.  I guess I have trouble accepting the fact that things are fine and that as long as we both communicate and don't let other people get in the way that things will only get better.  I'm just going to do my best and concentrate on enjoying the time I spend with him and if we are meant to be we will end up together.  *sitting at work stressing about tomorrow's midterm*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"I hate bylaw officers!  I got a $40 parking ticket yesterday, grrrrrr.  My fault, but still NO FAIR!!!  The concert at Michelle's was pretty cool, we all hung out and talked until around 6pm when the  urlLink band  showed up.  There was a live radio show and the djs interviewed all the band members and we heard a few live songs.  It was good to see some of the  urlLink Alpha Phis  again.  Later on I met up with Kimi, but she wasn't feeling too well so we just hung around her place instead of bike riding.  On Saturday we're going to the mall to pick out a whole new wardrobe for her.  It should be fun, I just hope I can avoid buying too many things for myself.  After shopping I'm meeting up with the boy to go to the waterslides in the valley.  Hopefully on Sunday we'll get to go to the lake near his place and maybe even take his  urlLink motorcycle  (read: crotch rocket), I keep wanting to go back up there after hiking the trail a few weeks back.  I've definately got to hit the gym tonight I have been slacking for the last few days due partly to a running injury.  Stupid old runner made me get a huge blister under my big toe nail!  Ugh, at least I have bright new silver runners to try out tonight!  *chair dancing to Secret Agent Man*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Tuesday already!  I'm going to see Terminator 3 with Stephen tonight, I didn't see the first two, but he's really excited about this one so I'll be a good girlfriend and go.    Last weekend was lots of fun.  On Saturday it was Heidi's birthday so we all went to the water slides and then to her place for dinner.  Her boyfriend made her a cake, it was so cute it said ""Happy Birthday Heidi"" in strawberries!  Well actually it said ""Happy Birday"", apparently he got distracted while making it, but still how sweet!  On Sunday the boy and I went swimming again.  I don't think I will ever be able to knock him over!  Oh the trials of being small!  Monday night was pretty dull, I went to my boot camp class and got all gross and sweaty then I went home and watched too much t.v.  Ah well one has to vegetate some time I suppose.  *sitting at my computer trying to drink 2 litres of water a day*"
DZ3ZKUD,female,24,"Well T3 wasn't too bad, but it wasn't too good either.  Yay Ann is back from Taiwan!  Woo hoo, I didn't figure she'd be gone long, but she's back sooner than I expected.  We are going to do dinner tomorrow night with Grace.  Yay!    Not much is happening on the Cryssie front.  I kinda miss the frat now that I've been home for a couple of months.  It was nice to have my own place where I could come and go from whenever I pleased.  I miss the karaoke nights with Laurence, the stupidity of the Ray G. situation, Brett's dumb comments, but I am greatly relieved to no longer share a roof with Kristaps.  Psi U was a great place, albeit a bit run down.  Being one of five girls living in a guys' frat house is an experience that I highly reccommend to any girl who can tolerate the mess and odd happenings.  I think my favourite Psi U memories are kitchen parties, painting Laurences toenails, playing pool in the basement, wathcing Simpsons every night at 5:30pm and songfest practices in the front room.    Top Five Reasons (in no particular order) to live at Psi U 1. Cheap rent 2. Good food 3. Having a place to crash on campus 4. 3am runs 5. Anything can happen  Well back to work, Kimi and I are biking today for exercise, should be fun!  *trying to stay awake after going to the late movie last night*"
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"BBC NEWS    Eating fruit could protect against an age-related eye disease which can cause blindness, research suggests.    Researchers from the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston followed the progress of over 118,000 people for between 12 and 18 years.   Those who ate three or more servings of fruit a day were 36% less likely to develop age-related maculopathy than people who ate less than 1.5 per day.   The study is published in the Archives of Ophthalmology.  Age-related maculopathy, or age-related macular degeneration, is the leading cause of blindness in people over 65.   The condition is caused by the deterioration of the macula, a part of the light sensitive layer in the eye called the retina.   The cells either break down, or the tissue is damaged by the growth of blood vessels under the retina.   There is a treatment for the condition, but no cure.   Previous research has shown antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation protects against the condition, and that supplementation with high-doses of vitamins C and E, beta carotene and zinc delays its progress.   Diet survey   The researchers in this study looked at how the amount of fruit, vegetables and vitamins people ate related to their risk of developing the eye disease.   They followed 77,562 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study and 40,866 men who were taking part in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.   All were at least 50 years old when the study began with no diagnosis of ARM. Women were followed for up to 18 years, and men were followed for up to 12 years.   Women completed questionnaires about their diets up to five times over the follow-up period (in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990 and 1994), and men three times, in 1986, 1990, and 1994.   They also reported their vitamin and supplement use once every two years.   Over the follow-up period, 329 women and 135 men were diagnosed with early stage ARM, and 217 women and 99 men with neovascular ARM, a more severe type of the condition.   While three or more portions of fruit a day was found to significantly cut someone's risk of developing neovascular ARM - a severe form of the disease, eating more vegetables did not appear to hold any benefit.   Bananas and oranges were strongly linked with protective benefits.   Researchers also found that levels of antioxidant vitamins or carotenoids - compounds responsible for the red, yellow and orange pigments found in some fruits and vegetables - were not directly related to ARM risk.   Food versus supplements   Writing in the journal, the researchers led by Dr Eunyoung Cho, said: ""Fruit intake was inversely related to age-related maculopathy, particularly neovascular ARM, the form of this disease that frequently involves severe vision loss.   ""Since none of the antioxidants or carotenoids contributed substantially, other factors may also contribute to the reduced risk.""   They suggest other constituents of fruits with potential health benefit include flavanoids, fibre, folate and potassium.   Catherine Collins, a dietician based at St George's Hospital in London, said the study findings made sense because certain substances found in fruit had specific benefits for eye health.   She said the beneficial link with fruit may have been clearer in this study because people did not eat enough of lutein-rich vegetables such as spinach for them to have a noticeable effect.   She added: ""There are substances in foods which give you extra benefits compared to vitamin and mineral supplements."""
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Once, Prophet Mohammad (Sal-lal-laaho-Alaih-e-W-sallam), said to Ali (razi-Allaho-anho):    Ali ! Do 5 Works Before Sleeping      Daily.Give 4000 Dinar Alms/sacrifice (sadqaa) daily before sleeping.    Read whole Qur'aan one time daily before sleeping.   Pay price of Jannah,daily before sleeping.   Make a truce/peace between two fighting men daily before sleeping.    Perform a Hajj daily before sleeping.    Then Ali (razi-Allaho-anho) requested Ya' RasoolAllah (Sal-lal-laaho-Alaih-e-W-sallam) It is very hard to do how can I'll do all this?   Prophet Mohammad (Sal-lal-laaho-Alaih-e-W'sallam) replied:     Read ""Sura-e-Fatiha"" 4 times..... Its equal to sacrifice 4000 dinars.   Read ""Sura-e-Ikhlaas"" 3 times.... Its equal to read Quran one time.   Read ""Durood-e-Pak"" 10 times..... Its equal to pay price of Jannah.

Its equal to perform Hajj.    Who knew one could get this much blessings so easily?"
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"CBC News   CHICAGO - An extract of prickly pear cactus may help prevent hangover symptoms such as dry mouth and nausea, scientists have found.   Unlike folk remedies like eating a greasy breakfast, the extract seems to help forestall symptoms rather than relieve them.   Dr. Jeff Wiese of Tulane University in New Orleans and his colleagues randomly assigned 55 young adults to either take the extract or a placebo.   All of the volunteers then ate a fast-food dinner. Four hours later, they started drinking either:   Vodka.   Gin.    Rum.    Bourbon.    Scotch.    Tequila.  The volunteers, aged 21 to 35, drank up to 1.75 grams of alcohol per kilogram of body mass, an amount that produced hangovers in previous studies.   Drunken study participants were driven home. The next morning, they ranked nine symptoms of hangover severity. A week later, the experiment was repeated with the two groups trading places.   The extract showed statistically significant improvements in nausea, lack of appetite, and dry mouth but Wiese's team did not measure if it helped the foggy-headed feeling common in hangover sufferers.   ""In this randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we found hangover symptom severity to be moderately reduced by an extract of the prickly pear plant, Opuntia ficus indica,"" the researchers wrote in Monday's issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.   The researchers also measured levels of C-reactive protein, which is thought to be involved in inflammation and hangovers.   They found those who took the extract had 40 per cent less C-reactive protein in their bloodstreams compared to those who took a placebo.   The research was funded by the U.S. government and a nutritional supplement company that markets a form of the extract."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"BBC News    The latest endorsement for using blood-sucking leeches for medical purposes has come from the US government.    In a world where medical advances are dominated by developments in drugs and surgery it seems that in certain fields these humble creatures cannot be beaten.   They are highly prized as a tool for healing skin grafts or restoring circulation, especially in reconstructive surgery.   Now the US Food and Drug Administration has approved an application from French firm Ricarimpex SAS to market leeches for medicinal purposes.   These hungry little Draculas have been used in medicine for centuries and were first employed in Egypt about 2,500 years ago.   Later, they were applied to treat all kinds of ailments from headaches to gout.   Through bloodletting, it was thought that leeches would drain ""impure blood"" from the body, thereby curing illness.   Eventually, scientific research showed that leeches were unlikely to stop a headache, but are useful in surgery.   They are often used today in plastic and reconstructive surgery, because a natural anticoagulant they secrete fights blood clots and restores proper blood flow to inflamed parts of the body.   Thousands of patients owe the successful reattachment of body parts to miraculous technological advances in plastic and reconstructive surgery.   But some of these operations might have failed if leeches had not been reintroduced into the operating room.   The appendages reattached include fingers, hands, toes, legs, ears, noses and nipples following breast reconstructive surgery.   Buying time   During operations, micro surgeons usually have little trouble attaching the two ends of the arteries, because arteries are thick-walled and relatively easy to suture.   Veins, however, are thin-walled and especially difficult to suture, particularly if the tissue is badly damaged.   All too often the surgeon can get blood to flow in the reattached arteries but not veins.   With the venous circulation severely compromised, the blood going to the reattached finger becomes congested, or stagnant; the reattached portion turns blue and lifeless and is at serious risk of being lost.   It is in these cases that leeches are summoned.   Ken Dunn, consultant burns and plastic surgeon at the South Manchester Burns and Plastic Surgery Service said: ""We use leeches to establish a flow of blood through tissue where there is congestion of blood, usually because the flow of venous blood out is not adequate, while the arterial flow of blood into the tissue is good or excellent.   ""The treatment simply buys time for the venous drainage to open up and improve, usually 3-5 days. If this is not done the tissue will die from that congestion of blood.   ""Leeches are extremely effective and better than simply putting a hole in the tissue to make it bleed because the leech lines the bite they make with a good anticoagulant that is very long lasting.   ""On average the tissue bleeds about 10 times the volume of blood that the leech actually removes to feed on, making it a very efficient and effective treatment.   ""Treatment with a single leech will last hours and allow blood flow in the tissue during that time.""   Natural anaesthetic   The key to success is the exploitation of a unique property of the leech bite, namely, the creation of a puncture wound that bleeds literally for hours.   The leech's saliva contains substances that anaesthetise the wound area, dilate the blood vessels to increase blood flow and prevent the blood from clotting.   Mr Dunn said: ""Leeches are a treatment associated with medieval times and appear a tad dated.   ""However, much the same as maggots and a small list of other treatments, leeches still have their place in modern medicine.""   They do have their drawbacks, one of which is the patients' squeamishness about having three-inch slimy parasites attached to their wounds.   They can sometimes slip off patients and reattach themselves to other parts of the body not in need of therapy.   However if you are ever in that unfortunate position of needing leech therapy, it may be a case of lie back and think of something more attractive if it means saving a limb."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"New Scientist   A plant banned as an illegal drug in some countries could help boost men’s fertility, say UK researchers.   The leaves of khat, a plant cultivated in East Africa and the Arabian peninsula, contain a chemical that peps up sperm and increase their chances of fertilizing an egg. The researchers suggest the chemical could one day be produced as an over-the-counter treatment for couples experiencing problems conceiving.  Khat (Catha edulis) has been known for centuries for the euphoria its leaves induce when chewed. The stimulant, cathinone, is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and norephedrine. These belong to a group of chemicals called PPAs, which are similar to amphetamines and adrenaline.  Lynn Fraser and her team at the Centre for Reproduction, Endocrinology and Diabetes at King’s College in London, UK, decided to test the effects of PPAs on sperm. They were studying the final stage of sperm development called capacitation, where sperm ""switch on"" and develop the ability to fertilise an egg.   Accelerated effect    The team placed mouse sperm in four different PPA compounds: cathine, norephedrine, adrenaline and noradrenaline and tested to see how they affected capacitation. All four accelerated capacitation even at low concentrations.   The team also tested the effects of cathine on human sperm, with similar results. This means that cathine can pep up a man’s sperm, increasing the number able to fertilise an egg.  The team then tested the effects of PPAs on the final stage of capacitation where the sperm’s head pops open and releases the enzymes it needs to burrow into the egg.   This ""acrosome reaction"" is triggered by chemicals produced by the egg, but can also happen spontaneously. Fraser’s team found that cathine prevented this spontaneous reaction, but did not affect the reaction prompted by the egg.  So cathine can both turn sperm on and stop them peaking too early, maximising the chances of fertilisation. But Fraser says: “I certainly wouldn’t advocate anyone going out and chewing khat leaves.” A consistent, measured dose, as would be found in a commercially-prepared drug, would be preferable, she says.   Undiagnosed problems   Many men experiencing fertility problems have normal sperm counts. The cause may be undiagnosed problems with sperm function, explained Fraser, but no-one knows how prevalent this problem is. A drug based on cathine might help.  “We are not suggesting that this would be a panacea for infertile couples,” she told New Scientist. However, couples trying to conceive often take steps to improve their chances by altering their lifestyles, such as stopping smoking, she added.   Taking an over-the-counter drug containing compounds such as cathine could just be an extension of this, especially if conception were taking longer than expected. “Anything that reduces the need to go for assisted reproduction would be valuable,” said Fraser.  The research was presented on Monday at the 20th conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Berlin, Germany."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"BBC News     Citrus peel may not be very appetising - but research suggests it could be very good for you.     US scientists fattened up hamsters on a high-cholesterol diet, and then fed them compounds found in tangerine and orange peel.   They found the compounds signficantly lowered the animals' levels of LDL cholesterol - which is associated with heart disease.   The study is published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry.   The compounds, known as polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), are antioxidants that belong to a group of plant chemicals called flavonoids. Flavonoids exist in a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as tea and red wine.   A pilot study suggests that humans derive the same benefit from the peel compounds, and researchers are testing whether a supplement with combines PMFs with a form of vitamin E can reduce cholesterol levels.   Lead researcher Dr Elzbieta Kurowska, of the Canadian company KGK Synergize, said citrus juice contains only a small amount of the relevant PMFs as the compounds are not soluble in water. Peel, on the other hand, contains 20 times the level.   In addition, the peel-derived compounds are more concentrated and easily absorbed and metabolised by the body.   In the study hamsters were given the two PMFs most commonly found in citrus fruits - tangeretin and nobiletin.   A diet containing just 1% PMFs was enough to cut the animals' cholesterol by up to 40%.   Powerful effect   Other hamsters were given a diet enriched with two other flavonoids, hesperetin and naringenin.   This diet also lowered LDL cholesterol - but it took three times as much of the compounds to yield the same effect seen with the PMFs.   Dr Kurowska said it appears the compounds may work by lowering the secretion of cholesterol from the liver.   She said: ""Our study has shown that super-flavonoids have the most potent cholesterol-lowering effect of any other citrus flavonoid.   ""We believe that super-flavonoids have the potential to rival or even beat the cholesterol-lowering effect of some prescription drugs, without the risk of side effects.""   The Department of Health announced earlier this month that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs - previously only available on prescription - were to be made available over-the-counter at pharmacists.   Sarah Schenker, a dietician from the British Nutrition Foundation, said: ""It is not a big surprise that they have found something in plants that can have this effect - after all, cholesterol-reducing products such as Benecol contain extract of bark.   ""But whether they are useful will depend on how strong their effect is. Statins are very strong drugs.""   Previous research has also indicated that citrus juice can reduce the risk of cancer.   Judy O'Sullivan, a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""We will be interested to see if similar results emerge from long-term studies involving people.   ""It is also important to stress that whatever the cholesterol-reducing potential of citrus peel, our advice remains the same: regular physical activity and eating a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in saturated fat are the best ways to avoid high cholesterol."""
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Forbes   NEW YORK - A new set of government-sponsored guidelines will highlight the need to keep a close watch on high blood pressure in children--and even, in some cases, to use anti-hypertension medicines to keep the problem in check.   The guidelines are being presented May 20 at the American Society of Hypertension's annual meeting in New York, and highlighted in an opinion piece by Dr. Julie Ingelfinger in the May 20 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Ingelfinger, a professor of medicine at Harvard, writes that the guidelines should ""constitute a call to action.""   The full guidelines will be published in the July issue of the medical journal Pediatrics. They indicate that between 1% and 3% of American children may have seriously high blood pressure. The problem is made worse by the fact that many of these children have other risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity or high cholesterol. More than 15% of American children may be obese.   ""We have enough evidence to show that hypertension really has its origins in childhood,"" says Dr. Bonita Falkner, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, who helped write the guidelines. ""It's not just a disease that grandparents have.""   The first guideline is that all children should have their blood pressure measured during checkups. That's not new. Sometimes, high blood pressure can be caused by other health problems, particularly kidney disease, says Falkner. These obviously need to be treated. But the guidelines put a new focus on treating high blood pressure in children, partly thanks to newly available information about drugs they might take. First, kids should be instructed to lose weight, exercise, limit the amount of salt in their diet and eat fresh fruits and vegetables. ""For those who do not respond to lifestyle changes,"" says Falkner, ""medication is appropriate.""   But which drug? Until relatively recently, medicines such as Pfizer's (nyse: PFE - news - people ) Norvasc and Novartis' (nyse: NVS - news - people ) Diovan would not have been tested in children. That state of affairs was changed by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, which encourages drug makers to study their medicines in children. Investors mostly think of this incentive of as a way for firms to get a six-month extension on the patent life of a drug. But to doctors, it is very important. ""Data is slowly coming out and it gives doctors some guidance,"" she says.   Still, that could mean some tough choices for doctors. John M. Flack, a professor of medicine at Wayne Sate University in Detroit, worries, for instance, that ACE inhibitors can cause problems in fetal development--a definite downside in teenage girls. Still, Flack says ""The tide of obesity is going to mean a lot of hypertensive kids.""   High blood pressure medicines already bring in $40 billion globally for drug giants such as Merck (nyse: MRK - news - people ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (nyse: BMY - news - people ), and Sanofi-Synthelabo (nyse: SNY - news - people ). In this high-stakes marketing war, drug companies are pushing their medicines to small sections of the population. Flack, for instance, is presenting data at the Society of Hypertension meeting regarding how a combination pill made by Novartis works better for African Americans with diabetes than a single-drug pill made by Merck. The study was funded by Novartis.   African Americans have long been identified as a high-risk population for hypertension. But children have not necessarily been seen that way--until now. The new guidelines may create one more new market for firms looking for ways to boost hypertension drug sales."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"News-Medical   The rate of childhood type 2 diabetes is 13 times as high among South Asian children as it is among white children, reveals the first UK survey of the disease in Archives of Disease in Childhood.  But overall national rates are still low, compared with countries such as Japan, where rates have soared over the past 30 years, the survey shows.  The findings are based on a survey of all 228 diabetic centres in 2000, carried out by the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinical Trials/Audit Group. http://www.bsped.org.uk/  Data were collected on children up to the age of 16 with a presumed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as a result of environmental factors, those with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)¯caused by defective genes¯and those with ""atypical"" type 1 diabetes.  Responses were received from 177 centres, which, between them, cared for over 15,000 children with diabetes.  Specialists reported 112 children to the survey, 25 of whom had type 2 diabetes and 20 of whom had MODY.  Children with type 2 diabetes tended to be older when diagnosed¯around the age of 13¯than children with type 1 disease. They were almost always female and overweight or obese. Most had a relative with the disease.  Rates of type 2 diabetes were more than 13 times as high among South Asian children as they were among white children.  Children with MODY were around the age of 11 when diagnosed, significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than those with type 2 disease. And all of them were white.  Based on the figures and population estimates, the researchers calculated that the national rate of type 2 diabetes is 0.21 per 100,000 children. This is low, and much lower than a recent study from Birmingham suggested, indicating that there are large regional variations.  But they caution: ""Our survey almost certainly underestimates type 2 diabetes, MODY, and secondary diabetes?""  It is well known that children with type 2 disease don't always have symptoms, and therefore do not come to the notice of doctors, say the authors. And they conclude: ""All prevalence estimates based on diagnosed cases will be an underestimate."" http://www.bma.org.uk"
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"Health Talk    Strokes are more likely to occur on a Monday, as opposed to any other day of the week, according to a Finnish study published in the July 22 online issue of the journal Stroke.   Researchers from the National Public Health Institute of Finland examined the incidence of ischemic stroke by day of the week and its relationship with age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES).    A ischemic stroke is caused by blood clots that block blood flow to the brain.   In their findings, researchers report most strokes occur on Monday with the fewest number of strokes occurring on Sunday.   The incidence of ischemic stroke is much higher in persons with low socioeconomic status than in those with high socioeconomic status, the researchers report.   The highest incidence of stroke occurred in low income elderly men aged 60 to 74, on Mondays.   No Monday excess was observed in persons with high socioeconomic status.   ""This finding may suggest reasons for the higher IS (ischemic stroke) incidence in persons with low socioeconomic positions and open up some possibilities for prevention,"" conclude the authors."
B2K8ZXH,male,16,"BBC News    The economic and social cost of mental illness in Northern Ireland is nearly £3bn a year, according to research.   It is more than the sum spent on the entire National Health Service in the province.   The figure is published in a report by the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health on Thursday.    Mental illness is calculated as being a 25% larger problem in Northern Ireland than it is in England.   Researchers have taken into account the cost to the health service, employers and the economy.   They have also added in a figure based on the human cost of mental illness.   Michael Parsonage of the Sainsbury Centre of Mental Health, which was involved in writing the report, said it was important to realise the scale of the problem.   ""£2.8bn for the total costs of mental health problems in Northern Ireland is a very large figure, more than the total amount spent on health care in Northern Ireland, on all conditions,"" he said.   ""The problem clearly could get worse. The scale is already very large and justifies some fairly major action to try to reduce that cost.""   Graham Logan of the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health said the effects of the Troubles and social deprivation were partly to blame for the difference in the province and England.    ""Our mental health needs are higher, the spend is lower. This document emphasises that if we were to be on a parity with England today, there needs to be an immediate cash injection of £60m.   ""We are living with the legacy of the Troubles. There's the whole issue of socio-economic deprivation in Northern Ireland.   'Severe stress'   ""There's a whole range of issues that need to be looked at.""   He said workplace and family issues were the main causes of severe stress.   ""There needs to be an holistic approach, there needs to be a strategic development of mental health promotion, mental health prevention and the importance of early intervention.""   The report is called Counting the Cost and is to be submitted to the Department of Health.   A Department of Health spokesman said that spending on mental health care rose by 4.5% over the past two years.   Last year, an additional £8m was provided for mental health and learning disability services over and above inflation.   The spokesman said a review of mental health and learning disabilities was under way and that future funding would be determined on the basis of its findings."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Friday afternoon saw my temporary attempt to ignore abstracts long enough to enjoy my birthday weekend. Tiffany (also known as the girl I spilled beer on) had people over to her place to watch the opening ceremonies of the Olympics and eat pizza. Dan had promised to let me know where he, Kristin, John, and perhaps others were going to end up for the night, but Dan's a liar. Hear that, Dan? Nathan and Melissa hosted an evening of drinking games (""presidents and assholes""). I made my promised appearance and played for a few hands, long enough to work my way up from asshole. In the first round, Nathan, as president, dictated that I should take a short of vodka from a very tall shot glass. He filled it about half way, but the result was perhaps three or four shots. I took it like a champ, though.   Saturday, I spent most of the day preparing the Ward Cave (also known as ""Ward's House of Love"", a name which didn't fit particularly well that night) for my birthday party, doing requisite cleaning, picking up some drinks and snacks from the grocery store (Randall's had Shiner for $9.99 for a 12 pack, rock; I grabbed two), and putting together a suitable party mix with which iTunes could DJ. I went and picked up Jeff around 6:30, and waited for the party to start.   Randall's, by the way, marked the second time in twenty four hours that I was IDed, making me wonder if I did, in fact, age any. My increase in grey hairs would seem to remove any doubt, though.   Note to self: don't start a party at 7:00. I thought perhaps those that wanted some hot  urlLink Star Pizza  action would want to eat around then, but apparently not many people had planned on getting in on the hot Star Pizza action. Shortly after 8:00, Jeff and I gave up and I ordered two larges. While I was gone, people started arriving, and the pizzas got consumed fairly quickly after my return.   I had e-mailed about 25 people the invite; those who came, in order of arrival, were: Jeff, Stephanie, Jennifer, Nathan, Melissa, Brandy, David, Tiffany, John, Dan, Kristin, Char, Graham, Kennedy, Graham's sister. Not a bad turnout, although considering I invited every girl that I have a putative interest in and none of them showed, that part was a little disappointing.   The beer supply held out well, and my liquor was barely touched (except for Stephanie stealing shots of my sweet, sweet, Cazadores, yet failing to carry through on her promise to sleep with me). The evening ended with Jeff and Char giving me advice on clothing. Char told me I need to pick and image and dress accordingly. I'll get right to work on that... Nathan took some pictures at the party; however, a lot of them seem to be of feet or cleavage. If there any appropriate ones, I'll but them over on the main site. My official estimate for the evening is eight beers.   Sunday, my aunt and uncle took me to  urlLink Texas Land & Cattle  for dinner in honor of the birthday. I do love me some steak.   Monday was spent reading journal articles, feeling that I would never come up with a topic for abstract number two. After going to bed, I was struck by blinding inspiration, and now have drafts of abstracts one and two composed in my head and ready to write. I went up to school today to abuse the lab printer, and then read this afternoon and evening in support of abstract number two before Nathan, Melissa, and Jennifer kidnapped me to go read with them at the library, which, I discovered, eats at one's soul in a manner similar to the Baylor University computer science labs. I think it has something to do with white walls, fluroescent lights, and cheap furniture. I also sent off a proposal for my laptop purchase today.   Tomorrow will hopefully bring two drafts of abstracts. If things go well, I'd like to go see Magnolia Electric Co. (formerly Songs: Ohia) play their (his?—it's basically just Jason Molina) brand of country/folk. And it would be nice to catch last weekend's episode of Six Feet Under at some point.   Sorry, readers, that life is boring these days. Hopefully there will be glimpses of excitement between now and November; if not, expect a grand return to form at our departmental retreat. Or, possibly, my failing out of graduate school. Dan, I'm sorry I called you a liar. Care to keep a job open for me?"
QCKJZB6,male,23,"So now's the part that will be particularly boring to my female readership (which may very well be everybody at this point). I'll soon be acquiring several new pieces of electronics. Think of it like getting a new pair of cute shoes.   I've had my Sony Ericsson  urlLink T68i  since this time last year, and though I like it, the reception is less than good, and it's getting a bit dated at this point. Its newer siblings are available free to new subscribers of tMobile, Cingular, and AT&T through Amazon.com in exchange for a one year contract. If AT&T wanted to keep me as a customer, they could give me the same deal they're offering their new customers. So, I called customer service. After twenty minutes on hold:   Me: ""Yes, my contract is almost up, and I'm interested in renewing it in exchange for a new phone, the  urlLink T637 ."" AT&T: ""Let me see what kind of price I can get for you on that. Can I put you on hold?"" Me: ""Sure."" AT&T: ""OK, I can get that for you for $200 with a one year contract, or $150 with a two year contract."" Me: ""Both you and Cingular offer that phone for free to new customers. Can you do any better?"" AT&T: ""Let me check and see if there are any additional rebates... OK, I can get you an additional $50 off."" Me: ""That's still way to much. Unless you can do better, I'm going to take my number to Cingular."" AT&T: ""I'm sorry, sir, that's all I can do."" Me: ""Could you tell me when my contract is up then?""  I had a second conversation that proceded in a manner very similar to the first one (including the twenty minutes on hold). Last night, I called once again. After twenty minutes on hold:   Me: ""Yes, I'd like to know when my contract runs out."" AT&T: ""Could I ask why you want to know that?"" Me: ""I'm unhappy with my current phone and would like to switch to Cingular since they have the phone I want for free."" AT&T: ""Would you be willing to sign a one year contract if we matched that offer?"" Me: ""Cingular only requires a one year contract."" At&T: ""OK, we can do that.""  I don't know if my approach was just different enough this time to elicit a different response, or if it was the representatitive I spoke with, or what, but I was quite pleased. I thought for a while I might have to call in Customer Service Sabrina. So, in the end, I saved myself the trouble of porting my number, paying for the phone up front, and filling out rebates; they're even fedexing it to me. That rocks."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Rebecca and her friend Kelly departed Houston on a flight to Amsterdam yesterday, and I was tasked with ferrying them to the airport. They picked me up from school, and then I drove Rebecca's car. Now Rebecca's got a '99 Camry, and while I certainly wouldn't claim that it's a high-performance automobile, it's a huge improvement from the '94 that I drive, and much better suited to Houston traffice. It's nice to be able to change lanes knowing that you have enough acceleration to keep from getting run over.   So we took highway 59 to the airport. We were driving along, and it occurred to me: there are three of us in this car. That's a rather high amount of occupancy, which makes us... a high occupancy vehicle!  Obviously, I took the next available entrance into the HOV lane. I'd never driven in one before, but it was hot. It was like the glorious feeling I got the first time I hit the tollway, but better. It's a nice, wide, luxurious lane, with concrete barriers. We saw two other cars in the lane during the entire trip (sadly, I was behind them and had to slow down for them), but mostly, it was like having my own private road. We even had our own, special exit for the airport. It was so hot; so, so hot. I felt sorry for all the losers driving on the normal road.   More electronics showed up yesterday. I had ordered an  urlLink Airport Express  from Apple, and it arrived, along with some assorted cabling I needed to go with it. It's basically a small wireless base station (which in and of itself is of limited use until I get a laptop), but you can also hook it up to your stereo and play music wirelessly from your computer, all with a beautifully pure, digital optical connection. Sadly, I haven't gotten to try it out yet, because, though I have the wireless card to put in the iMac, I don't have the additional adapter for the wireless card that goes in the iMac. Today, hopefully, USPS willing. There'll be a writeup on my music page when I've played with it a bit.   Also, my phone's due to arrive today.   Last night, I accompanied Stephanie and Jennifer to a  urlLink They Might Be Giants concert . I'm not a huge fan, but I like them well enough. The opening act was  urlLink Corn Mo , and his ""Meatloaf playing accordion singing songs about junior high"" act was fairly entertaining, as was his rendition of ""We Are the Champions"" and his story of how he quit his day job to play accordion. They Might Be Giants were relatively entertaining, and played such classics as ""Why Does the Sun Shine"", ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", and ""James K. Polk"" as well as a song about the venue they performed in (they've been writing one for each show) and the theme to ""Malcolm in the Middle."" An enjoyable show, although the venue staff was a bit green, and, being on the second floor, I was afraid that it was going to collapse due to the combined weight of the entire audience pogo-ing, which reminds me of that Onion article, ""500 Record Store Clerks Feared Dead After Roof Collapses At Yo La Tango Concert"". I would link to it, but, in one of the greatest tragedies of our age, the Onion's archives are no longer free."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"I just discovered that my car was broken into. Again.   It's almost exactly the same, too. Once again, they failed to get anything valuable, wasting both their time and mine. They once again smashed the small, rear, passenger-side window, let themselves in, tried to pull my stereo out, failed (miserably), stole my faceplate, and messed up the plastic molding around the stereo. Fuckers.   But this time, it was at my apartment complex. Back in March, I was in Montrose, where lots of shady people roam, to see a band play, parking was scarce, and I ended up on a poorly-lit residential street a couple of blocks from the bar. This time, I was parked in well-lit, covered parking close to the building. At least I know where to go to get the glass repaired. And this time, despite my opposition to the noise pollution, I guess I'll be purchasing a car alarm.   I'm currently waiting on Houston's Slowest to come by and file a report. Last time, they did it over the phone. It didn't inspire a ton of confidence, but at least it was quick.   Honestly. This is going to cost a $50 deductable.

QCKJZB6,male,23,"Around 9:00 last night, I realized that I had accomplished everything useful that I was going to accomplish on my Monday. So, I thought I'd try to find something worthwhile to do. First, though, I watched Teen Titans. I love the Cartoon Network.   So at 9:30, I called Stephanie (first year grad student in developmental biology at BCM, lives in my complex).   Stephanie: ""What's up?"" Me: ""I'm bored."" Stephanie: ""So am I."" Me: ""So what are we going to do?"" Stephanie: ""We could have sex."" Me: ""Stop being a tease. You've already told me you're not attracted to me. So what are we going to do?"" Stephanie: ""Yeah, but you're so pathetic I just might give in."" Me: ""I don't need your pity. So what are we doing tonight?"" Stephanie: ""I don't know, there's nothing to do in Houston."" Me: ""Well, what would you have done in San Francisco?"" Stephanie: ""Gone and hung out at a coffee house."" Me: ""We have coffee houses here.""  So we called Melissa (first year grad student in cell and molecular biology here at BCM), whose husband is out of town), confirmed that she, too, was bored, and after I had established that we would have to go to an establishment that also had alcohol available, took off for  urlLink Onion Creek , or ""The O. C."" as they call it (not sure, but I think that one's taken).   Anyway, I really like the place. It's got more of a coffee house feel than a bar feel, but yet it still serves beer. I had a snakebite and a bloody harry (bloody mary mix and beer—surprisingly good). And Melissa and I split a mini pizza. Stephanie, despite her talk about how much she wanted hot chocolate, ended up with cake. The girls there were pretty cute too.   Midway through beer number two (the final one of the evening), Stephanie asked if she was going to have to drive home. In her mind, if there's one drop of alcohol in my blood, it renders me utterly incapable of any sort of fine motor control. Despite the number of times I've tried to explain to her the concept of the ""legal limit"" and shown her Bryan's BAC calculator, it doesn't seem to have taken. Thankfully, I made it home without causing any death and/or destruction."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Fridays at West Alabama Icehouse have been going downhill lately. Last week, I showed up and Graham was there, alone. This week, it was Graham and Kennedy (sans the girl she wanted to set me up with). We hung out a bit, drinking beer and eating the free hot dogs, before they retired for the evening to watch a movie, and I went off in search of something else to do. I don't know what's behind this fall-off in attendance; perhaps Graham's e-mails reminding us to come out are no longer as effective as they used to be; perhaps the change in time (moved later due to the heat of the summer) has thrown people off; perhaps it's just become boring; or perhaps people are just busy. Who knows? Certainly not I.   I called up Jeff, post-doc extradonaire, and we decided to go see a movie. Shymalan's  The Village  narrowly won out over  The Manchurian Candidate , and not-so-narrowly won out over  Napolean Dynamite  and  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle  (which, shamed though I am to admit it, I want to see—it would be perfect Drunk At The Dollar Theater fodder, were Sabrina only here).   I liked it. It was well filmed, written, and acted, and I thought that Shymalan's signature twist ending was clever, though Jeff found it distracting, and many others in the theater loudly complained that it was lame or cheesy. I'd recommend it highly had I not heard so many dissenting opinions; so, your milage may vary.   Saturday was reserved for traditional Saturday afternoon activies; I went to Susan and Jerry's and did laundry, and we went to dinner at the Black-eyed Pea, which, though not a personal favorite of mine, was free and therefore beyond reproach.   When I first got interested in computers, I got a subscription to   urlLink MacWorld  , which, thanks to my genetic predisposition to read things cover-to-cover, was in large part responsible for greatly expanding my knowledge of computers. Since home audio is becoming a big hobby of mine, I went ahead and purchased a subscription to   urlLink Stereophile  . It was only about a dollar an issue, but I have a feeling it's going to wind up having a bigger budgetary impact in the long run. Still, most of the products they deal with are not only outside of my pricerange, but  way  outside of my pricerange, so hopefully it won't incite me to do anything rash. I also picked up a copy of   urlLink The Absolute Sound   to see if the grass is greener on the other side of glossy-print fence. All of that is to say that I started working my way through my first issue of  Stereophile  while I was doing laundry.   Road construction is a perpetual fact of life in Houston, and loop 610 was down to one lane for a couple of miles on my return trip, near I-10. This was clearly signed (""left 2 lanes closed ahead""), and so I took the opportunity to go ahead and move into the lane that I knew would remain open. Of course, there are those who think that they're better than everybody else and instead drive ahead in the soon-to-be-closed lanes, knowing that somebody will let them over at the last possible second when they have to merge. These people are absolute failures as as human beings and will be the downfall of society as we know it. In return for a minimal gain for themselves (moving ten or twenty cars forward in line) which saves them an insignificant amount of time, they are responsible for further exacerbating the situation for those of us who actually know how to drive. As far as I'm concerned, they can all go to hell. I ended up in a battle of wills with one particular car trying to merge in front of me. I lost, because though I'm willful, I'm not entirely stupid. I think a little part of me died.   Jeff and I met Dan and Kristin at  urlLink Mary Jane's  (ignore their gradual transition to the name ""Fat Cat"", it will always be Mary Jane's in the harts and minds of the hipsters of Houston) to see  urlLink The Damnwells :    and  urlLink Jesse Malin :     The former produced enjoyable if somewhat generic alt-country/power pop. Their lead singer criticized  urlLink this article  in the  Houston Press  which referred to Jesse Malin as a ""solipsistic fuckface"" and said that we, as a city, should be ashamed. What I was not prepared for was learning that the  Press 's reviewer was, in fact, more or less right. Malin played sub-par Ryan Adams-ish frat rock between telling stories about exposing himself to girls when he was in junior high. We left early and made the rounds at  urlLink the Harp , Whataburger, and Woodrow's."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"This, perhaps, will shock and amaze some of you, but it can be hard to get budding biologists out of the lab for a night of fun. At this point, most of the kids in my year are done with classes, so we go into lab in the morning (or afternoon), do some stuff, see the people that work in our general proximity, and then leave in the afternoon (or evening, or morning). There are some people whom I see on a regular basis because we're in the habit of doing things together, but there are a lot of people whom I don't yet know well, and no longer see in the course of a normal week at school.   Thankfully, David of the genetics program has consistently arranged an end-of-term happy hour at  urlLink Brian O'Neill's . It's sort of a half and half mix of Cricket's and Treff's. It's not one of my favorite places; this being a real city, there are bars with more character and better atmostphere, but I can't be too picky at this point. So we show up at 9:00, get a ticket for a free drink, and get extended happy hour pricing until 11:00. The turnout, while not what I hope, is usually decent, and it serves its purpose.   So, the evening's going well, and I've had three Shiners, two gin and tonics, a tequila and tonic, a whiskey and coke, and a shot of Southern Comfort (always reminds me of Paris and London with Rebecca last summer) with lime juice, provided in a glowing shot glass (containing glow stick technology, I think) by the SoCo liquor reps. Happy hour pricing ends, and there is talk of moving the party to a different venue. One group was in favor of  urlLink the Ginger Man , which I'm rather fond of. It seems like the kind of bar where graduate students would hang out (but in a good way), and has lots of beer on tap. The other group was mainly girls, and they wanted to go to  urlLink the Red Star  to go dancing.   Now I don't dance under most normal circumstances. It's really better for myself and others that way. Nobody gets hurt; nobody gets embarassed. However, sometimes, you have to go where the ladies are. So, Friday night, I learned how many drinks and how many cute girls it takes to get me out on the dance floor (well, with their power combined, at least). Those numbers are eight (well, nine after we got the club and girl A suggested that I needed a drink) and five, respectively. This, folks, is big.   So, taking two cars, we went downtown to the club. It wasn't  horribly  objectionable. Sad thing was, out of our group, I seemed to be the least inhibited person out there. There were two other guys with us. They were all just standing in a circle, dancing. I made an effort to actually dance  with  the girls. Turns out, they're all pretty shy, which shouldn't surprise me, but this is another example of being disappointed when people reinforce stereotypes.   There were some entertaining happenings. After we had parked, girl B left the car to flag down the other car, and since the neighborhood was a bit sketchy, I went with her at the request of the others in the car. She was talking to the other car on the cell phone, and informed them that she didn't know why I was with her, since she was a former kickboxer and could probably kick my ass (which might be true; she's about my size). I also had the following conversation with girl A:   Me: ""You're surprisingly shy out there on the dance floor. I thought you were into this sort of thing."" B: ""I can't really dance."" Me: ""You were a cheerleader in high school. How can you not know how to dance?"" B: ""How did you know that? Nobody's supposed to know about that!"" Me: ""You told me. At your birthday party. You were drunk."" B: ""Well, keep that quiet."" Me: ""OK. But I still have complete faith in your dancing ability.""  And she could dance, as long as it was by hereself. Or even with me, for about thirty seconds, until she got embarassed.   Oh well. I impressed myself by trying, anyway.   Also, thankfully, these people know that after the bars close, you go to Taco C. Even though there was complaining from people who had planned on getting up early to go into lab, I feel like I accomplished something."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Valhalla officially rocked. Three kegs, a hundred or so graduate students, thirty or so pizzas (Domino's—damn you, David W.), three hours. Record time. I showed up, got my first beer, drained it quickly, and then came back for more. The bartender's response: ""That was fast."" Yes, indeed. Thanks to Rice's liberal alcohol policy, the party quickly spilled out to the better-ventilated campus grounds outside of Valhalla. I quickly worked my way up to the six beer mark and then slowed things down a bit. By the time the kegs ran out at 9:00, I had probably had ten beers or so, Stephanie had bitten my neck (not sure what's going on there), I had made the rounds and hung out with some people whom I don't see frequently enough, and I had even introduced myself to some first year girls. Will & co. went to work moving the party to Woodrow's once the kegs were out, which, as always, wouldn't have been  my  first choice, but hell, I'll go where the people are.   Jeff took on the task of driving me around; we dropped by his place so he could change, and I got to try out Doom 3 for a few minutes. We made it back to Woodrow's, and amazingly, a good portion of the party had reconvened there. I'm not sure how it happened, but whoever pulled that off has my eternal respect. I had a couple more beers, heard about how there had been a golf cart joy ride back at Valhalla (golf cart theft and BCM gatherings quickly becoming like peanut butter and jelly), met a couple of the other first year girls (I really should have been in the genetics program, in retrospect), and discovered that Jeff can be a good wingman if you don't get him started on politics. Will started gathering up a crew to head to his place and partake of illicit substances, and, having just had the girl I was talking to casually work into the conversation the 'b' word (ladies: don't be paranoid that every man is trying to get into your pants, but if a guy you don't know spends a substantial portion of the evening talking to you, do try to work details such as boyfriends early on), Jeff and I made our exit.   I was thrilled to discover a substantial portion of the Miller High Life 24 pack I had bought a month ago still sitting in Will's fridge. It was shortly after that I reached the pinacle of fucked-up-ed-ness. I ended up lying on the floor, wanting desperately to communicate my desire to go home and hide in my bed, but not quite being able to. At one point, nausea swept over me, and I tried to fight it, but it just wasn't working.   Now I rarely vomit due to drinking, but when I do, it seems the results are spectacular. There was the time in New York when David and Thomas insisted on going to dinner after we had been drinking all afternoon on no lunch, and I lost it on the table. There was the time that I had just made it into my entryway at home, realized there was no way I could make it to the bathroom, and instead thought I'd make a run through the door for the yard, but failed to get the deadbolt undone.   This was different, though. In a moment of brilliant clarity, I noted the plastic shopping bag lying close to me, grabbed it, and positioned it correctly before I lost it entirely. If James Bond was fucked up and had to vomit, he couldn't have pulled off anything smoother than this. It was that good. I seriously impressed those present with my plastic bag-wielding prowess.   Pretty soon after that, I managed to convey that I should be given my keys so that I could walk the block home and go to bed. I thoughtfully placed a trashcan by my bed (which turned out to be a good idea), and slept. Next up, I'll have the Saturday report.   And now, a few pictures. First up, this is from Rebecca's return on Wednesday; dig the cool new hair:      Here's a shot she took of me and Kelly, also back on Wednesday:      Next, here's Stephanie at the Valhalla shindig:      And finally, another Valhalla shot:"
QCKJZB6,male,23,"I haven't posted since Sunday, so I thought I'd preemptively post before I was accused of slacking off. The first part of my qualifying exam is due soon, and it's not going well. Whether that's due to my underestimating its difficulty and time requirements, or whether I've missed out on some crucial part of my graduate education, I'm not sure yet. Anyway, I'm working hard to churn out something, but it's slow going.   So, there's been a lack of fun adventures lately. I'll be taking Saturday off in honor of my birthday; I decided to throw a party here, so I'll post about that, time permitting. Beyond that, hope the scientific muse smiles upon me."
QCKJZB6,male,23,"Do you ever have those nights when you wish your brain just had an off switch, when you wish your thoughts would just stop for a while and give you some peace? I had one of those nights last night.   The best part is when you consciously try to remove those thoughts. I can usually concentrate on nothingness for a good thirty seconds or so before my brain gets bored and, like a small child at a grocery store, drags me by my wrist to whatever has caught its attention. Still, when you're half asleep and anxious to get the other half out of the way, it sounds like a really good idea.   It obviously didn't work, as I seem to be quite tired this morning.

Researchers have discovered that a 10-minute ogle at women's breasts is as healthy as a half-an-hour in the gym. A five-year study of 200 men found that those who enjoyed a longing look a busty beauties had lower blood pressure, less heart disease and slower pulse-rates compared to those who did not get their daily eyeful. Dr. Karen Weatherby, who carried out the German study, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine: ""Just 10 minutes of staring at the charms of a well endowed female is roughly equivalent to a 30-minute aerobics workout. Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation. There is no question that gazing at breasts makes men healthier. Our study indicates that engaging in this activity a few minutes daily cuts the risk of a stroke and heart attack in half. We believe that by doing so consistently, the average man can extend his life four to five years. She added that sexy stars like Dolly Parton, Heather Locklear and Demi Moore had proved to be especially good for the men's health. #############################################################  Happy bird watching.

Buddhism day was rather... interesting..? well, i'd say it was something worth going to. The video at the beginning actually had my attention for 2 hours... without me falling asleep... which is saying something. Well, the Romero video last year caught my attention too... but yah. Pretty good feats for educational videos.    Oh, Keanu Reeves starred in that Buddhism Video... lol, i swear, the Matrix had lotsa ideas that were similar to ""Little Buddha"" (that's the name of the video). For instance, there was an awakening (aka awake from Matrix). There was a search for the reincarnation of the Buddha (aka ""the One""). Instead of stopping bullets, Keanu Reeves stopped a bunch of flaming arrows.   His acting style is about the same too... the nearly emotionless, short-sentenced person. The only thing that was missing was some nice martial arts =P   Speaking of which, martial arts was my first workshop, out of 3. It was ok... none which can be used in real life, and the person that's  supposed  to be doing the workshop was absent. Next, it was Buddhism symbols... since it was ""mandatory"", i didn't have much hope for it, but it was actually quite interesting. Lastly, there was food... not really interesting... but... food! i mean, c'mon... free food.    After school, i went down to anime, but then, karen was like stressing over newspaper, and she was working on something that was supposed to be my workpile  anyway  (she took charge of it after it became clear we needed a better article). So i decided to do my share of the work, and spent around 2 arounds working on it.   Managed to get it done too... hopefully, newspaper would be ready for tomoro. Mike Sitayeb was saying how it was ok .. but karen was like ""noooo... not good enough... change stuff""... so i stayed an extra hour till i got her i-give-a-damn-anymore approval ^^ *sigh* i'm easily satisifed... i'm not suited to become a layout artist. Anyhow, i really feel sorry for karen, who had to stay behind for god-knows-how-long to supervise the rest of the layouting. And for Mike, who i know also put in long hours for the paper.

Extracurriculars may be different. I'm sure doing better in units than last year. Etc.    Some people would kill for such normalcy... those in countries with natural or man-made disasters... or even close to home, when income isn't always a sure thing. However, once you've conquered all those big problems, what next? Help others. There's always suffering and stuff in the world... and help is most appreciated.

Sure... we live longer now... but do we do more with our lives? Sure... we have all these conveniences and materials... but at what environmental cost? How long can we eat up the earth's materials, before it finally breaks down like a too-oft ridden horse?   I'm not saying progress is a bad thing... it's just that there's always balance.. no matter how much you advance, something else would deteriorate in its place.

FJX5J38,male,17,"Welcome my friends, to my first blog.  What is a blog you ask? No? Ok good, because I'm not even sure if i know what one is myself.  Umm lets see. I'm eating pineapple. im wondering who, if anyone, is going to read this. I wonder how long this entry will be. I wonder how long the whole thing will be. I'm wondering if i wonder too much.  Alright, well in case you dont know, my name is Matt.  I live in the town of Gig Harbor, in Washington state. I've only been living there for a year now so I'm not really sure how to describe it.  There's something about the people there that I just don't like... But there's something about nearly all people I just don't like.  I like my old town better, in Port Townsend, probably because it's more familiar than my new one.  I'm in Port Townsend at the time that I'm writing this, because I'm visiting for the summer.  Too bad all my friends won't call me back or are never home or some stupid thing.  I never get to hang with any of them.  Occasionally I question my friendships. But what can I do, but sit at home and stare at a computer screen for hours and hours, trying to escape the boredom of it all. I must admit, it does beat school though.  I wonder where all of my ""friends"" are right now... what they are doing... wonder if they ever care to think about me.  Maybe a blog is just something to write down all of your thoughts to let everything out, in the hope that someone will read it and care.  I hope you don't mind me complaining a lot. I wonder if anyone I know will read this. I find the chances unlikely.  I wonder if I'm writing interestingly enough to keep the reader's attention. I think I stopped caring. This blog is declared for me to look back on and reflect upon. I'll call it a night. Good night readers. I hope the next one is more interesting"
FJX5J38,male,17,"well i just deleted a really long post accidentally. i dont feel like typing anymore after that. ill come back some other day, c ya fans."
FJX5J38,male,17,"this post is about my dad. not like a life story. just about how he can piss me off. actually that would be too long, ill just tell you what happened today. so we were ridin along in the car, after we watched the bourne supremacy, and it was pretty damn good, and he gets into the same old arguement: ""you dont do anything around the house!! bla bla bla bla!!!"" (yeah he actually says bla bla bla...jk) and hes like, ""im bustin my balls for you, are you bustin your balls for me?"" and im like ""no"". i answered in simple one-word sentences, because thats all i could do, as he wouldnt let me reply. like always. so eventually, hes like, bla bla bla, ive done all this stuff for you, i feed you, im sending you to norway (which was because i got good grades this last semester and that was the deal, but he still uses it against me), youre living under my roof, bla bla bla. and im just thinking all this time, ""you dumbass, why dont you just take it all away from me then if im not giving back?"" see, this is what i @#$ing HATE about my dad and my brother. they dont understand what it means to ""give"" something. it means to pass it on to another person, WITHOUT expecting anything in return or ESPECIALLY using it against them later!!! i dont take anything my dad gives me now, its gotten so bad.  anyways, my dads like dont you want a car? bla bla bla.... and im like no, not really, i dont need a car at the moment. and hes like, youll need a car, bla bla bla. and im like no i dont, i have a bike and a bus, and they can get me anywhere. so hes like, ""well, i want you to have a car, and youre gonna have to earn it, and whos gonna pay for gas? and whos gonna pay for insurance? me."" and im like no, if i want something that bad, i can get it. i told him i wanted to be completely independent of him. basically meaning that he has nothing on me. because he really thinks he does.  so anyways, today, since i was grounded from the computer for a while, this girl i know online called me to say hi and see if i was doin alright and all, so my dad picked the phone up and gave it to me, and we talked for a while, then my dads like, whos that? and im like this girl from elma. and hes like, does she drive? and im like, i dont know, it doesnt matter. and hes like, well if she can drive, then she can come up here and you can go on a date or something and im like uhh shes got a boyfriend. and hes like ""what the fu....""  and im like, ""what do you mean ""what the fuck""? can i be friends with girls?"" and hes like, ""someday youll know"". and that pissed me off kinda.  he basically thinks american women.. just suck. and they want money, and are bitchy, and all this other stuff. it seems to have been true with the girls hes been dating here, but i dont believe it.  he probably just thinks theyre good for fucking.  either way, he does not influence me very much, if any at all. id like to learn on my own. my brother and i have different tastes in relationships, and my dad kinda has the same thing going as my brother. you know, like, oh theres girls over here and girls over there, lets do them all in one night. and im like.. yeah.. im gonna pass on all that. i only wanted one person really. when .. i was a christian (i am not anymore, but dont get me wrong, i am no satan worshipper, i still have values too :). ) it mustve rubbed off on me, you know, all that pre-marital sex stuff. also, you know, the STDs, the baby risk, all that shit. id rather just avoid it all.  yeah... the christianity thing. i wasnt gonna really post it. all its caused me is a lot of grief and shame though, theres no evidence of it all... why believe something that just hurts me. i live life to the fullest, as no one knows whats on the other side truly. i hate getting in religious debates on all of this crap, because it cant be proven or disproven. its a faith thing. no reason to believe, but they still do anyways. ive lost it. people join christianity, i think, because all of the people there are accepting and happy, and they think its a cool place to be, pretty soon, youre singin the songs too, etc, and you grow stronger off of that, well, insufficient evidence that got you started in the first place. my dad needs to get on now (of course.). what do you know, more work. c ya"
FJX5J38,male,17,"last night.. i had some strange dreams.  i dont remember them vividly, but the more interesting one was really breif.  i was on a bus going to school, and there was the girl i was attracted to, a year younger than me, sitting in the seat across from me.  she said hi and i accidentally said, ""oh, hi alisha"" (her name wasnt alisha) then put my face over my hands and apologized. she said it was alright. thats about the end of that one. the only other dream i remember from last night was that i was in an electric wheel chair, zooming around a hospital, though i wasnt disabled. just really bored i guess.  i walked outside of the hospital and it was on top of a hill, towering over a green grassy land with blue skies.  oh yes, and the other dream.  i was in the front passenger seat of a really fast car and i was with like the national lampoons family but we were driving realllly fast down a freeway and the dad was passing people by going off the road. it was crazy.  so we decided that the mom should drive, and while she was driving safely, she asked me, ""dont you kids play crashing games at your age?"" and im like uhh no... then the dream ended.  that ends this post."
FJX5J38,male,17,"today my brother left for the airforce. he left me some stuff, including a mini fridge, a new room, a queen size bed, all of his cds (which is good because mine are lacking in quantity), a crapload of magazines (mad, fhm, stuff, maxim), most of his clothes, and a nice bottle of tarantula (alcoholic beverage with tequila) in his fridge, which he forgot that his friend gave him until today :). i hope this doesnt mean im evil or something, but i really dont think ill miss him.  hows everyone else doing though, whos reading this thing nowadays anyways?  go ahead, post a comment, you know how good it feels when you get a comment in yours. adios for now."
FJX5J38,male,17,"hey hey my friends, this blog cant be too long, so ill try and summarize it a bit. basically, my dad grounded me for being lazy and not cleaning anything, i started the harry potter 5th book, about half way through now (vegard left it for me (for those of you who dont know vegard... hes the norwegian guy im visiting in norway.) , and i rode my bike to the store and back twice today in nearly 90 degree weather and probably got some color on me. it mustve been 8 miles total but i got home and i felt great. i basically only did it to prove to my dad that i wasnt lazy, if i wanted something i could get it.  yeah so ive been feeling really good today, dont know if it was  the bike ride, or the pushups, or the book, or the tarantula :P or the freaking hotness outside or the ice cream i got. or all of it. but yeah i feel good. i hope to get back to this blog soon. maybe it was a good thing i left the computer. naaaa... what else was i gonna say. ok today i found out my great grandmother, ilene petersen, is norwegian, so that makes me 1/8 norwegian if i did the math correctly. anyways, theres no telling when, or if, ill be on the computer again, so i wish you a merry life. if i forgot anything, ill get back to you all."
FJX5J38,male,17,"this is a list of all of the things that remind me of her... i decided to type them up on here... vanilla coke lemon smints the slow songs they played at creation at night.. dont really rememer which ones. Canon in D One Last Breath the way she smells the way her hair smells the stars at night. the old field behind the school. warm summer nights.  well, i guess everything is over now. no, i am just saying that in the hopes that it will be over. its hard to accept, but i cant have her.  i am just another guy in love with her. crappy deal.  what can i do.  ill live as though none of it happened?... well i suppose i shouldve seen it all coming. ill end this one there..."
FJX5J38,male,17,"due to unpopular demand, i am writing this post for all of my viewers   hey everyone i am having the time of my life staring for hours into this computer screen. ill be on this for a long time today.  my other options are: walk to the store (2 miles away) and buy ice cream or other good food, play guitar or piano, orrr... look for food that we dont have, in the fridge and cupboards again.  any suggestions? feel free to comment."
FJX5J38,male,17,"yeah its a nerdy title. anyways, when i came back from norway, i was looking forward to getting on the computer to talk to all my online buddies, but the freaking keyboard was gone. so im like oh. shit. so the next morning, i woke up at the same time as my dad, and tried to fall asleep, but couldnt because i was hungry, and not tired at all (probably still recovering from norwegian time..). so i sat in bed, and i was going to get up and shower while my dad was still there, when i remembered a little plan i had made... when my dad was almost out the door, i used my keen sense of hearing to listen to him carry the keyboard past my room, and into the closet near the front door... after he left, i searched around, and looked on the shelf in the closet, and sure enough, it was there. there is justice in the world after all. so ill probably be on the computer forever now, since there is nothing much else to do except make more lattes. thats the story for the day... nothing else much new. when my dad took the keyboard, he said, ""its for your own good"" or something like that. and im thinking wtf. but now im thinking, ""my dad did a mediocre job of hiding the keyboard and i found it pretty easily and im happy now.""

KDGGEE4,male,17,"Nothing like a good day of ball to exhaust you and let you fully enjoy sitting on front of your comp!  My body is sore all over... I LOVE IT!!!  That feeling of, ""Yes, I did something constructive with my time.""  What's so constructive you ask?  Well, I got some well-needed excercise, I got to work on my game, I got to completely destroy on of my friends I rarely see, and I got to play wit my bro and share some laughs.  The last thing was key, as we hardly spend time together with him working nites and sleeping in the morning and me go to work in the afternoon.  I also got to see someone I went to elementary school wit.  He was the best ball player then, and he is still amazing.  Like I wouldn't dare to play him 1on1.  He's getting some interest from some US universities, but he's going back to high school next year to  work on his game and marks.  I'm so happy for him, he's didn't fall into the many traps that high school has to offer...  I can also say that I have finally ""Let it burn"", tho I still wish you the best...  Matt, you said the next move is mine, so here it is... While you were still at that camp, I already forgave you.  I know it was unfair for you to get the most of my anger, but that's just how it happened.  Though I did get to see some of your truer colours.  I don't hate you, I just don't feel that urge I had before to speak to you over msn or see you outside of church.  When I see you next, I will smile and act like everything is normal, but I'm unsure whether it will be 100% sincere.  Ultimately, it was simply outside circumstances, hot tempers, and my pride that ended it.  I still read ur blog if ur wondering, and I still care.  I still think of you as a friend, tho not as highly as I once did.  Maybe one day things can be the way they were, or maybe that day will outlive us both...  On a brighter note, I can't wait for university for many reasons.  Alota ppl I know are going there, but more importantly, alot I don't.  I just really need to get that tuition paid off...  ARGH... my back hurts... ^_^ ... haha, I'ma sleep well tonite."
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Man this weekend sucked...  Thursday when i was supposed to play ball wit those ppl, half of them never showed -_- ... like come on, its not hard to come to ball, and if something came up u should at least have the decency to call or AT LEAST explain over msn... but no, i was let down.  Later on thursday i went to work :(.  The big boss didnt close - that was a plus.  But both of the ppl in my department suddenly felt sick at the same time and left... leaving me alone to face the whole store by myself.  For those of u who dont work in groceries, facing (also referred to flatenning) means that i walk through every aisle and fix all the products so that the aisle looks like a solid wall.  After that u gotta fix the front and back displays.  With a friend and at a leisurely pace, it takes about 40 mins during on a weeknight.  I did most of it in 45, then had to face the diary department.  Man, 1 hr of absolute boredom... not cool  Yesterday, I woke up early (as usual) and turned on the comp.  I never realised how fast time flies when ur playing sc (comp game)... During one of the games, i checked the time, it said 11ish in the morn.  So i played a game or 2 more, and i check the time after what seemed like a second later and it was 2!!!  I knew that i was supposed to get ready and stuff at about 5 to go to my grandma's, but i decided that instead of taking my shower i was gonna play some FFX (my 2nd fav game ever!!!).  After about half an hour of leading Tidus through the Isle of Besaid, i feel asleep :S.  When i woke up my mom was yelling at me to make sure i was ready to leave... this was at 5:30.  So i ran in the shower, did my stuff, got dressed, grabbed the essentials (wallet, cell, MD, gum, forgot my keys >. Anyways, we finally got there at about 9.  Upon arrival, i went inside and started talking to my grandma who i hadnt seen in a year or so.  She was all proud of me going to UofT next year, and she started talking to me about life in the Phillipines (shes going there soon).  From what i remember, she supports a single parent family who lives on a hill, whom she will be visiting in the summer.  Unfortunatley, she can only bring 72 lbs of stuff and shes afraid she may be over the limit.  For each pound of stuff over u have to pay $20+!!!  Then she asked us if we ate dinner yet, we said no.  So she sent my oldest bro to get my mom to tell her that shes taking us to fish&chips ^.^  My grandparents are regulars there so my grandma called them to make sure that there still open.  While they were doing this, my eyes fell upon a white book wit those familiar words ""Holy Bible"" on it.  When i saw this i remembered that i lost my last one, so i asked if she had any extras.  She said that she got that white one for free at a garage sale and that i could have it -.-  After waiting in the basement and looking at my uncles living room for a while, we finally made our way to the fish&chip spot.  When i walked in, the first thing my eyes so was a kinda cute chinese girl.  My first thought was, ""huh? fish & chips by asians?"" and my second thought was, ""that girls kinda cute...""  After a few hellos, my grandma introduced me (with pride) as the grandson whos going to UofT next year.  Then she told me that that cute asian girl was going to gr. 9 next year!!! >. Anyways, the food was good and then we went to our separate homes, and i forgot the Bible in the van :( i think its still there... at least i hope... :o  Today... boring again.  Woke up at 8 to hear my alarm play my fav BoyzIIMen cd, went to sleep for another 30 mins b4 jumping in the shower.  Did my thing, got out of the bathroom, saw it I had 2 mins to get to work, gave up on being on time, took my sweet time getting dressed, dreading another 7.5 hrs of work to come.  I left home, and got to work 15 mins late, (its only a 3 min work to work :D!!).  When i got there i saw that it was gonna be a little more fun than usual as one of the managers was on vacation and his spot was taken up by one of the younger cooler ppl.  I'll avoid boring u ppl (as if this blog isnt boring enough :P ) so I'll just say that i barely survived work without going crazy and hurting myself.  When i got home, i turned on the comp, got changed, and found out that my parents were making a return trip to granny's today.  I told them that i was too tired to go (what?! its the truth!!) so my mom had to leave me and my bro some of the lasagna that she made ^.^ When they left, i ate it, played some sc, and decide to write in my blog... and here I am...  Sadly, i will not be at church tmr as my parents stop driving me there when sunday school ends... so i wont be at church sunday morn for a long time, prolly 2 months when sunday school starts again.  I also hope to attend some weds nites at church, even tho the usual is not going down, its about time i helped out some1 other than myself!! I also gotta give Matt my FF7 & 8, great games they are (FF7 being by #1 of ALL TIME!!!!)  Anyways, i ran outta stuff to write... ........................................... Well as u can see my life is QUITE BORING!!! so if ur bored or u just wanna chill wit the ""Skyrida"" then call me up :D later -.-  Edit: I forgot!!!

KDGGEE4,male,17,"Wow, yesterday was awesome.  Here's what ya missed the last 2 days:   Tuesday: Work... no need for detail.   Wednesday: What a busy day!!!  Woke up at 7:50ish, got on the comp, msn/email.  Then after reading another heart-warming email, wc3!  Wow, I got owned 3 games in a row... lol, in total I got 1 win and 4 losses.  After getting fooded, I ate some leftovers and ran some ball at 11:30.  There was supposed to be a huge game going, but it turned out to be a practice session for me.  That's cool, I need to work my ankle back in anyways.  Wow, it was so hot yesterday, and I was playing ball in the dead heat of the afternoon under the sweltering sun wit the smog alert in effect.  It woulda been ok but some lil kids from some camp or something took my fountain captive!! >.  After a short convo wit a friend, I jumped in the shower.  I had one of my old burned mixed cds playing.  Nothing I could sing along to, but some classic jams.  Shine - Hot Boys??!! Exactly... Anyways after shaving and stuff I got out at 2:20ish.  Got dressed, Luckily I already decided what I was gonna wear so I was good.  A lil last second colonge and I was good to go.  As I left, I told my mom I was going out, and she was on the comp wit her back to me.  She said ok and never turned around.  Turns out she thought I was going to work... o well.   Wow, thats a long bus ride.  It got longer at the Dragon Centre on Sheppard between from between Brimely and Midland to Birchmount.  The bus was nice and empty till about 30 lil azn kids got on the bus.  Some day camp I assume, they had some counsellors and stuff.  I think one of the girls were checking me out... ò.ô.  Those kids were everywhere!  I was in the corner of the bus as usual, and I had put my bag on the floor to help out one more kid.  Well the kid who was beside me kept on touching me and pointing at stuff outside the window while putting his arm across my face.  I was quite relieved when they got off.   I arrived at Fairview at 3:55.  As soon as I got to ground level, I pulled out the cellie to call Matt... no response.  Ok, they're in the arcade.  Walked across the mall to reach the arcade... no1s there.  Ok, they're waiting for me at the theatre.  Climb the escalator to the theatre... no1.  I was getting really worried at this point.  I'm sure they wouldnt have ditched me without giving me a phone call right??  Well 3 calls later Matt FINALLY picked up his phone.  Will went to the arcade so I went to intercept him.  When I found him we all met at the theatre and got our tix to ""I, Robot"".  Wooooo... that movie was toooo good too!!!!  I esp enjoyed the shower scene wit Will Smith... mmmmm...  Go and see it!! Tho prolly not at the theatre in Fairview... it was kinda ghetto.  lol, I didnt even know the place existed till this week.  O well, I got to sit between Ada and Will, I offered to switch spots wit Will cuz I knew he'd be happier beside Ada... but he refused.  No matter, the movie was good so it didnt matter where u sat, unless u were at the front, but it wasnt that packed.  Like c'mon, there are better theatres (no offense to those who love it).   After the great movie and some chuckles of me playing Will in ball, we we to the Sony Store to look for a ""stylus"" I think its called for Ada.  Radio Shack? No.  Sony Store? No, but Ada did get the guy's number ;).  lol, hes a lil bit older but I guess thats how she likes it... haha... uh, lets get off that.  Well after that Will went to check something out and I went to the arcade to run some MvC2 as Matt and Ada went to get some food.  I almost wish I went wit them, cuz I got struggled!!!  I'm talking like 6 losses in a row!  One of them lasted like 30 secs.  Juggernaut... the guy did that gay thing where as soon as u jump he throws out the super and u cant block!!  Then when my 1st char died I called out my assist and somehow they both died... not that he wasnt skilled... well... nvm.  After getting shamed I met up wit the 3 in the food court.  They were already done and were waiting for Jaime to give Ada her letters for her missions trip.  Ooops, sorry, I didnt write one >.  Sometimes I love to be difficult.  Well I excercised this wit Ada as she and Matt were criticizing my shopping habits.  A- ""Shopping like that is natural... for a girl""  W- ""Oh... so ur calling me feminine.  Your calling me a girl, well--""  ""No! that's not what Im saying.  I'm just saying that socially, stereotypically, it is natural for a girl to do that""  ""Wow!  So I'm not only feminine but I'm weird too huh? thx Ada...""  haha... then we started yelling (well I did) and creating a scene as she stormed off in frustration.  She went to Coles as Matt and I reached EB.  Nothing good.  Then I went to the nearby Foot Locker.  Yes... 3x black golf tees.  But it was wrinkled, so I didnt buy it.  Returned to Coles, Ada and Will were still going wild, so Matt and I chilled on the bench.  They came back out and we sat around for a bit.  Will went to check out the Bell Mobility, so we waited on the bench.  Apparently Matt and Ada were surprised that I wasnt shopping, so I got up and started to leave them.  Ada ran after me followed by Matt and Will who happened to have just been catching up with us.  I joked around wit her some more as we continued walking.  Slowly Matt and I switched spots as I got the chance to catch up wit Will a lil more.  Ada saw an old friend, they talked as Will and I talked during Matt's numerous laps around the block.  Then some mysterious things happened and Will and I were talking again.   I must say Will, I didnt know what to expect cuz it was the first time chillin wit u but ur far cooler than I gave u credit for.  I see why Matt and Ada chose u as friends, and Im honoured that I had the chance to talk with you 2.  So... now u heard it from my mouth... well it seems we got a problem, well I know u know it but I dont think that you know that I know it too.  Well since I found out ur such a good guy I'd rather talk to you about it than hide from it.  Next time we see each other wherever... we'll talk a lil more seriously.   Tensions mounted as I got a nice tour of the outside of Fairview.  I swear I've been there like 5 times in my life >. ""Warren... WARREN!!!""   Thx Will... if it wasnt for you I wouldnt have gotten to accomplish what I set out to do that nite... say goodbye.  You honestly dont know how much ur efforts made my day.  You are a true friend to every1...   Haha, I was escorted to the bus depot and didnt escort my escort back to the subway.  And you thought I was a nice guy??!!   M- ""Hey Warren tell me when ur bus gets here.""  W- ""Uh... thats it.""  M- ""Oh, ok""  **""gangsta"" hug**  M- ""See ya later man""  W- ""Ya for sure!  I'll definetly see ya soon!""  M- ""Uh... Im leaving for my cottage this weekend...""  W- ""Oh, guess I wont be seeing you soon then >. **exchange of ""later""s**   Then a convo that seemed to fly by while I waited for the bus.  Bus arrived... heart-warming hug that kept me on Cloud 9 the whole way back... I'll miss you more.   I got home at 10:30 and I was exhausted.  I woulda written this last nite... but them damn rentz again!!  O well, thank you Matt, Will and Ada for my most memorable nite this summer.  Matt enjoy urself at ur cottage!  Ada have fun in Arizona on ur trip!  Will... uh... ya... see ya later...?  lol, I'll be praying for all of you and we gotta do this again sometime (well hopefully minus the drama)   Here's the lyrics to a song that reminds me of someone.    Carl Thomas ft. LL Cool J - She Is (remix)     (V1)  Like my favorite scene in the best movie,  like the air that I breath that's what she is to me.  Like a song I just wrote or like coming home,  when I've been gone too long that's what she does to me.   (Oh) I wanna always to have this feeling,  (Oh) Ohhh your love is so amazing  (Oh) tell me tell me tell me baby    (tell me that you'll never go)   (Hook)  She's the light the sun would bring,  everything that means anything to me(that's what she is)  And she's so heavenly,  she's how the world looks to some1 whos never seen it(that's what she is)   (V2)  Like a lover's hug when you first fall in love  Girl it means so much when your out of touch  It's like seeing you for a moment or two  Girl the thought of you is what gets me through   (Oh) I wanna always to have this feeling,    (Oh) Ohhh your love is so amazing    (Oh) tell me tell me tell me girl  (tell me that you'll never go)         (Hook)    She's the light the sun would bring,    everything that means anything to me(that's what she is)    And she's so heavenly,    she's how the world looks to some1 whos never seen it(that's what she is)     (Bridge)  I don't think that words can discribe exactly how you make me  feel inside,  never in my life have I been so in love   LL  Slid up in the AMG, satalite radio you next to me  legs like nestle, they constantly test me  I'm clear that the rest be tring to out finese me  our love is real, I can tell how it feel  say what you want but keep you're lips sealed  you could run your'e mouth talk extra slick and  strip in front of the plasma yes it's sick'nin  uh, belly dance for your man  make eye contact make a player react  in fact crawl on the bed while ya mans laid back  run you're pedicure across my six pack  hold my dice baby roll for ice  you free to move around I won't control your'e life  I'll just keep you heated treat you how you wanna be treated  you got an appetite for love i'll feed it   (Hook)    She's the light the sun would bring,    everything that means anything to me(that's what she is)    And she's so heavenly,    she's how the world looks to some1 whos never seen it(that's what she is)    lol, I dunno why I say ""someone"" insteada who it is.  Like who am I kidding, the only ppl who read this know who it is.  Yes, we gotta talk...   See ya later,  Warren   [14] [11]"
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Today was interesting... here's what ya missed:     I woke up at 7:20!!!  I'm not sure why either, I guess it's cuz I went to sleep kinda early the night before.  Or maybe my slightly sprained ankle had something to do with it.  Anyways, 7:30ish, I was at my comp...  I opened an email from a special somebody but didnt reply to it yet... I wanted to save it for later when I was fully awake and was missing her even more.  O ya... 2:30 am send time...?  Very disappointed...jks     Hmm... Matt came online and we talked about tmr... I'm really looking forward to our date!!! I mean... uh... :$... hahaha, jks.  11... EB... I'll be there ;) (I hope I dont forget those games!)  Hmm... some1 else came online and we spoke for a lil bit... then they both left me alone on msn.  That's when I replied to that email, when I missed her the most knowing that I coulda spent an afternoon wit her >.    This friend is my 23 yr old friend from work.  Hes really cool, very down-to-earth and open-minded.  He's also the one who was seeking guidance in his choice of UTSC or work.  Well we decided to go to... arghh... forgot the name.  But it was (something, something) of the Nazerene I think.  Well the ""Nazerene"" part or some other form of that word was in it and it kinda worried me.  I had no idea what to expect.  My friend said that the name of the head of the church was Pastor something, so that comforted me cuz it reminded me of Forward.  When we arrived... the church building itself was very nice.  It has very white walls, stained glass windows on the side and a large cross on the front.  The parking lot was VERY large and had been freshly painted.  My fears of looking outta place were also subsided as I watched a brown family and some azns walk in.  As we walked through the main glass doors, I noticed that the church from inside the foyer was very small... well not that small... cozy.  As we walked into the auditorium (I guess its called) I noticed that the layout was similar to ours.  They had a very large projector screen on the back, a drum set, an organ or piano, a podium, and some mics and music stands for the singers.  As I sat down I noticed that they had nice cloth seats.  Sorry to say but they are alot more comfortable than the wooden ones at FBC.  When the service started, there were only about 3o ppl there.  It was very empty but at the same time it gave me the feeling that I was part of a close family rather than a congregation.  The pastor there was very upbeat, he always had a smile on his face which.  My friend described it like he looked like he won the lottery the whole time.  Well God's glory, salvation, grace, etc. is worth SOO much more than that so I'm sure thats the high he was on.  The pastor also had soothing voice... like something u'd hear on the radio or one of those relaxation tapes that you listen to while u sleep.  He also had a very full, booming singing voice to go with it.  Unfortunately this voice started to annoy pretty soon, at the end of the song he would repeat the last verse or the chorus EXTRA slow... like he wanted to show off or something (not that that was what he was doing... he wanted us to ""reflect"" on the song and what we're singing)... and I always felt like he was screaming into the mic.     LOL... funny thing... after a few hymns and a prayer... a lady went up to the front and asked for all visitor to stand up and introduce themselves.  So one lady who was already a member introduced a family whose father was a pastor from Guyana... and he told everyone that when all else fails to put all ur faith in God.  Then some1 else introduced their nephew and some1 else who I believe was going to church for the first time.  I was hesitant to stand up before but how could I follow those 2??  Well they asked one more time for visitors before finally saying, ""Well for all those SHY people **stares at my friend and I** welcome to (name of church) and I hope (something, something)"" hahaha, like she literally stared RIGHT AT US!! Well more at my friend but we're a group so its still us.  Anyways, after that some1 preached a message about parents leading your children to Christ.  Even tho it wasnt meant directly towards me, I still got some encouragement.  But it was the fact of being in God's house which get my feelings up.  Not that I was feeling particularily depressed, just that God brightens my day like nothing else!!!     At the end of the service... I witnessed as a few ppl accepted Jesus for the first time.  That makes me feel so warm inside, that some1 else has just received the same hopes and joy as I do.  Then we sang another hymn and the Pastor invited all the visitors to proceed to the back after the service and get our pics taken.  Well most of u know how much I hate pics of myself, and I had no idea why they wanted one.  My friend wanted to go but after he spoke to the guest family from Guyana, in particular the Pastor/father.  He asked him the differences between catholicism, baptism, and ""Nazerenism"" (haha, prolly not real word).  He didnt really gimme a satisfactory answer, he said that his faith his a ""holiness"" faith and is based very much on confessions and something like that.  I already can see the dif b/w catholics and baptists/Nazerenes but I couldnt decipher the difference between them and us.  O well, Christianity is all the same ^.^     Today was a very good day...     Tmr is gonna be great too... ya Matt!!!    See ya later  Missin ya alrdy   Warren     [18]"
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Saturday morning... and i was up at 8!!! U havent missed much since my last post, but whatever did happen is a blur to me cuz of something else that is constantly on my mind.  Heres what i can piece together:  Thursday: I went to work at 3,  worked till 5 until my manager left, took a 45 min break on front of a camera >.  Friday:  Woke up at 7....??!!  Ya, something was on my mind.  I responded to an email, talked to some friends... read stuff... ate some small leftover salad for lunch... still had cravings... had some chocolate fudge ice cream (mmmmmmm.....).  Then i got really bored and went upstairs to catch up on lost sleep.  I couldnt sleep so i listened to my B2M cd as i sang along... still couldnt sleep so i started my Usher cd.  I think i dozed off a few times then.  Hmmm... i think i went downstairs for a sec, then returned to my bed and listened to my MD as i felt asleep.  Something woke me up.  I tried to dl some songs, failed... jumped in the shower, sang some songs (wit some1 on my mind)while i was there. Then i got dressed for work, left home, and got there late again.  My dept manager was closing that day so no messing up!!  It was a struggle cuz there was nothing important to do, combine that with trying to impress ur boss and u've got a struggle.  Did everything by the books, 15 (prolly 20) min break... no food T.T .  I did all my work so i picked up the slack for some1 else.  Then we faced the store (gave me time to think...) and i went home.  When i got home i was soooooo hungry.  Luckily my parents left me food.  U shoulda seen it, i practically inhaled that food.  It was dry so i ate it with my hands... faster than a fork :P .  I started an email then stopped when i talked to some1.  Wanted to explode... and went to sleep.  This morning:  I woke up at 8.  I have a dentist appt at 12, getting a filling (maybe).  Guess i dont take good enough care of my teeth... nothing to do after... if u see this in time then feel free to call me after 2 i guess... i'll prolly be really bored and doing nothing.  Or ball... good ol' ball...  AHH!!! I forgot the countdown... T.T ... im such a bad friend... here it is again:  [26]....... :D  This has been my shortest post in awhile.  The last one i wrote was based on a morning, this one i had 2 days of quality material to use... but i cant think.  Don't worry about me... I should be able to resolve (if thats the right word) it in the next few days.  Hmm... I hate the dentist... lol, i was considering becoming one too!!! They dont get long, awkward hours, and they get great teeth!!  Wow... i cant elaborate on anything... i think i'll just go now... do something... maybe get some more sleep...  See y'all later :D"
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Today... was actually a good day!!!  I mean, despite the drama thats been going on the last little bit... today was good.  Earlier i posted when i woke up.  As i said then, i had to go to the dentist to get a filling.  I really hate going there, but today it wasnt so bad.  Through my mom, word got around that i was attending UofT Scarborough in the fall.  Well my dentist attended UofT as well, and he had some tips for me (nothing im gonna talk about, i need the edge :P)  After that pep talk, he left me to attend to other ppl.  I had been tired all morning, and the ""Business Weekly"" that was on the TV wasnt helping me.  I was just about to doze off when he returned and gave me the filling between questions and comments about university.  The whole thing took 5 mins, but i was the 30 min wait before that killed it.  Finally, my mother (who also got a filling) and I left the building and stood outside for our ride.  10 mins later we were on our way to our new house.  There, my brother and my mom went for a look inside while my stepfather and I stayed in the van.  It was quite silent in the van, not that any of us minded tho, he was reading something and i was listening to music.  15 mins later we got home.  After eating some leftovers, my parents and my older bro left my younger bro and I at home.  After starting up my msn and media player, i started messing around wit my blog template.  I didnt get too far, i widened the body part, thats about it.  Then i decided that i needed to clear my mind of what had been bothering for a while, so i went outside to run some ball.  Upon arrival, i noticed that there was not a single person at the courts or the adjacent park.  Nice... some silence is always welcome.  There i worked on my game a bit... mostly pull-ups and left-handed layups.  My jumper is coming along little by little.  I discovered some things that i didnt notice before.  Well before i get into that... heres the ideal pull-up:  Perform a cross over move of some sort, throwing ur defender off balance.  Shortly after making ur move stop on the spot, but as u do this, make sure that ur feet are lined up to the net, right foot (if ur right handed) slighltly on front of ur left, shoulder with apart.  Take a moment to collect urself and align ur shoulders to the net, then elevate straight up.  As u go up, bring the ball in ur right hand on front of ur face, slighlty to ur right, locking in ur right elbow to ur side while using ur left hand to support the ball.  On ur way up or at the peak of ur jump, release the ball, not pushing it, but stroke the ball towards the net in.  Ensure that ur shot has sufficient ark and rotation, improving ur chances of getting it in or getting a ""shooter's"" bounce.  To help make sure that u followed through cleanly, as u land ur hand should be above ur head, slightly tilted forward.  Now the only thing left to do is to listen to the swish of the net and the ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" of the spectators.  That being said, i noticed some things about my shot.  Firstly, i was holding the ball too far to the right.  My elbow was somewhat locked in, but it was angled out to far.  This caused my shot not to look straight, tho it usually went in.  Not a big problem... but could result in inconsistency if i didnt hold the ball far enough to the right.  That was easy to fix. Secondly, i didnt always align my feet.  After u do a cross over, its not uncommon for ur feet to be pointing away from the net.  Well when i crossed to my left, my feet would point left.  This resulted in many bricks and air balls... not cool. Finally, i was not releasing at the peak of my jump.  When i started my ball career, i was a set shooter.  This meant that i would release the ball as i jumped, giving me more power but making it easier to block me.  I gradually developed my jumper, and have been happier ever since.  Well as i did my jumpers, i noticed that i was releasing the ball on my way up.  But i wouldnt release it at the same time every time, making my shots inconsistent.  So i started releasing the ball at the very peak, and they went in more often.  But more importantly, i didnt have to think about how much power to put, it just seemed to flow.  Well as i practiced, 3 girls started shooting on the other net.  I didnt get a good luck at them (mostly cuz my i didnt have my glasses), but they seemed really young, prolly 12-13.  So i continued to shoot around, not paying them any attention.  After an hour or so, i ran to the fountain.  I have mentioned this fountain before, but that fountain is soooo great!!! (excuse my lack of vocab)  Like, after u work up a sweat from playing all day in under the sweltering sun, nothing feels better than cooling off in the fountain.  I think i go to the courts for the ball, but stay for the fountain.  Anyways, if u ever come to visit me, the first thing i'd take u to see is the fountain.  Then i'd make u run through it with me... like lil kids.  Good thing i bring a ball to the court, otherwise those parents would look at me funny...  Well, after awhile, one of my friends from school, his bro and his cuz came and started shooting around on dif nets.  Moments later, another guy i played wit b4 came to run some ball.  We ran 2v2, me and my the 2nd guy vs my friend from school and his bro.  I started the game off weak, lost the ball, missed a few hook shots, threw some bad passes.  Before i knew it we were down 6-4.  So i stepped it up, my friend from school whos smaller than me was guarding me, so i just posted him of, drop stepped to my left and made the smooth baby hook.  After my teammate made a few baskets, i made another hook and we had game point.  At the top, they checked the ball to my teammate, he passed me the ball and i faced my man up.  As i looked around, my teammate set me a screen to my right, so i ran around it.  The guy who was defending my teammate didnt step out, so i had the open shot.  Then i set my feet, aligned my shoulders, elevated and released the shot at the peak in one smooth motion.  As soon as i shot it, i knew it was cash... so i watched as the ball floated into the net (not touching the rim), bounce off the net and roll slowly to our feet.  Another victory for Warren... tho i wasnt all that proud.  My friend from school had bad coordination, and wasnt nearly as skilled or experienced as i was (no offense).   His bro was alrite, i'd say just as good as my teammate, maybe a little better.  After running throught the fountain twice and going home to get some water, i came back to another game.  3 ppl had come, one very tall one and 2 brothers.  We started a 4v4, and i was assigned the tall guy -_-.  He was about 6'4, 200 lbs, and muscular build... kinda intimidating.  He was the most talented of the 3 ppl who came, he was slightly quicker than me, but the height advantage was the real killer.  Luckily, he was also not too quick, something i took advantage of.  Time for Warren's shooting zone...  Well, finally the game started.  I started off slow again, i missed a few layups... theres no excuse for it but that tall guy kept on intimidating me, making me afraid of getting blocked.  Then the other team was up about 8-6, and i decided to step it up.  I started running around more, giving up on playing big and concentrating on getting open.  My man underestimated my shot, so i set up on the outside waiting for the pass.  When the ball touched my hands, my mind went completely blank, it was just me and the rim, nobody else was there, no pressure.  So i took it like i did during my shoot around, releasing the ball at the peak.  I took joy when it released my hand, it felt right as soon it took flight, i knew it was money.  The next play, i set a backdoor screen for one of my teammates.  The oppenent didnt see it coming, and he got completely stopped in is tracks.  As my teammate ran around to the other side of the court, his man tried to catch up.  Then i turned towards the top and found the ball at my hands.  There was a miscommunication and no1 picked me up.  ""Just me and the rim"" i thought again... swish.  10-10 .  As they checked the ball, i stood under the rim, comtemplating which side to run to.  When my teammate got the ball up top, another one ran towards me, so i ran around him, attempting to mix up our defenders.  At this time my team noticed i was hot, so they got me the ball.  I stood slightly to the right of the top of the imaginary arc, dribbling the ball casually while keeping my head up as to not miss any easy passes into layups.  Screen left, i ran around, my man got caught behind.  As i ran just inside the elbow, i stopped on a dime, set my feet, and hit a clutch pull-up-almost-fadeaway jumper... nothing but air (we dont have meshes >.  After a 30 min break, having 2 ppl join us, and after me and the guy who guarded me were assigned captains and chose teams, the rematch was ready.  But this time i started on fire.  After running from one baseline to the opposite one, i was open for a shot.  No hesitation... another point.  2 or 3 big open jumpers and my team was up.  My 1st draft pick was also playing well, he had an usual fake which seemed to keep on working.  A few points later my team won another close game.  3 vics.  The person who sat out the last game took off IMO the worst player on the other team.  He wanted to play wit my #1 pick so he and my worst player switced.  As soon as the game started i could feel the rhythm my team had going the last game disappearing.  I was the hot shooter, but that didnt stop the new guy from jacking up some ugly bricks... one went in tho, off glass... fluke.  I continued running around trying to get open as i did in the last 2 games.  Finally i did got an open shot.  I missed it, but that wasnt what bothered me.  As i landed, i noticed that i ever so slightly pulled my left calf.  It didnt bother me too much, but the next shot i took and missed magnified it 2x.  My man, who is a tough cookie to stop, decided to drive and lay it up over me.  I did what i could: stayed with him as best i could and jumped as i put my hand in his face.  As i landed, my left calf hurt worse.  This came down to the wire.  10-10 again... win by 2.  We had exchanged a point or so when my teammate gave us the lead with a runner in the lane.  My man was getting fustrated and he switched with his friend.  THANK YOU!!! Some1 small!!!  As soon as the ball was checked i set up in the post.  The ball handler made a good feed to me and i started to back my defender down.  As i gained a few inches, he started to push harder on my back.  All going to plan.  I made one last push to the rim, and my man pushed back.  As soon as i felt this, i dropped my left foot behind his feet.  Then i spun off him, using his own pressure on my back to throw him off balance.  I was off balance too, but it was a shot i was used to.  Elevation... then i smooth one handed follow through... and the game was ours!!!  But as i went up i felt a slight twitch in my right calf.  As i came down that tickle turned into excruciating pain... tho it wasnt as bad as SnoCamp.  My team started to celebrate while i leaned against the fence in pain.  Finally some1 asked what happened, and i told them between grunts of pain that i pulled my calf.  Sadly my friends who had just arrived had next game, but i couldnt play against them.  O well, i was happy 4.5 hrs of ball, 4 wins, but most importantly... i got my mind off what was bothering me all day.  Not that i dont care about it, but during a ball game, u havta concentrate if u wanna win.  U have to always keep ur head up, looking out for open cuts, screens on teammates or set by them, defensive miss-matches, open shots... everything.  But i felt at peace the most when i got the ball for an open shot.  Nothing matters, just me and the rim... one fluid motion... clean follow through.  That time, when u are at  that complete peace, cannot be replaced.  U are not concentrating on anything but the game during the game... unless u wanna lose.  Everyone has to be on top of the game, even the slightest slip could cause the game.  Anyways, i accomplished what i wanted... i was happy.  After painfully limping my way home, i got on the comp.  I opened my blog and then my template.  I wanted to customized it, to make it seem more personal, something that better reflected me... i changed a few things in the end: my font, how wide it was, the ""posted by"" comment, and that pic up top ^.^... all i need to do is find a good background colour, a good font colour to go wit the background, a border around the body, and possibly some links to my friends sight.  But now that i've said everything that comes to mind, I cant help but think about that problem.  In my eyes it shouldnt be a problem, but ppl are... well... human.  I need not say more...  Hopefully my upbeat mood will last through the night... *sigh* who am i kidding..."
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Hmmm... havent missed much in my life, but here goes nothing:  Friday: Woke up, sc/msn, played some more ShenmueII... till before work.  LOL, i was late for work cuz i was gambling in the game... somethings will never change i guess. But i did find a certain win gambling booth, so i guess its not gambling if u cant lose... :S Anyways, went to work late, my department manager closed -_-, and it was just me him and some old guy i dont talk to working, man was it boring!! Ate chef boyardee beef ravoli for dinner, felt sick 15 mins later, worked it off by the end of the shift.  Got home, more of the same stuff, slept for work...  Saturday: Woke up at 8:40 to get rdy for work at 9!! >. I got home, did some sc/msn/ShenmueII and went to sleep.  Today:  ALL DAY... sc/msn/ShenmueII... Well i watched ""Not Another Teen Movie"", kinda funny, but that was it.  I was too lazy to go to ball, too lazy to go wit my parents to my grandmas, but i have no regrets.  Oddest thing happened tho, outta nowhere some guy added me to his msn.  I accepted, asked who it was, and asked if it was a joke.  Turns out the guy who added me was really looking for his friend, and they both live in Australia.  Usually i delete and block right away, but i talked to him.  Here's what i know: he's 17, dropped outta school to work at MickeyDs to help mom wit bills, was on vacation wit his gf and his mom.  He and his gf were both there, sometimes switching who i was talking to, they're both really in love, and are getting married in 4 years (they invited me to their wedding ^.^).  The guy wants to own a recording company and the girl wants to go into interior design.  then i added the guy's gf and they had to go... I also found out that a friend of mine has a crush on a former crush of mine.  We had a very enjoyable convo about alota things and he went out... That was pretty much my nite...  Well Martha leaves tmr, im very sad... tho i wish her the best.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you... :D Have Fun!!!"
KDGGEE4,male,17,"Last nite i said, ""I am now officially one step closer to happiness. Hmm... could it really come true???""  I now know that answer.  In case you cannot figure it out from the mood of this post... its... i dont even wanna say it.  I've lost the will to do what i used to.  I dont wanna write in this anymore, i dont wanna be on msn anymore, i dont even think playing ball can give me that momentary peace anymore.  I dont know whats gonna happen... to tell the truth i feel as tho it doesnt matter anymore.  I work today at 3... whats the point?  To make money... money cannot buy me happiness.  To keep busy... nothing will keep me busy enough to clear my mind.  I also dont know if ima be at the youth nite which mite not even happen.  I know i promised ppl that i would go, and i hate breaking promises.  But this may be one of those times that i do... I just... cant bear to face...  I was right.  I am a ghost.  I blend into backgrounds, going unnoticed.  I am meaningless.  I have no purpose.  I am a drifter, moving from place to place, school to school, existing solely for the purpose of being alive.  I have nothing to fight for.  Nothing to inspire me.  No goals... just going for the ride that i started.  Maybe one day i will fall out of this depression.  Maybe someone will lift me out of the lake of sorrow that i am drowning in.  But right now there is a storm overhead... and no one can lift me out.  So i will stay here... dragging myself through life only to make others who care happy.  Forever... is a very abused word.  Is anything forever?  I'm usually not one to say what i dont mean, and i've used it many times... but im doubting it myself.  Well... i was also speaking my mind.  It feels like forever is whats gonna happen.  But maybe im forcing forever.  For what?  Im not sure... to prove myself?... to avoid it happening again?  Or am i just a liar; someone who uses words when it suits them, not caring about the true meaning of what i say?  I dont know...  If you are one of the few who are still proud to call me a friend, dont try to console me now.  Usually thats what friends do, but i've done it before... and i dont want others to do it for me.  I dont wanna hear comforting words... cuz im gonna think its a lie.  As much as i trust you, i cant trust others when i cant trust myself.  And rite now i am the last person i trust.  So if ur reading this... i dont know what i expect you to do.  Nothing sounds good.  I'm not tryna say that i dont need friends.  Cuz there are many times that i have.  But right now is not one of those times.  Just leave me be... for now..."

KDGGEE4,male,17,"Yes... you are reading correctly... I did sprain my ankle again.  Well I'll start from the beginning of the day.   I awoke to the beautiful yet familiar melodies of ""End of the Road"" - B2M.  Usually I go downstairs to check whos online, but it was Saturday, so I decided to sleep in until I had to shower for work.  At 9:30, I finally got up and dragged myself to the shower.  9:55 got outta the bathroom... hmm... late again I see... o well.  Listened to some ""Twork It Out"" - Usher as I dressed.  10:10ish... punched in.  After I put on my clip-on-tie and apron, I got the chance to catch up wit a guy I hadn't seen in 2 weeks.  I told him whats been going on the last little bit, he said I was ""pimpin it"", I laughed and sternly told him ""no"".  He told me that he's got a tough decision coming.  He has the job interview which pays VERY well... but hes unsure if he wants to do this or go to UTSC for me... he said hes gonna pray at church when we go together tmr, but ima start today :)   O ya, we're doing this thing where we go to different churches and see the differences... I shoulda started writing notes... o well, we've only gone to 2 so far: Forward and his old catholic church, but I hope we visit lots more!!  For those of who dont know... catholic churches IMHO are so boring!!  Like no offense but it was too much.  I stayed awake the whole time cuz it was an evening service so it was shorter and cuz it was my first time.  They are very ritualistic there, lotsa chants and stuff they expect u to memorize.  Also, I never noticed how enthusiastic Pastor McNeil is, but the main priest I guess is sooo boring to watch.  I'm sure he was praying or something... but I coulda sworn he was sleeping for pretty much the whole thing!!  He didn't preach but my friend tells me that they are very boring when they do, while Pastor McNeil is very emotional and talks to YOU... I love my church.  I wish I was there more often... lol, I say this but I'm breaking some1's heart (well not really) by not going to the picnic tmr.  Then again some1 couldnt tell me how to get there, and I did sprain my ankle so I dont feel so bad... but still... sorry :(.  I truly will miss you, esp if I dont see u again...   Well back to my boring work day... after catching up wit my friend while filling the bread, we all topped off the grocery order, went on break (hehehe, extra long one), and buggies.  Then he and I got split up, he did the dairy order and I did the pop >.   As soon as I arrived, I signed on and relieved me self of all that discomfort by visiting the bathroom... ah ya... felt so good after.  Then I ran some sc wit my ""SC GOD"" of a friend, got struggled too many times (cuz of me :\), talked to Matt, relieved myself one more time and ran some ball.   When we got there, my SC friend and I shot around, then my bro came, and 2 others came.  We ran 3v3 wit some other guy... WOW my teammate struggles!!! No offense but it bothers me when they struggle that much... I mean, every guy he D'ed up beat him in 1 second.  And when a teammate starts straining, the team does too.  I had to come over and help everytime and they would somehow score from open shots or beating me cuz I would have to run out to contest the shot.  And hes offense is just as bad!!!  He misses open layups, throws away the ball, and has the most dash shot EVER!!! **sigh**  I'm sorry for saying all this, but I had to get it out. Well finally he left and so did the mystery guy, so it was just me, my friend, my bro, and his friend.  We started a boring game of american, gave up on that and ran 2v2.  Teams: me and my bro's friend vs my bro and our friend.  Wow... my teammate is too good!!  He's just all day!!  He kept on hitting pull ups over my bro... that's the kinda shot that I work towards ^.^  Anyways, we won the first game 11-6.  Second game:  we started off on fire!!  It was 7-3 when the I got injured again.  I had been kinda struggling down low all day, but my shoot was doing good.  Finally, I set up in the post again.  As I backed down towards the left (if ur on offense) of the net, he pushed back.  I did my fav drop step to the other side and had a nice open shot.  Here's what ran through my mind as it happened: ""drop step, ok, elevate, follow through.  Sweet, there's another poi-"" **sickening snap** **yells of excruicating pain**   LOL, its funny now that I look back on it, but it wasnt at the time.  My friend thought the yell was because I made a power move... I wish that was it.  After rolling on the ground for what seemed like 5 mins... I told them ""I'm finished"" limped my way to my ball, and wit a few breaks outta the court.  I climbed half way up the hill and plopped my large body on the bench.  There I cringed in pain some more, and watched the a play from my sub.  O ya, my sub was a lil kid that we sent away just a few mins b4.  He acts like hes good buy... umm... no.  I observed as my teammate drove and dished the ball to him.  Then I watched as the ball slipped through his hands and flew to the other side of the court.  Im not sure what happened in between, but I saw him get easily beaten by my man.  It was gonna be a long day for my teammate... he was getting crappy partners all day.  I was the only good one, o well...   When I got home I got a drink, checked my comp, and hopped up the stairs.  Then I took a painful shower and cleaned my room... I dunno why either, kinda random if ya ask me, but I did anyways.  Then I limped to my comp and started this.  That was almost 2 hrs ago... well it's not really my fault... I've been chatting the whole time... wit 3 ppl at one point... but I've finally finished my boring day... and my ankle isnt feeling that bad... cant run or anything like that... but its not killing be as it usual does.  But the morning after is the WORSE!!!  Like one time I lilterally crawled to the bathroom to shower for school.  I dont remember if I actually did take a quality shower that day, the pain was simply unbearable... anyways I should be good for wednesday scheduled noon game ^.^   Well last post I recommended some good R&B songs... but a lil Mrs. KnowItAll said that she alrdy heard of all of them... so here are some good BSB & N*Sync songs: (**means not popular but still great)   N*Sync: **Everything I Own I Drive Myself Crazy   BSB: Quit Playin Games **Just to Be Close to You All I Have to Give As Long As You Love Me **Back to Your Heart   Those are my FAVS... there are alota singles that I didnt list, and songs that I enjoy but I also didnt list as to not clog up my blog.  I just wanted my top songs for you to love and enjoy... so enjoy ^.^   Hmm... on a happier note:  I made it one week without... doing something... at work!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!! thx for the prayers.   To every1 who wanted to see me at the picnic tmr: sorry, Im a horrible and lazy person... also standing all day wit a sprained ankle doesnt sound to appetizing.  AND, I'd have to leave early anyways cuz I gotta hook up wit my friend and get some more vitamin G-O-D... anyways, if I dont see YOU again then I'm very sorry and I'll miss you the whole time... t.t   Matt: town centre sounds good, but I still feel bad for making you travel soooo far.  I feel bad for making u watch Spidey2 again too... wow... I'm a jerk.  But since we already decided its too late ^.^ ... hahaha... im so bad...   Anyone wanna reach pickering flea market??  I really need clothes... I need some 4x Tees, some extra baggy jeans, some new HIGH CUT ball shoes... hmm... thats about it.   O ya, I need y'all's (lol, thats so no a word) opinion... How would I look if I shaved my head??  Not like skin head shave... but more of a bald fade... like alota azns have.  I really wanna try it but im afraid to part with these long, dark locks I love... and I'm afraid that it'll look bad... and that my head will be WHITE!!! Ah who cares??!!  Thats something for my summer list for sure!   Anyways, See y'all later   Warren   [19]"

ATY1JC6,male,34,"Sir - Non-custodial alternatives to prison fail to prevent crime or address the widespread fear of crime. Your leading article (Mar 26) makes the point well. One of the main reasons for this problem, which is worsening monthly, is the fact that those in charge of the legal system do not understand how criminals really think.  Having spent nearly 40 years listening to them in cells and interview rooms, I know that the only punishment they fear is prison. It is precisely that fear that lies behind two of the most common pretexts used by criminals to avoid custody: ""You learn how to commit crime in prison"", and ""I did it to feed my drugs habit"".  Many criminals privately admit that they have no such habit; but it is a good way of getting a probation officer to recommend a non-custodial sentence. All too often, the strategy works. Too many courts fail to realise how smart some criminals are.  However, it is not only ignorance of the criminal mind that results in the failure to protect innocent citizens from crime. It is the lack of courage by the agencies responsible: the Government, the police, the probation service and the judiciary.  The Government refuses to fund a worthwhile prison-building project. The police do not have sufficient numbers to patrol our streets effectively - but two officers can be spared on a quiet road to photograph cars. Too many chief constables prefer to use their resources to trap speeding motorists rather than to combat real crime. Meanwhile, the probation service still views its main task as protecting criminals rather than victims.  The judiciary cannot bring itself to accept increasing public concern and criticism of weak sentencing. The Court of Appeal, in particular, includes many judges who know little about criminals or victims - and this is being noticed by the press and the general public.  Your editorial was quite right: nothing cuts crime more than imprisonment.   From: Keith Matthewman QC, Circuit Judge, 1983-2001, Nottingham"

ATY1JC6,male,34,"urlLink Melanie Phillips's Articles :  ""Terminating the Parental Role, Daily Mail, 11 February 2004  The poignant, handwritten diary entry in its childish, rounded letters says it all. 'I had my termanation (sic). Then in brackets underneath: (killed my baby).' Through these few words, one can only guess at the turmoil in the mind of this 15 year-old girl as she struggled to come to terms with what she had done. After noting the event in the impersonal jargon used by the professionals who handled her case, she revealed in childishly simple terms how it actually felt to her. Not a 'termination', but killing her baby. Tragic as this was, the really appalling thing was her isolation from her parents. In need of adult guidance and support more than at any time in her life, she had been effectively abandoned to make this decision and cope with its aftermath on her own. For the doctors who dealt with her had not told her parents on the grounds of 'patient confidentiality'. The girl, who was frightened of what they might say, had said she didn't want to tell her mother. So her GP, who took a mere 15 minutes to see her, simply referred her on to the hospital which carried out the abortion. The first her mother knew of what had happened was when she read the entry in her daughter's diary.  What have we come to when a girl barely out of childhood can have an abortion, a procedure with huge physical, emotional and moral ramifications, without the advice and care of her parents because they have been deliberately kept in ignorance of what is happening? Something has surely gone badly wrong not merely with medical ethics but with our society's whole attitude to sexuality, childhood and parenthood.  On every count, this incident illustrates a widespread breakdown of responsibility, care and common-sense. The first thing it shows is how far"""

4ZAP27B,female,23,"So, happy Memorial Day to all.  I'm sitting in the computer lab, thinking about bidding on something on Ebay.  God Bless internet shopping.  I'll have my whole paycheck spent before it goes into my account tomorrow.  Scary.  I've still got to clean my room sometime before tomorrow, but it's a rainy day, so I'll be spending most of it inside.  I don't think I'll get a chance to play soccer today because of the rain, and the need to clean.  I also have to call my sister in about three hours to find out how her soccer game went.  I don't really like not having a specific list of things that need to be accomplished in a day.  In Basic, we had someone telling us what we needed to be doing at each step.  Now I know that I have to accomplish certain things within the day.  I think going from rigid structure to virtually none at all has messed me up.  It'll take a lot of discipline to get that back.  I'll try though.  I'll be back later!"
4ZAP27B,female,23,"Save Yourself by Stabbing Westward  I know your life is empty And you hate to face the world alone So you're searching for an angel Someone who can make you whole  Chorus: I cannot save you I can't even save myself  I know that you've been damned Your soul has suffered much abuse But I am not your savior I am just as fucked as you  (Chorus)  Please don't take pity on me  My life has been a nightmare My soul is fractured to the bone So, if I must be lonely I think I'd rather be alone   In the Absence of Sun by Duncan Sheik  For all the good you say it does It seems no better when you've had your say You may believe it's just because The words get colder when you've gone away I thought I understood What I was to you...

4ZAP27B,female,23,"Well, it's Sunday, and Sunday sucks.  This has been the worst week of my life, and I'm glad it's almost over with.  Now I only have 12 days left until I'm on a plane back home.  Even though I'll only be home for a week, I'm excited.  I miss my life, and I miss who I was.  It's not that I'm not that person anymore, I just felt more comfortable in my own skin back home.  Here I'm always afraid that I'm doing something wrong.  And I try so hard to make people like me.  I think it works, most people think of me as a nice person.  At home, I had my friends, and we could go out and have a good time.  I didn't have nearly as many dating issues back home.  There was always someone to go out with.  Now, I'm here bored, wishing I had someone to date, because it'd be nice to take my mind off of things.  I guess that's why rebounds are so important.  But, I can't because I don't want to just throw myself at anyone, and I don't really care to get involved with anyone else around here.  I now know the meaning of ""Don't shit where you eat"".  Anyway, back to what's going on.  I just got off my fireguard shift.  I still have my homework to do, but my policy letters have been written.  Speaking of policy letters, I discovered that the fraternization rules apply regardless of branch of service.  Which means I'm not allowed to see Tornetta.  :(  Hehehe, anyway.  We went out last night, and I fell asleep during the movie.  It's not that it wasn't a good movie, I was just so tired from the lack of sleep the night before.  And, there were post-it notes on doors this morning!!!  Thank God they finally hooked up!  I'm glad I went out with the group on Friday.  I don't think I've had that much fun in a while.  We were doing pushups on the floor in the bar.  Totally drunk, but somehow I managed to squeeze out three diamond pushups in heels!  Then Spada did pullups in the ladies room.  It was a crazy night.  I still don't know who puked more.  I miss getting that drunk.  I'm not saying I'm going to do it all of the time, but it's been too long.  Anyway, my nicotine craving is screaming.  Later!"
4ZAP27B,female,23,"Well, today definitely tops the list as one of my better days.  Not really sure why, but I have this crazy almost happy feeling.  I got everything I felt about Lily off my chest, I talked to Ryan, I had people I work with tell me how much they'll miss me.  It wasn't people in the office, it was suppliers with other companies.  That really means something.  After four years of jumping from boredom to ulcers (such is the life when you help buy holiday merchandise for a retailer), it's nice to know that someone appreciates you.  I don't think I've ever been told how well I do my job until now.  When they start freaking out about who is going to replace you.  When they realize all of the stuff you do ""behind the scenes"".  It makes me kind of sad that I'm leaving, but for an adrenaline junkie like me, I know what's ahead is where I'll be happier.  I hate working at a desk job crunching numbers.  I hate numbers!  I can't even balance my checkbook.  How do they expect me to help budget for what we're shipping when?  Ryan was glad to hear from me.  He'll definitely be there Saturday night.  Which is good, but which is also bad.  Give me a little liquid courage, and I'll be sure to tell him all of my suppressed feelings.  So, I'll have to have Jeff around to make sure my mouth stays zipped.  (With the exception of consuming more alcohol.)  I think Lily will be there.  She got the invite when we were still friends.  Her roommate asked me for directions.  Hmmmm......  That'll be interesting.  Once again, liquid courage + conscience drainer comes into play.  I just hope I have the strength to not be stupid.  But, I probably wouldn't have all of my fun stories to tell if I'd always taken the smart road.  I think I'm going to take more idiotic quizzes."
4ZAP27B,female,23,"Well, it's been a while since my last post.  The internet privledges were taken away the the barracks because someone decided to be an idiot and download unauthorized software.  So there's all this stuff about a security breach, and all sorts of higher ups are involved.  And, I'm now suffering from Internet-shopping withdrawls.  I don't know how I'll be able to handle it.  Otherwise, things are good.  Another day, another crush.  I'm stupid, I know.  And, for some reason, every crush I've ever had has always followed the same pattern.  I think it's me......  If the guy is interested in me, there's something wrong with him.  If I'm the one crushing on the guy, then he thinks there's something wrong with me.  I'll never get laid.  That's all there is to it.  I will die sexually frustrated.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have gotten married to Matthew.  Even though I didn't love him.  Sometimes I can't tell if I was lonelier with him than I am now.  I just know that I'm crazy lonely right now.  I don't have anybody that understands where I'm coming from.   That's all I have for now.  I know I need to start whining about things other than matters of the heart, but it's at the forefront.  Hopefully that'll change soon.  (Eleven days until I can be a civilian on weekends, and that means civilian sex!!!)  Love ya"
4ZAP27B,female,23,"Today was my first day of classes here at DINFOS (Defense Information School).  There are a lot of nice people in my class.  One especially.  He's rather handsome, too. I'm trying to work my magic, but those of you who know me know that I have no magic.  I have no game.  I can smile, be friendly, even try to flirt (which isn't very good), and all I'll ever be is a friend.  It happens all of the time."
4ZAP27B,female,23,"I think I may be too hard on the boy. I don't know. I know I care about him a lot. I know that if you love someone, you have to let them go. If they come back, then it's real. I'm not too sure that he'll come back, but I hope he does. I like him. I could spend some time with this one. Another thing that scares me. I usually get bored really quickly, with the exception of a few bad decisions on my part. Nah, not bad decisions, experiences....I'll chalk it up to experience. Gus was a good experience, Josh was a not so good experience. And Justin, well, the jury's still out on that one. He's still got me confused, and it's been a while. That poor boy. I'll bet he's married to Holly by now, and probably still cheating on her with all of the available women from work. I don't understand people who cheat. If you don't want to be in a relationship, you should not be in one. There's no shame in being single. For the most part, I was happily single. Okay, not really, I'd say it was more 50-50. But it was always fun to have a crush. Until you get to know them and find out they're nothing like you expected. So, even crushing has its ups and downs. Then I meet someone who strikes my fancy. And I got lucky. I was mooning over him for a month, and the actual person was better than the daydream version. Back to the original topic, I'm not bored with him, not yet. Who knows where it will all end up. I feel like I'm in a Jane Green novel. That's exactly what it is. Straight Talking by Jane Green. Well, maybe not. More of a mix between Bookends and Straight Talking. I need to find another good author. I've gone through all of her books, and all of the other books I have. I don't have books. How depressing. Especially for me. I can't stand being without something to read. I need to finish reading/editing/whatever else the boy's manuscript, but it's been kind of tough to focus lately. I'll get back on that this weekend. After I complete my punishment for fraternization. Yup, that's right. I will be hand-writing policy letter #14 ten times as corrective training. Pretty pathetic. I had to buy real-size notebook paper today, just for that. And I have to iron my BDUs, polish my boots, shower and get gorgeous for tonight. Scary business, it is. Last night was a lot of fun. We went to Fell's Point, had too much to drink (way too much), met some interesting people. Delker got a date, and she was trying to set me up with his friend, but she doesn't understand that her type is NOT my type. Stank and Spada went, and they got harrassed about a lack of post-it notes on doors. Spada had told us that whenever she finally got some, she was going to start putting post-it notes on our doors when she came home. I had jokingly added, ""We should all start leaving them on the doors, color coded ones."" They told me that I had to leave one up there when I didn't get any, because otherwise I'd go broke having to stock that many post-its. So, after we finished teasing Spada, they turned to me and said ""And we'll be expecting a post-it from you tonight B."" What are friends for, huh? So anyway. I have to go, because I've been wasting away my precious policy letter writing time. This is crazy, absolutely crazy!!! Oh yeah, let me add. I called Ryan today to schedule a racquetball game for when I'm home in two weeks, and I'm meeting Jared (yes, unfortunately that one, but Jeff will be there to protect me) at Brewski's for Guinness and pool. Hopefully I'll run into a few others while I'm back home. It'd be good to see the old friends. I'm going to meet Cheryl for lunch sometime. I still think she'd be the coolest mother-in-law. But I digress."
4ZAP27B,female,23,"Yup, okay.  I like him.  I can't help it.  So, I'm stuck.  Whenever I get my heart yanked out and stomped on with his giant combat boots, I'll cry here.  So, anyway.  We're planning a big get together for this Friday night.  Hopefully it will be fun.  We'll have a few drinks, Mr. Man and I will sneak away and go to some hotel......Fun stories to follow, to be sure."
4ZAP27B,female,23,"Okay, I have to get into the shower, seriously, but Ryan just called.  I'm so excited.  He was double checking the time and place.  How cute is he, and how much of a loser am I for thinking that something would ever happen between us???"
4ZAP27B,female,23,"I am the biggest idiot in the whole world. Yesterday, everything seemed cool. He talked about things cooling down for a bit. Today, he's looked through me, and as far as I know, we're done. I knew I shouldn't have gotten involved with him. I knew that it would only lead to heartbreak. Every time I've ever trusted anyone, they've fucked me over. And here I am, yet again. It's the hurt me once, shame on you; hurt me twice, shame on me adage. And, a true friend stabs you in the front. The only thing I asked of him when we started this whole deal was to be honest with me. How can that be too much???"

We talked alot: families, college, job, my stuff, her stuff. WE've met alot at the ice-cream store, and we  agreed  to go there anytime fot eating some.  I watched to 2 episodes of "" SEX IN THE CITY "", that was just  GREAT !!!!!Samantha remuved her cancer( brest cancer), Miranda went for ""her"" honey moon ( she hates these romantic sutff), Carye tol Alek she wants to have a baby cause she's getting old but he said he doesn't want babies and Char.. well.. she showed the babiyes stuff to Carye! I guess i'll die when it ends, in august! Thank nice Lord there are the DVDs and when they arrive here and when i get the money i'l buy all!  I finished the book i was reading ""Treasure Island"" by Robert Louis Stevenson, the book is not wanderful but it's teachful. It's about a treasure lost in an island, sometimes i thought I was watching to ""Pireates of Carebian""; 'Sometimes I wake up at night. I can hear the sea around Treasure Island.

I spent my free time thinking about somethings that had happenned in my life, I wish i could back in time and change somethings, not things that bothered me, but things that i did and bothered people around me. Well,that's why life is what it is, we never can just erase things. This week passed so fast, and it's not good at all, like Luciana said ( luciana is a lady who works at the gym) ""I'll be in 30's and i didn't enjoy life"", hummm... what is she waiting for? She said that but didn't change anything i suppose, maybe we should not think like her, there's no time for thinking about how fast life is passing, just do something."

After breaktime, i had a Math test, so eaaaaaasy -Thank God- and after it, a wrinting test, easier than the Math one, beacuse after the math test i met some guys of the other junior class and we traded our tests, so before the writing test begin i knew all about it.  And when i was going home i met a friend and we traded our homeworks, i gave him my litersture home work and she's gonna give me the chemistry one. Watched Friends, went to gym, took shower, thought about somethings... And here i am. Tonight i'm going to eat ice-cream, i'll try to brake the last week's record: eat more than 900g of ice- cream.

2V77FDE,male,16,"Last week i watched a movie on HBO, it's is "" le fabuleux destin D'Amèlie Pulain"", very good movie. After the movie the director  said something that really passed the oposite message of the movie, he said that Paris is dirty, crowed, polluted, there is dog's poop all around and the city is rainy, Wow, this man should be exiled from France.  I've heard that the city is fantastic, but full of whores. Well, someone has to work!! HAUHAUHAUHAU!!!! If someone who has been to Paris reads my blogger, s'il voul plait, post about the city. I could go there by myself, but with 100 reais - how much i have - i can't even buy a backpack.  Whereby i'm posting it , i'm eating a cookie named ""Break up!"" wow, such a help. I have this friend, she broke up with his bf sending him one of this, nowadays they're still friends..this girl is crazy, but thinking, it was nice of her. Hummmm... no it wasn't , she made him a piece of crap.   I'm feeling bad about the Math teacher, but he's a terrible teacher, he says something and then he said that he was wrong, it messes everybody's mind. Last week a girl delivered at everybody's desk a petition, asking us to sigh our names, if we get lost of sighs the head-teacher is going to talk with him.  I feel sorry for him, maybe it's not his fault if we didn't get good grades and all of us are going to have to do the tests again, maybe he was getting divorced and couldn't get focus, maybe his son has a serius deciase and he could pay attenion to himself, or worse, maybe his puddle died and he was hurt inside. I sighed my name, and i don't know if i did the right thing, and somepeople gave me as exemple "" bla bla bla the math teacher isn't good, look, till André will have to do the test again, André"" as if i was Da Vinci.   Well, voir vous demain école, or even today when i got back from gym.   P.S: i don't speack french at all, i have a little help from the PC's dictionary."

The glow of your heartbeat next to me, bathing my senses in an acid overflow, Can it cleanse my soul?

8WSXFAT,female,26,"Several years ago, my friend Rimma and I made a pact. We would take the Foreign Service Written Exam, everytime it is offered by the State Department, until one of us passes it, or one of us moves out of the suburbs of Buffalo NY. That pact lasted through one all-day Saturday exam. Rimma decided not to take it again, but that did not stop me from religiously signing up the next time around and the next time. Yes, I took the exam three times. I wasted three Saturdays, trying to remember the dates of the Franco-Prussian War and why Alexander Hamilton was famous. I still don't know the dates of the Franco-Prussian war. I was such a mascochist, I opted to take the exam once I moved out of Buffalo, and down here to Miami. I gave up attending a large party for my office, in order to sit in a university auditiorium and once again remember what ""opportunity cost"" means in economic terms. Finally, my wasted Saturdays paid off. Today, I received a letter from the State Department, letting me know I passed the exam, and have been invited to interview with them. I know all that means is I made it over the first hurdle. I know there are a lot more before I can say I work for the State Department, but today, just for today, I plan on reveling in the fact that I accomplished something that very few people in the country even attempt to do. YAY ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
8WSXFAT,female,26,"The undertoad is strong today. That irrepressible feeling that something bad is going to happen. Nothing bad may happen. I may be fine today. It may be yet another day, full of banter and nostalgia, but it could be painful and scarring at the same time. I cannot get out of my head today. All I want to do is sleep, but I am stuck in the middle of a traffic jam on 95. I wonder, if I napped right now, would anyone notice?   I write sonnets in my head as the radio blares. Who cares about being springtime fresh? Why is the triangle considered an instrument in elementary school music classes? Isn’t it just there so the kids who cannot carry a tune can participate?   The air conditioner kicks off. It keeps doing that, stopping in the middle of 100 degree days…as if to remind me it does not want to be down in Miami…it prefers the cold of the Buffalo winter. I remember when we bought the car…it is white…”A Florida color” my father said. I had declared that the only color car I did not want was white. I drive a white car in Florida.   In Buffalo, during snowstorms, my car would get buried and completely blend in. I used to think of it as one of those monkeys that live in Nepal, near the hot springs….you never see them until you get right on top of them…or they dive into the hot water to warm up.   Now my car is easily spotted in every parking lot. It glows like a radioactive sheep. I can hear it saying, “Baaaaahhhh, baaaahhhhh” as I turn it on. It likes me, my little Iris does, yes I named my car…but it does not like having to run its air conditioner during the Miami afternoons.   I keep half a bicycle in the back seat. Just the wheels, for they are easily accessible for spinning at long stop signs. I see them sometimes, and tell myself I should put them in my storage locker, but I never do. Other times, I look at them, and think,  I could make a really great diorama of  the solar system with them…but then I remember…no one in the real world makes dioramas.   Then I realize, that is the reason adults become elementary school teachers. They have dreams of leading children in creating dioramas, so they go back, into the cavernous halls from which they came. I need to be more specific in my reference there, but I really don’t want to be, so I won’t.   I will just go back to driving along 95, and wondering why it is that everyone else is on the road with me…do they also have no where to go? Hello Mr. Undertoad, I’ve been expecting you…   For those of you who do not know, the undertoad is a reference to  The World According to Garp  by John Irving ."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"I watch the people around me searching for love. They cling to each other in some dark misshapen attempt to exorcise the demons within them. They call physical attraction and a sense of trust, love. It makes me wonder, as my friends’ marriages break up, and others find their soul mates, where does the line exist…and how do we define love? Most days I take a Supreme Court’s definition of pornography approach to love, “I’ll know it when I see it.” Still it makes me wonder, as the happy couple turns into the shrill single…what are we all really searching for? In my quest to find answers, to questions yet unasked out loud, I have turned to poetry. I just finished Stephen Dunn’s book  Different Hours , the book that won him the Pulitzer Prize. It was impressive, and a bit overwhelming, to read his words and connect with them so forcefully…but this poem entitled “Their Divorce” really illustrates how I feel each time I watch the friends in my life separate from each other:   Their Divorce    Not them. Not even with the best binoculars  on the bluest day could I have seen it coming. Not with scrutiny’s microscope, or with the help of history or gossip.  Of all the people, not them.  They hadn’t fallen in love with others.  Not even a night of drink or proximity’s slow burn drove them  to lapse, say, with a coworker. It means no one can know what goes on in the pale trappings of bedrooms,  in anyone’s secret harrowed heart.  It makes time itself an executioner- a fact I always knew applied to couples  whose bodies contradicted their Darling this, Honey that, and even some who exhibited  true decency and respect. But this is a mockery, a defeat. My friends were perfect, perfect. “Every married couple appearing together in public is comic,” Adorno said, and I wrote “Stupid!” in the margin. Now they’re broken up, finished. Oh Adorno, you son of a bitch, you perspicacious bastard, sometimes what a cold eye sees lasts longer than any of us.    Copyright 2000 by Stephen Dunn    Stephen Dunn is a new discovery, only recently introduced to me by the fact that he won the Pulitzer and his book was in the Miami Dade Public Library. I should own more poetry than I do. I used to devour it like pancakes for Sunday morning breakfast. Now, I only nibble at the edges of it, like its expensive caviar, and I don’t want to finish off the last cracker.   Still, back in my feasting off poetry days, I consumed a vast quantity of Anne Sexton…probably at too early an age to understand what she really meant, and definitely at a time when I could not discern all metaphors from real life. I am not ranting about my history in this message, I am making allusions to poems that make me think about the break ups of friends. I probably should just sit down and write my own poems, but since I am wary of opening that Pandora’s box, I will post an Anne Sexton poem that also makes me think about the shredding of the heart. It is called, “The Wedding Ring Dance,” and was published in  45 Mercy Street  in 1976.   THE WEDDING RING DANCE    I dance in circles holding the moth of the marriage, thin, sticky, fluttering its skirts, its webs. The moth oozing a tear, Or is it a drop of urine? The moth, grinning like a pear, or is it teeth clamping the iron maiden shut?  The moth, who is my mother, who is my father, who was my lover, floats airily out of my hands and I dance slower, pulling off the fat diamond engagement ring, pulling off the elopement wedding ring, and holding them, clicking them in a thumb and forefinger, the indent of twenty-five years,  like a tiny rip leaving its mark, the tiny rip of a tiny earthquake, Underneath the soil lies the violence, the shift, the crack of continents, the anger, and above only a cut,  a half inch space to stick a pencil in.  The finger is scared but it keeps its long numb place, And I keep dancing, a sort of waltz, clicking the two rings,  all of a life at its last cough, as I swim through the air of the kitchen, and the same radio plays its songs and I make a small path through them with my bare finger and my funny feet, doing the undoing dance, on April 14th 1973, letting my history rip itself off me and stepping into something unknown and transparent,  but all ten fingers stretched outward, flesh extended as metal waiting for a magnet.     I read that poem the first time fifteen years ago. Then, I saw it as a piece reminiscing about the wedding. Then again, I was 11, and not nearly as cynical as I am now. Me, cynical? Nah…never!!! I think that is part of why I am writing this blog…in order to stop hiding me. I have written other things, and put them out there, but I was always afraid of what people would think, so I censored myself. I am sick of having to choose between friends as they separate…but in order to stay a good friend…I don’t tell them so. I just write it in my blog so anyone in the world can read it."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"Ok Folks, I am posting my first new poem in several years. I may get rid of it, since I am not sure if I like it yet...but for now...here it is:   Moanings at 3 in the Morning   I ache, deep in my soul, where does it come from? why can't it stop? I try so hard, so hard to feel like there is more to me than a reflection of melodrama. I hear the whine in my voice. I crave more, but I fear to give into  temptation. I fear giving into myself. Why don't I know what I want? Why isn't it tangible? I can't see it. I can't let go of the past. I can't picture the future. Dreams fall away, carving a hole in reality. Leaving me empty."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"I am sitting in Starbucks, reading a magazine article about the gentrification of New Brunswick NJ written four years ago, because there is also an article about the 2000 Democratic convention in it, and wondering why? There was a time when I would have scoffed at sitting in a Starbucks, and would have chosen a non-chain alternative. I have one, 2 blocks away. I could have gone there, but I chose to stop here.   Since moving to South Florida, I feel like my level of consumption has risen. Maybe it’s the fact that I am living with my parents, and being around them for long periods of time these days makes me sick. I find myself driving, thought I know it is bad for the environment. I look for jobs in the next county, or the county above that, just because I know I would not be able to live with them and work, if I got those positions. Every time I fill up my gas tank, I know I am being cruel to the environment, but I can’t help myself. Its like I am saving my sanity by polluting the planet.   I eat out more than I did up north and I usually consume fast food. Burger King and Wendy’s may no longer use cardboard boxes to wrap their food, but they still use so much stuff, I feel like I have killed a couple trees in the past 4 months.   When did I become this person, who does not take into account my level of consumption as I lead my life? When did the term “need” start working with a pair of ruby red high heels that are so insanely high I could never wear them? Last night, I said that, even though they were probably the most frivolous item I could buy. Wait, no, considering the store I was in, the pair of shoes is not the most frivolous thing I could have purchased.  Still, realizing that I used the word, “need,” when it came to shoes, alarms me a lot.   Just now, I witnessed a scene where a toddler was being entertained by his big sister. She was pushing him back and forth with her feet, in his stroller. Their father did not like the fact that the toddler was laughing really loud. I was smiling at the children, and when the father interceded and told them to calm down, I gave him a look. He took it to mean I did not want the children to be loud; when in fact, it was just the opposite. I wanted them to be louder. I wanted them to scream and run around this Starbucks, and threaten to tear the place apart. And yet to that father, I looked like a person who did not like rambunctious kids.   I’ve become a ma’am. In restaurants and at work, especially when I am wandering around the office in a business suit, advising people twice my age on financial planning and their taxes, I get called ma’am. I’m too young to be ma’am. Ma’am is a term for my mother. It is a term for older women with greying hair. Wait, I have at least five grey hairs at the moment. So that definition does not work for me. Women who are called ma’am worry about mutual funds and the stock market. Ok, that doesn’t work either, since I do keep track of my measly portfolio and wish I could put money away for the future. I guess I don’t have any more arguments against being ma’am. I have reached that age.   It makes me amused to realize that a lot of the declarations about myself I made at 16, I have reversed by the time I was 26. I told myself at 16, no matter my interest in the Middle East, I would never work for an oil company. Now I wonder if Halliburton is hiring, though I don’t bother going to their website to seriously pursue it. I did look at BP and Exxon-Mobil. Just looking at the websites made me sick to my stomach. I felt sick, mainly because I realized, I could work for those companies. I could sell my soul to a corporation and be relatively happy. The thing that stops me is the move to Texas or Oklahoma and the fifty-mile a day commute out to the suburbs I see in my future. Oh, and don’t forget the SUV and the 2.5 kids. I have to make sure they are in the picture."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"Tuesday morning I crawled out of bed about noon and was confronted with yet another test of my strength. My mother announced to me that she thinks she had a heart attack two days before. She had called the doctor, but could not get an appointment until Friday morning. It is now Thursday afternoon, and I have been feeling like an elephant has been kickboxing my chest ever since. Memories of the times I spent sitting in emergency rooms and waiting rooms of ICUs came flooding back to me. I have a big ache in the pit of my stomach. I know no matter what happens, it will be ok. I just want to know something now, not tomorrow and not next week.  Oh well, such is the life I lead. I'm at the library, where I usually am when I decide to pound out a rant. I just tried to access nerve.com. I was not allowed access due to content. That of course makes me curious what kind of content is on it, that I am not allowed to view? I guess the sex survey done by the unemployed for this week, may be it...but is it really that different than the stuff on slate.com? Where are they drawing the line? I love lines....they lead to slippery slopes. Slippery slopes are fun...because you never know how far down people and morality will fall.  My hands hurt, from hours of typing, and my eyes ache from staring at the screen. Why do we subject ourselves to spending hours in front of a keyboard, only to communicate with people who are no where near us? Why do we race home from work, or school to check e-mail from people we see everyday? Why do we seek this validation?  If anyone has any answers to my questions...please let me know. I am sick of trying to answer them for myself."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"I own an umbrella that I have chased around the country. I have left it in truckstops, and restaurants, and have back-tracked 100 miles to retrieve it. It may seem silly, tracking down an umbrella, but this umbrella represents for me, one of the darkest times in my life.   I was 20, almost 21, and home from college because I was sick. No one was completely sure what was wrong with me, except that I was dizzy, fainting, and had massive headaches. I was scared. I felt completely alone and isolated from everyone around me. Part of it was my own fault, dealing with people made me miss the life I had been leading as a care-free college student. The other part of it was the ""fault"" of the people who were around me. They had no clue how to deal with someone who was sick, and not elderly. I was also incredibly afraid of people.  Still, I digress, this posting is about the umbrella. During this time, an exhibit on Monet came to the Allbright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. It was only pictures he had done at Givenchy, and I really wanted to go. My parents, and their friends got us tickets. We went to the exhibit, and about halfway through it, I nearly passed out.   I remember my father sitting with me in a chair, and that I never finished viewing the exhibit. Monet is one of my favorite artists, and I felt really horrible, since I had wanted to view the entire showing. I wanted to cry.   My parents bought me an umbrella, with Monet's water lilies on it. I got better, and have gone on with my life. Still, I keep this umbrella, to remind me of a time when I was so weak, I needed my father to help carry me."
8WSXFAT,female,26,"I have had four hours sleep, and should be doing something more productive than writing yet another blog message, but the message I had written, and was going to post...an analysis of my consumptionist ways, is on a floppy disk. The computer in the library where I am sitting, a nice gateway pentium 1 by the way, has a broken floppy disk drive, and of course no USB port. Therefore I am screwed. So I have decided to rant for a few minutes about the lack of technology in today's libraries.   Personally, I am against computers in libraries, particularly in school libraries. I think there is something to be said about the tactile feeling of finding a book before writing a paper. Looking my first book up alone in the card catalog is a memory that will last me the rest of my life. It was a big accomplishment, since I didn't ask the librarian or teacher to help me, and I found the book myself. Its hard for me to picture my future children not having that same experience. Just like it is hard for me to know that they will probably have worse handwriting than I do, (And those of you who know me, know my handwriting sucks) because I know that their teachers will demand they type their assignments, instead of being forced to decipher primitive script.   Still, if there are going to have to be computers in every day use, I really would like them to be functioning well. I really wanted to tell the librarian at that branch, that I could streamline their access to the internet, and make the webpages load faster, if she just gave me 10 minutes. I figured that they would think I was gonna hack into their system or something, so I didn't. Instead I left the library feeling like I wasted my 45 minutes. I wish I could have done something for them, because I know other people don't have the access to the internet that I do. I am lucky, I have it at home. I just use the libraries for convenience when I am out and about. As I do my job hunt, more and more I am refered to websites, and I know that there are lots of people out there who cannot apply to those jobs, because they have no access to the sites. It makes me sad, that the technology exists, but the people do not have access to it. The lines in the libraries prove it. Down here in Miami-Dade, I have witnessed people waiting an hour for their 45 minutes to send e-mail or do a job search. That is all the library can afford to give them."

YVQ7EG8,female,14,"Here's todays' joke: Insulting Parrot    A lady was walking past a pet store when a parrot said, ''Hey, lady! You're really ugly!""  The lady was furious and continued on her way.  On the way home, she passed by the petstore again and the parrot once more said ""Hey, lady! You're really ugly!""  She was incredibly ticked now, so she went into the store and said that she would sue the store and kill the bird.  The store manager apologized profusely and promised he would make sure the parrot didn't say it again.  The next day, she deliberately passed by the store to test the parrot. ""Hey, lady!"" it said.

Ask the price of almost everything on the menu and then order something that you didn't ask the price for.  3. Tell the employee that your window is broken. Order and then pay with your door open.

If they ask you to wait, order anyway and keep doing it till they yell at you.  14. Pretend your car has broken down. Ask for assistance moving it. When they come out, drive away.  15. Tell them you have to use the bathroom.  16. Order a cup of water and two napkins. That's it.  17. Don't order when they come on. Just sit there. If a line forms behind you, get out of the car and cause a scene.  18. When they hand you your food, hand them a bag with all the trash from your car in it.  19. Just stare at them when you pay and get your food. Don't break your stare.  20. Honk your horn the whole way through the line.

0D4CHHN,female,23,"My feet hurt :'( *sob sob* I hate Wednesdays.  Wednesday is when many of the shipments come in, including cigarettes.  Cigarette shipments are a bitch to count and even more of a bitch to put away, especially since the Phillip Morris people came in and took away some of my carton space.  What a pain in the ass.  To top it off, I had to work an extra half hour today.  Why, you might ask?  I didn't find out until AFTER my manager had left that there men coming from the ice cream company to drop off a cooler and tons of ice cream to go in it.  Now, before Todd had finished his counting during the changeover proceedure, one of the guys said, ""I forgot to tell you this was a cash on delivery and the other stores have been averaging $250-$300.""  I thought 'greeeeeat' because Todd only has $250 in his drawer to start.  There was no way he could make such a payout.  I, however, from working all day had the money to make such a payout, so I told Todd that I would stay on until they were finished so I could make the payout, which was just shy of $300.  That meant that I got off my drawer a half hour later than I was supposed to.  I hope I get paid for that extra half hour..... (Yeah I know it's just $3, but $3 is $3).  A side note:  I MISS PHIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0D4CHHN,female,23,"I have to close tomorrow night.  Yuck.  I hate closing.  Last time I closed I had a mad rush like 10 minutes before closing and Todd shorted me like $5 for the lotto deposit.

Mind you, I USED to know how to sign a little but I can't remember a bit of it.  Damn the fact I'm an auditory learner.  Anyway, I did the best I could and I think I did ok.  I got out a pen and paper and I got them a map for them to look at.  Apparently they missed their turn and ended up quite a ways away from where they needed to be. I think I pissed off my sister.  I was in Mt. Pleasant for the last couple days to visit Jenny.  I told Kate I would visit with her too, but at the last minute, Jenny and I decided to do her sociology project that involved going to the mall and I sort of forgot and I really had no way of contacting her, considering I didn't know her number.  Oh well.  Kate comes home every fucking weekend.  I rarely see Jenny, so Kate will have to live with the fact I wanted to spend time with my friend."

0D4CHHN,female,23,"(note:  This was originally published on my old website  urlLink ""Weezer and Stuff"" )  Scott's Side Project  a fanfic by Becca       ""Brian has a side project.  Pat has a side project.  Why can't I have a side project? It's not fair!,"" Scott said to himself, thinking about how Rivers was about side projects.  He remembered times where Brian would talk about the Space Twins and then get yelled at by Rivers.  Pat knew enough not to talk about it very much in the first place.       Weezer was taking a break for a while.  Pat was doing stuff with The Special Goodness.  Brian was doing stuff with the Space Twins.  Rivers was busy hanging out with Fred, Britney, and other celebrities so people would see him on TV or at least inside a tabloid.  Scott was bored out of his mind.  True, cruising around Silverlake in his El Camino was fun, but he missed playing his bass.       Just then there was a knock at the door of Scott's apartment.  It was Brian.  ""Hey, Scott!  How are you doing today?,"" he asked gleefully.       ""Hmmm... bored... but fine... I guess...,"" Scott replied.       ""Well I came over to invite you to a performance of my band, the Space Twins.  Would you like to come?  We will be playing tonight at the Troubador,"" Brian said eloquently.       ""Sure.  Why not?,"" Scott said, even though it was just another reminder of what he could be doing.       Later that night, Scott observed Brian's performance in a hidden away spot in the bar, away from the screaming girls who were always trying to pet Brian.  He was hoping they wouldn't notice him.  They were only there because he was in Weezer and could care less about the Space Twins.   ""Hmm... I guess that is a downside to having a side project.  Some people will only like you for your main band, but I can handle that,"" he said to himself.       He looked around the bar.  Rivers was there, hidden away himself, talking on his cell phone.  ""Oh Mary Kate, Ashley, the three of us can have our birthday parties together... Yeah, I'll still take you to the mall afterward...,"" Rivers was saying into the phone.  Scott just sighed and rolled his eyes.       At that point, Scott's cell phone rang as well.  ""Hey, what's goin' on, man?  You at Brian's gig?,"" Pat asked.       ""Yeah.  What you up to?,"" Scott asked back.       ""Oh nothing much, just on the road with the Foo Fighters...  How's Brian doing up there?""       ""Pretty good,"" Scott said.       ""That's cool.  Gotta go now.  Dave and I are going to have a drum off.  Later!,"" Pat said before hanging up.       Scott was sad, thinking about what Pat was doing.  He could be there, too, if he had only said yes when Pat offered him Murph's old spot.       He sat in his apartment, thinking about the day Rivers tore into Brian for even mentioning the Space Twins in an interview and things Rivers had periodically said to him about side bands, often accompanied by a slashing motion across the throat or a mid-90's picture of the band with Matt ripped out of it.  Even Rivers' voice haunted him, saying ""You know what happens to bassists who start their own band...""  It echoed in his brain before he went to bed.       Scott fell into a vivid dream as he fell asleep.  He found himself in an endless room full of basses.  He then heard a voice saying, ""Hey! Over here!""  It was a voice he had heard before.  Scott turned toward the voice.  There was Matt Sharp sitting on a sofa fooling around with his bass.  The funny thing was that he didn't look like Matt today.  He looked like Matt from 1995, with his hair cut short.         ""What are you doing here?,"" Scott asked with bewilderment.       ""I'm the ghost of Matt Sharp and I've come to talk to you about side projects.  Here, take a seat,"" he said gesturing to a chair.       Scott sat down and thought for a minute.  ""Wait a minute,"" he said, ""Matt is still alive! How can you be his ghost?""       Matt's ghost thought for a minute. ""Hmmm... that's a good point.  I never thought about that before...  Let's see...,"" the ghost said, scratching his head.  ""Oh! I've got it!  I am the ghost of Matt Sharp from WEEZER.  I'm pretty sure that part of him is dead.  Is that a good explanation for you?""       ""Yeah.  I guess that explains it...,"" Scott replied, still confused.       ""Good, but we have no time to discuss that.  I hear you've been thinking about a side project of your very own.  Just to clarify, the Rentals were never a side project, they were MY BAND!,"" ghost Matt said.       ""Yeah, yeah. I know...,"" Scott said.       ""Sorry. I am very sensitive about that.  Anyway, I'm sure Rivers has put you through every scare tactic in the book.  Don't let him sway you.  If you want a band of your very own, then do it!""       ""What???,"" Scott said.       ""You heard me,"" the ghost of Weezer Matt replied.  ""If you truly want to start your own band, who can stop you?  Only you can stop yourself.  Rivers doesn't control your life.  Besides, you look like you could kick his ass if he ever started shit with you anyway.  You're a scary guy.""       ""Ummm... thanks I guess... but, you know, I only look like a scary brute.  Inside I am very sensitive.""       ""Aren't we all...?  Most guys, however, would never admit it.""       ""So what are you up to these days?,"" Scott asked.       ""Well, you probably already know the real deal is out on the road with his solo act.  I've been really bored lately because of that.""       ""Why is that?""       ""Well all these kids who only see the real me because I was in Weezer go out to the shows and heckle me.  They remind the real Matt of times he was acting like an idiot, usually drunk off his ass.  Or would that be my ass?  Anyway, when kids ask him about Weezer and such it does the haunting for me.""       ""That sucks,"" Scott said.       ""Well, anyway, do what you really want to do.  Good luck,"" Matt's Weezer ghost said as the dream world faded out.       The next day, Scott began to plan his big side project.  ""Okay, I will have to work on making my voice super scary.  I might even want the guitarist I hire to have a scary voice too for added effect.  Oh man, we have to be totally heavy metal.  I never get to rock out to my fullest with Weezer.""  He even made posters to put around the area:  BRAND NEW HEAVY METAL BAND  LOOKING FOR HARDCORE DRUMMER  AND GUITARIST WITH SCARY VOICE.  SCARY LOOK A PLUS.  MISSION: TO BRING THE ROCK BACK TO THE KIDDIES!  CALL 555-0711 FOR AUDITION.       Plenty called to audition with Scott over the next week.  He finally settled on two heavily pierced and tattooed guys who were also very talented.  The guitarist went by the name ""Murder"" and the drummer was named Steve.  Scott, Steve, and Murder decided to name their band Thicker than Blood and immediately started practicing songs Scott had written during his time of boredom.       Eventually, the band got out there and began playing gigs and such.  They even began to lay down tracks for an album.  Scott's band built up a small following and the potential for success grew larger by the day.  Unfortunately, the amount of time Scott had off from Weezer also grew shorter by the day.       Soon, the dreaded day had arrived.  Scott received a phone call from Rivers.  ""Hey Scott,"" Rivers said, ""I think I've had enough time off.  Let's get back to the studio tomorrow so we can start on album 5.  After that, we can go back to some heavy duty touring.  I know you've been really bored, so I bet you can't wait...""       ""Umm... yeah... sure... that will be great!,"" Scott said nervously.       ""I thought you'd be more excited,"" Rivers said.       ""No, it's just that i've gotten used to having all this free time.  It will just be a while before I get back into the groove of doing all the heavy duty Weez work again,"" Scott said, still nervous.       ""Well be at the studio tomorrow at 10 a.m.  No later!,"" Rivers said sternly.       Scott didn't know what to do.  His band was ready to break beyond underground, but now he was being dragged back into his Weezer world.  He always said that Weezer would be his top priority, but now Scott wasn't so sure.  He was enjoying his life in a side project, but, alas, it was only a side project.  He had to tell the other guys that they might not be doing any more work for a while.       Scott, Steve, and Murder had a meeting a few days later.  ""Listen, guys,"" Scott said, ""I'm in another band.  I started this one as a side project to kill boredom while we had all this time off in my other band, but now they want to get together and start working again.  That means that we can't do anything for a while.  I hope you understand.""       ""Just curious,"" Steve said, ""but what other band are you in?""       ""Weezer.  Didn't you guys know that?,"" Scott replied.       Steve began uncontrollably laughing.  ""Weezer?  You're shitting me, right?  Weezer! Ha! What a funny joke!  What band are you really in, Scott?""       ""I told you Steve.  Weezer,"" Scott said.       Steve continued to laugh.  ""Weezer is a geek band.  You're not a geek, are you?""       ""I'm there to take some of the geekiness away from the band.  Do you have a problem with that?  If so, you can leave this band,"" Scott said with anger bubbling within him.       ""I don't want to be in a band with any geeks,"" Steve said, walking out the door.       ""What about you, Murder?,"" Scott asked.       Murder was silent as usual for a minute, but then he spoke up.  ""I understand.  I have to go back to my band as well.""       The only time anyone really heard Murder's voice was when he was screaming into the microphone.  Murder almost never spoke in conversation, but when Scott heard him speak, his voice sounded familiar.  ""Rivers? Is that you?,"" Scott asked, ""What are you doing here?""       Murder removed his wig of long, black hair and took off his clip-on piercings.  ""Yeah.  It's me,"" he said, ""I just wanted to rock out.  Besides, I thought I told you never to start a side project.""  Scott, out of patience at that point, was about ready to pound him, but then Rivers said, ""I'm just fucking with you.  Relax.  I'll let you have this side band as long as you tell no one about my alter ego.""       ""Man, I still can't believe you're Murder.  Are those tatoos for real?,"" Scott asked.       ""No.  They rub right off.  See?,"" Rivers said rubbing his arm.  ""Do we have a deal, Scott?  Can I secretly be a metal god and you have a side band.""       ""Okay,"" Scott replied, ""but on one condition.  You remember that this is MY band.  Don't you dare try to take over.  I'll let you do whatever the hell you want with Weezer as long as you let me do whatever the hell I want with this band.""       Rivers thought for a moment.  ""Deal,"" he said, shaking Scott's hand.       Later on, the band found a new drummer who was even more hardcore than the first.  His name was Joe and he had no qualms about Weezer or the fact that this band was just a side project.  In fact, Joe had a job of his own, so it worked out better that way for him.       The band never really did get that successful, nor did they last very long.  Joe wanted to spend more time with his family, Scott got bored with the whole thing, and Murder went on to become the newest guitarist for Limp Bizkit.  THE END"
0D4CHHN,female,23,"So the online catfight has begun... First of all, yes I do remember what it was like when I was searching for a job, but Jen is neglecting two very important facts:  1. she already has a job (which I never did at that time) so she at the very least has some form of income and 2. she is acting like this after about 2 +/- weeks of hard core job hunting.  That's right two weeks.  Talk about a lack of patience.  I at least didn't get this way until after maybe 1 1/2 - 2 months, which is understandable, but TWO WEEKS???  Yes, I do understand.  She calls me unsympathetic, but she's not telling you the whole story.  First of all, she cancells her date with Will on Saturday (which is a whole other long story of lack of sympathy and forgetting what it's like on  her  part), so she had  promised  me we'd go out and do something instead.  They made her work an extra hour and she was dog tired when she came home, so I said, ""Okay, it's fine if you take a nap.  We don't have to do anything big.""  She took a nap and all was well.  When she got up, we slowly began to discuss things to do.  I wanted to go out for ice cream.  She suggested going to the fucking grocery store and picking up some.  That wasn't what I had in mind, but I let it slide.  Next, we start talking about going out to eat.  It was a fine idea, but then Jen started to complain about how little money she had.  I offered to pay, but that wasn't good enough for her and she FREAKS OUT and starts job hunting at 9:30 on a fucking Saturday night.  I thought maybe this would only be a few minutes, but soon enough it was 10:00 and she was still freaking out about jobs.  It was clear that I wasn't going anywhere this evening, so I decided to spend some quality alone time in my room to cry out my disappointment. You know, she didn't even make an effort to see what was wrong.  She didn't even say anything until I actually came out of my room for a glass of water.  She said that had I told her I wanted to go out, she would have stopped, which is bullshit because she knew I wanted to go out and I know her - she wouldn't have stopped.  If we did leave, she would have spent the entire time worrying and complaining anyway, which defeated the purpose of going out.  I had contemplated going back out to the living room instead of my room, but I knew Jen was just going to cold shoulder me and spend the entire rest of the night on her computer, like she always does, so I really was better off alone.  After I went to my room she yelled to me in a really snotty voice, ""I see you don't want to talk to me!""  I did respond.  I said ""No, it's not that,"" but she ignored me as I figured she would. You know, all I'm asking for is an apology and that she'll make it up to me, but I know I'll never get that because Jenny never apologizes.  She's never sorry for anything she does.  I admit, I should have been more vocal about my extreme disappointment that she broke her promise, but I don't think she would have listened to me anyway.  It seems she only fully pays attention when she reads it on a computer screen.  (I hope you're paying attention.) I'm sorry for feeling that I have to take it to my blog, but I think that's the only way you'll ever listen to me.  I'm sorry for being so immature about this and I wish we could work out our problems like adult.  I'm sorry for spending so much time in my room, but it's because lately I feel I'm my own best friend.  I don't think anybody really cares about me and that I'm probably better off dead, but you probably don't understand and I don't expect you to.  You probably don't remember what it feels like to be so alone, to feel like NOBODY cares about you, to feel like NOBODY cares if you just disappeared, to feel like you wanted to die physically so badly because you felt so isolated and dead on the inside.  This isn't your fault, but lately, you haven't helped.  I'm sorry for being so selfish, but I think to some extent it's true.  The reasons why I stay in Encino when you close have little to do with my fear of driving anymore, but more to do with the fact that I get to go out and see people and I'm not trapped in this apartment all evening.  I enjoyed watching people and making observations as I sat inside a Starbucks in Ventura.  I just wish that we could go out and observe people and share our observations, but you won't!  You won't go out!  Can't you see how much it's suffocating me to be here? I'm sorry if the words I said hurt your feelings, but I wasn't this bad this morning until I read your blog, because you hurt my feelings.  You probably don't to be my friend anymore and I should have seen this coming for the last few weeks.  I'm sorry for all the things I must have done to make you feel that way.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for whatever I've done to make you hate me.  I don't want you to hate me anymore, but I want you to understand how much being trapped in this apartment is killing me.  I know the job thing is rough, but you really have to give it more time before you freak out, okay?  Two weeks is not enough time.  It took me almost 4 months, for crying out loud.  I'm not saying it will take you 4 months, but you need to realize that it's not going to happen immediately.  You need to be prepared in case it takes like 2 or even 3 months.  It might take you until August.  You can't expect to have it right away and the more impatient you get, the longer it will take.  God uses these things to teach us patience, don't you know that?  You need to just calm down and work a few hours each day, except for maybe Saturday when it won't do you any good, and send resumes, even to jobs you don't completely qualify for.  You never know, they might just take a chance on you.  Please don't take your lack of funding out on me.  If need be, I can help you out (just not right now, as I'm dealing with the car thing).  I can take a raincheck on the birthday gift (you are still getting me one, right?), all I ask is that we try to enjoy ourselves a bit more.  By sending out your cover letters and resumes, you've done all you can do.  If it bothers you that much, then hound them.  Send mailed copies.  Nag them if you can.  I've heard that it can work.  Now, all that I've probably said hasn't made one damn bit of difference to you, but that's all I can say. Now, if you need me, I'll just be in my room..."

0D4CHHN,female,23,"Oh my God,  urlLink this the COOLEST blender that I've ever seen.  I think I have a new pet.  My mom was fishing her fish out of the pond in our front yard today because it's supposed to get really cold tonight and she has to fish them out anyway because if she leaves them in there over the winter they'll die.  Anyway, she found what she thought was a small lobster.  She said I could keep it as a pet.  It was much too small to boil anyway.  I was going to name it ""Rock"" (as in Rock Lobster, a song by the B-52's) or ""Pinchy"" (because there was an episode of the Simpsons where they kept a pet lobster and thanks to Eric, an expert of the Simpsons, I figured out that they named it ""Pinchy"").  So, later on, when I was looking up care instructions, it dawned on me.  Lobsters live in salt water.  This could not be a lobster.  It had to be a crayfish, a BIG crayfish.  So anyway, now ""Rock"" is out of the running because it's no longer funny.  (""Rock"" crayfish... umm... no)  I might name it ""Marron"", despite the fact that i'm not sure if it's a Marron or a Yabbie or whatever breed, but after the very bishi character Marron from Bakaretsu Hunters.  I still don't know.  How about ""Krusty"" the crustacean?  I'm not even sure if i'm keeping it, so you know... Since I have virtually no music at all anymore (pretty much all the music on this computer belongs to Kate), Jenny has been kind enough to give me the hook up and to ""share"" some of her music with me.  She's sent me quite a bit of the Cure and the Smiths and I'm not sure if it's depressing me more or just making more aware of my depression.  I think it's the latter.  It's really sad when you hear Morrisey describing the details of your life through song.  She sent me some Clash and some Femmes too, but lately the really depressing stuff has been more appealing to me lately.  Well, that's not completely true...  I can  really associate with the sexual angst of the Femmes and as for the Clash (most of what she sent me was sell-out Clash) I can't help thinking of Brian Bell and it's always fun to tease Jenny about him.  Then again, whenever I hear Morrisey's voice I think of that really creepy dead on impression Matt Sharp did of him at the Schuba's show in Chicago last November.  Matt is my hero (even though that has absolutely nothing to do with his numerous impressions)!  I wish I had a burner that worked so I could listen to all the music she sent me at work.  I don't like it getting quiet at work, especially when I'm closing.  Closing is scawwwy."

This also got me wondering about the validity of these claims. It is true that if someone wants a free email address they are available easily. When I signed up for Yahoo I opted not to receive the email address. We also do not use our cable email address at this time. We never used the DSL one either for our office or home.  I do use GMail though. At least now I'm using it as a way to better manage some of my email. Will I go away from it once it becomes available to the masses? Perhaps for regular usage, but I still like the search aspect of it and I think it is easily better than Yahoo or Hotmail. I'm still getting used to it though and I still have a bunch of screenshots to share when I get to it.

SF6OWBR,female,25,"So...after an almost two month hiatus I finally went to Disneyland yesterday. Yes. My first summer visit of 2004. My friend and I got there around 4. The rumors were true; attendence was very low. We were able to ride (more like walk on) to Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion, and its a small world by 5:30. We met my cutie out in front at 6:20, after seeing the all new Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (which is severly lacking without the two brothers and Golden Wings songs.) Then went over to DCA to see  it's tough to be a bug and, of course, Tower of Terror (I have now ridden the California version 10 times. I know. There are people out there that have ridden it way more. but still. I am keeping count.)  Sigh. My Disneyland fix. Its staring to wear off....want....to....go....back...."
SF6OWBR,female,25,"Ok, when I first heard about this I thought that blogging (weblogging...keeping on online web log or journal) sounded really cool. I could write short little blurbs about what's on my mind and people who want to know me better could read them and amuse themselves at the insane and ever evolving processes of my mind...  I could recommend books and movies, say my piece about all of those shows that I am addicted to (you know, like those Survivor updates I always tried to do...), think aloud about al of the religious and philosophical debates that are floating around in my mind, and complain about things that bug me...Which is always fun to rant about.  And I freely admit that I am may be the biggest nerd ever...  So I found this website and decided to give it a go, and see if I can actually keep up with it. Unfortunately, I could not have picked a crazier week to begin, because unlike the series of boring, monotonous weeks that I usually pass through, this particular week had some amazing stuff going on...you know...those events that you look forward to for weeks? So how on earth do I begin when there are already major cool things I want to write about...such as the Madonna concert on Wednesday, seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on Friday on IMAX, and going to RELAY for life on Saturday and Sunday? I know...Unbelievable week, no?   For the sake of easier reading, I am going to do separate, short entries for each of those awesome things I did this weekend.

SF6OWBR,female,25,"Ok, I was going to wait a bit until I dove into the heavy stuff, but as it just so happens, my blood is boiling today by a conversation we had in the lunch room, so, guess what? I am going to vent. here. now. And you know what? I am not going to defend my position right now. I'll do that later. For now, I am just going to be totally emotional. Love me or hate me...here goes nothing.  There are these two people in the lunch room who totally antagonize each other. One is super liberal, and the other is super conservative. They constantly get in fights, however, Mr. Conservative tends to do it in good fun, although he is more staunch about his opinion, while Ms. Liberal can get overly emotional...She can dish it but she can't really take it.   Usually, their conversations are a lot of fun for me, since I love arguing stuff like that, playing devils advocate, looking at both sides, and since I am either the most liberal conservative that you'll ever meet, or the most conservative liberal (I haven't decided yet - my political skewings resemble a scatter plot with absolutely no correlation) then I most often find myself cheering on both of them (or thinking they are both completely wrong)  Normally, lots of fun.   Not today.  The topic? Abortion.   Sigh. Now, just to make it clear, I am prolife. That is my current opinion, and I must admit a very strong one. I was very passionate about it in high school and did a lot of research so that I could argue the pro-choice position, wanting to be clear that I understood both sides, and in doing that, it made my feelings towards being prolife even stronger. To this day, I feel very strongly about it. I am sure, in a later post, I will make clear all of my feelings on both sides (yes, I do have flaws in my beliefs about abortion...for example, if abortion were illegal except in cases where the mother's life was in danger, then even more babies would be born and overpopulation would increase - as if humans don't already over run the earth (see Ishmael - Daniel Quinn)....ok see there I go....) Alas, I digress...  I can already see the wheels in your head a spinnin'   Okee dokee...I'll try to relay the incident without commentary, because I have commentary for just about every line of this story, as I am sure you do to, especially if you are as passionate about this topic as I...And if not, perhaps you know the feeling regarding another topic that you are passionate about...  so I didn't hear how the conversation started, but I started paying attention when Mr. C says, ""Ok, I understand that your prochoice because the women has the right to choose what happens to her body. But let's say the medical technology existed that could take the fetus and hook it up to a machine so that it could continue to grow and develop into a normal baby?""  ""So?"" Ms. L shoots back.  ""So would you be for that?""  ""No. I wouldn't. Its my choice. If I didn't want the baby then that's it. The woman should get to choose what happens.""  Mr. C - ""Even once its out of her body?""  Ms. L - ""Look, you aren't going to change my mind about this. Its the women's choice.""       So I am sitting here in shock thinking... You could be so selfish as to say that not only are you unwilling to carry a child you created through pregnancy, but for whatever reason you should have the choice to say whether it lives or dies, when there is a possibility that it could live?     So, I pipe up and say, ""Too bad the baby doesn't have that choice."" (urg...Should I have kept my mouth shut?)  Ms. L kinda looks at me, shocked, because I usually don't say anything at all (believe it or not, I am rather quiet at work. - yeah, stop laughing, I really am!)Then she says, ""Well, yeah, because then they'd grow up in some orphanage or foster home or something like that.""  And I look at her incredulously and (see what's I'm on a role its hard to keep my mouth shut...I was so angry...) I say, ""Are you kidding? For a healthy newborn baby? There are waiting lists for those types of adoptions!""   She shrugs and looks the other way, and Ms. Parrot, another staff member who tends to repeat whatever is said by the last person, says, ""Yeah, its my uterus. Whoo hoo,"" with her fist raised half heartedly in the air. Thanks for the convincing argument.   Anyways it pretty much got quiet after that, and Ms. L got up a few minutes later and left. So I spent the rest of the day half feeling bad that I opened my mouth because I really like Ms. L and don't want her to think bad of me, and half angry at what she said.   (Hmm, I bet at this point everyone who reads this is going to say, "" she better not use my name on that post of hers!!!) Yeah, and don't worry. No one at my school has this address.   No wonder they say don't discuss politics...Its all fun and games until someone loses an eye...or pokes at someone's heart.  SO that's it. I am going to repost my conversation with commentary below,if you are interested. Man I sure get worked up about these things. Wink wink...   Mr. C says, ""Ok, I understand that your prochoice because the women has the right to choose what happens to her body. But let's say the medical technology existed that could take the fetus and hook it up to a machine so that it could continue to grow and develop into a normal baby?""    Could you imagine if this technology existed? How many people would just do it so they didn't have to carry the baby to term? I wonder if they could make some sort of law that stated that if you were going to use this procedure as a way to opt out of abortion, then you were immediately signing away parental rights. Wow. Then people could adopt fetuses and bond with their growing child. Ok way over the top here!     ""So?"" Ms. L shoots back.  ""So would you be for that?""  ""No. I wouldn't. Its my choice. If I didn't want the baby then that's it. The woman should get to choose what happens.""   Mr. C - ""Even once its out of her body?""  Ms. L - ""Look, you aren't going to change my mind about this. Its the women's choice.""       So I am sitting here in shock thinking... You could be so selfish as to say that not only are you unwilling to carry a child you created through pregnancy, but for whatever reason you should have the choice to say whether it lives or dies, when there is a possibility that it could live?     What ever happened to making the choice and taking the responsibility of having sex seriously? If you have sex, then you know that there is a risk of pregnancy. Shouldn't you be accountable for your actions? Don't you make the choice to potentially have a child when you choose to have sex? When I say I am prolife, I am talking about in cases of consentual sex. The lines blur somewhat in the case of rape, and also when the women's life is in danger.         One more thing. If you are so close minded that you refuse to listen to others points of view and comment rationally on them with your opinion, then why have the conversation? Its funny, she's always bagging on him for being close minded.    So, I pipe up and say, ""Too bad the baby doesn't have that choice."" (urg...Should I have kept my mouth shut?)  Ms. L kinda looks at me, shocked, because I usually don't say anything at all (believe it or not, I am rather quiet at work.)Then she says, ""Well, yeah, because then they'd grow up in some orphanage or foster home or something like that.""

There are waiting lists for those types of adoptions!""   Ok. Enough for now. I can see the angry emails pouring in. For those who made it this far, thanks for letting me speak my mind. For those that are angry, I completely understand, its a very passionate issue, and for those that are chuckling because I am making a big deal about the issue, well, hey...We all have something that stirs our hearts, right? I hope so."
SF6OWBR,female,25,"We spent all day clenuing and shopping and getting ready to finish the guest bedroom. I am so excited! It looks so awesome already, and we aren't even close to done! I can't wait to describe it to you, but that will have to wait until tomorrow...its a suprise for Mom and G-man, since they will be the first to use it when they come to visit tomorrow!  Belle is such a begger. She begs for food, even if she doesn't like it. The other night we made popcorn, and gave her some. She didn't like it, spit it out, and then begged for more.   Today the whole time I was working in the kitchen, she sat there lookin' all pretty just beggin' for some scraps! Cute puppy!"

FHARGL9,male,15,"Today's been a weird day, haha. It started off boring as usual, but around the afternoon, Nat called me! ^_^ OMG, she has such this sweet and wonderful voice that definently lives up to her moniker as the Sexed-Up Schoolgirl. We talked for exactly 1 hour, 20 minutes, and 19 seconds, which was a long phone call for me. XD  And that brings me to the suckiest part of today: Nat and I's argument with Marcelle. I told Mar that I was talking to Nat on the phone (hence my ""On The Phone"" status on MSN), and she asks ""Are you two having phone sex?"" I told Nat, and us three got into a major bitch fest. This seriously made me realize that Mar is a lying whore. I mean c'mon, she even TOLD ME that she was my whore, then denied it when Nat was in the conversation. And she said some mean-hearted, scornful comments to Nat. >_> All in all, I am so glad that I chose Colleen over Marcelle."
FHARGL9,male,15,"I don't know what is wrong with this site and my computer..haven't been able to create a new post in days. Well, whatever. ^^""  I *love* my new hair. Those pictures I posted at FC can't do justice to it.  It really looks that awesome. When I looked in the mirror, I for once actually liked seeing my reflection. I can tell I'm going to be a picture whore when I get my digital camera, hehe.   In unrelated news, my feelings for Sana have been lessening and my affection for Steph has been increasing, which is really, really good. I've recently started having dreams about Steph, so I know where my affection lies. ^^"""
FHARGL9,male,15,"I'm officially single ladies...and now you'll keep your legs closed from now on, then. >_>  Yup...Colleen broke up with me...seems like she only liked me as a friend..which was weird, because the day before she told me she was in love with me. I wish she had her feelings sorted out before telling  me she liked me. Oh well...another failed ""relationship."" I run through girls toooooo quickly. It's really sad. >_>  There's been some romance sparking between Stephanie and I. :O I really don't want to date anyone though...I'd rather just stay single and flirt with her. That would be better in the long run, and would prevent needless heartbreak.   And I've started liking Sana again for the last month or so...yea............................................................................ god help me. -_-"
FHARGL9,male,15,"I've been pretty depressed all day..for about three reasons. Let's see...  I am getting REAL depressed about my outer looks. I see nothing good looking about me, I really don't. I don't know if it's just normal teenage Linkin Park-esque angst, but I really do think I'm ugly. Nat and Mike's lil threeway about the subject didn't help much either. If I actually was good looking as they claim, girls wouldn't run away from me, laugh in my face, or flirt with me all school year out of sympathy.   Okay...I REALLY miss Ali...I have only been able to talk to her for a few minutes over the last two days..and I miss her so much. Of course I'm worried about her too...what with her illness and what happened to her a few nights ago. And I'm across the country, unable to be by her side. -_-  Thirdly, I must begin Summer school in a month or two. *major collective groan* And I must do Algebra..and if I don't pass it, I must repeat the ninth grade. >_> Not how I wish to spend Summer. Not only that, if Ali can indeed make it over here this Summer, I have no way of meeting up with her without telling my parents about her. ...they don't even like me talking to people on MSN or AIM, let alone meeting girls I met online who I might possibly have sex with. They'll kill me. X_X"
FHARGL9,male,15,"I think that I am becoming my best friend Natalie. I'm GROWING into her. XD Both my blonde moments and typos have been much more frequent than ever before, which is a sure danger sign. I believe I am developing *gasp* St.Louis Stenographic Syndrome, as Justin so eloquently put it. I fear for myself. O_________O"
FHARGL9,male,15,"Seems like things turned out all right after all. Colleen and I stayed up until about four in the morning talking (XD), and there was actually some serious talking going on. :O  Even though Sensui/Sesshomaru kept trying to persuade Colleen into thinking I'm a bad boyfriend by saying I abused Hikki, Nat, blah, blah, Colleen thankfully didn't listen to that jealous bastard. ^_^  It was kinda romantic, hehe. I made a topic in the Love House forum at ADG about how much I care for her..then she told me she loved me and wanted to be my girlfriend. I'm finally happy, hehe."
FHARGL9,male,15,"Below, is why I hate two of my oldest romantic interests.  Well, Sana faked being in a coma to see how much I'd care for her. Yeah...what a great friend. Not only that, she became a bitch about how DPKT is run, and suggested that she'd tell Invision about this board so it would be deleted. Yeah...and she became a bitch about the forums AFTER she cheated on her boyfriend with me. And on top of that...she's an immature, incompetent dumbass.  As for Hikari...gee, where to start? She got into a lustful relationship with me by telling me that she loved me when she really didn't, and kept begging me to screw her everytime she posted. When she got mad at me about anything, she pretended to be her friend Caitlin so she could cuss me out. When I figured out it was Hikki (which was easy, since the real Caitlin told me it was Hikki all along), both Hikki and Caitlin denied that anything had ever happened. I KNOW THAT I WAS GETTING BITCHED AT, KTHX. I'M NOT THAT STUPID. I really don't care if she ever talks to me, since she's on her, what, second boyfriend since I broke up with her. Yeah...love forever my ass."
FHARGL9,male,15,"""If you cyber with a girl while you're in an online relationship, then you're cheating.""  Is that right? >_>  Well, I suppose I cheated on Colleen if you ant to look at it that way. I was really horny, and Steph, who I used to have the hugest crush on, told me she wanted me. @_@  So yeah...I took the opportunity without thinking of the consequences (as usual) and did it...SOMEHOW Justin knew I had done it and he and Nat started arguing with me over whether it was cheating or not..and at one point Nat said that I was classless and was no good to women. And of course Mike had to say it again. Newsflash: HAVING MIKE SAY ANYTHING TO ME DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. >_>  So I'm just going to have to talk to Colleen and hope she doesn't hate my guts afterwards. >>  Also, I got to see a new picture of Sana. Oh my lord is that girl hot. Just....wow.   Anyways, yea. Summer school starts on Monday, as well. Reallllllly not a good weekend. -_-"
FHARGL9,male,15,"I'm not doing too well..Ali broke up with me...and she's yet to give me a reason why. She was fine yesterday..so what happened? I SWEAR I can't get a girl who won't hurt me....I just need to back away from relationships period. If I'm going to get into another one, I hope it's a long time from now..that's all I can hope for."
FHARGL9,male,15,"Wow, been so long since I've posted in this thing...crazy, hahahahaha. Well, since I'm bored, I may as well do a run down on my thoughts.  Ahh...school begins September 2nd. I dunno whether to be excited or downright nervous. I moved from such a small lil Christian private school (which started with only 3 students XD), all the way up to I think the biggest high school in my city. More than 1500 students. @_@ I'm going to dread having to go up to the board to solve a math equation I don't get, especially since I'll be looking like an idiot in front of so  many people. Gaaaaaaaaah. -_-  Let's see...Summerslam is coming from the Air Canada Centre (I think that's the arena) in Toronto, Canada, and is only a couple short weeks away. Yay. I'm looking forward to the Randy Orton - Chris Benoit match for Benoit's World title. I'm pretty sure Orton will come out on top and become the youngest World champion in the titles's illustrious history. :D  Hmm...things are going really, really well with me and Marcelle. We're in love, hehe. And our one month anniversary will be on August 18th. :O :O :O"
DWO9MYV,female,25,"Oh my goodness, I was totally in a car accident! I had Denyelle in the car and we were heading to the superstore for groceries during rushhour and some lady rear-ended me on Dundonald Street. Being so packed in, I hit the car ahead of me as well.     We were lucky there was an off-duty cop just around the corner who came and helped us move our cars and told us what information to have on hand. An officer showed up and wrote out the report.     Nobody was badly hurt and no air bags went off, thank goodness. My poor friend Denyelle has just finished recovering from injuries suffered at another car accident over a year ago, and so this immediately brought back her whiplash. I had some mild discomfort about an hour after the accident. We both wanted to get checked out right away so we sat at emergency for about three hours just to be told to take some Advil.     Both of my car bumpers are messed up now, hopefully there's nothing else that isn't immediately apparent. The lady that hit me was driving a Volvo, and surprisingly she took more damage than I did. My bumpers both shifted the force of the impact out to the sides, the ends jut out on each side now. On her car, the front light was all smashed out and her hood was pushed up considerably.     I've made the report to my insurance company, and they said the adjuster will be calling tomorrow. Hopefully this won't be a fiasco, I really don't need that right now."
DWO9MYV,female,25,"Jasmin is home for the night, it's nice to be a mom again. Even when she's arguing with me over the stupidest thing I'm glad to have her back. Lemme tell you some things about my Jazzy:      She prefers to be in sock feet, even when outdoors.     She likes fart jokes and Sponge Bob Squarepants.      I think she's a dog person, but gets along fine with cats too.  She will actually go to bed when she's tired of her own accord, something I'm not certain a lot of kids do.     She doesn't like strawberries, but likes my strawberry jam.   She got some treats today for being good at Gramma's this week. One of the things I got her was a pair of costume fairy wings; I snagged them at a yard sale for $1. She choose those wings over candy, clothes, and a comic book. She's been wearing them all afternoon; to the store, out for a bike ride. She wore them while we watched Peter Pan (great movie) and pretended she was Tinkerbell. LOL, she's definately my girl.

DWO9MYV,female,25,"It's starting to be pretty apparent now that stress is just as much a factor with my gastrointestinal distress as booze. Stress goes up, nausea ensues. I find this to be a problem at bedtime, which is when I do my best fretting and fussing. For some reason, I can only assume it's the lack of food or drink in my belly, I've also been waking nauseous up at 3AM.   To combat this I've pulled a musty, poorly-bound paperback copy of Moby Dick from my bookshelf and started reading myself to sleep by the light of my lava lamp. I've had the novel, and several others, in my possesion since high school. I was lucky to have the opportunity in grade 12 to take on a self-study advanced english class. I feel especially lucky to have the opportunity since my grade 10 and 11 english marks were not so great. Without naming names, I'll just say that the right or wrong teacher can make or break a class. There are teachers with no energy or passion to be in their profession anymore, no urge to actually teach anything, just counting the days to retirement. Those are the teachers we used to make cry. Anyway, back on track here. In my self-guided english class we were required to study two classic novels; one was our own choosing. At the end of the year the pile of novels still sat in a pile on top of a folding table pushed against a cinder-block wall. Being the miscreant that I was, I made off with several of the novels, a few Shakespearean plays, and two books of poetry. To this day I still feel that my action was more of a rescue than a theft.   I am so impressed with the imagery and mastery of words in just the first eight chapters of Moby Dick I felt I had to share my favorites.  ""..whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul.."" ""..and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.."" ""Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.""  Oh, and there is a reference to something called pea coffee which has me intriqued. I'll have to look that up."
DWO9MYV,female,25,"Reason 2944 why I love my town: free classic movies on Sunday nights. For those living in the Fredericton area, the city is showing classic movies every Sunday at 9PM on an outdoor screen near the officers' barracks/library.   On Sunday D and I saw ""The Italian Job"", 1969 version. It was pretty funny, and I loved the little cars they used in the chase scene. There was also a short independant film from a local film maker that was pretty amusing; ""Tie Your Laces"".  A word of advice to those who venture out: dress very warmly and bring blankets. I could have made use of some mittens as well."
DWO9MYV,female,25,"Well I was supposed to see some family yesterday but that's been postponed. My Aunt Judy is the youngest of my Dad's family, and a free-thinker. She's a vegetarian, home-schooling, baha'i free-spirited wonder-mom and I look up to her a lot. Unfortunately she's also kind of random and spontaneous so though we expected her to arrive early yesterday we still hadn't heard from her at 4PM.     If all goes well her family and mine will all be at the cottage tonight. I've offered to make some chinese food; veggie pot stickers, veggie spring rolls, and ma po tofu. I suppose if I have time I could get some green onions at the local vegetable stand and make some onion cake too. It will be nice to spend a few days at the cottage again, I expect to be back early Sunday with lots to reflect on.     Apparently in the time I've been out of the blogging world, the  urlLink Friday Five  has ceased to be. Luckily I found a  urlLink livejournal community for Friday Five enthusiasts . So here goes, I wish I had picked different questions!!     1) Do you remember your first kiss?       Yes, but it was anything but memorable.    2) How old were you when you had your first kiss?       I would guess about 12.    3) Where did your first kiss occur?       Just outside the junior high school (before they started calling them 'middle' school), after a dance.   4) Where do you think is the most romantic place to exchange a kiss? (locations, not body parts)       At the door, because you never know when a parting kiss may be the last memory you have of a person.   5) What type of kisser are you? (peck, smooch, French, sloppy, etc.)       Ok this is the one I didn't want to answer. I confess, I am a bad kisser. I never really learned the right way to kiss, and at present I avoid it when I can. I guess most times I try to get away with just a peck. And yes, I have seriously considered buying one of those 'how to kiss' booklets. I'm really more of a hands-on learner though, maybe I can find a tutor. *winks*"

DWO9MYV,female,25,"I had a date on Friday. It still feels funny to say that, haha. Amy's first date! LOL!  Okay so now I realise I have no idea what the rules of dating are. We met at a Saint Cinnamon downtown; there was live music there too so that was cool. I delicately picked at a cinnamon bun with a fork while he sipped on a coffee and we chatted about various topics. I think I did most of the talking, but then I don't think there would have been any conversation if I didn't. He seemed nice enough, and knew a few people that I also know, and he had a nice smile. On the downside he didn't seem to have an opinion about anything, or have any passions...maybe I just didn't find the right topic. Anyway it might be nice to catch a movie or some pool with him sometime.   Now here's my dilemna, what is supposed to occur at the end of a first date? Does the no kissing rule still apply? Should there be a handshake or something? I ended up just kinda staring at my feet for a minute and then turned on my heels and walked to my car. I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do? Anyway he's still talking to me so I couldn't have done THAT bad."
DWO9MYV,female,25,"Well it looks like tonight I have the choice between ""The General's Daughter"", or some COPS special. I think I'm going to watch my episodes of Chobits again, thank you Bittorrent!  So I already don't shop at WalMart, now I'm going to stop giving my money to Tim Hortons. My story starts with the fact that I'm broke, and when I say broke I mean I've even spent my overdraft! So with half a tank of gas and NO money in my pocket I take Jasmin to Tim Hortons. I don't drink coffee myself but I have a lot of friends and coworkers that do; during the ""roll up the rim"" contest they gave Jasmin several winning rims for free cookies and donuts. Jasmin happened to find one of the winning rim pieces today and REALLY wanted a donut. So I take her into town and we go inside, I was sure she was going to pick double-chocolate but instead she decided on the vanilla dip with sprinkles. Smiling, I held up the little torn piece of coffee cup and asked for my free donut.  Cashier: ""I'm sorry, we only take those during the contest"".  Me: ""But there's no expiry date mentioned here"" Cashier: ""It's written on the contest cups"" At which point I had to turn around to my eight-year-old daughter and tell her she wasn't able to get the donut after all and we had to go home now. I can't beleive that, I could understand if I tried to cash in a coupon that was three years old, but not this. I never liked that contest anyway, always thought it probably had worse odds than the lottery."
DWO9MYV,female,25,"Here I am, just finished a weeks vacation, and I'm taking a sick day. Am I going to get passive-aggressive guilt trips at work tomorrow? Definately.   So the barbeque at J's house was fun, but he was overly generous in the wine he offered me. I'm going to be talking to my doctor about this, but it seems that if I have more than two drinks I end up nauseous for several days afterwards. I'm sure that can't be a good thing, please don't let it be my kidney.  I only have one kidney, though by now it's increased in size enough that I can hold my water as well as anyone. Despite being born well past my due date, my right kidney had never properly formed. At five my kidney became infected and had to be removed. Then at six I had another operation to adjust a tube in my bladder to ensure proper drainage. The second operation was much harder on me than the first and apparently I spent several days in the ICU, but I remember nothing of it. My childhood was plaqued with continous urinary infections and I was told I should not swim in chlorine-treated water, a harsh sentence to take when you're ten. But here I am now, healthy as anything for the most part and doing my best to take care of my precious remaining kidney. Without it I would be subject to dialysis machines for hours at a time, several days a week.  Oh and for my readers from Freddy Beach, I've heard there is a free yoga class Monday evenings at the lighthouse on the green. Sorry, I haven't heard what time it is held."
C8NHIYD,male,23,This is  urlLink simply amazing .  This report not only states no WMDs but also no formal connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq.  What did we go to war for?  Was it that Sadaam was just a bad guy?  That's basically all the Bush Administration has.  Problem is there are tons of bad guys in the world!  Republicans call Clinton dishonest.  What the hell is this!?  What an embarrassment this war and administration has been.

C8NHIYD,male,23,"urlLink   Did anyone see the news conference with Bush?  It was embarrasing.  He was asked at least three times in one form or another if he made any mistakes, and not once did he admit anything in the slightest that he did wrong.  At one point the president was completely, (and  I seriously mean completely), stumped.  He could not think of the biggest mistake his administration made when he was asked.  I know people in office don't like to admit when they are wrong but we are talking about serious issues, issues that need to be fixed or else more people may die.  Clinton was blasted for not fessing up to the whole Monica ordeal.  Why isn't that same quest for admitting mistakes not taken by the Republicans that bombasted Clinton?  It seems like a double standard.    Bush stumbled for about a minute saying how the reporter caught him off gaurd and how he probably wasn't as alert as he should be.  Alert?  Sharp?  Isn't that what a leader is supposed to be?  It seemed as though anything but the talking points was a real struggle for him.

C8NHIYD,male,23,"Well tonight was fun but sad. It was the last time we would all go out for our traditional weekly bowling. Alas I have to move next week and this is a tradition I will sorely miss. The night was great fun. Bill had some incredible rounds but the rest of us were pretty mediocre. I managed to get an unreal number of 9s which was kind of frustrating but I think I am starting to get a feel for form even though I haven't mastered it. We went for ice cream afterwards at Cold Stone which was really great.  I must admit it was a bit nostalgic to think of all the memories and people in that bowling alley. So many people: Cephalot, Tree Trunks, Sweaty Randy, Helen, Pimp, Bubba, Bowling Girl, McVeigh. I'm sure I'm missing some too!  Now I'm sure there will be lots of bowling alleys but there will not be any quite like the Nampa Bowl and surely there will never be as cool a bowling group as Mike, Cassie, Bill, and Sarah. I can only hope that we will meet up some day and all bowl together again. I'm thinking if they visit, we can get together some weekends and bowl.  Moving is bittersweet because you have to give up the things you are familiar with and enjoy. The sweet part is that I have a bunch of really great friends that I have shared great memories with and will continue to do so forever. So, for at least a while, this is Slashmaster signing out."

It is known to be somewhat more westernized, but i didn't notice how exactly; in that sense it was not very different from Crouching Tiger, except it was somewhat more stylish and post-modern. The main difference is that the plot and the message were a lot more clear. The message was very political and pragmatic, applicable in the political situation of today, although i don't know how exactly. Recommended."

XSS647U,male,17,"D-Day looms near and I haven't got anything in order.  That's a typical scene on a typical Sunday, though. Well, something happened out of the blue today - I conducted a 40-person survey for the first time in my life.  STOP! You can keep the medal for yourself, thank you very much. It was no great feat. But the start was incredibly difficult. Imagine people just walking past you, thinking that every step you take towards them your aura will pull them towards the Dark Side...   Of course excuses start flooding with their saliva in their mouths. ""Busy..."" some mutter from the corner of their lips. Some just smile and say ""Thanks"" when they should have taken the form and giving me the chance to reply. But most prefer to blend into the crowd, knowing that they have absolutely no chance of lowering their conspicuity whatsoever.  Doing surveys at fast-food restaurants is a great idea (of course, if you are lucky enough not to get chased out for doing the same to their customers). Firstly, those people can't possibly run away since they are either waiting for or enjoying their meal.  Secondly, the air conditioner in the restaurant seem to keep the temperature - and their tempers - cool so they don't spit and shout at the poor survey conductor. Believe me, scenarios like the abovementioned become much more common at food centres where the fans are negligible and cigarette smoke gives people adrenaline rushes.  So, I managed to complete the survey drool-free. Then I proceeded to Ling Yi's house, where Hun Ning and I did some pre-class preparations for Sci-Fi and Fantasy elective.  Yeah, you guessed it. We watched Star Wars Episode V and VI. Han Solo is the man, and C-3PO... should be murdered. Then again, droids are usually irritating."

With green lines of course.  So it's an incredible 18/50 for my essay, which, compared to my Economics essay, is heaven on earth. Try getting 11.  Economics is an intriguing subject, a subject no matter how much I try to dabble in I never seem to be able to get my desired (or even less than desired) mark.

And he doesn't need powerful vocals to express himself.  Back to my life. Someone said today that my blog is too confusing to read. In fact, almost literary. I apologise for that too, but it is my style and I like the way I'm handling this blog, though it's boring since I have only text, text and more text to show.   I won't forget the last time I had slight depression, and I don't think I will ever hit that level of emotion again, but lately stuff hasn't been going my way and it is unfortunate to know that most of it has been my fault.

XSS647U,male,17,"I should have predicted it would happen.   This morning was a long one. It wasn't just the 5km jog, nor the 1st lap of the 6km walk that I walked and decided to give up halfway because it just wasn't realistic - I said something that I shouldn't have, but was something that I had realised that could happen.   Well, Ms Wong gave me the scolding I deserved. But being the idiot that can't seem to open or close his mouth at the right time, I just couldn't open my mouth to apologise.   This teacher is no ordinary teacher. She has brought me through four years of Scouting, given me lessons that I will never forget in my life.   But it seems that if there was one lesson she hadn't given me, it was for talking without thinking.   I rarely spoke to give my opinion during meetings last year, but it was probably a good decision - I'd never make good in ANY useful meeting anyway.   How could I have spoken of our batch this way? What right do I have to declare that there is a segregation between President's Scout Award candidates and non-PSA? How could I have even dreamed that the batch would sneer at us?   Am I even suitable to take up this responsibility? Do I even have the right to represent the unit to become a candidate?   How can a guy that has a phobia of swimming even think of landing it as a PSA holder?   I have been too immature, too naive to think that I could ever make it.   It has always been my dream, of course, and I will continue to pursue it - but I pray my mouth -and I - can start growing up for a change."
XSS647U,male,17,"Actually, it's not the head that has caused any pain. You know what I am talking about.  The June holidays have just slipped away like how good things usually go, but HAVE June holidays been good, now? I've been besieged by some crazy fools who prefer to believe in fantasy and trust their hearts instead of their heads.   Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I shouldn't be able to pass my Economics JCT. Dearest Maggie had told the cohort that those that attempted the question on prices - the topic which she only gave out the lecture notes AFTER the test, what a pleasant woman - would have failed, and flunked with magnitude at that.  Rrrrrrright. Yes, headaches."
XSS647U,male,17,"What a day spent.  1220 hrs: Went to TJ to meet the others for PW. 1300 hrs: Qingyu, Shi Song and I head for Bugis. 1330 hrs: Shi Song has lunch at BK. 1445 hrs: We head to Jalan Besar Stadium for the tea session with Assoc. Prof Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, and also the President of the FAS. 1515 hrs: We shake hands with Chan King Fook, chairman of the S-League. 1525 hrs: A/P Ho arrives and shakes hands with us. He beckons us to sit down with him for the monthly tea session. We discover that there are two other groups from HCJC doing their PW. 1715 hrs: The tea session with A/P Ho ends. We are enlightened. 1725 hrs: A/P Ho leaves us with A/P John Koh, general secretary of the FAS, and we hold an interview with him. 1800 hrs: All questions answered and our doubts clarified, A/P John Koh passes the groups with a copy of the report on Singapore football. 1830 hrs: ""Hey, is Fandi coming?"" asked A/P Koh on whether the coach of the youth team - and also the legend - would be coming for training. 1915 hrs: Reached home."
XSS647U,male,17,"Imagine skipping school to do project work.     I did exactly that and I must admit it left me pondering what good it did.     You see, our group is admittedly the busiest group, with each person having personal external commitments that can force us to our limits sometimes.     Especially when your group can only meet up once in the most important month of project work - report writing - and you haven't sorted out those surveys and evaluations yet.     PW is terrible. The work of the devil.     Maybe not that bad, but it's pretty much like the inverse of a light-year away.     Then again, the day wasn't that badly spent. In fact I must say that we were more productive than we were the past few meetings (possibly because everyone was actually present).     Try to picture this: tomorrow we go to school and we explain our absence by saying that we did project work because we cannot find a suitable day to meet. And Ms Lee accepts it.     I just can't picture that.     I predict that the dormant volcano will do some sneezing tomorrow. And it's not just flu. It's full-fledged lava-pneumonia.     Let's hope I live to update this blog the next day.  And the next."

XSS647U,male,17,"Like the late founder of Scouting, Lord Baden-Powell did, I am now writing a letter to the world just in case anything happens. It's not really pessimism - I think there have been so many people in my life that I have met and made a difference and I believe that it is time for them to stand out and be recognised.  Firstly, to the part I've been living in - Singapore has been a wonderful home. Yes, ERP, fines and whatnot, but hey, no catastrophes, no war - I'm well-fed, and I'm happy. Thank you so much for giving me the chance to grow and be a part of the culture here.  Then, a tribute to my parents - it's been seventeen years of utterly brilliant education, and most part from your patient teaching. Dad, the canings still hurt, but they will constantly remind me of what I should strive for and what I shouldn't. Mum, you may be 44, but every day I see you I know that my Dad has great taste. To date you are still beautiful to us and your cooking is fantastic as ever.  To my late grandfather - your disease didn't allow you to have a clear mind when you went, and I always blame myself why I did not give you the respect you deserved before you died. Before his struggle with Alzheimer's, he was a tenacious man who married a prominent member of one of the clans in Hainan. Wherever you are now, I hope you will forgive me.  To my primary school teachers - you raised a child who was deemed 'smart' but had 'much room for improvement', and probably you should have added 'incorrigible attitude problem' beside those remarks too. Thank you for all the guidance even when at times those advice you gave seemed negligible, especially Mrs. Ang B.L. and Mr. Michael Lim.  To my primary school friends - I express my warmest heartfelt gratitude to several classmates who have had to withstand my temper and bad behaviour, some for as long as six years. Leonard - who is still in contact with me - was my best friend in primary school and is still one of my closest buddies.  To all who have been mentoring me in Scouting in one way or another - I apologise for giving up on my pursuit for the Chief Commissioner's Award, and I know I wouldn't want to slip up on my last chance now. Ms Wong, you have been amazing in being the compass North in my life.  To my ex-classmates in 1E/2E/3J and 4J - how are all of you doing? It's been a long time since we had a class gathering. My fault that I didn't organise one earlier. It is impossible to name everyone since every single person has made an impact in my life, and not just the most vocal one (yes, Yuan Qing...)  To my current classmates in CG 12/04 in Temasek Junior College - live on and live your lives with passion, purpose and drive. Ms Lee, to be frank, I did not really enjoy your classes during the first three months of JC, but I have slowly grew accustomed and I have grown to respect and like you. You are a good civics tutor and you will thrive in teaching as long as they permit you to stay so.  Mr Chin, thanks for the snooker club and all the enjoyment that we had spending our spare time (and sometimes not) in it.  It may be too little for a letter, so at this point I pray you will forgive my anxiety to complete this; I just want to dedicate this to all who have helped me, and that I am sorry for not including their names in this letter.  TAN WAH CHEN OWEN Signing off (for now) 12.04am, Aug 03 2004"

During the production I met many interesting people as well as known and unknown actors. One of these unknown actors was a little boy  from Marietta, GA named Dan Byrd.  ""Danny boy"", as I used to call him, played the lead role for the movie and proved to have great acting skills. He also possessed a such a sweet and very humble spirit. I saw him last at the premiere of ""The First of May"" back in 1998. In the years that followed, I heard that he had moved to LA and landed a recurring role in the TV show ""Any Day Now"". I was so happy for him.  But you can imagine my surprise  when I searched for him on IMDB.com and learned that he was making a movie with Hilary Duff! This past Friday I had the opportunity to watch him again in ""A Cinderella Story""...I almost cried...he's  too cute! I know it might sound silly but I grew so fond of him when we worked together in 1997 and I always knew inside of me that he had what it takes to be in Hollywood movies.

The girls had previously made an appearance as the beloved Shrek characters at High Spring's historic Priest Theatre and were then asked by the owner to come back to the next showing of Shrek 2. The girls did, but were almost attacked by a hyperactive blonde little girl (who kept pulling on Gingy's gum drop buttons, lifting up Fiona's skirt and asking Shrek where did he leave Donkey at).

OHU04IN,male,26,"**DISCLAIMER**  This post will include a few ""bad"" or ""dirty"" words.  Being a lover of the English language, I find it sad that we judge words on an individual basis, believe me, a writer worth his salt can offend and be vulgar and foul without ever touching the five or six ""bad, dirty"" words.  But anyway, I thought I should prepare you, so when you get to the bad part, just close your eyes while you get to the bad words. See how easy it is. The alternative is to censor my post, and rob it of its meaning and leave what I have to say pointless and asinine. With that in mind, read on o impressionable ones, read on.  I had a thought today on my way home from seeing the movie ""Dodgeball.""  The show was a hoot, kinda boring story line, but fun in that multi-level mockery sort of way.  Anyway, the idea that came to me was this, now bare with me, it relates to an aspect of baseball.  Every interaction you have with another person in this life is a game of catch.  Be it as simple as the simple toss, catch, toss of saying ""hello"" in the morning to a stranger; or the more involved game played with your boss and co-workers.  The right game of catch can last forever, and you will always be learning more about the person you are chucking the ball with.  Some folks like to throw like they are Nolan Ryan, closing a perfect game, a lot of fastballs and change-ups, with the occasional curve to keep the batter guessing.  Other folks like the soft game of catch like two friends at the end of the day tossing the ball back and forth, good throw for good throw.  Sometimes you find the odd relationship that reflects the father/son game of catch: one patient person throwing slow for another person who is, in all actualy a really shitty throw.  Now, if you have been playing catch for a while and you are still a shitty throw, you had better go find another shitty throw to play with, because a father plays catch with his son to teach him to throw better.  If the son never catches on, the games of catch will end.  Additionally, prolonged games of catch teach you how your buddy likes to throw the ball, and how he likes the ball thrown.  This usually comes about because of communication between the two folks tossing the ball back and forth.  If you are playing catch with a Nolan Ryan type and he keeps throwing the heat, but you don't like it, speak up, perhaps your buddy will calm down his throw.  If you are tossing the ball with a really shitty throw, provide pointers on how to throw better.  It is only through discussion and watching how the other person throws that you will ever improve your games of catch.  But ultimately you must at some point discover how you throw and what you like to catch.  But don't over think it.  You need to remember that line from ""The Rookie""  When Morris walks into the locker room and says to Brooks, ""You know what we get to do today Brooksie?  We get to play baseball.""  after all, it really is just a game of catch.  This has been Fenris the Poet, saying to you, Find truth in what you already have, because you won't find it in something you haven't got."
OHU04IN,male,26,"Well, I just read a little Email from a good friend of mine.  turns out Terry Goodkind is putting out another three books in the Sword of Truth series.   I nearly filled my shorts with poo.  then I read another Email from the same friend.  June 6th will see Stephen King's Song of Susanah out on the market.  Then I was sure of it, I needed to change my shorts.  Now that I have showered and dressed in fresh clothing, well...  I guess the wait for Goodkind will not be all that hard for me.  News that my two favorite series will be concluding.  I am excited.  not dissapointed, no.  unlike the ignorant, who still read the series that features characters that the author himself isn't sure of their purpose in the story, (lil Bobby Jordan's Wheel of Time, God help it stop spinning!)  Both Goodkind and King seem to actualy have a concept of what it is like to limit the number of characters that get involved in the story.  Before I go off too much, I must say this, I am very excited to read the conclusion to the Dark Tower, which will be out before the end of the year, It will be a great year for those who read."

Dear Mr. Howard,  I wish to write you Expressions of awe and  Ameturish admiration drip  From my mouth the words run  Too much separates you and I Forty one years from your death To my birth divide us Miles from Cross Plains Texas Too far to drive in a day  Mr. Howard, I wish you still wrote Yelling and beating words like forged iron From your Underwood came vibrant worlds   “By this axe I rule!” echoing in the night As Kull became king  Heroes walked tall in strange places  Hyboria was a living land to me  Countless others walked your worlds as well We still walk there and miss the creator-god Mr. Howard I see you working in the midst  Of the oil boom that made and nearly broke  Small town Texas where you grew and lived  You were a huge and strong man Paying attention to the physical as well As feeding your mind on the words of adventure Lovecraft, Doyle, London, Twain, Rohmer, Mundy,  Lamb, Haggard, Kipling, Scott, Bierce, Poe Their words and worlds aided you  You held your own in the ring prizefighter Toed the line with the worst Texas had to show Admire the strong defiant ones I wish to shake your hand as I stand over your grave I hate Hollywood’s murder of the mighty Conan Would you recognize the Cimmerian The barbarian they made of the King of Aqulionia  For a dozen years your fountain flowed Outward to the “pulps” While you were so much more Born to a world too old for you A notably noble savage forced  Into civilization barely  Wanting this life  Gifting it to your mother Whom you cared for  cried for  died for  Mr. Howard, did you speak aloud the note  Those final words you quote The Underwood a tombstone Keys caressed and  Pounded by your fingers no more  “All fled, all done  So lift me on the pyre. The feast is over  And the lamps expire.”  Did the paper rustle in the wind As you walked out to the car With the borrowed .380  Mr. Howard, what crossed your mind  As you placed the cold steel to your head  Did you enter the Grey Lands Did Crom weigh your soul  At the end of your eight hours dieing?  “Robert Ervin Howard (1906-1936) ranks among the greatest writers of action and adventure stories. The creator of Conan the Cimmerian, Kull of Atlantis, Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, ‘El Borak,’ Sailor Steve Costigan and many other memorable characters, Howard,… in a career that spanned barely 12 years, wrote well over a hundred stories for the pulp magazines of his day. While he is widely regarded as the ‘father of Sword and Sorcery’ and the creator of Conan the Barbarian, this reputation has been something of a double-edged sword. It has helped keep his work in the public eye for six decades since his death, but it has also obscured the astonishing breadth of his imagination, his talent for mastering a variety of genres and his ability to weave his magic in both prose and poetry.”  BENT.  *the first quote is the last thing Robert E. Howard wrote, left in his typewriter.     The second quote comes from a biography of Howard written by Rusty Burke.  More can be found at: http://www.rehupa.com ."
OHU04IN,male,26,"Check this out, I got this from my friend Anthonie, I have already shared my two cents with Pizza Hut.  If you believe in the second ammendment to the United States Constitution I encourage you to speak up as well.  ""Screw Pizza Hut"" June 1, 2004  “Ronald B. Honeycutt, 38, who has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, says he's been delivering pizzas for 20 years and has always packed heat on the job,” reports WorldNetDaily.com (http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38726) today. At around 11 p.m. on May 17th, just after he had made a delivery in a high-crime neighborhood in Indianapolis, a dirtball confronted Honeycutt with a loaded 9 mm handgun. At that point, Honeycutt pulled out his own 9 mm from the back of his pants and fired 15 times, hitting the would-be robber at least 10 times, killing him.  Sounds like pretty good gun “control” to us. And dare we say, an awfully effective “deterrent.  Anyway, Honeycutt went back to his Pizza Hut store and called the cops. The cops have since determined that Honeycutt acted in self-defense and will not face criminal charges. Nevertheless  Pizza Hut fired him.  For violating a company policy against carrying firearms.  BRUSHFIRE ALERT: Now, let’s be honest here. Pizza Hut, as a private business, has the right to make such a rule and enforce it.  On the other hand, WE have the right to voice our objections to such a stupid rule and refuse to do business with them unless and until they change it.  And if you’d like to voice YOUR opinion about how Mr. Honeycutt was treated, you can call the Pizza Hut corporate office at 1-972-7700 or give them a “pizza” your mind by emailing them through their website at http://www.pizzahut.com/contact/feedback_other.asp  You can also quickly and easily locate the Pizza Hut franchise store near you - along with their phone number - by going to: http://www.pizzahut.com/locator/.  I just called the store in my neighborhood and spoke with the manager. I explained that my family would no longer be dining in her restaurant and why. The woman’s response was, “You should call the corporate office. That incident in Indiana has nothing to do with us.” To which I responded, “Well, it does now. ‘Cause you just lost a customer over it. Maybe YOU should call the corporate office.  Something tells me she will...  Chuck Muth President Citizen Outreach www.citizenoutreach.com  Like I said, I am just reprinting an email forwarded to me.

OHU04IN,male,26,"well, here I am just a few minutes later, I decided that I should post another poem.  This one goes with my heart felt thanks to Weis and Hickman for Dragonlance, and most especialy Sturm Brightblade, yeah, I know they will never read this.  I don't care.  I am sharing, because I want to.  Any way, here it goes...  Paperback Knight  You’d never know I live two lives, One out here and one in books. When I read, I move  Into a world of knights and swords, Armor and honor. With my own invented history.  “My Honor is my Life.”  Ranks of knights form and chant, Swords held at salute. Steel glows in the morning sun. The blade I hold was my father’s. I belong to him, much as the sword did. The sword his tool in life, I’m his tool in death.  “Est Sularus oth Mithas.”  The line of my family reaches long. Into the past our house extends,  Many knights of the Crown,  A few of the Kingfisher, And less of the Rose.  “My Honor is my Life.”  I mutter this oath to a pretend God.  This fictious code of false knights. Words in a language existing only in a book. The unreal world this way of life comes from Ends when I press the halves of a ragged paperback together.  “Est Sularus oth Mithas.”  Imagination fades, The book slides into my backpack. These knights slip from my mind.  Their wars and vengeance fade, But I am left with the oath. This code of life in a world I pretend to know.  “My Honor is my Life.” bent.     If you havn't read Dragonlance Cronicles, pull your head out and get to it."
OHU04IN,male,26,"Well folken, here I find myself, reading information on the internet about meeting people.  I figure what the hell, I was honest in my add, maybe everyone else will be too.  If not then it will be a real gas seeing what kind of responses I get.  Any way, there is a certain book that I have been reading that I felt I should share with you all.  The title is  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  It was lent to me by some of my best friends.  Hey, they let me play with their kids, how cool is that?  Any way, the book provokes thought by presenting new ways to think and some really amazing description to go with the deep thoughts.  I think I am a hundred pages or so into it, and rapidly going nowhere, but not due to disinterest, mostly due to vast and almost overwhelming absorption.  It has drawn me in.  I am reading five other books at the same time just to keep from withdrawing into the book.  All in all, I really just want to say thanks to David and Jody (hope I spelled your name right) I love you guys, thanks for your friendship.  And thanks to all the rest of you out there that stick with me in the crazy times as well as the sane.  The Sandman reminded me of what friendship is worth and what it really means.  So you all get a virtual dugonut as soon as I learn how to attach them to emails.  Be cool, be smart, and if you hear a howl, it's just me."
OHU04IN,male,26,Been a while since I shared a little ill conceived poetry with you all.  This is called   autobiographical   Look ye and behold  The twinning beast  None like it in this world   Two halves wound round one soul  A creature of anger and honor  A child of fear   In juxtaposed heart  Emotion encased in logic  Encased in feeling   Fire captivates it  Burning in blind eyes  With deep fear of flame   A creature divided  Wanting to consume  Fearing the consumption   A diabolical paradox  Hungry wolf  Or naught but man   Fenris
OHU04IN,male,26,"And in other news, Fenris the poet has written yet another offering of poor poetic skill and lackluster verse to sate your thirst for wanton sillyness and tom-foolery with this bit of fluf called ""Can't Help  Hating You Now""  enjoy...   At the end I wish I still loved you I wish my feelings  Would last a little longer Than that song we both liked I wish it had been forever I wish I held you in my heart  Close to what is important  I wish that you were important I wish that you were important to me I wish feeling would last I wish hunger would last I wish we could last I wish For so many things to come to you I wish I wanted you I wish I needed you like you don’t need me I wish I could feel a part of you in my soul I wish I could feel me in you Not for sex Not for lust But truly for the reaching  Stretching for a bigger soul I wish I smelled you when I wake I wish I heard you in my house But the delicate plant that we grew Between us is dead from neglect Not long ago it passed into death Here at the end I wish that I held you Not for me Not for you I wish for the sake of holding I wish for the sake of loving  I wish for the return I wish for feeling I wish for … I wish                                   Bent."
OHU04IN,male,26,"Well now, this being an election year and all, I was thinking, why not start my own political party?  No, I don't want to run for president or anything like that, nor do I want to back anyone else, I just want to draw together some like minded folks so we can have a rally, wave the flag around and give out keychains with our names on them.  See, my folks got realy involved in politics since my dad retired.  They have been telling me to register to vote, and I will.  I believe that if you don't participate, you have no right to complain.  but anyway, back to the party idea.  I want to call it the ""Codependant"" party, you see, we have the Republicans who want to give aid to big buisness so that big buisness can give us, the citizens, reitrements and health insurance and what not, then you have the Deomcrats who don't think the average human being is capable of providing anything for its self and want to institute government programs wo hold everyones hands while they piss.  You have the American Communist party, well, the only place that communism has realy caught on is China, but they are culturaly disposed to it already.  Or Cuba, which, I honeslty look at as a dictatorship, because Castro Runs The Country!  then you have your independant party, they beileve in voting for candidates that will not win any big elections and probably never go anywhere.  throw in a couple dozen other fringe parties and you have the American Political system, according to my understanding anyway.  So I want to start the Codependant Party.  No, no codependant will ever run for office, because we are not good enough or capable enough to pull it off.  We know that government, regardless of Party will screw us in the end.  But hey, we deserve it.  we obviously did something wrong and need to be punished for it, and if we ever kick government out, it will come back all broken hearted and contrite.  It might even bring us flowers!  then we will take it back, eventualy we will do something that will deserve abuse again, and the cycle will star all over again.  But that is all beside the point, I just want to have a Political Rally!  wouldn't that be fun?  Or putting up signs with names on them on your lawn?  when the city council candidates are named Smith and Jones, you put up a sign that says Vote Murphy for city council.  anyway, for now that is as political as I intend to get.  If you think I am expressing a deep seated resentment for our government, I am NOT.  I love it here, I would never live in any other country.  Hell, I'll probably never visit another country.  I just feel that Government steps on peoples toes, but it hasn't tromped on all our toes all at once, unlike some other institutions.  anyway, enough said by me.  watch this spot for more bad poetry.  And remeber, Fenris loves you baby!"
OHU04IN,male,26,"When a dream dies, we find ourselves watching a sad, horrid, final process.  Dreams usualy die when they starve from lack of hope, sometimes they are smothered between slices of reality.  But the most truly saddening is when we must take that dream and kill it ourselves.  When we find ourselves repeating cliches to asuage our guilt at the murder we just preformed... I have recently driven a final stake through the heart of a longtime dream.  When you find yourself killing things that you had held close to the heart, well, you feel as though you've become the ultimate betrayer.  So be it.  The truth is, the cuts scar over, the heart mends and you go on.  But in some instances the future holds nothing of the dream you had, and ghost-like afterimages and half measures to keep out the bitter winds, are better left out.  So it is with this dream, I can not have staked so much of myself, so much of what I am on what turned out to be a pipe-dream.  So, in retrospect, promises of continued friendship where lies.  The chance of holding on to a sad ghost of what I once felt will not be good or healthy.  So at this juncture, the Wolf (that's me) will grin and cry to the moon one last time as she takes her path and he takes his.    Why the Lone Wolf Calls  I walk the bluing world As the sun slides  Below the jagged rim of Earth All stretches into shadow Blue and black Shadow on shadow on shadow  Inches Yet miles deep As Earth’s eye closes  In twilight sleep My mistress climbs  The even-sky  Her form is full And purest white Above jagged peaks  My cry to her  Ripped from my throat It echoes   I alone Hunt To offer my mistress Sustenance in sacrifice  Crying for her Join me love Join me 		Fenris  The fable I've constructed here has an end, though few will like it.  The moon can not condecend to meet the wolf, and no matter how high our dear wolf climbs he shall never meet the moon.  And so the wolf will cease to cry for his moon.  The dream he held has been killed, and blood drips from the wolf's fangs.  For the truth is seldom pretty and real life is naught but pain.  But the wolf will run and he will cry out in anger and in fear and with pain, but never to the moon again, never. Well friends, this has been Fenris the Poet coming to you all with truth in fiction, feelings in prose and honesty in poetry. This is for the moon and all she represents."
RI0870P,female,27,"I think I might be a psychological hypochondraic.  I always seem to be looking for some kind of mental abnormality in myself, and have diagnosed myself with several neurotic problems that no one else seems to think I have.  I suppose it's a good thing, seeing how ready the average psychologist is to prescribe medications that are supposed to make you happy and worry free and otherwise totally blissfull, but it is a little disturbing to realize that the things you think are in your head are, well, all in your head (not to mention it makes for some damnable circular logic).  I think that I can trace pretty easily where my neurosis about finding neuroses comes from.  One reason is that my entire family except for myself has been on some sort of depression or anxiety medication for years.  When I was in fourth grade my teacher recommended I go to a psychologist because, apparently, I wasn't ""living up to my potential"".  The child psychologist, an awesome high-school drop-out who taught me the  urlLink rubber pencil trick , said that I was perfectly normal, if a little high-strung, and it was the rest of my family who was in need of therapy.  Being the Unmedicated One might be something to be proud of, but it also means that I'm constantly looking over my shoulder for the monster in the closet that will turn me into a drooling lithium addict.  Another reason I am convinced there must be something wrong with me is because of my not-so-mild geekieness.  Of course I have a sense of separation from the rest of society. I read  urlLink comic books , watch pathetic amounts of  urlLink Fawlty Towers , and have never, not once, wanted to meet my co-workers at TGI Friday's for happy hour (though on some maudlin nights I can be seen sipping a Mudslide while I'm reading my comic books).  Because the rest of the world is supposed to be ""normal,""  that must mean that I'm ""abnormal.""  But tell me what is normal about subjecting yourself to burned mozzarella sticks and a bunch of white people chanting ""Whoomp, de it is!""  But probably the biggest reason I persist in combing my own mental landscape for abnormalities is because I want to be a genius.  I want to be the person that everybody thinks is on some magnificent, higher plane than anybody else.  But, as everyone knows, it is often the geniuses  urlLink who suffer most ."
RI0870P,female,27,"After reading  urlLink this post , I started thinking about my own strange relationship with death.  My aunt and grandmother both died several thousands of miles away from me, and I never went to their funerals.  Though I was sad that I would never see them again, I honestly didn’t know them very well.  I still have vivid memories of summers spent at their houses, and that has always been enough.  For me, they were people close to my father, and most of the pain I felt from their deaths was seeing him so heartbroken.    When an acquaintance from high school committed suicide, at first I felt an overwhelming shock.  There is something desperate and broken about the idea of an eighteen-year-old boy ending his own life.  But on a more personal level, it was again an empathic sort of grief.  He had been very close to one of my best friends, and I felt that I was only sharing something that really belonged to her.  I could let it go at will, detach myself from it as being a horrible event in someone else’s life.  I think that the first time I really understood grief, the time it was so gigantic and overwhelming that I felt I couldn’t control when it came or went, I couldn’t—and still can’t—even see a way around it, was last summer when my husband and I watched his father die of cancer.    When we first got to Madison, he was still very much the same person.  Obsessively selfless, determined, dryly witty.  Although he was sick, he still worried about being the good host.  He even threw one of his famous backyard picnics, where there was too much beer, too much food and all of the children were so high on sugar they couldn’t remember how to walk.  He made a speech, thanking the caregivers of his elderly mother, and I know for certain it was the speech that made people cry, not the fact that he was so obviously ill.    But it  was  obvious.  He was in pain.  He was tired.  For hours at a time, the light in his eyes would grow dim and vague.  He wouldn’t be ready with a joke, he would just have to sit there concentrating on breathing.  I don’t remember how long it was we stayed.  It didn’t really matter.  Our only purpose was to try and make things easier.  In truth, we were probably trying to make the things that were happening not happen.  Even when the hospice people arrived--and this must have been a week or so before his death--we were still discussing ways that we could help him get better.  They knew they were there just to make him as comfortable as possible in the last days of his life.  We were still fighting our own battle against facing this horrible, inevitable thing.  We saw our hope dwindle until it turned on us into a fierce desperation, and then, finally, we began the completely unmanageable task of acceptance.  And I found out that accepting death, when it is right there in front of you, is like trying to eat the universe.  It is completely impossible and yet you can’t ignore it, because it is everywhere.  I still watch my husband struggling with it, and I know there are whole days that are lost to him,  because he is staring at the world through this immeasurable haze.  A year later, my own grief is like a giant monster in a closet.  Whenever it’s let out it seems terrible and uncontrollable, but eventually it goes skulking back to where it lives and closes the door.  I know that as the years go by, it will get smaller.  Maybe someday it will disappear.  But the closet will remain, and it will always remind me what was there.  I am hoping that as time goes on, rather than a hole left by a death, I will remember the space filled with the immense spirit of the man that lived."
RI0870P,female,27,"I’m always a little taken aback when I remember that there are really two lives I could be living.  I don’t mean the chance that I could have been born in a Yurt in Mongolia, or even the possibility that I could have turned out a cheerleader instead of a chronic dork.  I mean that I’ll be sitting there, worrying about mundane things, and then all of a sudden my mind flicks into gear and I’ll be thinking about art and books and paintings and music and all of the people in the world who have taken time to stare into space and really, honestly explore the lives they were living.  The wonderful overwhelming reality of it all.  Mortgage payments are quite real, but not as real as that anger, that sunset, that moment when the curve of someone’s neck nearly brought you to tears.  I think of all of those people with brilliant minds trapped in taxes and new cars and that flat screen TV they promised their husband for father’s day.  I think of the rage of that incapacitated brain.  I think of staring out the window of my office, wondering how anyone could deny that there is a world other than this.  Wondering how people could just talk in small ways about small things and never pick up a paint brush or even allow themselves to contemplate the miracle of an eyelash.  What I think about the most, however, is how close I come to that line.  How often I let myself get lost in the clatter of adult responsibility, how often I say I don’t have time to sit down with a pen, how often I lose that other world.  As if it didn’t exist.  As if I’d never known it.  As if it wasn’t more real than me.  Even for a minute, take the time to take a photograph that isn’t of your cousin’s wedding.  Sit down with a jar full of paint and touch up your toaster.  Write.  Read.  Dance.  Unzip yourself.  Walk the world.  Breathe.  Without that, the real world is dead."
RI0870P,female,27,I love those Spring days when the air feels like it does that time you did everything you ever wanted your hair flying carried by the April wind your knees stuck out sideways on a red bicycle bruises on your ankles and chocolate ice cream on your face and your eyes burning forward your legs pumping your heart pounding throwing yourself towards tomorrow like the world is going to catch you and carry you and hold you up forever you've had some scrapes but nothing could ever burn the meat of your heart away and today is one of those days with a grey sky hanging over but my blue eyes burn blue into the cieling and my red cheeks are lighting red-light districts on the  cold empty avenue and my knees are still awkward flinging out a leg to catch the pavement just as I fall and fall and fall and my hands deep in my pockets reaching for smooth pebbles magic charms that carry that old burning heart that I turned into stone for safe keeping when the world had to stop carrying me in its big tired arms.
RI0870P,female,27,"I must say, I hate it when people boast about how they got their blog to do that cool little mousover, or automatically list their top five favorite indie songs, or taste like cake--mainly because I can't understand what the hell they are talking about.

RI0870P,female,27,"I know I’m supposed to be posting about smoldering relationships between mother and daughter and the universalities found therein, but with my health as it is I don’t really feel like doing much of anything.  Particularly anything that involves a lot of thinking.  Although I feel physically awful, I feel strangely secure and comfortable when I’m sick.  I sort of retreat into my own snotty mental landscape--a world of chicken soup and orange juice and watching soap operas because they’re the only thing on TV at two in the afternoon.  Perhaps it is a defense mechanism.  To insulate my system from further shock my brain wraps me in a nice, mucous-y blanket of willful ignorance.  The power of these regressions is especially noticeable in summer.  While I was growing up I would usually get sick in November, so I wake up in the morning, stuffed up and crusty-eyed, and expect to see the leaves changed.  I even think I smell the soft damp of decomposing leaves and the inexplicably lovely perfume of wood smoke.  But instead everything is green.  The air is hot and slightly humid.  There isn’t a trace of crisp autumn wind to be found.  The result is that the gap between what I’m thinking about and what is actually happening around me gets even broader.  It’s a miracle I can find my way to work at all.  Especially without personal injury.  No matter.  I will return to real life soon enough.  But for now I’m going to snuggle a little deeper into the bunk bed in my head, and ride the socially sanctioned wave of my antihistamine high.

RI0870P,female,27,"My friend  urlLink Chris  is a teacher. He’s the kind of teacher who thinks that getting a kid to think about something he’s never thought about before is as punk rock as you can get.

RI0870P,female,27,"I am totally supposed to be at work right now.  But the fact that my husband just left to go on tour with his band, which is really depressing, and the fact that it is seventy degrees outside, which makes me feel a little bit better, along with the fact that my boss just went out of town today, which is really too convenient, means that instead of being in my little stuffy office looking for  urlLink work-appropriate-porn , I am sitting on my front porch, drinking a beer, and soaking up the good vibes created by being an unproductive member of society.  Hallelujah.  But I did promise the blank Internet world the rest of my dentist story, and although I may cheat the University of Minnesota out of some butt-spreading time, I will not cheat my three readers out of a story about my teeth.  Well, actually, I won’t really get into my teeth, since what really matters here is the dentist.  So we’ll skip ahead right past the Ghetto Dentist Who Didn’t Have Time for a Root Canal, and the Emergency Dentist Who Caused Further Emotional Trauma, to the moment I showed up in the chair of M.J., Senior Dentistry Student, with a hollow tooth, an abscess, and two enormous cavities.  M.J., how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  1. Calls filling a cavity “Fucking around in your tooth” 2. When he hears I haven’t ever seen “The Apprentice,” he describes the show to me in detail, along with Trump’s infamous snakebite hand gestures, and how sad he was when the guy from Kansas didn’t win. 3. His latex gloves smell like swimming pools 4. Tells me to close my eyes before taking out the giant Novocain needle 5. Tells me I’m “awesome” as I sit in the chair drooling on myself. 6. Greets me every morning will a little dance and a “Hey, howya doin’?” 7. Spends half an hour carving away at the metal in my mouth because “I want all of your future dentists to say that this is a damn good filling.”  8. Holds my face whenever I start wincing 9. “Do you have to answer phones at work?  You might sound a little funny, but with any luck they’ll just think you’re drunk.” 10. Tells me stories about his wife and cats while pulling bloody pieces of cotton out of my mouth  I’m still no fan of drills and x-rays and giant steel girder needles, but I can say that every day I have to go see M.J. I have a little spring in my step.  Dare I say, I even think that going to the dentist regularly is a good thing, and I very well might do it, twice a year, maybe even three times.  Sadly, my days with M.J. are numbered.  In fact, that number is one.  One more appointment to get my root-canal cap before he heads off to an internship at the VA hospital.  But he has changed my life.  Because of him, I no longer shudder at the idea of going to the dentist before I am reduced to an Advil popping, whimpering idiot.    Take heart, dentist weary readers.  I have seen the future.  And it loves reality TV."
RI0870P,female,27,"Behold!  A brand spanking new site design to celebrate my first attempt at weeding my front yard.  I needed some kind of bolstering, because my weeds aren’t your normal, tip-toe in the tulips kinds of weeds.  These are giant, monstrous, well rooted weeds.  Yup, I think I can say these weeds are more intimidating than a hip young college professor or that girl in sixth grade who was prettier, smarter,  and  nicer than you.    I’m also a little reluctant because I don’t actually have any grass in my front yard, so the weeds are really the only greenery represented.  The rest is just dirt and old leaves that were never raked up last winter.  But due to the fact that those weeds have doubled in size since the rain Sunday night, and I’m beginning to get slit-eyed looks from my neighbors, I should probably just buck up and dig in.  I was very disappointed to learn that there was no Super Weeder machine available at Home Depot.  I was looking for something big.  Destructive.  Preferably with a seat and a motor so I could drive it home at 10 mph.  But nothing of the sort.  When I typed “weed” into the Home Depot website it just came up with the usual nasty chemicals and twenty dollar spades.  I will be a little sad to see them go, those weeds.  Since I have never had a garden in all my adult life, and my own parents were of the “crabgrass counts as lawn” school, I wasn’t entirely sure if those green little furls were weeds or not, and so I was pretty excited to see what they would become.  In fact, even if they just became a carpet of dandelions, that wouldn’t have been so bad.  I’ve always loved that blanket of yellow on the highway.  And whose childhood would be complete without a June afternoon spent lying on your back, dirty toes dug into the earth, grass-stained knees pointed at the sky, filling the horizon with those white umbrella wishes?"

DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, the Oldest Son© and I went to the 7PM showing of the new Harry Potter movie. We are both huge fans of the series and the movies.  The books are really something else, and the 1st two movies are excellent.  I wish I could say the same for the 3rd movies adaption of the book.  I was dissapointed to the EXTREME to say the least.  They left an incredible amount of information out that is vital to the story, changed various things around location wise, made changes to BIG things in the story like, having so-n-so say them instead of who should have.  They added stuff into the story that wasn't there in the first place, and didn't put in stuff that in my opinion is crucial to the plot and over-all story.  I'm amazed that J.K. Rolling let them do this to the story and I hope to Gaea that she doesn't let them do the same thing to ""The Goblet of Fire"".  Some of the filming styles were quite well, I'll admit that some of the scenes were nice with the way they were filmed, some of the HUGE changes to the grounds of Hogwarts was unacceptable.  I won't say anything for awhile, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.    I just came out feeling very let down, like an old-friend had just cheated me.  Such is life I guess..."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, the doctors appointment went pretty well.  I had them look at the two spots on my left shoulder, and they decided those are ok right now, but he then went on to look at 3-4 different spots on my back, and decided 1 had to come off today.  So I have 2 stiches in the middle right side of my back, 3-4 inches over from my spinal column.  The other is from the lower part of my left calf.  That one took 3 stiches.  I get to go back a week from tomorrow to have them taken out.     You would think, since novocaine would hurt so much going in.  The stick of the needle sucked, but to have that liquid fire going into your leg...OUCH!!!  I got to look at the spots the doc took out, and was surprised at how big they seemed.  The one on the leg was 8mm and they used a ""punch"" to take it out.  I should know by next week when I have the stiches taken out if they are actually skin cancer or not. Based on how they looked (EW!!) I'd say the qualify.  Hopefully they don't though.   I took 1500mg of Tylenol (generic) to make sure I was ready for when the pain starts to kick-in.  Hopefully it wont be too bad, but judging by how deep he went, I'm ""definetly going to feel that in the morning"""
DR9XLF0,male,36,"and it feels like I'm still recovering from being sick over the weekend.  Our oldest was sick last Thursday, and the rest of us came down with it during the night late Friday night.  I was supposed to go help assist with some training at the local district Scout Camp for OWL (Outdoor Webelos Leader) and Baloo (Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation). Well, that didn't happen. I felt bad as there was no way for me to contact them to let them know, since the leader I was going help was there Friday evening already.  I woke up about 4am, and already didn't start feeling very well. I realized later, that I had already started feeling bad the evening before when we went out to eat, and I was starting to feel extremely tired.  Well, I had my clock set to go off at 7:15, which would have given me time to get my clothes together, cleaned up, and on the road. I had already packed my tent, sleeping back, a chair, and a few other things in the trunk of the car the night before.  By 7:30, I had started to throw up.  Oh that’s such a joyful experience. I won’t go into details about what else was happening, but needless to say I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.  That continued during the whole day.  I napped for about a half-hr or so, and just couldn't seem to quite get any actual rest. So about 4, laying on the couch, hips starting to ache like I had a case of the flu, I had the boys throw ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" in the DVD player. We have it on loan from my parents.  It's an interesting movie. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but it was a fun watch.  Some of the plot lines are more then paper thin, and I was able to anticipate what was going to happen, quite easily before it did.  The boys seemed to enjoy it though, and they seemed to like the special effects. Personally, I while I thought the Sub of Capt. Nemo's was very impressive; it was completely wrong/inaccurate to what is described in the classic ""20,000 leagues under the Sea"".  Plus, I never realized that Capt. Nemo was from India. Go figure.  By this time, I had started to sip on some Kool-Aid, as I was dehydrating very fast.  I also had some chicken noodle soup, sans noodles. That was all I had to eat.  Sunday I felt better for the most part, some more energy, hips still aching though.  I had some actual food type food that day.  I've been slowly getting myself to eating more daily, but it's still taking some time to get my appetite back.    I've spent some of our tax return myself finally, and can't wait for the items to get here.  I ordered the 19 inch monitor that I've been wanting for ages. It should arrive in a day or two.  That will make it easier on Z*lda, since the 17 is hard to see text on for her.  It shouldn't be much different in size than our 17 inch monitor now, as it's a Nokia from 2000, so it's on the big side.  That will go down to our youngest son so he'll have something better then a 15 to work on.    I've also made it official and have become a card carrying member of the Star Trek Fan club! This is the part that cool to me. I've wanted to join the fan club for years, and finally have.  It's $30 to join, and for joining up, if you pay the $6.50 shipping, you get a $20 lithograph for free (is anything truly free?).  So I ordered another lithograph to go with it, that shows the Enterprise NX-01 in space next to a planet.  Just wondering where I can put that up, w/o being too obnoxious about Trek :-)  I almost got the Captain Proton one, which is from Star Trek: Voyager. It's based on a ""serial"" type story line in the holodeck that Lt. Paris and Ensign Kim use. Think of the old Tom Swift/Flash Gordon matinee's from the 30's/40's and you'll have it.    School is getting close to being done, and I can't wait.  Taking two classes, while being so active in scouts, and work, and trying to have a life just runs you down.  I have some research to do, as I'm going to be writing a paper on the topic, that if it should be required to have a license to have children or not.  I thought it would be an interesting topic, as I can easily and readily see how the argument could go both ways.  You have to have a license to drive a car, so why not to have kids? Seems to make sense."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Went to the Doctor today with the oldest so we could get a physical, to attend Boy Scout camp this summer.  While there I had the Doc look at a spot on the back of my lower left calf. It was decided, to make an appointment for next week to have it removed, based on his impression, it looks like it's skin cancer.  We'll know for sure after they check it out. It's a small spot about a quarter inch round, that on occassion hurts into the muscle. There is also another spot about 4 inches above it thats probably in my opinion going to be the same way.  Plus there are 2 other spots just like that one on the back of my left shoulder.  Hopefully I wont turn into a walking tumor.  Time will tell, I get to have it removed on the 2nd of June.  Then 2 days later I will be camping with our Boy Scout Troop over-night, to help setup for a fund-raiser the next day.  Too much to do, too little time to do it in.."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Looks like we get to see winter show up finally. We're suppose to expect between 4 to 7 inches of snow by 6am. Should be interesting.  Wonder how the new snow blower will work on it.  Todays been a Monday in hiding. Raining all day, cloudy, the day ends in Y again..  Nothing else to report."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, we had our Pinewood Derby for our CubScout Pack Thursday night.  We had a fantastic evening!  We had our weigh-in, and measuring (car has to fit inside a  box  thats 7inches long, and no wider the the car with it's wheels on).  We got all our cars checked in by the 6pm dead-line. We handed out the participation patches to all the kids as they were certified, just to make it easier.  I arrived at 5pm, to start unloading the track from the car, and getting stuff carried in.  The track is extreamly easy to setup. We purchased a 35ft 2 lane aluiminum track from  http://www.besttrack.com .  All I had to do was to put the pieces of track together, pushing in the ends of the metal dowell pins into the other piece of track, and clip it together with some binder clips.  We had the track together, with our electronic time keeper hooked up, was maybe 20 minutes.  I gave it a quick wipe down, and then we were ready!  We started out with our Flag Ceremony, and some opening announcements.  I got to hang our 2004 National Quality Unit Award streamer on our Pack Flag, and we handed out the patches to all the scouts to put on their uniforms.  We also handed out some patches for our Webelos Overnighter last fall (we ordered the new patches, which came out in 2004, and was our first chance to give them out).    I also had some achievements for my Webelos II Scouts as well. Then it was time to start the races!  While we were doing our awards, we also had our 2 judges looking at the cars, to pick a  Best Design  and  Most Unusual  from each den, and those cars would get trophy's.  We had 25 Scouts racing this year! Always a good turn out for Pinewood derby!  We had no issues, no squables, bickering, or arguing! It was awesome. No cars malfunctioned.  It was probably the best Pinewood Derby we've had while I've been a leader.  The cars were great, there were some excellent races (Including * 2 * re-races, as we had to have the cars flip sides and go again, because they tied!).   All-in-all, it was just an awesome evening.  Z*lda made up 2 kerchiefs for the winners, out of a checkered flag material. These went to our 1st and 2nd place winners, and they get to wear those kerchiefs to districts where they represent our pack, and to our last 2 pack meetings.  Our oldest who is a Webelos II won a trophy for Best Design for his den.  Both boys want to take their cars to district to show, to have a chance for a trophy there.  Our youngest got one last year for Most Unusual Design.      All I can say, is that I really get into doing the Pinewood Derby races, and it just gets funner and funner every year.  I'm going to help out the local Boys and Girls Club's Pack a hand, and take our track down Tuesday to help out with their races as well.   Might be helping out another pack as well, they have to contact me yet.    Cant tell I had a great time can you?  It's a very energetic evening, and it tends to last for a little while :-) Can't wait for next year, to do it again! :-)"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"The oldest son and I got back from spending a week out at Boy Scout camp. We left on June 27th, and got home around 10:45am on July 3rd.  Boy was I tired!  We left the 27th at 11:45, and after picking up a few items we needed, we headed out to Camp C.S Klaus, located just outside of Coalsburg, Ia.      We arrived at camp, for our check-in time at 1:45. The Scouts all took their back-packs out of our Troops trailer, and we then proceeded to hike the 3 quarters of a mile to our campsite.  We were staying in Owl Hoot.  Got camp setup and everything organized. That evening we had our Council Camp Fire with all 7 troops present and the Camp Staff as well.  We got about 3/4's of the way through, before the sprinkles we'd had off/on all afternoon, turned into a steady rain. We stopped the fire, and then started heading back to our camp-site.  By the time we got there the rain was coming down heavily, and we were soaked from the knees down (we had poncho's on).   On Monday the boys started working on their merit badge courses, and our 4 1st year scouts started on their ""Adventure Trail"", where they were working on 3 different merit badges (Swimming, Basketry, and Indian Lore).   On Sunday all the scouts who wanted to use the water, had to get pass their swim test. There are 3 levels, White, Red, and Blue (being the highest and needed to work on the Swimming Merit Badge).  My son just got his white on Sunday, and then Monday took the test and passed for the Red Swimmer.  Tuesday he took his Blue and passed. That took swimming 4 25m laps, with the last lap a backstroke of some sort, and then a 5-10 second float on his back.  He had a cheering section going by the time he finished.  It's a big accomplishment when your 11, and you take a swim test that has you swim the length of a foot ball field. Way to go!!  We had some activities that night, on a troop level, that started off with a tug-of-war.  It  was quite hilarious actually. When we walked up, 2 groups were already going, and the 1st boy in the water (they dug a pit and filled it with water, making it a very muddy mess), did a dive, just like you'd see on Most Extreme Challenge off Spike TV. If we had had a camcorder, we could of won money on those home video shows, it was that funny.  By the time it was done, the same boy had ended up in the water 3 times.  They had a few other actives, like a team getting their members over a rope 4ft off the  ground, w/o touching the rope.  I was busy with the camera trying to get some decent pics of it as it was going on.  There was some other actives involving boards and ropes and carrying team-members around.  When we were done, we then made the almost 1mile hike back to our site.  The oldest son also had his first attempt at shooting a 22cal rifle and had a blast literally.  I'll have to take him out so he can practice for next summer as he now wants to take the Rifle Merit badge (along with Archery).  Wednesday was a bit of a challenge for him, as I think the long days were starting to get to him. The 1st years had to go on a 3 mile hike (1.5miles one way). He got back and was almost wiped from that, then had to go down and work as a server at our table.  I helped the 1st years with their waiter duties, as there was nobody there to tell them all what they had to do.  Then the 1st years headed down to the parade grounds for an evening of games and activities.  Oldest son decided he did NOT want to stay down there for the ""sleep under the stars"" camp out, and came back to the camp-site about 9:45.   Thursday was supposed to have the 1st years start out with a ""Polar Bear"" swim, which he didn't want to do either.  He was getting a little homesick by this point as he had cried some on Wednesday night before bed, and Thursday morning.  Thursday he had a better time of it, as he had another chance in Field sports to shoot the rifles and the Archery range again.   We then spent 2hrs down at Aquatics (the beach) for the Water Follies, a bunch of fun events that involved water.  One of the best practical jokes of the week went on at this event, and I'm sure will go down in the annals of Klaus folk lore.  I won’t describe it here, in an attempt to protect the not-so-innocent lol  We also had family night that night, so about 5pm families started to show up, and the scouts could take them around camp to show it off and some of the activities they had done.  Since it was Family Night, I got to walk around with my Son, just the two of us.  We went over to the Water Falls, which were just perfectly lit, and looked awesome.  We went over and watched the demo from the fire truck, and had something to eat.  Then it was time to head up for the Council Fire, which was pretty neat. It got just AWESOME when they started the tap out ceremony for the Order of the Arrow.  I won't even try to describe how incredible it was, just imagine a Pow-Wow drum going, torches, and people dancing and throwing said fire torches.  It had to be the kewlest ceremony I've seen in Scouting yet. After that was done, we headed back to our camp-site to put an end to our night.  The only mishap of the week happened about 3:36am that night, when my son decided to roll a little too far to his right on his bunk, and rolled out of the tent.  The tents, are Boy Scout type tents, which are on raised wooden platforms, 2 poles holding the center up, with a beam between them.  My son’s side of the tent was about 2ft off the ground, and his bunk added another foot and a half to that. I heard him fall, and jumped out of bed, and with flash-light in hand, leaned over his bunk and looked out the side of the tent. Sure enough, there he was on the ground in his sleeping back, sitting up wondering what had just happened. He only really remembers the “whoosh” of the air going by him as he fell.  I told him to climb back up into the tent, and he looked like an inch-worm in his sleeping bag as he did it.  He fell asleep almost as fast as he had fallen out of bed.  It took me another 45 minutes to fall back asleep after that.  I did listen to the Owls hooting away though as I waited.  Friday the Scouts got to put finishing touches on any Merit Badges they hadn't finished yet. My son got his Indian Lore and Basketry badges finished up, and some of his Swimming done as well.  2 out of three ain't bad!  It was also a chance for me to perform the practical joke that I'd had planned for the week.  We had 3 boys who pulled a joke on a leader and shouldn't have gone into his tent. So....I enlisted some help, and I put their cots on the roof of the latrine. It worked out very nicely. Even have pictures of the not-so-innocent helping me do it.  All 3 Scouts took it extremely well, and we helped them pull their stuff down after it was done. By evening, we got ready for our last Council fire, were each troop had to put on a Skit and do a cheer.  Our Skit was so long we didn't do a cheer.  It was BY FAR the best skit of the evening. We did ""The Wizard of Klaus"", and it was hilarious.  I got to be the Wizard due to being able to do a deep voice that projected so the audience could hear.  We headed back to our camp site to finish up our packing (we pull all other stuff that we didn't want to haul-out on our hike out, back in the troop trailer), and then hit the sack. We got up at 6:10, so we could get ready, and have our Camp Site cleared out and signed off by 6:45am. We then hiked down the hill to the dinning hall for a quick cinnamon roll and milk, before going down to the parade grounds, were we threw our packs into the trailer, divvied up the Scouts between the cars, and then made our 40minute drive back to Dubuque.   We then proceeded to divvy our gear back up into our respective vehicles and headed home.  It was an incredible week, very tiring, but we had an awesome time.   The leaders who stayed all week, at the last Council fire, were even presented with a Mini-Multi tool that say ""stayed all week leader, Camp C.S.Klaus"" which I thought was nice.  But what was nicer?  Getting to spend the week there with my Son, having a great time, and getting to sleep again in my own bed.  We can't wait until next year! Is it 2005 yet?"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Well, the good news is, that the 2 pieces of me that were carved out by my Doctor last week as possible skin cancer came back negative.  Neither one was at that stage.  The way I'm thinking, is it's good it's gone, so it doesn't have a chance to go that way.     The other good, is that the stiches are out.  My back is fine, Doc says that it's healing nicely.  The leg..well...thats a different story.  The stiches hurt alot more when they removed them from my leg then my back.  I asked Doc about how the skin was really pulled tight and causing the skin at the edge to bunch up in a line. He said they called those Dog Ears.  Woof woof I guess.  So, he said just take it easy, I'm pretty much good to go, and sent me out the door. My appointment was at 4:15, I was leaving the parking ramp at 4:24.  The body parts smarted a hair, from having the stiches pulled out.  It's pouring practically by the time I'm ready to step out of the car at home.  I open the door, put out my left leg (can you see this coming yet?) and I must of twisted my leg just enough as I stood up out of the car, that my leg popped open. Oh, talk about stinging.   I came into the house, went right into the kitchen, grabbing a phone book so I could call the doc back.  I'm sitting at the kitchen table, dabbing the back of my calf with a paper towel, to see that yup, it did pop.  I have a live person from Doc's office at 4:41. They said how soon can I be there, I said 9 minutes, they said come back in.  Doc comes in, cleans the leg up, said Yup! it's popped. I'm thinking SOB, I have to get one of those railroad spikes jammed into my leg again to numb it out.   He said Nope! Just pack it with antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a band-aid.  So, it gets to heal from the inside out.  Hope it's done in time for BS Camp, really looking forward to that.  I ran to Wal-Mart to cash a check at the bank, and decided to look at their multi-purpose tools, as I've been w/o one for awhile now (if you know a techie geek and they don't have their multi-purpose tool, you know their mentally lost).  I picked up a nice little Gerber for $32w/tax.   My leatherman's small tip screw driver BROKE, which really pissed me off to be honest.  I decided since a new Leatherman would run me $29.99, and it was IDENTICAL to the one I have, which happens to be about 7yrs old, that I wanted to look at the Gerber Multi-Pliers 400.  Thats the one I ended up getting, I liked the pliers design, and the locks on the accessories that flip out, so they wont close on you while pushing with all your might (you know what I mean, and man is that a blood blister!).     Will see how good the Gerber does. I had a Winchester MultiPurpose too that I got last fall for $15, and it wasn't worth it.  Was $15 wasted. Looked nice, functioned not so nice.."
DR9XLF0,male,36,"Ok....this is getting old.  I spent alot of Saturday with the feeling in the right side of my head, that I had  a migraine  just waiting to jump out of the closet onto my back.  I went to bed early Saturday, around 9:30pm. Getting old sucks.   Sunday after getting a decent nights sleep, I still had that tell-tale pressure in my right temple.  Well, about 4pm, the oldest and I went on a run to the store as we needed cat litter, chocolate moo, and ice cream.  Stupid me didn't wear sunglasses, so the late afternoon sun was beaming me right in the eyes most of the way home.  That was enough to push  my migraine button  the rest of the way.  About 5, I took 1000mg of ibuprofen (sorry if it's misspelled, hate the word anyway lol), and one of my migraine meds.  About 5:30 I decided it was time to lay down. My wife Z*lda asked if there was anything she could do, and I asked her to call the ER. One of the guys at work gets migraines and he has his wife take him to the ER, where they give him a shot of demeral, and 30minutes later, he's out and not having to experience the pain.  Well, she called the Ask-oh-nurse, and was connected to a hospital in Des Moines.  The lady sounds like she went down her little chart, sounding like she was agreeing with Z*lda on everything, and I ended up staying home, and spent another 45minutes feeling like the vessels in my right temple were trying to escape from my body (felt like they almost made it too).    The nurse did say ""if he throws up bring him in right away"", which didn't make sense to me, as I almost ALWAYS throw up when I get a migraine.  Hell, it feels bad, but, it does seem to make it go away faster.  Why would they want me to come in only IF I puke?  Go Figure.    I'd of rather got the demeral shot.  I would of slept through the night. As it was, I woke up about 9pm, thought I felt ok, then about 30 seconds later, Mr. Migraine said FU and looked me in the eye again.  So I rolled over and went back to sleep.  Then I woke up about 11:45pm. Lights on in the living room, and the house was very quiet.  So I got up, since Mr Migraine had finally given up and me and went to beat mercelessly on someone else.  Z*lda was on the couch snoozing, but woke up right away.  Oldest boy was in his bed reading some of the AWESOME book Harry Potter 5.  Littlest boy was playing with transformers (I think) on the floor.   Got him to brush his teeth finally and crawl into bed (12:30AM. for being 7 he sure is a night owl).  I finally went back to bed, and go figure, it took me until 4:15am to get back to sleep.  Then to top it off, having some of the most odd-ball dreams ever. (can anyone say astronaught?)  Well, the old alarm clock went off at 6:45, and my ""no freaking way"" meter pegged out.  I got up, and got stuff organized as I had to take our pc into work, were I was doing some digitization of video. Must say, that is some way fun stuff!  Put in the full/busy day at work, and then at 6:20, went to school for my 1:15 of learning to program in Visual Basic.net.  This is going to be a very kewl programming language to learn.  My copy of Visual Studio (academic copy) has arrived at the book store, now to figure out how to pay for it, as I just learned I'm not taking enough credits for my student loans Tuesday to be accepted.  I'll get it figured out somehow.  Oh, to top it off on Monday? Mr. Migraine was back, trying to invade the left side of my head this time.  Sometime, I'm going to be a REALLY big stick and give him some of his own back.  At least I fended him off, and he didn't get the better of me.    So, after the long day at work, the long evening, I get home from school, and what do I do? Throw in the Hulk.  Z*lda took the boys down and rented video games, and they had The Hulk previously viewed for $10.  I'll write up a review to post another day. I have mixed feelings about it, both good and bad (coming from an old comic book collector)  So as Stan Lee would say,   Excelsior!"
DR9XLF0,male,36,"I want to say  Thank You  to my  wife , for all the work she did on my Blog last night. She set it up so I can have comments on my blog, and a picture of me   and a mood indicator. Watching her edit the template and posting html code here, and typing some in by hand there, I can definitely say she knows her way around a web page. Shes only had a webpage since '96, when Geocities was the only real place offering a free web page. She was once a featured website, and there was only 1 of those at a time, once a month.  She does an  awesome  job with the sites, and is  amazing , to me, who works with  pc's , but not  html .  We got our popcorn today, for our CubScouts to deliver.  After unloading all of it, it was nice for a change that our sons only had a little amount to deliver.  Everything went pretty smoothly for the most part and kids maybe knocking on YOUR door to deliver something you ordered.  Everything we do as a CubScout Pack during the year is funded by what we earn from our popcorn sales.  Last spring we were able to purchase a new 2-lane all-aluminum 35ft long track.  Wow, is it awesome to run the derby on that! Our race night seemed to go by fairly quickly.  My assistant leader and I even set it up at another school for their CubScout Pack's derby. They haven't had one before, and we volunteered to help out, and it gave us an excuse to show off and use our new track.   We had 24 kids racing, using a double elimination, and we were done raceing in 45 minutes. Was amazing, our own pack races don't go that fast.   We're going to make a trip up to the University of Platteville Wisc tonight. They are having an Indian Pow wow.  This will be our second one this year, and our 3rd one total, together.  Should be quite interesting.  After going to the Tama Pow wow on August 7th, this one will be nicer, as it wont be boiling hot outside, and we'll understand it and appreciate it a little more as well.  The costumes are incredibly detailed, and the dancers are very good at what they do.  It's an awesome experience, one  I think everyone should experience for themselves."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"Remember when we were little?  How we were practically inseperable?  How we always promised to be best friends forever?  Well I just wanted to let you know that you're still number one to me because I'm pretty sure I don't tell you enough.  Thanks for making me feel a little bit better, you put a smile on my face.  I don't know anyone who can say they've been best friends with someone for as long as we have, and I'm pretty sure no one else has as good a best friend as I do.  So thanks for caring."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"You used to be one of those people who knew when something was wrong even when I said nothing was.  I was comforted by you.  You let me cry, you patted my back an told me everything would be okay.  What about now? Is everything going to be okay now?  I need your comforting words now more than ever.  I need you back."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"I didn't really want to admit it to myself.  Not until I heard someone else say exactly what I was thinking did i really let it sink in.  It tears me up inside to know that I feel this way and you have no idea, but it's better to know that I'm not the only one.  That I have someone to turn to, someone who knows exactly how I feel.    Not only that, I'm leaving you out of one of the most important things in my life.  That's something I should feel guilty about, right?  But I don't.  That someone knows, they knew all along.  They know me, and I'm not so sure you do anymore.  *mine...yup...k*"
UXEGK7T,female,16,Someone made me happier than ever today just by being totally honest.  It made me want to smile and cry at the same time.  And I'm glad that person had the courage to say to me what I wish i had the courage to say to them because I felt the same way.   Amanda--I missed you soo much! I love you.
UXEGK7T,female,16,"You wonder when I lost respect for you.  I remember exactly.  It was the day you told me I wasn't smart enough to form my own opinions.  The day you let me know you don't value my thoughts as valid.  The day you told me that age does matter, you told me you couldn't trust the opinion of a sixteen year old.  Why is all my respect gone?  If you don't think my thoughts count, I think the same way of yours.  You're the one that needs to tell me that I am smart, to push me to form my own opinions.  I don't get that from you and i'm not letting you into my life until you realize it."
UXEGK7T,female,16,I want you to know how much I care about you. I want you to know how happy you make me.  Sometimes I have a hard time making the words come out.  You bring out my shy side and i don't know why because I am most comfortable when I'm with you.  So just know that I love you even if I can't always say it the way I want to.  *Happy doesn't even begin to describe it*
UXEGK7T,female,16,"It's funny how you can not see someone for so long, yet they still love you just as much, if not more, than the last time you saw them.  I always hear stories about how my little cousins talk about me and want to be like me.  No matter how long I go without seeing them, they always come to me for the first hugs.  I'm the fun one, the one who does what they want to do.  The babysitter who lets them stay up for that extra half hour and helps them build ""tents"" in the living room.  The one who pushes them on the swing and picks them up when they fall off.  They look up to me, and that feels good."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.""  Excellent movie."
UXEGK7T,female,16,"I cried today.  I went up to my room, turned up my music, and just cried.  It's good for me sometimes.  It reminds me of when my sister broke her finger and they had to pop the blood blister to relieve pressure.  But there's only so much pressure I can relieve before I start to wonder when this will be over.  When my life will drift back into my existence.  When I can be me again, I mean really be me.  When I can stop acting and actually enjoy myself.  You make me smile.  The way you joke with me and make a serious effort to get to know me better.  Thanks for caring."
UXEGK7T,female,16,I love you baby more than anything in the world.  Everything is going to be okay.   The tough times are coming I know.   For you they've already started.  But we can do it because we love each other and because we have our friends behind us all the way.   Thanks to all of my amazing friends.   I know you can do it and I will do my best to try also.  And I will never give up.  I love you.
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Okay, so on my way in today, a terrible thing almost happened, but fortunately I was able to reach the emergency duct tape in my glove compartment and wrap my head before it exploded.  I'm sure you all know about the movie ""Catwoman"".  During an interview, Sharon Stone was asked why the movie did so badly.  Never mind that it had a STUPID plot, bad writing, etc.  Stone's reasoning as for why it did so bad was because there was no lesbian kiss in the movie between her and Halle Berry.  After all, she said, how could you have a movie with two people as hot as Stone and Berry and NOT have them kiss?  I don't know Sharon, please enlighten we poor stupid members of the unwashed masses with your infinite wisdom...  There was no lesbian kiss because George Bush is in the whitehouse.  And thus, the movie didn't do well.  In two related stories, there have been late monsoons in the south pacific because Stone's ego has pulled the moon out of orbit, and Hollywood has renamed the San Andreas Fault to Bush's Fault.  I don't understand it.  Hang on a second...*takes hit off bong*  You know, Stone might actually have a point."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Being not in the mood to discuss anything heavy today, especially after this weekend, I thought I would pose the following question:  What are two foods you've eaten that just don't go together?  My entries: Bologna + Orange Juice Macaroni & Cheese + Spam (NEVER EVER EVER do this!!!) Caviar + Milk Chicken + Egg (Don't ask me why, they are just horrible together)  Now, I'm not looking for obvious things like pickles and ice cream, so have at it.  :)"
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Well, since it is an election year, once again the Democrats are proposing an increase in the minimum wage, this time taking it to $7.00 an hour.  On the surface, a lot of people will think ""What a great idea!  Take those greedy bloodsuckers for all their worth!""    However, the problem with this line of thought is that the greedy bloodsuckers won't be the ones who end up paying it.  That's right, boys and girls, you will.  Now maybe you don't have a problem paying more for your Soylent Green burger at McDonalds and think it will help a lot of people out.  Well, the truth of the matter is that most people on minimum wage aren't the sole providers for their household, most of them live in households that are well above the poverty level, yada yada yada...    So why then are the Democrats proposing this if so few voting age people would be affected?  Well, because minimum wage workers are the tip of this iceberg.  That's right folks, we are talking about Unions.  Most union contracts are tied to the minimum wage.  Minimum wage goes up $2.00 an hour, a guy making $17.00 to flip a switch is suddenly making $19.00 an hour to do the same work.    And since you can't do something to the economy without experiencing the ripple effect, let's follow this ripple a bit.  McSoylent employs 8 people for the lunch shift, lets say.  Suddenly, minimum wage goes up.  Well, the McSoylent Corporation isn't going to take the hit to their bottom line, so what do they do?  They ""emancipate"" two of the 8 wage slaves they have working their lunch shift to allow them the privledge of expanding their horizons (*sniff sniff*  Smell that?  That was sarcasm).  So now, the other six wage slaves have to work harder to provide the same level of service.  And since this doesn't quite make up the entire amount of lost revenues, the head Ronald at McSoylent decides to raise prices.  Now, an Extra Soylent Meal costs $5.00 instead of $4.00.  This is to say nothing of other cost cutting measures, like consumer downsizing, safety spending (the kind that prevents fun things like Mad Cow), and quality assurance.    Now, lets go up the chain a bit.  Here I am, working for a grocery chain in the Hidden City.  What happens if they suddenly have to pay all of the grocery workers an extra $2.00 an hour?  Well, in order to stay competitive, they will most likely offshore their IT staff.  There's the ""O"" word again.  The word that causes a hemorage in the US economy.  Less higher paid workers that are suddenly not able to afford to buy ""stuff"" to keep the economy going.  Moving us closer and closer to a two-tiered society of rulers (government officials, company owners, executive management, salesmen, and lawyers) and the low paid unwashed labor masses that is the rest of us.    Cause and effect can be a real pisser."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Nothing big going on these days. Just dealing with bouts of pretty severe depression that the stupidest little things will trigger. Now, don't get me wrong, its no where NEAR the point to where my wife would ask ""What color should we paint the walls?"" and I would be tempted to answer ""Give me my gun and I'll paint it 'My Brains!'"" No, just that kind of depression where I want to go down into my cave, lock the door, and say the hell with the rest of the world.  Ugh. I can't wait 'til vacation time. I need a rest.  But anyway... On the way into the Hidden City, I tend to listen to the radio. One of the commercials is a group of kids screaming hyperly ""LET'S GET SOME CHOCOLATELY OVALTINE!!!"" to which the other kids scream ""YEAH!!! OVALTINE!!!"" Then the moms give them some, and they hyperly scream ""MORE CHOCOLATELY OVALTINE PLEASE!!!"" You know, I really have to question the mothers' decision to give these hyped up wired kids even more sugar and caffeen, considering they were probably jumping around like crazed gibbons in the first place."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"It is always an interesting weekend when one sees something not seen that often.     After getting very little sleep Thursday and Friday night, due to an ephemeral and far too public obligation I ended up not getting home until 2:30 on Saturday night / Sunday morning.  After winding down and making sure the bunker was secure and everything was hidden to my satisfaction, I finally got to bed around 4:00-ish (heavy on the ish).  Ah, blissful, concealed, much needed sleep.  I didn't even remember my dreams, which is very rare for me.     9:00 AM.  When I sleep, one can usually hit me with a large stick before I will come out of hibernation.  But on this particular morning, a deep rumbling forced its way into the layers of unconsciousness.  I found myself in a semi-conscious state of confusion, having no idea what was causing my guts to resonate with such annoying force.  After about 10 minutes of trying to fight off the ephemeral world, gripping tightly to the shroud of the encompassing dream world, my mind was forced to confront the terrible force that violently pierced the sweet darkness.     It was a noise coming from outside.  I quickly went over the security checklist from the night before in my mind.  No, still unseen.  It must be coincidental.  Crawling over to the shade drawn window, I peeked out.  There, on the road that passes my house, hundreds upon hundreds of motorcycles were riding past.  Now that was something one doesn't see every day.  There were so many, I even had time to get my morning drink and stumble outside and watch the parade from the safety of my camouflaged porch.     As I'm sure you do too, I see motorcycles every day.  But seeing that many of them, knowing that this event was organized, and that hundreds of people took time out of their lives to just ride through the country on a Sunday morning... I don't know, but it was quite impressive.  And well worth waking up for."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"An interesting article I found:   COLLAPSE OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD ACCELERATES Mon Jul 12 2004 18:17:38 ET  The collapse of the earth's magnetic field, which both guards the planet and guides many of its creatures, appears to have started in earnest about 150 years ago, the NY TIMES is planning to report on Page Ones Tuesday.   Science reporter Bill Broad has filed a report, according to newsroom sources, which explores how: 'The field's strength has waned 10 percent to 15 percent so far and this deterioration has accelerated of late, increasing debate over whether it portends a reversal of the lines of magnetic force that normally envelop the earth.""  Broad explains: ""During a reversal, the main field weakens, almost vanishes, and then reappears with opposite polarity. Afterward, compass needles that normally point north would point south, and during the thousands of years of transition much in the heavens and Earth would go askew.""  Broad claims: ""A reversal could knock out power grids, hurt astronauts and satellites, widen atmospheric ozone holes, send polar auroras flashing to the equator and confuse birds, fish and migratory animals that rely on the steadiness of the magnetic field as a navigation aid.""   One has to wonder what this will mean for our dependent-on-technology society.  Or what other sort of false phenomenon this is causing us to think we are observing *cough* *global warming* *cough*.  Heh heh.  Just my opinion on an observation.  And if you want to discuss global warming and why I believe it is a false crisis, feel free to e-mail me."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"I came up with one of those ""get to know you better"" type of political quizzes.  Feel free to copy and use.  It will be interesting to see what people say.  For or Against: - Gun Control Against.  2nd Amendment is an individual right.  -Abortion Against.  I believe life begins at conception, so abortion is murder.  -War In Iraq For.  I also believe things are going well there, considering what we are up against.  -War On Terror For.  And I believe Iraq IS part of the war on terror.  -Free Trade Against.  With the exchange rates, free trade is causing our economy to hemorrhage.  -Offshoring of Jobs Against.  A thousand times against.  This is BAD BAD BAD for the American economy!  -Illegal Immigration Amnesty Against. Don't reward illegal activity.  And we should charge Mexico $40k per person that comes across our boarder illegally that we have to return to them.  You know, the way they do it to the countries on their southern boarder.  -Increased Environment Regulation Against.  A lot of environmental issues are based on shoddy, agenda driven science.  This is one of the reasons we haven't built an oil refinery in 25 years.  -Global Warming Policies Against.  Global warming as a result of human activity is completely unproven.  -Kyoto Protocol Against.  CO2 is not a pollutant.  -Socialized Health Care Against.  -Laws punishing Hate Speech Against.  1st amendment thing.  ALL speech must be protected, even speech we don't agree with.  Besides, who's going to decide what is Hate Speech?  The government?  No thanks.  -Hate Crime Legislation Against.  A crime is a crime, no matter who it is against or why it is against them.  I believe that they should all be punished consistently.  -Making the Bush Tax Cuts Permanent For.  Tax cuts are a good thing as they spur the economy, and the ""rich"" pay most of the federal income taxes as it is.  Plus, at my measly salary, I would be considered rich as I saw a decrease in my taxes.  -Death Penalty For.  -Tracking Foreign Nationals For.  -Oil Drilling in ANWR and the Gulf For, until we can find Alternative energy sources.  -Alternative Fuels Research For.  We need to get off of this oil thang.  -Embryonic Stem Cell Research Against.  I believe that life begins at conception.  -Patriot Act Against.  It gives the government too much power.  -Racial Quotas Against.  It is another form of discrimination.  -Constitutional Ban on Gay Marriage Don't really have an opinion, but I am leaning to Against.  What do I care what two consenting adults do?  -Campaign Finance Reform Against, in its current form.  Why is the solution to people being pandered to by special interests to limit my right of free speech?  Besides, there are too many loopholes in it.  -Partial Social Security Privatization For.  With the Baby Boomers retiring and withdrawing from their 401k's, the stock market is going to be in some serious trouble without it.  And there is no lockbox!  -Reduced Defense Spending Against.  The defense of our country is too important.  -Gender Based Quotas Against.  If we are all equal, we should be treated equally.  Gender Based Quotas are not the answer for equality.  -Logging on Federal Lands For, as long as they replant.  Trees are a renewable resource.  -Ban on SUVs Against.  I believe that Global Warming is being caused by the sun, as Venus and Mars are getting hotter also.  -Teacher Led Prayer In Public School Against.  That is not what they are paid for.  Although I don't believe that students should be banned from praying.  -Membership in the WTO Against.  The WTO is a flaccid organization who isn't willing to tackle real problems.  -Increased Pressure to Change China's Currency Manipulation For.  Cheap crap at Wal-Mart now could easily mean economic collapse later.  -US Membership in the UN Against.  Pull us out.  The UN has grown beyond its original charter and is trying to be a world government.  -American Sovereignty For.  As I said above, pull out of the UN.  -Decreasing the Power of American Courts For.  Judges shouldn't legislate from the bench.  -Taking Steps to Eliminate the Trade Deficit For.  Free trade is bad.  Trade deficits are worse.  Could lead to economic collapse.  -Animal Rights Against.  I don't believe that animals have rights.    Scale of 1 to 10 (1 being Don't Agree at all, 10 being Agree Completely):  -Bush is intelligent 8  -Kerry is intelligent 8  -Bush is in touch with the common man 2  -Kerry is in touch with the common man 2  -Cheney is evil 6  -Edwards is evil 8.  He's a trial lawyer.

He has so far.  -Kerry will pander to the special interests and his campaign contributors 9, just different ones than Bush, obviously.  -Bush stole the 2000 election and was appointed by the Supreme Court 1.  Bush had the rule of law on his side.  FL court tried to legislate from the bench.  If you want to argue this one, feel free to e-mail me.  -People who vote for Bush are stupid 1  -People who vote for Kerry are stupid 1.  Difference of opinion does not equal lower intelligence.  -I can understand why some people will be voting for Bush 10  -I can understand why some people will be voting for Kerry 10  -I will be voting for Bush 7.  That free trade / offshoring thing just chaps my behind.  -I will be voting for Kerry 1.  No way in hell."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"This is just completely depressing.  Now that  urlLink Kerry's people are swearing up and down  to the bastard who's the biggest offshorer of jobs in America, there is no reason for me not to support Bush for re-election.  Bush's stance on offshoring was the main issue that made me hesitant to vote for him.  On almost all other issues that matter to me, he was leagues ahead of Kerry.  Leave it to Kerry to flip-flop on my hot-button issue."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Oh boy!!!  More bitterness!!!  One thing that really irks me is hypocrisy and inconsistency of thought.  I'm not talking about the ""They are hypocrites because they don't act like what my interpretation of their religion is"" variety either.  A little background.  I can't STAND Michael Moore.  He twists the truth, uses editing to mislead, outright lies, then presents his creation as a factual documentary.  Plus his smarmy, self loathing, poor-me-vicitm attitude really rubs me the wrong way.  Sherman, set the wayback machine to 12 years ago.  Rush Limbaugh appears on the national scene.  He takes the airwaves by storm and gives a voice to a huge conservative demographic of the country in a way that has never been done before.  What are the major attacks from the left?  ""He's FAT!!!  Why would anyone like to listen to that FAT-ASS!!!  Rush is RIGHT FAT!!!  Rush Limbaugh is a BIG FAT IDIOT!!!""  Very classy from a group of people who claim to be based on inclusion and to stand against group-ism, which the right threw back in their face, and rightly so.  Back to today.  These very same people who were bashing the left for ripping on Rush because of his weight are doing the EXACT SAME THING to Michael Moore!!!  Glenn Beck, Jim Quinn, and Michael Savage to name a few.  COME ON PEOPLE!!!  There are - SO - many things to bash Michael Moore on, must you resort to the ""He's Fat!!!"" attacks that you were pissed about a mere 10 - 12 years ago???    So disappointing."
9NSDHMI,male,35,"Greetings all.     Lately, while spending my time keeping out of sight, I've been reading several good books.  One of them is ""Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance.""  However, due to lack of free time, I haven't had a chance to get very far on it.  Working two jobs while trying not to be seen will do that to ya.  What little I have read though has really resonated with me (and getting through all the different layers of cover is no easy task).  One of the topics touched on is a common little greeting we all get from time to time.  ""What's new?""     How much of our lives do we spend chasing after ""What's new?""  A new experience, a new job, a new warning device, a new toy/toys, a new hiding place...  As an INTP, I am definitely guilty of this.  Although lately, as I have passed the half-way point of my statistical life expectancy in my quest to not be seen, I've started looking in the rear view mirror a lot more.  Well, for introspection, rather than its usual function of seeing who is sneaking up behind me.  As I do so, I have realized just how much more ""new"" there is to get out of things with which we are already familiar.  In the quest for newness, we only get the chance to skim the surface of all we reach out of our hiding places to touch.  Plenty of the experiences I've had in the past were spent looking forward to the next experience rather than fully experiencing what I was doing at that moment.     One thing that comes to mind from my youth was when my family went to the beach.  At this particular beach, I remember walking out to the edge of a pier that went about 100 yards out into the ocean on a night of a new moon.  A cool Atlantic ocean breeze gently pushing the sea mist to me as the waves broke against the pier's foundation poles.  Being surrounded by darkness on almost all sides, it was like I was standing on the edge of reality with literally nothing in front of me, to either side, above or below me.  Just the soft sound of the ocean, the smell of the salt water in the air, and one's self. It is amazing what races through one's mind at a time like that.  I didn't stay long, though, as there was just so much more to see and do at this beach community, with all the seasonal vendors hawking exhilarating entertainment for what was at the time a mere two hours wage.  I don't remember what I did after that, so I can't say that it justified leaving an experience that has stayed with me all these years.  But those five minutes I spent standing at what felt like the edge of eternity... how much more meaning would it have had if I had stayed longer to enjoy the quality of experience and not the quantity of ""stuff to do""?      Have you had similar experiences?  I'd love to hear them."

CXSA8YM,female,27,"I've spent the past few hours preparing a fine fine dinner.   I made:  Boursin stuffed Chicken breasts (a tara specialty)                 Panzanella, featuring a variety of tomatoes from my garden         And Apple Carmelita (apples baked w/ crumb topping to be served w/ vanilla bean ice cream and topped w/ caramel sauce)  Plus I made key lime pie to use up the last of the key limes.  But that won't be ready until tomorrow because I let it cook overnight in the fridge.   The funny thing is that Daniel is probably working until close so it will be probably midnight before we eat.   And knowing him, he won't be hungry anyway.  Oh well.  Nothing is cooked yet, just ready to cook so it can always save until tomorrow."
CXSA8YM,female,27,"Walmart Neighborhood Market Self Check Lane  6/17/04  18:19:01 (found 6/17, 9:30ish)   Folgers           3.86 Chicken Stir Fry  4.96 Chicken Stir Fry  4.96  Total 15.02 Cash 20.00  Change 4.98   ********  That seems awfully high for chicken stir fry, presumably frozen. I think they could have bought some chicken breasts and some vegetables for much less.  hmm.  I think they are single.  It would have been much more interesting if it had been instant coffee.  **********   This is a pretty boring hobby, really."
CXSA8YM,female,27,"So I left work early today because I was dizzy and feeling like I was about to pass out.  Fun! There is at least one ambulance/fire truck call a week and I am not about to be the reason for the call this week.  I was feeling like this yesterday too.  So of course, everyone around my desk is now convinced that I am pregnant. I hope they shut the hell up about that very soon. Because I am not. I know I'm not. But if they keep mentioning it, I am going to start thinking I am and that's where I get into trouble.  I start to forget that I only have 3/4 of a poorly functioning left ovary and an empty spot where the right one is supposed to be.  Well. I assume it's an empty spot.  Unless a different organ decided to take up residence down there.  So I forget this fact and get my hopes up. But not this time. I promise.  I don't share these things w/ my coworkers of course.  I'm not one of those people.  Maybe I just hate my job.  I can't figure out why there are so many coworkers dropping dead or having asthma attacks or heart attacks, etc at their desks. Do my bosses only hire sickly people? Is our building cursed?    I never want to live in a house that doesn't have popsicles at all times in the summertime.  Bomb pops are preferred but I'll take those twin pops too.    I have said goodbye to an old internet crutch.  I'm not going to go into it here becasue my lord I think I have rehashed it enough.  It is enough to say though that I am happy, finally, after a few weeks of being down about it. And I think it was a long time coming.  So I'm back here at my old blog named after a weird Dolly Parton song.  Hurray for me!"
CXSA8YM,female,27,I got my new wedding rings.  They look just the same so I can pretend that no badness ever happenend. Huzzah!
CXSA8YM,female,27,home at last
CXSA8YM,female,27,"I have been lightheaded, dizzy, nauseous and headachey for five days now.  I have convinced myself that I'm either pregnant or have contracted some weird and fancy disease.  Today I realized I probably just need glasses.    Tomorrow I go to the doctor (yeah, on a Sunday. I'm odd like that)."
CXSA8YM,female,27,"How could I possibly be depressed when we have booked our vacation?!   From December 11-18 I will be on the Sea.  It's not the S-S Norway, which is my idea of heaven, but it will do in a pinch.      The S-S Norway was for sale. Why doesn't anyone want to give us $28 million so we can buy it?     So, we will be going to:  Cozumel, Cancun, Belize City, and Bay Islands, Honduras.     Yay!  It has been too too long since I've gone snorkeling in the Caribbean.  Maybe should buy our own gear instead of renting?     **     Tonight daniel got the idea to rearrange the living room.  We have too much furniture for this to work out well.   His original idea was to have the sofa sticking out in the middle of the room, effectively cutting the room in half.  I'm sorry but no.  It looks weird just plunked down in the middle of the room.  And I am so bothered by sitting there and having half the living room and the rest of the house behind me. No. Just.. No.    So we've decided to stick the sofa against the other wall. This means I think that I'm not getting my loveseat.  I don't think it will work w/ our new set up.  Bah.     **     I'm still not feeling well.  Dizzy and short of breath and I can't seem to think clearly.  Today I had the added bonus of nausea.   I should go to the doctor but I don't want to. So there."
CXSA8YM,female,27,"I like finding shit. I like keeping the shit that I find. My newest obsession is found grocery receipts.  I just decided to collect them, at 1am while at the Walmart Neighborhood Market.  Does that make me odd?  Would it be more interesting to scan them in? Probably. But that's not the point.   #1  Walmart Neighborhood Market Broken Arrow, oK Self-check lane   Great Value Chicken Broth Great Value Chicken Broth Med Noodles Tampons (generic) Ramen Beef Ramen Beef Ramen Beef Gogurt St Bn Oreo  Total 9.91 Cash 20.00 change 10.09    someone is having their princess time..   I like that everything was off brand except for gogurt and Oreos. We have our priorities."
CXSA8YM,female,27,"Four years ago today I stood in the winner's circle of a horse race track* between the 8th and 9th race to marry my best friend.   I am oh so happy to be married to such a person as Daniel.   He brought me Del Rancho for lunch even! (yes, the best chicken fried steak sandwich of OKC has finally come to Tulsa! Hurray!)       *i have taken to saying horse race track now instead of just race track. Lest anyone think I got married at some nascar thing. heaven forbid."
CXSA8YM,female,27,"I want my fucking wedding ring back.    I don't know why the fucking hotel maintenance worker chose to come into our room while we were at the beach. And I don't know why he chose to steal my ring.  I don't understand why I couldn't just take the risk of wearing it to the beach and I don't know why I didn't just leave it at home like my intuition told me to do. I don't know why I can't stop crying and I don't know when I'm going to feel better about this, if ever. I just know that if I ever come face to face with the man who did this, I will break his neck.  Some people might think I'm being overly dramatic about this. It's not as if anyone died.  And it could have been worse, certainly.  But I have lost something that was so so important to me. And even if I get it replaced, it won't be the same.  It won't be the ring that we picked out together when I was a newly engaged bride.  It won't be the ring that he slipped on my finger four years ago. It won't be at all the same.  I'm afraid it will always be just a ring.  I want the man to fry but I know he won't.  I want him to confess. I want him to see how stupid it was to use the key card that was registered to his name to come into our room.  I want him to return the ring.   It makes me sick to think of some skank wearing my ring.  Whether she belongs to the fuckass who did this or whether she got it at a pawn shop, I don't care.  I hate her.  Does she see the inscription? Or has it already been buffed away? Does she know that it will never be her ring?  Does she love it as much as I do?  Does she know what the man did to me? does she even care?"
