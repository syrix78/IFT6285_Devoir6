20F3BJZ,female,40,"urlLink On the dairy farm: A voyage into the milky way Herd produces 20,000 pounds a day BY KARA M. CONNERS Press & Sun-Bulletin   NANTICOKE -- The faint smell of manure, drill-like hum of the milking machine and the occasional ""moo"" of more than 500 cows become fixtures of a day that starts at 5:30 a.m. and runs well into the night.   On a recent afternoon, a black-and-white border collie-Labrador retriever mix named Diesel rolled in a sweet-smelling pile of sawdust, tugging on a leash held by 13-year-old Aubrey Whittaker. Aubrey is youngest of the three children who work on the Whittaker Dairy Farm, their parents' 800-acre operation off State Route 26.   Some of the calves, each kept in an individual wooden hutch, crane their necks and lick Aubrey and her mother, Judi, with long purple-white tongues. The 40 members of the young herd chew and lick anyone or anything that walks by the hutches -- it's instinct. Yet the calves rarely complain, unless they need something.   ""Just like a baby,"" Judi Whittaker said, ""the only time you hear from them is when they need something.""   The coarse feel of the calves' sandpapery tongues and wet snouts are conditions to which Aubrey has adjusted since she began feeding the calves last fall. Thousands of flies buzz around the calves' plastic buckets of vanilla-scented milk and sweet-smelling grain. More flies stick to a bright green strip of fly paper draped over a row of hutches.   Scott Whittaker's grandfather, Lewis Whittaker, founded the farm in 1915. Scott Whittaker's uncle Roscoe Whittaker inherited the farm. Scott and Judi bought the farm from Roscoe in 1981. In 1984, when the farm was milking about 100 cows, a fire destroyed two barns and killed 27 heifers.   Since then, the family has built and expanded the farm into a $1-million-per-year agri-business that employs the five Whittakers and three other people. The operation includes a 1.6-million-gallon manure pit and a group of concrete-walled food bunkers. Each cow consumes 100 or so pounds of food and drinks 100 gallons of water daily.   Across a worn path of gravel and dirt, a generator-like machine hums as a line of 20 cows slowly move into milking order. A cow must be at least 2 years old to produce milk; about 250 of the Whittakers' cows are old enough to be milked. The first of the three daily milkings begins at 5:30 a.m. and takes three to four hours.   Inside a cool, metal A-frame building, Keith Yalch of Lisle wears a mud-stained T-shirt and work boots as he hoses the cows' udders with a sterilization solution to prepare them for milking.   A milking machine latches onto the cow's udders like a vacuum cleaner and sucks the milk through a clear rubber tube into a 3,000-gallon steel drum, causing the cow's milk vein to swell like an enlarged intestine. The herd produces 20,000 pounds of raw, unpasteurized milk each day.   After milking, Yalch dips each cow's udders in iodine to stimulate milk production.   Piles of sand-like feed sit near the milking facility. The cows, which weigh about 1,400 pounds fully grown, eat ground corn, cotton seed and a protein mixture. The Whittakers will occasionally alter diets so the cows will produce milk that contains more protein or fat.   A truck picks up the milk daily. Though it's tough to say exactly what dairy product the Whittakers' milk will become, it often goes to a processing plant in Waverly to be made into mozzarella cheese.   The Whittakers have two of the six types of milking cows -- Jerseys and Holsteins. Jersey cows are brown or tan; Holsteins are black and white. A dry-eraser board lists the identification numbers of cows that are in heat, pregnant or sick.   The pregnant cows are placed in a special barn as they wait to deliver. On July 4 a cow gave birth to triplets -- the first time on the farm in 30 years. The family normally doesn't keep the male calves; the bulls are typically sold for beef.   ""When a male is born, their life is generally a lot shorter,"" Scott Whittaker said. Females live an average of eight to nine years.   In each cow's right ear is a yellow or orange number tag containing the cow's birthday, and the Whittakers' herd information. In the cow's left ear is a metal identification tag that's part of the National Farm Animal Identification system, a database that helps farmers track animals' origins and geneaology.   The federal government sets regional milk prices, which can significantly vary from month to month. Currently, milk is selling for $20 for 100 pounds; last year prices hovered around $11. Sometimes it can be an unsettling lifestyle.   ""We really sweat it sometimes,"" Scott Whittaker said. ""Sometimes you are lucky to break even, and sometimes you are lucky to make a little money."""

GJWCU6Z,female,27,"today was the first time in a long time that i've been on time at work.  i think it's because of the time change.  i totally forgot about it until my friend grace told me about it.  oh well.  this past weekend, i've had a lazy kickback weekend.  i'm glad...i'm happy.  the past few weekends have always been busy for me and andy.  it just felt good to just relax!  so yeah, we didn't do much.  just hung out at home.  we rented enough and serendipity.  it was pretty good...we haven't done that for a very long time.    i was actually supposed to go to a birthday party.  we were in carson at the time but i had a head ache so we decided to skip out on it.  oh well.    so today all i did was go to work, sleep and go grocery shopping at some asian store in westminster.  we also went to target to buy my dog some poo pads! :)    tomorrow i'm planning to go to target again to buy the christina aguilera cd.  i actually have an early edition burned copy but for some reason, i want the original.  i'm normally not like that.  if i have a burned copy, that would usually be good enough.  i guess i really like her music.  her new cd is pretty good!    hmm...whatever happened to eden's crush?"
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"well, i just got back from jem's house.  we had a  urlLink surprise baby shower  for grace!  i got to jem's house around 2pm to help her out with decorations and last minute stuff...while i sent andy out to pick up our food orders!  =)   i think the party went pretty well.  it actually got crowded cuz we were worried that not too many people would show up.  grace was really surprised.  she knew something was up but thank god for lynce...she made it seem that there was something going on for her but during jack's graduation party.  she didn't really say it out loud but hinting that there's something going on during his party which is next saturday!  hehe...that's why it threw her off and she ended up being really surprised at her shower!  it was cool.  there was so much food!  my mom is so nice!  well, basically 5 girls hosted the party and each girl had to bring 2 main dishes.  well, andy cooked salmon and i asked my mom to cook palabok.  around 4pm, i was ready to pick it up so i walked from jem's house to my parent's house to pick up the food and i basically hitched a ride back with georgia.  georgia came with me inside my house and i saw my mom cooking a bunch of lumpia!  i was curious as to why she was cooking that!  hehe...she's nice cuz she made it for the party!  she's all like...""i like grace...she's a nice girl so i'm making this for the party!""  how sweet!    we had a few games.  the beer drinking one was funny.  we filled a bunch of baby bottles up with beer and had the guys drink it.  whoever finished first was the winner.  well, janzen (suzette's bf) won!  other people cheated...hehe but they didn't win!  the prize was a huge coffee mug filled with condoms!    anyway, i'm so glad that this surprise shower is over!  it was so much work!  besides...i'm also helping with grace's other (women only) shower next sunday!  poor grace was worried that no one was gonna show up to her shower next week.  we told her that we'd all still be there!  i know she wanted her ""real"" shower to be a big one but for some reason decided to only make it women only.  we just thought it would be nice to invite some old high school friends, ""the guys,"" etc.  yeah...so it was nice seeing some old faces!    tomorrow (today), andy actually wants to go to a bridal show!  we might go with some of his friends.  how weird huh?  well, i told him that i'm not really into it anymore cuz i don't have any use for that crap!  hehe...that was supposed to be a big hint!  haha!  but he still said he wanted to go.  we'll see.  it's already late and i don't know if i would wake up on time."
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"yesterday, andy and i were walking coach to a park close to our place until a lady pulled her car over and said that there was a coyote down the hill.  so, we just walked in the opposite direction back home.  i hate coyotes!  on friday, we went over to national's with my friends to watch the laker game!  i'm not into basketball but i just wanted to go to hang out w/ my friends.  we went to the one in torrance.  i know those places are usually loud but there were these 2 people who kept going at it.  one of the guys were for the lakers and the other guy was for the other team (i forgot who they were).  it was so irritating and they were even putting each other down.  one of em wanted to bet but the other didn't so he just kept making fun of him.  haha...so stupid.  thank goodness one of the guys left after halftime!  anyway, i just liked that place because we went during happy hour...which means half off appetizers and $3 martini's!  their martini's were good!  after that, we went to my aunt's house to drop off these baby shower things that i made for my cousin's coworker's shower.  i'm starting to have a business.  hehe.    saturday, i decided to get a haircut.  i'm not as happy with it cuz it's too short.  i just didn't expect that much to be chopped off.  i guess i'm just not used to it.  oh well.   while i was getting my haircut, andy went to long beach to help his friend move.  i ended up staying at that hair place longer than expected cuz the person i had an appt. with was running late.  the girl that was before me got her hair colored and after she got her hair rinsed, she left cuz she didn't know it was gonna take that long.  she didn't even get a hair cut or have her hair blow dried!  i was also in a hurry but i still wanted her to fix my hair.  =)  by the time i got out of there, it was around 5:30pm.  melani had another baby shower at her parent's house and it started at 4pm.  so, we were late.  and besides, they wanted us to pick chinese chicken salad up at the loft which made us even more late.    i think melani knows the sex of her baby.  before she got the 4d sonogram done, she had a feeling what the baby's sex was going to be.  i thought that same thing too until after the sonogram.  hehe.  so, me, my brother, mel's immediate family, andy, and my immediate family were the only ones who supposedly knew the sex of the baby.  well, someone leaked that information out to some coworkers.  hehe.  so, when they were opening the gifts from the baby shower, they got some clothes that were specific to the baby's sex.  most of the other people (who don't know) gave neutral gifts that are good for either a boy or girl.  that's why they got a lot of yellow stuff.  hehe.  so, i think mel and my brother knew that someone told their coworkers and now melani may have an idea of what it is.  also, my brother and melani were shopping at potterybarnkids and mel noticed that my brother kept looking at the ********** section.  oh well.    my parents should be coming back from philippines tomorrow!  i'm actually excited.  hehe.  they've been gone for so long!  i think this is the longest vacation they've ever taken.  how weird.    now i have to finish up my paper that's due tomorrow.  yuck!"
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"hello.  i spent yesterday at the dmv!  haha...not really.  well, i spent almost 3 hours there.  i have to renew my drivers license cuz it expired back in december.  i admit...i sent in the form a little late but i know that they cashed in my check and i still haven't received anything.  so...i waited and waited for my number to be called.  finally it was my turn!  i thought everything would be done and over with once i made this visit...but NO!!!  the reason why i didn't get my license yet is cuz social security put a hold on it.  it looks like they got mixed up with my last name!  it shows that it's reyes and not de los reyes!  geez...my last name is so complicated.  i can't wait to give it up!  hehe.  so, now i gotta get my birth certificate and social security card.  i just don't have time to spend hours and hours at the dmv.  i wanted to schedule an appointment but the next time they'll be available is the middle of february.  oh well...i MUST deal with it.  i added a class last night.  i'm just taking classes so i don't forget what i've learned in health education.  no big deal!  today, i might add another class!  we'll see.  besides...if i take a class, i get to put off paying my student loan!  =)  after my class last night, my brother called me asking if andy can do a notary.  so, my bro and cousin came over and andy got to do another notary!  hehe...if anyone needs something notarized, give andy a call!"
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"i'm back!  this past weekend, i didn't do much.  andy and i just hung out at home and then visited my parents.  my mom and auntie are going to london so they asked me to go online and book them a hotel room.  i wish i could go with them.  actually, my mom was asking me today if i wanted to go and they are leaving tomorrow.  if i would've known, i would've taken this week off.  now i can't just abandon them with just a few hours notice.  that would be rude!  i miss traveling!  i used to go to chicago and new york every summer when i was in high school.  andy and i have taken a few trips ourselves in the past.  so far we've gone to china, hong kong, hawaii, san fran., canada, and chicago.  that's about it.  i keep bugging him cuz i want to keep traveling but we have to keep our expenses to a minimum.  oh well.  andy's mom is in the philppines right now.  however, she's not there for the fun of it.  she's there cuz her brother (andy's uncle) past away a few days ago.  that is so sad to hear.    speaking of that, my uncle's 3 year death anniversary is coming up on the 13th of october.  i don't think anything has been planned as of yet but that is the day that my mom and auntie will be getting back from london.  i will just visit him with some beautiful flowers."
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"happy new year everyone!    this year, andy and i didn't have any definite plans.  actually...no one we were close to had a party so we just decided to stay home.  i kinda feel guilty cuz for a long time, my mom always wanted me home for new year's.  either that, or be with family.  my cousin usually throws a new year's eve party...so lately, that's where i've been.  there's only been 2 times when andy and i were alone on new year's eve.  i called my parents sometime in the evening just to find out what they're doing.  they asked if i was gonna go over there.  all i said was that there is a lot of drunk drivers out there!  hehe...they didn't argue!  YAY!    oh yeah, andy's friend was having a kick-back kind of party for new years.  to be honest, i didn't wanna go.  i dread the smell!  hehe.  andy's parent's called us and asked us if we wanted to go out to dinner.  they had a card to ""be our guest"" at a steakhouse called morton's steakhouse of chicago in costa mesa.  the card was gonna expire 12/31/03 so they just decided to give it to us.  they couldn't make it cuz they were doing last minute stuff before the new year came around.  i heard that place was really expensive but other than that, i knew nothing about that restaurant.  i called the place to ask what time they closed and to see if they were still accepting reservations.  they said that they were all booked up for the night and even if it was two of us, we still couldn't get in.  so, we gave up on that idea for about 5 minutes.  i just told andy that it was still worth a shot to try.  if not, we'll just have dinner somewhere else.  so, we just got ready really quick.  we stopped by andy's parent's place to pick up the card.  we got to the restaurant and it's true they were all booked...but they were still able to get us in!  we didn't even have to wait.  i was kinda nervous when we got to our table.  i wasn't sure exactly what we'd be able to get with that card.  it's not like there was a specific amount of money listed or anything at all.  it basically just says ""be our guest.""  oh yeah, another thing i was nervous about was if that card was good for only one person.  andy's parents already told us that they used that card before and it was good for everything.  i guess since it was written on the card, i still wasn't sure.  so, our waiter came by and andy asked if the card was good.  he then said just tell me what you want and i'll take care of you.  hehe...i still didn't get all the questions answered.  i was just thinking that we'll just have to pay for just one person if the card wouldn't cover both of us.  hehe.  i kinda felt ghetto too.  the one thing i didn't find too attractive was that before you order, you get a menu and also the waiter would show you all the things on the menu.  therefore, you see the raw meat.  it's not a big deal but it just didn't do anything for me.  haha.    so, for an appetizer we had scallops wrapped in bacon.  we also had salad.  for our main entre, we both had a huge porterhouse steak.  i had my meat cooked well-done.  andy was dissappointed that i did that.  hehe.  i guess i shouldn't have done that cuz they kinda burned it.  oh well.  the inside was REALLY GOOD!  our waiter asked if we wanted lobster to go with our steak, and we were kinda hesitant.  i guess cuz i didn't know what we were covered for.  the waiter just told us that we might as well!!  so, then we went for it.  when he said that, it made me feel better.  andy and i split one 3 pound lobster.  guess how much that costs?  $78.00.  geez!  and for dessert, we had a godiva chocolate cake w/ ice cream!   OH MY GOSH...it was so good!  i'd actually go there just for that!  hehe.   we were both so surprised at how good it was.  everything was actually really good but the dessert blew me away.  so, we finally got the bill.   GRAND TOTAL: $233.00.   that was the most expensive meal i've ever had.  hehe...i'm just a ghetto girl i guess.  the waiter came back and we just wanted to make sure that we were on the clear.  he said that everything was taken care of except for tip.  and then i went on to say that i'll have another porterhouse steak!  haha.  oh yeah...he took our plates.  andy and i didn't finish our steaks.  i didn't even finish my lobster.  i probably ate only half of it!  i was so full.  anyway, he took our plates to put it in a box.  i assummed that everything was in there.  when we opened up the box today, it was only the steaks.  MY LOBSTER WAS GONE!  that was probably worth $20!  geez...what a waste.  hehe.  oh well.  it was quite an experience to go there.  it was fun."
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"today (well, saturday) was such a good day!  andy and i had two parties to go to.  one was his friend's cousin's baby shower and the other was jack's graduation party.  we basically took our time.  we just hung out at home for a while.  i wanted to make sure we got to his friend's house on time cuz we still had to go to jack's in buena park.  so yeah, we got to the first party.  people were there already but it was mostly family.  the rest of andy's friends came shortly after.  time was passing by so we had to get going!  we ended up missing the games and the gift opening.  when we were leaving and already in the car, andy said that we have to come back.  i didn't really know why but i told him that i didn't want to.  he just kept trying to convince me.  i sorta got upset but he said that we can go to jack's party for a while, go back to ross's, and then back to jack's AGAIN!  he wouldn't exactly tell me why...just that there was gonna be a special prize given out at the end of the baby shower.  i didn't really care for that but by that time...i was just like...""whatever!""    so we finally got to jack's party.  after being there for only 10 minutes, andy gets a phone call and he says that we have to go back to ross's house now.  yup...we ended up leaving jack's party but told everyone that we'd only be gone for about an hour or so.  when we got back to the baby shower, they were just finishing up opening the gifts.  ross has a digital camera so he was showing all the pictures that was taken throughout the shower on the tv.  they even played baby music in the background.  it was basically a slide show.  it was so cute!  anyway, after the baby shower slide show was done, it continued onto another screen that said something like this...""mary jocelyn somera, please turn around...""  so, mary turned around (wondering what was going on...like everyone else) and ross was right behind her.  he was holding her hands and made some kind of speech!  very romantic!  i got so emotional!  ...and then he got down on one knee and popped the question!  it was so romantic.  we were all screaming and cheering!  it was such a beautiful moment!  now i know why andy wanted to go back to the party.  he knew about it cuz we told them that we had another party to go to.  so, basically in order to convince andy to come back, he was let in on the secret!  it was so worth it!    he told me that he was so excited that he had butterflies in his stomach!  how cute!  hehe.  after mary said ""yes,"" ross announced that he had another slide show for us to watch.  it was basically pictures of them together, family, and friends.  i felt so special to be in their little slide show!  hehe.  after that was done, there were a few kids that came out of some room.  one kid had a bouquet of roses, another kid had ""congratulations on your engagement"" balloons, and the other kid had a cake!  it was so cute!  i didn't know ross could be that romantic!!!!!!   job well done!  =)  hehe.  that was actually my first time to witness a proposal!  it was nice to have all his family and friends there to witness that special moment including her parents!  YAY!  i think sometimes i get jeolous of couples who are getting married.  one of my coworkers (from another department) just got engaged on valentine's day and i straight out said...""wow...i'm jeolous!""  right after i said that, i was like...""oops...did i say that out loud?""  i felt so dumb!  but when ross and mary got engaged today, there was no ounce of jeolousy in me!  i was and am genuienly (sp) happy for them!  i guess it depends on if i know the person or not.  i don't really know that coworker well enough to really care for her and be happy for her!  hehe..cruel huh?  however, i do know ross and mary and i know that they deserve all the happiness in the world.  therefore, i am so happy for them!  i can't wait...i wanna help out with their wedding plans!  hehe...more bridal shows to go to?  hehe............i had such a great feeling today!  they both made me feel good!  i'm happy that one of our friends is finally getting married.  i've never actually gone to a ""friend's"" wedding before.  hopefully i'll be invited to this one!  hehe!  i found it funny cuz earlier during the baby shower, mary and i were talking about weddings/bridal shows without having a clue about the proposal!  that was the best...  so, after that romantic event, andy and i went back to jack's party.  i got there happy cuz of the proposal!  jack was so out of it!  yes...the alcohol!  =)  he ended up leaving the party to go to sleep!  poor him!  we just hung out at the party for a while and now i'm home.  YAY!  it was such a great night!  i know...i'm too corny!"

We just decided to watch 50 first dates and hang out over there. We were watching the deleted scenes on the dvd and I really really really think my old best friend's dad was in that particular scene (as an extra). I know he was in how stella got her groove back, a home depot commercial, and a popeye's commercial. Well, I'll find out soon enough.   Anyway, my throat was killin' me and I wanted a smoothie to soothe my throat, so Andy went to get boba at Tapioca Express while I stayed at the house. Apparently, Andy ran into my parents because the clinic they were at was near Tapioca Express. How weird! My parents were there for a long time! I thought they were just going through a regular check-up. On Friday, my dad started to have chest pains and was sweating really bad. My mom wanted to call 911 but my dad didn't want her too. He just kept saying he was fine. That's why they just decided to go to the clinic. They did an EKG on him and the doctor said it was abnormal and to go to the emergency room. So, they came home and they asked if I can take them to the hospital. I ended up taking them to the hospital while Andy stayed behind for a while because he had to visit my cousin, Glenn.   My dad seemed fine.....he was laughing and talking! He seemed normal. When we got to the ER, they took him in right away! They also did an EKG over there and they said that it was 99% abnormal and something needs to be done soon. Apparantly, the doctor said he had a mild heart attack. The next step was to do an  urlLink angiogram . Check out the angiogram movie thingy! That's exactly what the doctor told us. There are 3 different ways to fix my dad's heart problem...depending on what the angiogram test tell us. The best and easiest is medication therapy, the middle is the balloon angioplasty/stenting, or the worst case scenario...which is open heart surgery (bypass surgery). Well, he had a blockage on a huge artery! If it were clogged just a little more, he would have a major heart attack! So, yeah, my dad had to have the bypass surgery!   This is how it happened! I was in the ER room with my parents when the doctor was telling us all about the angiogram and the 3 different treatments after the test was conducted. I just put it in my head that there were 3 different treatments and I wont think about it until the doctor tells us the results. Keep in mind...I was sick. I was wearing a tank top and a skirt and I was cold! Andy went to Target to buy me some exercise pants & my mom gave me her sweater! The doctor finally came to get my mom and my brother but I didn't go because I happened to be in the bathroom changing!! After a few minutes, they came back out telling us the news...that he has to have bypass surgery. To be honest, I was kind of shocked! I don't know what the risks are but I could tell that my brother was scared! From that moment, I was feeling worse! I was shivering A LOT! They let us see my dad before he was off to surgery. I really don't know what was happening to me. I knew I was sick to begin with but for some reason, it all just got worse! I had to go to the side to catch my breath, to try to stop shaking, and I was actually trying to hold my tears back. It was scary. So, my dad was off to surgery while we stayed in the waiting room. The surgery wouldn't be done for at least 5 hours and I was debating what to do. I was so cold and I was shivering so much. My aunt wrapped me in a blanket! I was not feeling well. So, Andy and I decided to go back home to get just a few hours of sleep! I took my temp. and it was 103! I was drinking lots of fluids and TRYING to get some sleep! Coach was sleeping with me and I think she was dreaming! She was whimpering a lot & for a long period of time! That's how I woke up! I was kind of scared because I thought that was a sign...that my dad's surgery is not going too well! Well, my brother called me around 2:45am telling me that my dad's surgery went well! I felt so much better. I woke Andy up asking him if we can go back.   So, we were off to the hospital again. We were able to see my dad and he just looked so uncomfortable. He had stuff going through his body and a tube down his throat. My mom felt so bad for him that she started to cry. I think my dad could sense how nervous my mom was...so my dad kept moving when the nurses didn't want him too! My mom ended up going back to the waiting room and we were just trying to calm my dad down. We all ended up falling asleep in the waiting room. Around 7:30am, my family left while Andy and I stayed behind to see my dad while he was awake. We didn't get to see him until around 9:30am and I was so surprised at how alert he was. He said that he already feels better and stronger! That made me feel good. So, we stayed with him for a while and then we finally went home to Anaheim Hills."
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"i'm still awake!  anyway, yesterday, sunday, andy and i went to disneyland....actually california adventure.  we went with a few friends.  our annual pass is going to expire tomorrow!  andy really wants to renew it but i think it's just so freakin' expensive!  we were originally supposed to renew it at disneyland but the line was too long...and we didn't wanna wait.  we MIGHT just send the form in to renew it.  we'll see.    since the line was long (and the whole park very crowded), andy and i went over to california adventure.  we met up w/ andy's friends.  we actually stayed at the park for a long time.  we usually just spend an hour or two over there but this time we stayed longer than we normally do.  it's probably because one of our friends' cousins came along and she's from japan!  we had a lot of fun!  their ""who wants to be a millionaire"" show was cool.  you actually have a chance to be in the ""hot seat"" and win prizes.  if you get a million points, you win a disney cruise!  so, we watched a few shows and went on a few rides.  we went on that one water rapids ride.  we saw how soaked a lot of people were from that ride so someone came up with the idea to pay whoever gets wet the most $1 each.  (there were a total of 7 people in our group).  well, guess who won that money?!  I DID!  haha...i was soaking!  it was fun though."
GJWCU6Z,female,27,"tuesday march 18, 2003, coach turned 1 year old!  tuesday march 18, 2003 marked the year anniversary of andy and i living in this condo.  what a coincidence huh?  we moved in anaheim hills the same day that coach was born!!!!!  it was meant to be!  haha.    so, tuesday, we decided to feed coach with her ""wet"" dog food.  she usually gets so excited when she's having that food...but we never let her eat until we say ""GO!""  so, we wanted her to stay for a bit while we sang ""happy birthday"" to her!  hehe...i know, corny!  well, we sang to her and it's like she was singing with us.  but in actuality, she was whining and barking cuz she wanted to get to her food!  i just thought it was cute cuz it was like she was joining in on her song!    today (friday), andy and i decided to work only half of the day.  actually, i had to prepare and go to a meeting all the way in san bernardino.  that meeting ended at 2pm and i wasn't about to drive all the way back to long beach.  so, andy also decided to work half day so we can go to disneyland.  we met joey and kristina over there.  kristina had to leave early cuz she had to work that night but joey wanted to stay with us cuz he wanted to watch the aladdin show.  so, we watched it and i really liked it!  it's probably cuz i've always liked that movie to begin with!  if you're not really into it, then it might not be worth the wait.  yes...there's a wait to watch that show...in fact the line gets so long!  also, you have to get the tix in advance!  if not, you're screwed!  hehe.    after disney, we went to sam woo's for dinner.  i kinda got grossed out again cuz i saw chickens and ducks already cooked with their heads still on!  i saw that when we first got in that place and already got grossed out!  it was already fried and everything!  well, when we were leaving, i decided to look at it again and i saw another one at the bottom!  it was even more scarier to me because it didn't looked cooked!  i took one look at it and i had to turn my head and look the other way cuz it was disgusting...only cuz i'm really sensitive to that (and YES, i hate it when people mock me even more when i'm in that situation!)  so, being grossed out and kinda scared, all 3 of us walked out of the door.  as i was walking out, i had my phone in my hand and it vibrated!  i got so scared...but at the same time...it was funny!  hahaha.    last night, i bought 8 mile uncensored at best buy!  i actually bought it the day it came out (tuesday) but i didn't know they had 2 versions.  so, now i have to return the regular one at wal mart.  oh well.  i've never actually seen that movie in the theaters but i still decided to buy it cuz i love eminem.  there's something about him that i like so much.  i've never actually bought (only burned) his cd's.  when he first became popular, i knew his lyrics by searching for them online--and then eventually i would memorize it.  hehe.  andy was so surprised cuz i normally wouldn't listen to rap!  anyway, last night, i tried to watch it.  i was really tired so i didn't fully get into it!  i'll have to watch it again.    today, the kids were supposed to spend the night.  they asked us last week and of course we said ""yes!""  so, we called them but no one was home!  haha...they stood us up!  oh well.  it's okay...at least i'll have more rest this weekend.  besides...tomorrow i'm supposed to go with mary and kristina to a few bridal salons to check out some wedding dresses!  how fun!  i can't wait till i get engaged...dragging along some of my friends to help me find the perfect dress....in my new mercedes!  hahahaha...only in my dreams...as real as it may seem!

Because, sadly, I am not ready to trust that you will not hurt me again as you have done.  One day I may be ready to accept that risk but all I know now is that we are done, except that we are still having wonderful sex.   Because you my dear have the most gorgeous penis.  And I normally don't care much about them.    So, thankyou for the lovely lovely sex we had last night.  I anticipate that I will keep having lovely lovely sex with you until I find someone else that I can play with.  And I am looking.  Because that is who I am."

Chances are he has forgotten all about this blog and won't find his way to it.  But just in case he does, I would like him to know that I am not saying anything in here that I don't say to him.  We drank some nice red wine and sat around the table and talked for hours.  It was good.  It has been a while since I have felt that connected to him.  But we are still over.  So over.  As over as you can be when you are sleeping together once, twice, sometimes three times a week.  He stayed here last night and it was lovely to wake up to him this morning. Normally he leaves before the morning (if my children are here I prefer that). He is so warm and so gorgeous.  And I am not posting this here because I think he might be reading it.

QL8MXNB,male,27,"""tripped out"", being   dearest lord of the vaguest ramblings, your discourses and tidbits work like mouthfreshener for me. by saying that, i do not mean i really follow every meaning you describe, but your words are comfortingly fresh. i dig that, like ""that's the shit"" only an inflected tone can convey.  for this piece of mine, i choose words to respond to one statement in particular, that you chose to highlight as your understanding, in the piece titled ""shaking off the chains"".  i cannot speak for musicians, as i have only ever appreciated the kind, and never been one among them. but to pursue a creative art of self-expression, is something i understand as universal.  all that apart, this bleary-eyed monday-morning head was most piqued to read a remark, such: ""I believe that a person drinks or does a drug excessively only if he or she greatly prefers that altered mental state to normal sentience. Put simply, excessive tripping is a sign that you're not happy with what's in your head, with yourself .""  it seems to me, that the state of being 'tripped out' has been left unsatisfactorily described. of course, before getting to the state itself, there are several issues that need clarification: for one, the issue of ""excessive"" indulgence. in what context is this ""excess""? and who is to determine how much is ""excessive"" for every and any one?  i have known, and in fact been (over earlier days) in, the out-of-conscious state with drug/alcohol amounts that are by no standards much; on the contrary, the least amounts could get certain minds way out of control.  agreeably, ""excessive"" indulgence implying regular consumption, does decrease the relative effect on a mind over time, causing an increase in need (or craving) - for the sake of attaining a state off-handedly identified as a ""higher"" state.  the point i disagree with is that a mind needs to be necessarily discontent with the self in order to indulge excessively in intoxication. if the 'altered state-of-mind' can be identified (as a bio-logical reaction), and the effects therein comprehended clearly, this state-of-mind can, i believe, serve to work wonders. (to define such a state can seem and sound really hollow and pointless, as, who is to explain how what-i-mean really feels like?)  but i must attempt defining this 'altered state'. in my opinion, the feeling most commonly understood as a drug/alcohol-induced 'high', is nothing but a 'higher state of consciousness' (as a bio-logical effect of a sedated nervous system, and increased ""sensitivity"" of the individual mind).  most minds introduced to this state of increased sensitivity get driven into spiralling private pre-occupations of the self. such pre-occupations can last over life-long experiences, and really depend on vaguely defined (and oft misunderstood) references to functioning modes of the individual mind: issues like the sense of self-criticism, logical reasoning, mental balance, etc..  if the mind experiences such a state in an open environment (physically, this could mean open skies and nature, or even in the act of love-making), the mind might be able to broaden its understanding - over partners, known people, other people, people in general, and probably even the world.  in such a state, when the sensitivity of a mind is at its peak, expression turns out in the purest form known to it.  what struck me most in your message that accepts musicians getting 'tripped out' before making music, is the apparent cluelessness regarding the cause and effect of intoxication. (now, alcohol versus natural substances versus hardcore drugs is a discussion apart altogether)  the bottomline IS a state of mind. this can be described by most people as simply ""getting high"", explained by few others as an ""elevated"" state of being, and most commonly misunderstood as 'smashed', etc .. if the mind loses all control.  having scripted this piece, i find so many unclear statements, and vaguer allusions, herein, that i now so dearly wish i'd written this after smoking a big phat joint."
QL8MXNB,male,27,"Life carries on, you know? The point is, will you?  I have found it's very easy to be cheesed off and contemptous about the 'system', but then, where's the action? Either you break away completely - and I mean completely - or you choose to find a niche from where you can sustain your own idiosyncracies and maybe fight from within. Everything else is a cop-out.   Just clinging on apathetically in the interest of sustenance and confining your own expressions to a small incestuous circle of insiders - that doesn't make sense. Yes, anything really new and creative will probably only have a parallel audience at first. But go find that audience, don't just get caught up in the equally empty confines of some safe 'underground' niche.   I am slightly groping for the concept I'm trying to express. Expect more clarity as I achieve it."
QL8MXNB,male,27,"The important thing is not to confuse the need to learn with the need to believe. Many areas of human knowledge - history, for example, are not absolute pronouncements of fact beyond a certain surface level of detail. A responsible scholar refrains from presenting absolutes where there only certainties and uncertainties of differing magnitudes.   Sadly the number of irresponsible, axe-to-grind proselytisers, reactionaries and apologists putting out their counterfactual persuasions in the name of spreading information gets larger everyday.   It's important to retain the ability to critically assess every supposed 'fact' we are presented with, to examine the validity of each arguement we come across. There may be no absolute truth - but there are certainly a wide array of definite untruths jostling to capitalise on our credulity.   Perhaps the ability to recognise misinformation is even more important than the ability to find information."

Then there is no duality in reality, no reality as we now define it, as a compromise or a dim reflection or a limited fact, limited by its own objective existence. Then all is ideal.   Rich or poor? Just choices. Happiness or misery? Just passing fads.   All this may seem  frivolous, hedonistic to us now, grave, grave-bound, flesh-bound earth-crawlers that we are.  We are so used to holding to ideals despite reality.  Imagine how much dearer, clearer and truer all these ideals will become when there is no obstacle, no 'ground reality' to soil their logical, fantastic progressions.   ==  There will be backsliding. There will be transition.   Given eternity, neither decadence nor irony will be tenable for very long. Exposed for the hollow stances they are, these props will be cast aside.   All this is well and good for you and me, the transcenders.   The disappearing ones.   But what about the inevitable second generation, the ones who never were, and will be forever?   Because there will reproduction. The cycle will carry on. The wheel will turn. It's what wheels do.   What then?  ==  What comes next is The Future.   =="
QL8MXNB,male,27,"urlLink Dinesh Rao  has a good  urlLink guide  to second-hand bookstores in Bangalore on his blog.   To which I'd add:  The man who runs the pavement bookstore near Coffee House now has a store in Shrungar Complex, the commercial complex next to Coffee House. He has a pretty good range of books, similar to what you'd find in Blossom, and somehow manages to have an excellent selection of science fiction. I understand that he's been given the floorspace free for a trial period in which he has to prove that his is a profitable venture. So show him some love, if you're in Bangalore and want to pick a good book, cheap.   This brings me to something that's often bothered me: going by the fact that most bookstores in town have a reasonable sf/f section, and that I'm not buying every single book that they stock, there must be someone out there buying genre fiction too. But they never seem to go shopping at the same time as me - everytime I'm at a bookstore, I'm usually the only person at the sf/f shelves (apart from the odd Tolkien-seeker).   So if any of you are the other people out here who buy and read this sort of stuff, stand up and be counted, damnit."

2XYKSTV,male,35,"I sat & watched as the drips of water dripped off the edge off the over hang. I listened to the random rhythm of the drops as they fell to the ground. Then I took notice of something. Some of the drips were synchronized!! Then I thought, what are the chances of that? One hundred & thirty seven million rain drops, hitting this over hang, all at random, then forming random streams that flow to the end of the over hang & drip random drops. Yet! There is synchronization!! Order! A pattern!! IT'S A MIRACLE!! YES!!!  No! ...It's mathematical. They are not synchronized because they are being controlled by order, they are synchronized because there are only so many seconds in a minute & in that one minute, 180,666 drops must fall on that one little over hang. Mathematically, synchronization must happen. It would be more of a miracle if no two drops happened at the same time.  Look at yourselves as raindrops. If a million of you pray that your best friend gets well and he does, you think, ""THAT IS ALL THE PROOF I NEED! THERE IS A GOD! THAT'S THE PROOF!"" But, when you consider the fact that a million people are praying over the same situations, a sick friend, it would be more amazing if EVERYONE that was being prayed for DIED! Now, when you point out to the person of faith, incidents where the person being prayed for does die, Then the person of FAITH say's, ""It must have been God's will."" Well, here is a question. If there is a GOD, Isn't everything his will? Can his will be changed by mere mortals? Aren't prayers futile? It makes no since. I would like to see at least ONE person of riligious faith state. ""I believe in GOD, but I don't believe because it's the logical thing. I just believe & that's all there is to it. I will not enter in to an argument of reason & logic with this belief, because, it does not fare very well in such an exchange.""  You see, the Gods cannot live in the confines of the RATIONAL mind. That's why it depends on FAITH. If God could be proven by science, then FAITH is worthless. Once you accept that your belief is fueled by FAITH ALONE!!! Not human logic!!! Then you can start trying to understand what the make up of Faith is.  This is why the atheistic view will always win the rational, logical, conscious perception debate. It runs parallel to the age old Chaos V.S. .Order debates. CHAOS (Atheist) vs ORDER (Religious) Chaos (NO GOD) allows the possible existence of order & synchronization, but recognizes it as just a small fiber of Chaos & Random. An anomaly if you will. Order (GOD belief) does not allow chaos & random as a possibility. For chaos & random just appears to be chaos & random, but only if you take them out of the context of order as it’s all encompassing origin. Chaos & Random, through this perspective, are believed to be just a part of ORDER . You see? This is the proposed argument! If Order (GOD) is the origin of ""what is"", then chaos & and random are actually planned and are, there for, just tools of order & synchronization. They are not what they appear to be! They are not, in fact, chaos or random! So there is NO chaos! & there is NO random! There is only order! & that suggests a divine plan, an architect to all that is around us! A God perhaps!  That was a nice perspective but let’s get real! Check this out! If Chaos & Random (NO GOD) is our origins, then that opens the door to ALL possibilities, including, the occurrence of Order & the occurrence of Synchronization. Now, can order & synchronization exist if it's just a part of Chaos & Random? YES!! Now, Can Random & Chaos exist if it's really just a part of order & Synchronization? The answer is ....NO! Because you can't be outside of order & synchronization (GOD)! If that is the all encompassing cause. But, you can be anything if the all encompassing cause is chaos & random. Since we have no proof of origin, then it makes more since to embrace a philosophy that is open to ALL possibilities, as opposed to embracing a philosophy that closes off valid possibilities! ............................................!!!!"

I found an old journal of mine kept when I was sixteen.  Instead of the typical agnsty clap-trap, I was shocked to find a fairly sophisticated (and pretentiously composed) examination of the ""two of me"" problem lots of teenagers face.

70JA3EM,male,16,"Oh, it's happened. Shortly after one Margaret Sanger was called a whore by my very slightly overreacting pal Jetpack, Mattson slammed the statement, saying ""it was the most catholic thing ever"" with obvious distaste. Being, as I was, there, I took immediate offense but kept my mouth shut.      Turns out the Hobster wasn't too far off. This woman is a bit worse than anyone expected. She herself was highly promiscuous and had many lovers. She favored ""free love"" for women without any sexual limits but without the burden of children. She saw ""the marriage bed [as] the most degenerating influence in the social order.""      She was a overriding feminist. My two cents on feminism:   the movement, along with birth control and abortion, come about as a liberal attempt to give women the ability to be as sexually promiscuous and relatively irresponsible as the men they couple with. It calls to mind ""Harrison Bergeron,"" but with a separate twist. Everything possible is done to make everyone as similar as possible. Believe it or not, men and women are different! Realistically, all men are  not  created equal; this is the logic behind affirmative action, which I personally support. Since, like the lady with the shotgun in that short story (can't remember her title), we cannot easily limit the male ability of promiscuity without consequence, we must therefore instate the ability in women as well, since two wrongs happen to make a right in this case. Unless, of course, we argue that sexual promiscuity is not wrong...      Feel free to challenge me down that deadend road.

70JA3EM,male,16,"Today was an idyllic summer day. I can't say I accomplished anything, but I had fun.  Upon waking up, I showered and headed up to the Oselands to see what they were doing. After some arguing, we agreed on swimming. Then, we couldn't decide on where to swim. I wanted to go to the Point, and Chris wanted to go to Grand View. Erik didn't care, but it was his turn to drive today. After I pointed out to Chris that he lived on a lake and it would be stupid to go to Grand View, he said he would be right back. I went back to reading  Auto Trader , only to hear a strange noise a few minutes later. Erik burst into the house, and attacked me with a leaf blower, blowing things everywhere, while Chris stole my keys, wallet, and phone. Then, they left me at their house for an hour while they went to Grand View.  A brief interjection about GV: It really sucks, if you haven't been there. The tourists there are always of the rich asshole variety, and everyone is condescending to you. I don't mind going in the winter but in the summer it is really unpleasant. As this is the weekend of the Fourth, I knew it would be packed with Tourons from the Twin Cities.  When they got back, we went out on the boat on Nisswa Lake. At first we swam, but after a while we just drifted around the lake in the boat, enjoying the day. While doing this, we discussed the parade and the BACP. I have to work tomorrow, but Chris and Erik said that they would be would be marching with them. I don't think that I would anyway, because I am mad at them for bowing to pressure. Really, BACP isn't a group of people looking to stir up trouble. It is just a bunch of middle-age hippies looking to placate everyone. When I first went there, I expected to see revolutionaries, people seriously committed to far-sweeping social change. Instead what I got were people who only wanted unconditional peace. It is something I agree with, but I think that they go about their methods wrong. However, I applaud their courage to show their displeasure with the current state of affairs in front of 50,000 (according to the parade organizers) red-blooded, short-sighted, naive Americans on the day when you are supposed to be showing your love for America. If I get to the parade in time, I will give them my whole-hearted support. I won't, however, march with a group of people who bow to pressure. The whole point of the coffins were to bring home the realities of the war to people. We protest the war because it came around under  false pretenses . There is no evidence of WMD's, no evidence of an Iraq-Al Queda link, no threat to our nation. The reason these soldiers went into combat is because they thought America would be attacked, and it wasn't going to be. I know Saddam is a bad guy (Even though some of his worst atrocities, including the Kurdish massacre, are now being refuted by the  CIA  and the British government). However, that doesn't mean that  tens of thousands  people should die to get him out of office. Look at the consequences of the war. Can you really say America is safer now that it was when Saddam was in power? Is Iraq safer? Absolutely not. The ill will we have brought upon ourselves by invading and occupying a soverign nation is horrifying to think about. Not only did we occupy Iraq, we also humiliated Iraqis. The Abu Gharib prison scandal has set back relations with the Middle East decades. The Red Cross said 90 percent of the people in Abu Gharib were innocent, that some of them were being held for things such as traffic violations, and that the Army didn't even keep track of where which prisoners were held where. Iraq is teeming with suicide bombers, different fundamentalist Islamic sects, and American war profiteers. Iraqis hate Americans, and 80 percent of them want us out of their country  now . This was a war waged for oil and money, and instead of putting together a cohesive message that this is an unjust war, the BACP gets wishy-washy and chooses to send out a unconvincing message that war is not the answer. This is their biggest chance they'll ever have to send a message to the people, and they weaken it so as to make it to not make an impact at all. Sure, you'll have your conservative hecklers, your liberal supporters, but you won't sway the undecideds.   Anyway, let me move on.   After we drifted around for a couple hours we went to Rafferty's, and had some breadsticks and lemonade. I didn't even have to pay, as Chris got his first paycheck yesterday. Right around the time we left it started to pour. So, we repaired to the garage for an evening of mindless entertainment. The Oselands have two garages: Gail, and Poop's shop. I use the word garage loosely, because Poop's garage has a stage for concerts, complete with PA and instruments, an office, bathroom, and big screen TV. It also has your more traditional garage things. I hooked up some video games, Erik banged on Mike's beautiful new Pearl drums, and Chris somehow managed to hook my iPod into his record player/garage sound system. We played video games and listened to Wesley Willis all evening. And that brings me up to here.   I think I am done now, so good night."
70JA3EM,male,16,"Last night, I stayed at Bryce's house with Chris, but as usual there was a bunch of other people over there. If you never have been there, Hotel Olshanski is quite a nice place. We had fun, etc, etc.  I'm home now, which I guess is all right. It is much hotter here than at my grandma's house.  Due to the heat, I am don't feel like blogging. Nonetheless, I shall perservere over it and continue.  I was driving today, and Chris made some off-hand remark about Bush. It made me think of the kids at my school, because it sounded just like something a Bush basher would say.   Man, I can't stand people who hate Bush to look cool, so they look like they care. It gives me a headache when people only argue that Bush is stupid. The ignorant scenesters should get the hell out of political activism, because they suck.  Inform yourself . Much of our strength resorts in our willingness to solve things in a civil and informed manner, without name-calling. If you are going to call Bush a greedy fascist, by all means, do so, but make sure you have the  facts  to back the names up. Otherwise, you just hurt us. Blind liberalism is just as bad as blind conservatism. Fact of the matter is, we aren't always right. No one is. We can't set prominent liberals on a pedestal and act like they have no flaws. Case in point: Michael Moore. I am not Rush Limbaugh, and you aren't Bill O'Reilly, so don't act like it, ok?  It goes  much  deeper than George Walker Bush, and all you have to do is look.  Caught up on Derby's blog a few minutes ago. He was talking about stuff he bought, and one thing struck me as particularly interesting. Wearing a Che Guevara T-Shirt to a high school: what a romantic notion. Now, that sounds incredibly sarcastic, I know, but it really is. Think about it: passively mocking all the kids, without them even knowing it!   Nothing screams, ""I am a revolutionary,"" like wearing a shirt with Che's face on it, no doubt purchased from a mall.   I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.   But if you think about it, it is neither tired or cliche. Che's story no doubt mirrors our own. We start out as idealists, who are going to change the world. Some of us will be Fidel Castro, who stay behind in the (relative) safety of Cuba, and some of us will be Che, who will go to die in the jungle of Bolivia for what we believe in.   Who's going to run Cuba? Who will be gunned down by Bolivian Rangers?  Anyway, back to my original point: high school sucks really bad, and every day people passively rebel against it's depressing conformity. Derby, wearing a Che shirt. I don't want to mock  all  the people who attend BHS, because a lot of them are actually cool. However, majority of the people who go there are assholes who only care about getting drunk and following the latest trend. High school is basically training us not to think for ourselves at all. As long as you set the groundwork for social- and government- acceptable goals in high school, you're ok. Hell, if you pick on people who are different than everybody else, you're ok. High school is all about repressing the individual inside us, keeping us inside the comfortable and easily attainable goals our friends and relatives set for us.   Anyway, this is getting kind of long-winded and vague, so here goes: You can't buy rebellion from a mall, BHS sucks, and don't live your life according to the expectations of others.   Every day, someone new becomes disillusioned by their surroundings, and one more person is converted to the Revolution."
70JA3EM,male,16,"Father's Day. I didn't do anything with my dad, as I gave him his present yesterday. I woke up around two, showered, and headed out to my grandma's house. After no less than four of my relatives insinuated I was a girl, my mom vandalized my car. I  did , however, get some pie. Then, I left.  I've been playing guitar a lot lately. It seems to be an even better catharsis than blogging. Listening to music is probably the only thing that is more cathartic to me than guitar. I enjoy it, the simple task of setting my fingers in the right place for a chord. Instead of approaching the guitar with the passion for music I have, I instead started trying approaching it as a student, a workman. This seems to have improved my guitar playing, so I'll stick with it.  Due to me waking up late, I didn't get much accomplished.  I went to the late show with John and Pammy. The movie was  The Terminal , and I enjoyed it, even though it grated on me at the end.   Terminal  is a very sterile movie. The shots themselves remind me of a airport, clean and orderly, with a comforting conformity to everything. This bothered me throughout the whole movie. It does fit quite well with the movie, but you think such an acclaimed director would try something new and original. I suspect that good actors and scripts have led people to believe that Spielberg is a better director than he actually is. Tom Hanks is good in it, as usual. The awkwardness between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones  almost  felt real. It always bothers me when movie relationships seem natural, especially when the people first meet.   So that was my day.  I also was a Groundbreaking Documentary, both on Tickle and in real life twice as ""The Josh Mattson Story"", and as the crazy Hannah stalker video project (I don't know the real name).  Oh, and according to Tickle, I value religions that encourage open-mindedness.  I hope it is nice out tomorrow. I'd like to go swimming.  What is going on now? I don't really know anymore. I never have had a strong sense of self-identity. I just always believed I was what I was. Now, who knows? My life is like a living version of  Catch-22  where no one knows what the hell is going on. You know, I'm cool with that. I no longer fear the uncertain as much as I used to. I'm on a plateau, waiting for a big change.   I've always intellectually realized that I could die any time, but in my heart I don't really believe that. I can't imagine dying  ever . I'm not talking about my so-called immortal soul, I mean my physical body. It is hard to brood on something that seems so far away. But hey, when I was a little kid I figured I would be dead long before I was 16. Time plays funny tricks. Maybe in a short while I will realize that I am 40 and long to be 16 again.  Who wants to grow old? For that matter, who wants to grow up? I loathe responsiblity and I imagine that I always will.   Change  is the dirtiest word in any language.   On Chris Derby's blog: El Jefe: Holy Shit you are a whinner. I dont know you and I already hate you Chris: Fuck You Josh: That shit's wack, brah  I'm  much  too arrogant to fall into self-loathing, and Chris shouldn't either. We've had our differences, but he isn't such a bad guy. I used to hate everything too, until I realized that shit isn't going to change if I sit around and hate it so I might as well accept the things I can't change.   I'm glad I can go back and edit posts. I just deleted all of this here.  In other news, I hate pinball.  I hate it when you see people, but then you realize that it is just someone who looks like them. I go up and greet friends all the time only too realize that I don't know the person.  Well, I finished  Kavalier , which was quite good. I've now started to finish  Neuromancer , by William Gibson.  I've got nothing else to blog tonight, Raow."
70JA3EM,male,16,"Today was an inconsequential day, with nothing important happening, and only one thing that was funny enough to mark.   Hey, I'm done with Chemistry, and I did suprisingly well on the final test. The true final isn't until Thursday, but that is just busywork.  Me and John went to the Bookstore and the Salvation Army after school today. I got the new Spin (the price was raised from 3.50 to 4 dollars, which sucks), and I got a brand new copy of the Autobiography of Malcolm X for 35 cents. That rocked, because my copy was lost years ago one time when I moved. John kept trying to surreptiously make me listen to ""Iron Man,"" which I would have no part of.   I'm thinking about expanding the Joe Day concert into a full-blown documentary thing, but I won't have enough time to finish it before school ends and Joe is getting antsy for it. Plus, I've already got a documentary-type thing going on this summer. It's kinda a vanity thing where I just tape stuff and take a bunch of pictures. I already started, and I think I'm going to use some of the stuff I taped before the concert on Friday that won't make it onto Joe's concert tape.   John and I took the Goat Halo match one step further today. We went to my mom's to deliver the message that we accepted the challenge, and found no one home. So I wrote down the message, and John had a great idea. I took a knife, walked over to the mail, and stabbed the message to a package with the knife. It looked really funny, and I bet it annoyed the hell out of my mom.   I got the Minor Threat complete discography this weekend, and I like it a lot. I don't know why, but I've been gravitating towards hardcore more lately.   What is up with no one blogging? Come on. I know you have longer attention spans than me.  Saw Chris Derby at the show on Saturday. He kinda grated on me, and even Chris picked up on what his deal is. Every time I see him, I just want to tell him that existentialism is total bullshit, and how you put your name to your religion isn't as important as he makes it out to be.  Tomorrow is the last full day of school.  I'm still doing the year end review thing. I really wish you'd email me yours. I'm hoping to post them all on Friday, and I'll bother you all about it for the next few days. Make them about whatever you want. The people you met, movies you saw, stories you heard, fun you had, books you read, anything. Make them as personal or as boring as you want. I don't think you guys realize that you can type whatever you want in this white space, and it can be as self-serving and mundane as you want. Make them long, and have fun. But please do them. Email them to me at badreligion015@hotmail.com. Thanks. P.S.: Don't tell anyone what yours is going to be about so they are all different.  Speaking of books, I borrowed some good ones from the Hobster. I am reading Guns, Germs and Steel right now, and I think it is very interesting. I am also reading this sci-fi book I picked at random off Dan's shelf and it is so-so. I'll read it though, because every other book I have borrowed from there has been good. I usually read a fiction and a non-fiction book at the same time, and I usually go through the non-fiction faster.   Man, that poem we read in English was awesome. It creeped me out sufficently enough to enjoy trying to understand it.   The Casualties are on Warped Tour this year. Man, I can't even begin to think about how long Chris and Erik will go on about that. You should have heard the ""Guard Dogs"" jokes they were shouting on Saturday night.  In case you haven't noticed, I like to progress from the mundane to the personal on here.   On Sunday night, I was watching the Simpsons, and it struck me that the Simpsons is really becoming overly partisan. Not just Bush-hating, but dealing with real issues like massive corporate media takeovers. But anyway, there was this part where a teenager walks up to a cliff, yells, ""Why did you cancel Futurama?"", and jumps off the cliff. I, of course, thought of Hobie, and I laughed so hard I fell off the bed. It was the most perfect moment, because I laughed until it made me happy. For a few seconds, I felt invincible. But it was special to me because it felt like innocent unforced humor, something that you don't encounter normally in the halls of BHS.   My mom just called me. In retrospect, the knife thing was goddamn hilarious. My mom said they took some pictures and stuff to prove that I am nuts like they've always suspected.  Can someone find out how to use italics on this? And put in pictures? I've been trying to figure out how for a while now.  Until later."
70JA3EM,male,16,"Despite the best efforts of Nate Lucas to fix my camera, it is unfixable. So I am just going to buy a disposable one. I haven't took any pictures yet this year.  I hate how it is either too hot out or too cold out. I wish it would just stay one way.  Got into a few arguments today about punk and Halo. I was going to write about punk today (what with me being called a ""psuedopunk"" today and all), but I decided not to. I'm ok with myself, and I don't need to defend my punkness to other people.  My CD Adapter broke today. That is the worst thing that has happened to me in a while. I don't know how long I'll be able to listen to the Power Loon until I freak out and drive off a bridge.   (maybe if someone would give me the money they owed me)  Anyway, I read this on punkrocks.net today, they're talking about Troy: aaronfeibus (7:53:10 PM): be tru to the story dogg kevwad (7:53:28 PM): yeah aaronfeibus (7:56:39 PM): like an almond aaronfeibus (7:56:42 PM): almonds dont front aaronfeibus (7:57:02 PM): theyre like ""yeah we are dry and wrinkly on the outside"" aaronfeibus (7:57:11 PM): ""...but bite into us and we taste damn fine""  Funny."

QIT2ZPP,female,15,"so he did call yesterday. at 10. and i noticed 2 things. 1. even though i was mad at him, just hearing his voice calmed me and made me feel better 2. it was painful for me to hear him cry and assume that it was over"
QIT2ZPP,female,15,"i was looking through the old emails today. from my michigan people. from my pershing people. from people i do not see or talk to anymore. so i (naturally) started crying/thinking. how does one let go? rags brought up a very good point. you do not ""lose"" someone if you can still remember them. but if you haven't kept up with them, people change, and aren't they as good as a stranger to you now anyway? you don't really ""know"" them if you've lost touch. and the friendship can't be there after all these years. heh i'm like the communist govt. of china: new era=destroy the past... but i want to reconnect with some of the old people. i know, i know that sounds really idiotic of me... but these are the people that i grew up with, the people that shaped my childhood, and in some ways the people who have helped me to find ""self"". i have the email adds ready, so only one question is hindering me: do they still remember me?  oh well, there's only one way to find out.  >.<"
QIT2ZPP,female,15,"i can't believe we didn't rush home to blog about the first day of sophomore year.  then again, i can.  tired as crap.....dont have time/energy to say anything except that only freaks do this to themselves.   buy the TPP!!!!!  i think one rob rumble put it best: (even though he ended buying the TPP from VARUN of all people)  ""Josh, you are my inspiration for this piece.

""American Beauty?""  I still remember when i watched the highly acclaimed movie ""American Beauty.""  I kept having one thought: i have never seen many people who take themselves so seriously.  Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, begins the movie speaking from the grave, about his middle-class life in the suburbs. He speaks of how his life isn't the life of a white picket fence, a little house, and a nuclear famly.  And it sure isn't! Lester is int he deepest pits of personal pain.  why wouldn't he be?  He quits his job, buys a 1970s muscle car, begins lifting weights, smoking pot, and develops an obsession with one of his daughter's classmates.  Lester is in a crisis because ordinary American life wasn't extraordinary enough.  The story of ""American Beauty"" is a story that tells us that things are seriously wrong.  Simple beauty masks serious sorrow.  We have six percent of the world's population and sixty percent of hte world's wealth, and yet we are seriously unhappy.  Unable to move forward in our lives because we are just plain too depressed to keep going.  And we flock to see movies because they are so seriously serious about the excessive seriousness of our lives.  But i wonder if we haven't missed the real beauty of America.  Why is it that studies by the United Nations reveal that around the world at this very moment one billion people are saving money to move to America? [Jane Says...: poor bastards] Do they want to come here so they can book passage on the Good Ship of Psychotic Misery? Why should people who have the many privileges we do spend so much time trying to believe that AMerican Life is the thing of harshest dramam rather than the obviously beautiful? [Jane says...: with wealth comes frills, with frills come fringes, with fringes come knots that are really hard to get out]  So why do people take themselves so seriously these days? Well, if you look around, you know it starts early in childhood.  Did i say childhood? Parents today treat their children as special adults.  No wonder, when we continue to have smaller families, then all our hopes are wrapped in fewer little bundles.  Each child is very important, very special, and very serious; they are one of a kind, god designed.  childhood.  things are far too serious for childhood. A child's life is set a birth.  Planning for adulthood transcends the great events of childhood.  Why play outside when you need to be studying vocabulary for the SAT? Why watch a movie, when you should be volunteering for good works to put on your own personal web page?  We are all going to end up in college [uh...really?], but in order to get into the ""best college"", we have to forgo childhood to prepare for that serious world of adulthood.  and children want to taken seriously; their nature is to seek attention.  They soon learn if they act like little adults they will be taken seriously, very seriously, and they learn earl to do something serious and blatant to get attention, and they will suggest that everywhere you look you see some of hte most seriously silly things possible.  A trip to any school reveals this.  Consider, the Goths.  No, i'm not talking about the barbarians that Burned Venice and i am not making fun of them because they are different.  I am making fun of them because they are silly.  Why do we have to take seriously a group of people whose only claim to fame is dark clothing,e ye shadow, hair and nail polish?  They are into being taken seriously.  they live for depression because they seriously think that their life as well as every else's is worthless.  They like dark and evil things such as death and the devil.  Isn't that serious enough for you?  And if they aren't taken seriously enough, they can listen to serious rock music about how depressing their lives are, pack up their guns, and some serious pipe bombs and head off to Columbine High School.  Yes - they can make you take them seriously; ask the friends of the ten students and the taecher that can really explain what it means to encounter people who only take thmselves seriously and are onyl attuned to themselves.  They block everyone out, and lay waste to anything that does not see them as the only show in town.  And we take these please for attention very seriously; in fact, we take everyone too seriously.  Most of us regard ""political correctness"" as a trite nation.  It isn't.  there is an ugly undercurrent to this thing called diversity - it forces us to seriously consider all ideas and all people.  We take every idea seriously.  Nobel laureate or nutcase - they are all seriously valuable.  no they aren't.  we don't have to take seriously ultra conservatives or racist groups.  but we dont have to take seriously today's celebrities either.  fame in Hollywood, and all of a sudden we have to listen to them? because thye are famous, they must be heard?  reagardless of what you think about George Bush, Madonna and the Dixie Chicks [I BEG TO DIFFER] make him look like a bright guy [has anyone read bushisms?].  At the Academy Awards, Micheal Moore won an oscar for best documentary, but he decided to use his speech to convey his anti-Bush feelings.  What drove him to use that forum? on something that has driven hollywood performers to use that soapbox for 50 years - inflated egos.  We will take them seriously. and sure enough Micheal Moore got a lot of media attention.  But when we create a society of where everyone is fighting for 15 minutes of fame, we end up believing we should listen to everyone whoever appeared in People magazine.  Listen as if they had soething important to say.  As we become so puffed up with our own self-importance, we drown in our own artificial seriousness.  our society becomes more lacking in common sense, more humorless. [rather, i think debate is to blame]  and we always do think about ourselves.  But we don't know that our personal dramas are not hte only dramas on a larget stage of life.  there are other people out there - and we seem to ignore where we really fit in.  we should be able to take a back seat sometimes, to listent o others and when we stop to smell the roses, let's not whine that those thorns hurt us worse than any thorns every hurt any really sensitive soul.  take a moment to look and laugh.  in our adult childhoods, put some childish humor back into the adult life that we artifically create.  i'll give you an example: tied in the serious serious exercise of all time - one New York Universty applicant put down 100 items he had supposedly done in his life, each more absurd than the one before.  He is the fastest sprinter in the world, but he didn't perspire, he baked and these rolls rose without yeast, world leaders sought him out, he skied in the Mojave desert, was the first to chart the human gnetic code - and after reading 10,000 applications that seriously told the same story of serious life choices - the admissions committee let him in.  And why not? He probably will be sought out by world leaders some day because he had some mental health.  Life cannot be all ""mememe"" our neds and this listen to me first mentality make a mockery of a society that depends on humane interaction with others.  our self-centered society has caused us to take ourselves too seriously, we sink into the dark theater of our self-imposed depressions.  and the road to perdition is the highway of own self-absorption.  the real ""American Beauty"" is a beautiful place [only if you make it....or others make it for you].  A billion people struggle to get here and the ones who are here are so acught up in their petty dramas, they miss the larger screen of life.  ----fin------  well, that sounded like that old psycho david johnson. whine hwine whine. GET OVER IT! you wanna tell me what the larger screen of life is? alright.  point is, there is no big picture. it was all a lie. it's about hte little things. get a garden. grow some weed. smoke it. then go grow some tomatoes and give them to me. :-D"

QIT2ZPP,female,15,"ok, i suppose i'll finish this up. i realy dont want to though...AHHHH. ok...where was i . oh right...wednesday.  more dismalness in class...but by this time we all thought that it was too late anyway, and we might as well get some rest in class. haha ie, sleeping and listening to music.  we got some work back.....i never got my headlines back. booohooo. lol. let's see, what else did i get back. oh right, my captions. hahaha man the girl in front of me (sarah, she reminds me of elizabeth gardener, both in personality and looks, but she's nice and i liked her) saw my paper ands he was like ""man, that is al ot of red haha"". she was right. lol...but i was sort of pissed off because she said that like everything i wrote was an opinion. ok, how is this an opinion? ""bellaire students work really hard."" begeezus...........lol. oh, and then she told us about editorials: ""dont write them unless ur sure u can change the situation."" wow. journalism, defeated. and we didn't even WRITE them. the only real writing we did was feature writing, but nobody got done cuz we had like only an hour and no sources. geez....  oh, but that night was the journalism olympics. ok, ok, i know that sounds hilarious. hahhaa, ok it DID. when eleanor heard that she was going crazy. heeheeeheee. i thought it was like ""sit down and write a headline"" sort of thing, but it was actually like....a physical thing. there were different relay type activites.....or team activities anyway and it was soooo wesome. besides the constant threat of west nile and really annoying teams from hick schools, we did all right. but the yearbook ppl suck mother beacuse they made their own team and abandoned us. in fact, most of them didn't even play. grr...so us tppers made our own team and were really aesome...but haha we were in third to alst place. not enougg to win, not bad enough to get the booby prize, which was AWESOME. (silly string) but kumar and david heaton stole some anyway s o we had fun. dumped ice on the head judge guy, and sprayed him with silly string when that didn't work. ooh...but here's how pathetic ""journalism"" camp was.  everywhere we went, we were reminded of the yearbookjs. besides the camp being put on by Taylor, we did YEARBOOK spreads in beginning newspaper. haha, and then for the spirit prize at the olympics, we were told to yell out yearbook as loud as we could.....man and it was funny, everyone was yelling yearbook and we're all screaming and jumping at the top of our lungs....""NEWSPAPER!!!!!!!!!!!"" haha everyone got it akick out of it but those losers still didn't give us the prize....grrr.  oh well, it turned out all rignt. ooh...but then that night we watched ""the ring"". me and liang that is....on my computer. man dude that si a FREAKY movie. that's why i dont like scary movies...but i can't deny that it was good. nice, suspenseful, but it just had a few plot issues and was hard to follow if u weren't paying too much attention. there was a lot of foreshadowing though so it was really really cool to be light ""[lightbuld pops] and THAT's why..."" lol but me and liang were scared as crap when we saw it. her roommate fell asleep and dint want to see/hear about the rest, and mine had seen it efore and went o bed in the middle cuz she was like ""i cant see that again"". but me and liang saw it and OH MY GOd. the scariness....haha after it was done we were talking for awhile...and then she started commenting on the ligt that was coming from under the door and shiningo n the wall and i stuck my handundre the bed tio make a shadow and i dunno why but i got scared up my ass and scaremed....ands he did too...haha. ohh but the funniest thing was when she got out her flashlight cuz we were sorta creeped out by the dark, and she flashed it right in my face and u know the whole ""ringy"" nature of hte light creeped me out the crap and it scared me soooo much.  ooh but the next day on the way home, we watched it again and naeem said the ring video looked just like a tool video. *shakes head* anyway....  so not much is up. me and eleanor went to UH yesterday. we gt alot of stuff done......haha i counted my cards today and ther were exactly 100 cards. haha no tags yet, but HEY! eleanor hasn't counted her cards yet either so there...........wow this is going to be AWESOME.  oh, no we still ahve to make an aff. dammit.  oh, but while we were at the library, eleanor was trying to avoid hari, bc she was ""out of town"" so i was keeping her company and trying to keep her cover, but i think everyone ntoiced cuz we tried to run out of there and everyone saw ""someone"",and i told them it was my friend beverly crank. haha...niec drug reference huh?  but anyway now he's i dunno, prolly pissed off at me and telling raghu all this shit and crap.....very vaguely too i might add so it's just so stupid cuz now the whole rebuilt trust thing is like tumbling down and UGH UGH UGH. stupid hari. i can't say i've been the most civil person but geez this just sucks monkey. not only does he now believe i STARTED the mitchell thing just because mitchell was an idiot, and thought that josh was yelling at me when it was my DAD. geez what a pathetic loser. now i am going to go back to the zooj ust to freaking SPITE him. lol. but now raghu thinks i said all that crap about him, and about yue, and geez......ok fine let hari be mad but do NOT screw with my friends............aiya and now raghu assumes i started the whole ""situation"". dammit dammit dammit.  i have to do more world history.  jane  sleeping till 4 aint bad."

KFXLXX0,male,35,"urlLink Sydney Morning Herald : ""...an average of 13 attacks had been launched each day against occupation forces during the past 45 days, totalling roughly 585...  The commanders believe that the spectre of the deposed leader and his two sons is fuelling the growing resistance to the American occupation.""  So the U.S. believes that the reason they are under attack (500+ attacks so far) is that Iraqis still fear Saddam Hussein. If Hussein were dead, they figure, their job would be easier.   Why isn't anyone suggesting that the reason why they are under attack is that they  are not wanted  there? That would seem to be a more logical explanation. Things are worse in Iraq, not better, since the war started. As well, American troops have been heavy handed with the average citizenry (house to house searches, hands above your head, on your knees, blindfolds, etc.).  Don't get me wrong. If I was a U.S. soldier in Iraq, I wouldn't trust anybody. If you let your guard down, a six your old child can throw a grenade at you. But if I was a resident of Iraq, I would hate to have troops pushing ""innocent"" people around. Or pointing guns at me on a regular basis. Or opening fire in a crowded market. Or just making me feel like a piece of dirt in my own country, while the leaders of the troops sleep in Saddam's old palaces..."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"Have you ever wondered where the origins of the name  John Doe  come from? So did I. Thank goodness there are people who have the time to research such things -- I am not one of them.  There is a web site, called  urlLink Word Detective  that has the answer to this question. According to them:    It turns out that the ""John Doe"" custom dates back to the reign of England's King Edward III, during the legal debate over something called the Acts of Ejectment. This debate involved a hypothetical landowner, referred to as ""John Doe,"" who leased land to another man, the equally fictitious ""Richard Roe,"" who then took the land as his own and ""ejected,"" or evicted, poor ""John Doe.""  These names -- John Doe and Richard Roe -- had no particular significance, aside from ""Doe"" (a female deer) and ""Roe"" (a small species of deer found in Europe) being commonly known nouns at the time. But the debate became a hallmark of legal theory, and the name ""John Doe"" in particular gained wide currency in both the legal world and general usage as a generic stand-in for any unnamed person. According to Mr. Dickson, ""John Doe"" and ""Richard Roe"" are, to this day, mandated in legal procedure as the first and second names given to unknown defendants in a case (followed, if necessary, by ""John Stiles"" and ""Richard Miles""). The name ""Jane Doe,"" a logical female equivalent, is used in many state jurisdictions, but if the case is federal, the unnamed defendant is dubbed ""Mary Major.""    Well, you learn something new every day! Scott"
KFXLXX0,male,35,"urlLink New York Newsday : ""'The assistant captain at the controls collapsed,' said Councilman Michael McMahon. 'By the time the other captain could get control of the ship, it was too late.' According to McMahon, the crash was related to 'health problems and medication' -- reportedly for a blood pressure problem.""  If this holds true, that the cause of the ferry accident was that the captain collapsed because of a medical condition, then the New York ferry system has to take some of the blame in not preventing this.  One way it could have been prevented would be to have two ""captains"" at the helm, so that if one gets ill suddenly, the other can take over in an instant. Another would be to monitor the health of the captains on a frequent basis (say, a full-physical monthly), and remove any that show signs of poor health such as high blood pressure."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"Yesterday, while riding my bike through the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), I saw a movie set for Cinderella Man. I had never heard of that title, so I assumed it was nothing special.  According to IMDB , the movie is directed by Ron Howard (wow) and stars Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. Russell Crowe is an idiot, but I wouldn't mind bumping into Renee Zellweger...   By the way, the scene I saw being filmed had dozens of old 1930's style cars. At first I thought it was some type of auto show, but all the cars were basically identical, so I wondered ""who would want to pay to see 50 identical cars""?   I bet those cars aren't worth very much, because there more than likely just golf carts that have an old ""Model T"" looking body over them."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"There is a new TV show called the "" urlLink Jamie Kennedy Experiment "", and it is hilarious. (I say new because tonight was the first time I've seen it. I just discovered it's in its second season.) The basic theme has been done before --- place a hidden camera, throw in an actor acting weird, and watch people's reactions. Like Candid Camera has been doing for 50 years. But this guy, Jamie Kennedy, takes it to a whole new level.  On Candid Camera, the premise isn't that funny but people's reactions generally are, so they play the same joke on 30 people. ""The coffee cup starts moving mysteriously... Oooo!""   On this new JKX show, it will take 10 minutes for me to explain the joke they played on ONE person. The episode I saw was hilarious. Not just a chuckle either, this was a good ""belly of your stomach"" laugh. I hope more people discover this unique show."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"I was thinking about something this morning on the subway, coming in to work:   Will Science ever be able to prove the existence or inexistence of God?   In 40 minutes of thinking about it, I could not think of a way. 10,000 years from now, when humans have reached beyond our own planet and perhaps even beyond our own galaxy, there will still be no way to prove God doesn't exist.  This line of thinking might have been triggered by a star trek episode, where Picard sets out to prove this chick who claims shes the devil (and is about to enslave a planet) is actually just a liar with advanced technology.  Picard's way of proving her wrong is that he was able to reproduce every ""trick"" she could perform, and eventually the enterprise found her ship and power source and she was defenseless.  Well, no such luck proving God is a con-man. But could we disprove his existence by replicating his tricks? Not so easy. If I could create a planet, that would be impressive. If I could create a new galaxy, I might be able to fool people into worshipping me. But who created me?  It's the old chicken and the egg scenario. Which came first? In reality, the chicken evolved slowly from some other animal, and so you can say neither came first. But who created us? Who created the universe as we know it? There can only be one answer.  Scientists have tracked the history of the universe back to when it was only 1 one-billionth of a second old (or something like that). They say they can't go back any further, because the laws of physics as we know them are not valid due to intense heat and pressure (millions of degrees celcius).  So, science can never prove the existence or inexistence of God. We will never know. If we live 10,000 years, we will still not know. If some entity shows up claiming to be God, and can create new planets and galaxies, we don't have the luxury that Picard had -- we can't replicate his tricks, so who are we to say he's not the real God?  Or (to go back to the star trek analogy) what's the difference between a ""Q"" and God? For humans, none."
KFXLXX0,male,35,"What the heck ever happened to Bobby Brown's career? I mean, he was Mr. 80's. He seemed like he had it all -- success as part of a group, and success alone. Married one of the most popular female singers of that time, Whitney Houston. Not that her career is any better. She continued to have hits into the 90's though, which is better than Bobby Brown can say. Mind you, the last five years have not been kind to either of them.  Now they look and act just like an old trailer-park couple -- I imagine a lot of stuff gets thrown about that house. A lot of empty liquor bottles in the recycling bin too.  Would they have turned out this way if they hadn't met each other? Would his career still exist, and would she still be considered one of the best female performers?"
KFXLXX0,male,35,"This is  urlLink a nice article . In many ways, it tempts me -- you can certainly earn more having 15-20 clients than just having one. And you are less likely to be affected when your contract doesn't get renewed, as has happened to me twice recently.  But there are down sides too. Like, how would you ever be able to take a month off with 20 clients? What about calls at 8am, and 8pm? I'd need to set ground rules up front.  I'm not too keen on giving phone and email support for free, although I think it's very difficult to charge accurately for it. Still have to think about that one...."

I'm the type of person who stays up until 4am if he doesn't have to wake up the next day, and there have been a few days lately (like today) where I have no early appointments and I can sleep in.  The only problem is, the phone rings at 9:00am. That, in and of itself would not be a problem, because I can answer the phone and usually fall back asleep. But then the phone rings again at 10:00am, and after that, I'm up for good. So 6 hours of sleep will have to do today."

7MRDHB1,female,23,"dude, hello 2am, it's been a looong afternoon/evening.... i think mostly because i've been so many places with so many different people in the last 12 hours  church was at 7:30 tonight and i left super early since traffic was sooo bad yesterday, but it was all good tonight, no backup at all... go figure... paul came to church w/ me again, only drove himself this time and met me there... he plans to show up for easter too.  good friday and christmas eve were the two services a year that completely freaked me out when i was little (christmas eve b/c of the hot wax from the candles everyone gets at the end of the service, good friday b/c of the dark and loud noise at the end)... now it's symbolic, unscary, but reflective and thought-provoking.  after church, rather than show up at jared's for no-math night in a dress, i went home, cleaned up the mess i made getting ready and changed into normal clothes and showed up at jareds... leigh's sick, colleen's home for the weekend, trevor just picked up and went to paris yesterday (it's trevor, don't ask), john disappeared for the weekend, and i was 2 hours late on account of church so the crowd was sparse... i got there and sam, eric, jared, and scott were sitting around the dinner table chatting about random stuff... i helped them eat the leftover portabellos from dinner and we all had ice cream (well, everyone but scott who we're all pretty sure is hooking up with jared's housemate vicki)... it was nice to be there, chat for a bit, but not be in the middle of a huge crowd... small group relaxed time... completely ideal!  after ice cream, jared and sam were going to watch some random dvd that i had little interest in, but eric and me rented jerry mcguire last night (neither of us had seen it before), so we took off to my place and watched it (starting at like dude... 11pm)... just finished and both of us loved it and give it 9/10 on the new mooovie ranking system. =)  now, after overanalyzing everyone's life in the department with eric as usual, i'm off to read myself to sleep... exciting eh?  later dudes, good night to all y'all."

There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven & going to the tomb, rolled back the stone & sat on it. His appearance was like lightning,  his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook & became like dead men. The angel said to the women, ""Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.  He is not here; He has risen just as He said!  Come & see the place where He lay.

A3N10A4,male,23,"PROTESTING THE PROTEST   Initially, I decided to leave Mr Sexton's  urlLink account of the Sproul protest  alone, mostly because spring break came along, love was in the air, and I was spending too much energy being happy about this:     (if you don't want to hear him, tell him to make bad movies . . . you know, like bo derek and shannen doherty do)  Anyway... as I said, I had planned to leave it alone, but Mr Engberg's "" urlLink news analysis "" came along after Sexton's, so it's time to have some fun.  One of the implications here seems to be that the anti-war movement (in Berkeley or wherever else, it isn't clear after a while, there is a part-for-the-whole implication on Engberg's part here) is being anti-troops.  First of all, any rational thinker, not to mention rational observers of the anti-war movement in action (whether direct at a street corner, or through a lit candle) can tell you that opposing the war and administration policy are thoroughly different from non-support of the troops.  Engberg doesn't draw on any specific evidence regarding non-support, other than ""ranting"" and ""raving"" by speakers from the rally.  (where's the, um, ""analysis""?)  Attempting to give him as much benefit of the doubt as possible, perhaps he is referring to the yellow-ribbon episode described in Sexton's earlier piece: Surrounded by the peace activists, members of the Berkeley College Republicans distributed yellow ribbons as a symbol of support for the U.S. troops. They were able to hand some off to opponents of the war, while others of the protesters jeered and derided the troops. Some anti-war activists took the yellow ribbons, threw them on the ground and stomped on them repeatedly. Others took the basket filled with the ribbons and hurled it across the plaza, causing many of the small yellow ribbons to fall to the plaza ground. Is it within the realm of possibility that the actions taken against the ribbons by some at the protest may have been a response to what amounted to an attempt by the BCR's to look for trouble and create a scene, all while cynically using our men and women in Iraq as pawns for their politics?  Part of supporting the troops is trying to get them home as soon as possible; they're not the ones who dragged us into this foreign policy debacle.  Quoting a Republican freshman doesn't reinforce the argument any further.  A longer discussion could center around the idea that the campus protest movement is a bit iconoclastic when it comes to ""patriotic"" symbols like flags and yellow ribbons.  But anti-symbol doesn't necessarily mean anti-patriotic.  Perhaps, also, a realization of the worldwide implications of our current action in Iraq renders the protest movement bigger than just an issue of American patriotism.  This idea is certainly relevant to the situation in Berkeley surrounding the 9/11 anniversary several months ago.  Ooh, speaking of 9/11, from Engberg's final 'graf, on how we should all join hands, sing songs and support the war gleefully, says: ...Remember the three-week bipartisan lovefest we experienced after 9/11? Why did it occur? It occurred because abnormal times mandated a deviation from normalcy. Under normal circumstances, our nation is divided strictly along partisan lines. We often forget that we are Americans. Now, however, the time has come to remember once again that we are not identified by the party we vote for, but by the country we live in... Engberg seems unable to understand how we could unite after 9/11 but not after this war starts.  What's the difference between 9/11 and the Iraq war?  We united after 9/11 because  we were attacked !  We were not attacked by Iraq, we have never been attacked by Iraq, and no evidence exists showing Iraq to be an imminent threat to our security!  (just yesterday, the discovery of white powder - gasp! - turned out to be, well,  urlLink explosives , again not our promised WMD)  There are many other reasons why there is not unity behind this war, but that one seems to stick out the most.  Oh, and  urlLink this too .  (hmm 764 Iraqi civilians killed in just over two weeks, I have a feeling that's better than Saddam's 2-week average over the course of his rule . . . just a thought, read into it at your peril, hehe)"
A3N10A4,male,23,"AT LEAST SEXTON WAS COHERENT   Ahh, another April, and with it, another edition of the   urlLink Patriot  .  Let's see what particular fish can be found in this springtime barrel.  Right off the bat, from the  urlLink editor's note , we run into problems.  Of course, given that most of these articles were written in mid-late March, perhaps it isn't fair that references in their articles to the ""beacon of democracy"" Iraq is becoming have to be compared to current news from Fallujah, Najaf, Ramadi, Sadr City, Kirkuk, and elsewhere.  But now we find  Patriot  EIC John ""some civilians were killed"" Cise treading in ridiculous waters.  Though he does get credit for spelling ""Punxsutawney"" correctly, even though later in the article, ""two"" becomes ""to"". Wait, who would have thought that in April, John Kerry and George W. Bush would be swinging at each other like they are now? Maybe because Kerry still cannot find a position on issues that is not poll influenced, or the relentless criticism the President is receiving from the anti-war left, television stations are reaping a bonanza in political advertisements and no newspaper reporter is going to lose his job. Aww!  What cute right-wing paranoia.  Though I'm sure  urlLink Richard Lugar  will be happy to know that the  Patriot  considers him part of the anti-war left.  Next, a line that wouldn't have been written if this piece had been written more recently, leading into the next paragraph: But what about this torrent of attacks? Is it at all warranted? As we examine in this issue, John Kerry has a history of taking to [sic] sides to every issue. When he claims that he “actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it,” referring to funds to help rebuild Iraq, the rational voter has to wonder where he actually stands on not only this, but a whole host of issues. Of  course  the rational voter won't know, if that's all you tell 'em!  If you also inform them that 1) Kerry didn't want Bush, a spending freak who can't be trusted with a budget, to have a blank check, 2) Kerry wanted to fund Iraq by repealing part of the Bush tax cut that went to the richest Americans, and that 3) In general, people who call themselves ""wartime presidents"" ask the American people to make sacrifices, usually including some tax increases to pay for the war effort... maybe they'd have a fuller view of the situation.  But who am I kidding?  This is the  Patriot  we're talking about!  They're a ""well-respected"" student journal dedicated to telling the  whole story !  To finish up his introductory piece, Cise uses that classic  Patriot  rhetorical trick, summed up as ""Damnit, they're wrong!  And I'll tell you why: . . . well, actually I won't, but they're  wrong !"" However, unlike the current criticism of Kerry’s waffling, the attacks on Bush’s handling of the war on terror are not fair. Led by the recent charges from Richard Clarke, Bush’s, Clinton’s, and Reagan’s former counterterrorism chief, the attacks on the handling of Iraq have risen to a new peak. Now that he’s promoting a book, Clarke seems to have forgotten that he did not speak out at all in the lead-up to the war. Encouraged by some Democrats dead set on convincing everyone that democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, Clarke and others have continued to relentlessly trumpet the same claims over and over; claims that are invariably not true.  Take the claim that by invading Iraq, the President neglected the war on terror. Proponents of this opinion claim that the fall of Saddam Hussein will only encourage more people from the Middle East to develop a new hatred of the United States, leading to more terror attacks on the United States and its interests. However, they ignore the possibility that by creating a beacon of democracy and freedom in the Middle East (and yes, the United States will stay in Iraq until it happens), that other oppressive, U.S. hating regimes will open up; that hearts and minds will be changed by universal freedoms. First paragraph first:  Richard Clarke did not speak up publicly in the lead-up to the war because he was still a member of the White House staff, trying to exert some sort of influence on administration policy.  He wasn't writing a book or testifying to a then-non-operational 9/11 commission back then (a commission Bush initially  opposed , by the way... flip-flopper!).  Richard Clarke was a part of the lead-up to the first Gulf War, and he describes it on page 62 (Obviously Cise has read the book, and can follow along): By contrast, Bush and Baker knew that the thought of an American army going to war with an Arab nation could be enormously damaging to America's image in the Muslim world. They believed that the only way to inoculate against that damage was by extraordinary, unprecedented diplomatic effort and coalition building. Both spent long hours on the telephone for months, building and holding together the elclectic coalition. They knew that for that alliance to stay united, they had to demonstrate that they had taken the time and given Iraq every opportunity to avoid war. It could not just look that way, it had to be a really exhaustive effort to achieve a peaceful outcome. Only then could American forces go on the attack, along with the militaries of seven Arab nations.  Their historic efforts are in marked contrast to the go-it-alone, hell-bent-for-war policy pursued by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney twelve years later. Perhaps Clarke stayed on the team because, you know, he knew what good pre-war diplomacy looked like from experience, and was hopeful that Bush the younger would pursue a diplomatic strategy.  It was only after Bush dumped the UN negotiations altogether that Clarke left.  Nice try, John.  Second paragraph:  ""Proponents of this opinion claim that the fall of Saddam Hussein will only encourage more people from the Middle East to develop a new hatred of the United States..."".   Will ?  I'm pretty sure that opponents of the war are criticizing Bush because invading Iraq  already has  helped al Qaeda's recruiting, creating a new generation of terrorists faster than we can catch or shoot them.  And of course, at this point Bush claims that the June 30 deadline for transfer is  urlLink firm , and will not change, so depending on your definition of ""be there"", John might have another problem.  Of course, if Bush changes his mind and extends the deadline, wouldn't that be -- gasp! -- a  flip-flop ???  And the final pargraph: It’s time for John Kerry and Richard Clarke to stop the illogical criticism of the President’s handling of the war in Iraq.  The President did the right thing by removing an evil dictator. Freedom and democracy in Iraq are all but assured, which is nothing but a good thing. It's time for John Cise to stop the highly,  highly  illogical and fact-free criticism of those who oppose the President's handling of the war in Iraq.  And if freedom and democracy in Iraq don't seem all but assured given the events of the past week, just wait until June 30, when we get out prematurely, and set the stage for a factional civil war!  (In that case, Cise's comment about ""freedom"" is correct if you think about it in a Hobbesian sense)"
A3N10A4,male,23,"CONGRATULATIONS,  PATRIOT !   You have been chosen as #13 in Pandagon's 2nd annual  urlLink Twenty Most Annoying Conservatives  list.  Well, you and campus conservatives in general.  Jesse's analysis is pretty damn accurate: I think the saddest part about the rise of campus conservatism is that it shows you can master mediagenic conservatism by the time you're 18, with no real loss in shrillness or intellectual rigor. The half-life of angry, reactionary politics with no real point is apparently limitless.  This has been the year of the campus conservative...in much the same way it's been the year of the Milwaukee Brewer. Whiny, loud, and shameless, they've managed to start pushes at several colleges per year to complain their way into prominence.  There are 10 rules to being a campus conservative:  1.) Complain how you're shut out of every forum on campus by going to every forum on campus and using it to complain, prominently.  2.) Complain about how your professors are liberal, even though they grade your work fairly and accurately.   3.) Complain about the use of academic ""buzzwords"" in course descriptions without having actually taken the course.  4.) Complain about how much everyone else is complaining about your complaining.  5.) Complain about how nobody debates any ideas while strictly limiting your debate to telling everyone else that their ideas are horrible and shut out the ideas you can't actually elucidate.  6.) Complain about how the cable system doesn't carry Fox News, and complain when you get it but someone else signed up to watch Monday Night Football.  7.) Complain about campus oppression, and then inaccurately throw activist buzzwords at every liberal you can find.  8.) Complain about how you can't get spaces or funds to bring conservative speakers to campus to complain about the lack of conservative ideas on campus, ignoring that the space you wanted was taken months in advance by other groups.  9.) Take Econ 101. Complain about everything in barely informed economic terms.   10.) Complain about every stupid thing done on campus in terms of liberalism, no matter how apolitical it is. Bonus points if you can blame oversleeping for your 8:30 class on Paul Krugman.  See how easy it is? And it takes advantage of the natural talent that every collegian has, regardless of race, creed, income level or background: bitching about shit.

Tarek writes: Most disturbing, then, is the possibility that, to exercise the free speech rights of a conservative is to indict, intimidate and harass others exercising their rights. Many of the statements made by new right-wing journal editors cleave closely to the ""everybody is a leftist, so it's my turn"" philosophy, but they are making an assumption that is false: There has always been room for more than one belief, and your belief doesn't need to destroy or defeat another belief to get recognition.

A3N10A4,male,23,"SEXTON: RECALL BUSH!    urlLink Oh, that Steve Sexton . It may be too early to determine whether Tuesday�s landslide victory for Arnold Schwarzenegger marks a GOP realignment in California. Well, since Arnold ran much more as  Arnold  than as a Republican, and since both Republican-backed ballot initiatives  urlLink went down in race-baiting flames , I would file some sort of political realignment in the state in the wishful-thinking circular file. Democratic opposition to the recall was predictable. But the lengths to which Davis and Democratic hacks went to subvert the will of the people are telling. Thirteen times they went to court to try and stop the recall, which 55 percent of voters approved Tuesday. Republican opposition to the twice-elected Governor Gray Davis was predictable.  But the lengths to which Issa and Republican hacks went to subvert the will of the people are telling. In their defense of Davis and their opposition to the recall, Democrats have sounded outright undemocratic. It was Davis who quipped on the campaign trail that Schwarzenegger shouldn�t be allowed to be governor because he pronounces California as Caleeeforneeea. How does that show Democrats being ""undemocratic""?  I'm sure all those women would have voted not to be groped, but anyway.  Look out, Dorothy!  Here comes a strawman: On Wednesday, lamenting Schwarzenegger�s victory, Califonia Congresswoman and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Tuesday a sad day for our state. �It shouldn't be that public officials have to watch their backs every moment for fear of recall,� she said.   But that�s exactly what we want: politicians watching their backs, not straying from the will of the people. We want accountability in governance and the recall gives us just that. Pelosi�s vision of a government that isn�t accountable to the people, should scare us all. That Davis thinks an accent is a greater disqualification for governor than five years of failed leadership should anger us all. Um Steve, contrary to your apparent belief, it  is  possible for elected officials to be held accountable by the people without the possibility that a former car-thief might bankroll a partisan power-grab.  It's called elections.  From the sound of it, Steve could also draw the conclusion that President Bush is, therefore, not being held accountable, and should be subject to recall.  He shouldn't have to ""watch his back"" for something like that, right?  Then, watch Steve as he gets a little star-struck and confuses special effects with actual executive leadership: And of course, as they are prone to do, they gave us another dose of puke politics. Failing to formulate a vision they could sell to Californians, they resorted to the politics of personal destruction. This time, though, they went up against a man too big, too strong to be brought down.  On Tuesday, voters said the greatest state in the country deserves a great governor. I can see Mr Sexton, in the MTV studios, screaming with his highest head-voice, as Carson Daly introduces Arnold to TRL.  (of course, Arnold would then introduce his hands to... oh never you mind)  And by the way, what did we hear about a ""vision"" for California from Arnold?  Other than an ""audit"", which happens anyway, and a promise to ""clean house""?  From the NYT's post-recall editorial: The exit polls did not shed much light on the California voters' feelings, except their profound sense of irritation. A sizeable chunk of the Schwarzenegger voters said they had voted on the issues, but agreed that he had not really addressed them. The strategy was essenially ""just stand around and look like Arnold"".  And that's good news for me, because ""just stand around and look like Dennis Miller/Kelsey Grammer"" wont work next year.  Now, on to 'Ton's final graf: Arnold Schwarzenegger may be the man to lead a realignment in California, much as another movie-actor turned politician did 30 years ago. Together with Tom McClintock, Arnold and the Republicans garnered 62 percent of the vote on Tuesday�a sign that California will make room for a California Republican Party that makes room for moderate Republicans like our governor-elect. Awwwwwww!  I'm going to save this paragraph, and keep it with me for around a year.  Because somewhere in there, Arnold and his advisors are going to look at the budget in a sober fashion, realize the McClintockesque budgetary fantasies are just that, and they will propose a tax increase in some form.  The anti-tax  jihadists  of the Cali GOP will definitely fall in line, because Steve Sexton said they should."
A3N10A4,male,23,"NOTES FOR BARRON   There is no direct link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.  If the Bush Administration had any positive information indicating a link, we would have heard about it by now.  They tried the travelling fellow who stopped in at a hospital in Baghdad, sorry, no dice.  (as if Atta and the other hijackers didn't go to the health center while in flight school in Arizona, please)  They tried a mythical meeting in Prague between Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi agent, sorry, no dice (except in Bill Safire's head).  Yet many Iraq hawks in the media and elsewhere make a deceitful, disingenuous argument that Saddam and Al Qaeda are one and the same.  Such nonsense is found in the  Patriot , no doubt.  Certainly Kelso ""Since we've given peace a chance, three thousand Americans forever lay dead on the southern tip of Manhattan"" Barnett is guilty of spreading such nonsense.  And now  urlLink Mr Barron  joins him.  On Representative Barbara Lee: Recognizing the backstepping among Democrats from the war they and the rest of Congress overwhelmingly approved in October, Barbara Lee has stepped to the plate once again to demand an end to all this crazy war talk.  ""Calling the president's justification for a pre-emptive attack against Hussein's regime 'a statement of extreme arrogance and illegality,' Lee said at a Capitol press conference that the Bush doctrine 'undermines any moral authority of the United States in seeking peaceful resolution of any conflicts,' the Chronicle reports.""  This is just absurd.  Did al Qaeda give us any warning before they attacked us? Oh, but maybe good ole' Osama will be polite enough to drop the White House a telegram next time he tries to kill thousands of our people and decimate our national confidence and economic vitality.  (emphasis mine) Again, the usual confuse-the-issue nonsense.  Once more, for the record, a quiz . . . In a recent statement Osama bin Laden said what of Saddam Hussein? A) ""my ally in jihad"" B) ""a hero, a humanitarian, and a heck of a guy"" C) ""a socialist"" D) ""the only thing we have in common is that we were both on Bush's daddy's payroll"" (answer: C, although D does apply)  What's so frustrating about those who push the non-connection connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda is that such irresponsible thinking has spread so widely.  From Tuesday's  New York Times , the  urlLink last two paragraphs  on a piece about recent Iraq poll numbers: Although Mr. Bush's statements at his news conference last week appear to have increased the nation's support for a war, he apparently did not succeed with one argument: convincing more Americans that Mr. Hussein had a role in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  The poll found that  45 percent of Americans said Mr. Hussein was ""personally involved"" in the attacks , a number essentially unchanged from a month ago. (emphasis mine) The fact that almost half of Americans think Saddam was directly involved with 9/11 means that both the press and the administration are not doing their jobs.  Wouldn't a student-run publication like the  Patriot  be idealistic and honest enough to make the case for war completely on the merits, rather than resorting to the cultivation of fear and confusion by falsely combining two very separate issues?  Guess not!"
A3N10A4,male,23,"ANGEL BREWER GETS TIRED HALFWAY THROUGH FALSELY SMEARING THE CANDIDATES, TAKES A NAP, WAKES UP 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE DEADLINE, SAYS ""FUCK IT"", AND JUST SLAPS SOMETHING TOGETHER  Either Angel's really lazy, or really likes Edwards and Kerry.  You decide.   At least, that's what I'm guessing happened with  urlLink this piece , in which the records of both Wesley Clark and Howard Dean are blatantly distorted, but nothing nasty is said about John Edwards or John Kerry.  The paragraphs of the last two candidates may very well have come from their own bio pages.  Or at least the bio pages of a 6th grader trying to throw together a candidate advocacy website very quickly, but hey.  What's more, with six candidates remaining in the race, Brewer chooses only to profile four of them.  Quite the go-getter.  And to think the  Patriot  is passing up on an opportunity to throw mud at Al Sharpton.  Anyway, let's look at each one of these:  First, Retired General, and former Supreme Allied Commander (just like Eisenhower) Wesley Clark: Clark is most notably a retired four-star general of the United States Army, which he served for thirty-eight years. After graduating from Westpoint at the top of his class, he went on to study at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Other career highlights include his service in Vietnam, work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and an honorable appointment in 1997 as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. What may be interesting to note is the fact that Clark is a former Republican who -- whoooaa there!   Looks like new  Patriot  Editor in Chief John ""some civilians were killed"" Cise isn't doing his part to usher in a new era of journalistic integrity in the office.  Let's put it plain and simple:  urlLink Wesley Clark was never a Republican .  The linked story at FactCheck.org (easily found by googling ""Clark never republican"") has the details.  We'll be waiting for the correction, a chance for John, captain of the  Patriot , to show his quality.  Okay, back to Angel, mid-sentence, sorry for the interruption: told the Boston Globe in September that he “probably would have voted for the congressional resolution that authorized President Bush to wage war in Iraq.” In the first week of the first political campaign of his life, Clark slipped up a little.  It happens.  Bush nearly committed us to war with China in his first presidential campaign (though it was his fourth total campaign). Clark credits his changes in political sentiment to the presidency of Bill Clinton, whom he voted for in 1992 and 1996. The core of Clark’s campaign centers around his “Promise to America,” in which he states five goals to be achieved by 2008. These include raising the “typical family’s income” by $3,000, enacting environmental protection policies, increasing the number of students enrolling in higher education by one million, “lifting” two million children out of poverty, and granting health insurance to some thirty million people. In 2003 when Clark was considering a candidacy, he said to a friend, “My heart’s greatest gladness has always been answering the call and defending the country.” Among his prominent supporters are former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth and liberal media mogul Michael Moore. Madonna!  You forgot about Madonna!  How can you guys be a respected conservative magazine if you left out the Madonna endorsement!?  Oh, and there's also  urlLink all these guys , but I forgive you.  And no mention of the successful campaign in Kosovo, a multilateral operation where not a single coalition life was lost, all while having the liberated population actually greet us  as liberators ?  Why wouldn't the  Patriot  mention that?  And now, Dr. Howard Dean, former six-term Governor of Vermont: Howard Dean is the former Governor of Vermont, and has also practiced medicine for over twenty years with his wife, Judy. He is a Yale alum and studied medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. During his tenure as Governor, he has focused on job expansion and creating accessible health care for children eighteen and under with his program Dr. Dynasaur. Dean has set himself apart in the primaries as the candidate most vehemently opposed to the war in Iraq, calling it “pre-emptive” and “misleading” for the American people. Another key element of the Dean campaign is his commitment to bringing universal health care coverage to America, a plan he intends to cost some $88.3 billion. Dean is also pro-choice, pro-affirmative action, and pro-same sex marriage. Well, he passed a  civil union  bill through the Vermont legislature, but the  Patriot  likes things in black and white.  Now, witness some hilarious circular reasoning from Brewer: After a disappointing third place finish in the Iowa caucus (eighteen percent), Dean screamed in passionate anger during his concession speech. Although he has publicly apologized for the action, which he says was made to “pump up” supporters, Dean is consistently pinpointed as an “angry candidate” by the media. In other words: We the  Patriot , who aspire to be part of ""the media"", call Howard Dean ""angry"", listen to Dean explain what he did, but then, again aspiring to be part of ""the media"", call him ""angry"" anyway.  And by the way, I don't ever remember Dean apologizing for the speech.  You got a source on that?  Because I can google ""dean apologize scream"" and come up with  urlLink this , from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: With just three full days of campaigning before the primary, Kerry led Dean 31 percent to 22 percent, a margin that was down 2 percentage points from his biggest lead. Dean's showing ""may suggest that he has bottomed out and may in fact be starting to increase,"" said pollster John Zogby.  ""I hope so,"" said Karen Creed, a bookseller from Londonderry, an independent, undecided voter who has been intrigued by Dean's campaign and dismayed by the late night television jokes about his ""screech"" in Iowa. ""I'm glad he explained it, but  I'm glad he didn't apologize. There was nothing he should have apologized for ."" (emphasis CPW's) It was at this point that Angel apparently dozed off and took a long, peaceful nap.  Brewer awoke to find fellow staffers screaming that the slanted candidate profile piece needed to be finished.  As a result, the only substantive thing Brewer has on John Edwards is that he strongly opposes President Bush.  Wow, quite a scoop there.  And no effort is even made to go after John Kerry, who happens to be, oh I dunno, the frontrunner.  But kudos to Angel for not dragging out Hovannes'  urlLink dishonest use  of Kerry's stance on Iraq in the 1990's.  The caption to the graphic that accompanies this article reads ""Confused over which candidate is worse? We feel your pain.""  Perhaps it should be amended to read ""Too damn lazy to bother smearing all the candidates?  Angel Brewer feels your... your . . .  zzzZzZZzzzz... """

X0DILM6,male,16,"Todays title features from the front cover of this weeks ""BBC Gardrens World Official Magazine"". Where you get a free mini fork thingo. *sarcastic cheer*  Today was...interesting. Good points being that the time flew by, and there weren't too many people there.  Bad points being that I managed to slit my finger open on another damn rose plant, I had to scan through a  whole fucking trolleyful  of small cactus plants, and had to stop after every few plants to pull the fucking spikes out of my hands. Also, my first customer was none other than my French teacher. Then at the end of the day I was given a brush and assigned the wonderful task of sweeping the whole shop area. Which kinda did my back in. And took ages.  On the upside...Euro 2004 started today!  Theres only been one game so far: The host nation Portugal hosting the generally low-quality and funny-player sounding Greece. Portugal, being favourites to win this match by a long way, went and messed up badly. They lost 2-1: Goals coming from Giorgos Karagounis and a penalty from Angelos Basinas, then a last-minute effort from Christiano Ronaldo.  Not bad for Greece, this was their first even win in a major football tournament. Russia and Spain are playing in about 30 mins time (from time of writing this). So...good luck to Greece and Russia: hopefully they'll take out Spain and Portugal so England wont have to worry about them if/when they get through. WOOO!"

X0DILM6,male,16,"Check this out. The really kah-ray-zee bits are in bold. Woohoo!  ----------  BERLIN (Reuters) - Losing his license did not stop a drunk German driver from jumping back into his car a day later to buy more of his favorite tipple -- only to be nabbed a second time by police who this time seized the car as well.        Following a tip-off, police had stopped the 51-year-old on Monday, when a breath test showed a blood alcohol level  more than 10 times over the legal limit.     ""The officers could not remember ever having recorded such a high level,"" said a police spokesman in Hagen, western Germany. The man's license was taken away.    The next morning, the man again bought sparkling wine and drove home. Police again stopped him and recorded an even higher alcohol level -- almost  double the amount considered life-threatening to most people.     ""This time, the officers confiscated his car too,"" the spokesman said. The man will be charged.  ----------  Talk about a stuuuupid last sentence. ""The man will be charged."" Of course hes gonna be charged! Not like they're gonna send him gifts of thanks or anything...jeeeez."

Spent the whole hour trying to not do too much work, and hit my head against the keyboard/screen several times too. Let out late (again) so missed a fair chunk of English. Which didn't matter 'cos we didn't really do anything anyways. French...interesting. We had Ms Hovland as a supply, so naturally no real work was done, apart from finding random French words then insulting Sam with them. Science...again, interesting. Uncie Phil's WILF and WALT lists are getting v. annoying, but his willingless to let us play with those mini-whiteboards needs good comment. Of course, Jack and Bish kinda went crazy with classic messages like ""Jack blows rabbits"" ""I'm with stupid"" ""Bish for men"" ""Nat say yes"" among other things.

1SZLFYX,female,24,"Yesterday, my Renton reached a new milestone in his self-serving kitty life.  He ventured into the world of the outside.  Well, he has been outside before, but that was only while being confined in a carrier or his mamma's arms, which he categorizes as 'the usual place; different scenery.'  Yesterday was new.  He went outside on his very own . . . on a leash, of course.  Hey, don't laugh -- Siamese cats are very dog-like.  They even drool and poop in the tub.  His daddy, Steven, and I were working on sealing the doors to the apartment.  I have seen one too many lizards and way too many spiders during my time here.  Renton didn't bolt out while we had the doors open, but he was curious.  His little nose twitched with the beguiling scents that a rainy Sunday can bring.  He looked so cute for once (as opposed to Satan's Housepet), that we decided to let him have a go at the world.  Not only was it his first time outside, it was his first sucessful time with the leash, too.  We had tried it before, but we were inside when we did so.  This cat is known to chase his tail.  You can imagine what he wanted to do with a nylon string four times as long than any tail he'd ever chased before.  But yesterday the smell of the cement patio was much more alluring than any prostectic tail.  It was very humbling to watch him.  He stopped to sniff and investigate every inch that was around him.  Each piece of dirt or spot of water was the ultimate fascination for this cat.  And here we are just bustling to and from work every day, and none of us ever take the time to smell the dead leaves.  Not only did Renton smell the dead leaves, he investigated the dead bugs and the live holly bush.  Thankfully, he didn't eat any of it.  His palette is more geared toward Auburn afghans.  I am also glad to report that I got many a picture of Renton investigating this new world.  How could I not take pictures of such a nice, non-violent point in his life?  Steven remarked to me that I take so many pictures of Renton that I'm going to be worn out by the time we have kids.  Grandma please!  (To quote Willis . . .).  When we have children, I'm going to have so many pictures of that kid, you could put them together in a flip book and make a moving picture with it.  There are no worries on the wearing out of my picture-taking desire here.  Speaking of which, I need to find a place where I can buy good camera film in bulk.  Steven and I did some calculating, and the wedding is in some odd 33 days or so.  When you start counting in days, it's time to start buying film."

1SZLFYX,female,24,"Hmm, 'tis a Thursday.  For all of you who are gravely concerned about my health (and sanity) by fault of the last post, I am much better now.  It's a weird, weird week when I fight a cold and actually end up winning.  Much thanks to the Nyquil company and Vick's nose spray.    I'm really straining to think of something to talk about, but my week has been quite mundane.  I've either worked, slept, peed, pooped, blew my nose with little sucess, called on Renton, played with Renton, warned Renton, punished Renton, put Renton to bed, woke Renton up, read a book, or scratched my ass.  As you can see, there's not much to talk about.    I hope to have some good stories after my trip to Auburn.    Here's hoping for some excitement."

1SZLFYX,female,24,"I am having the weirdest time with my recent toothpaste selections.  Man, I never thought I'd have toothpaste on my mind so much that I'd want to write about it.  Maybe I'm getting old.  That's probably it.  I've been having this problem with my back, too . . .  In the past, I've usually gone for something like Aquafresh or Rembrandt, as long as it's extra-super-duper-will-make-you-go-blind whitening.  That's the good stuff.  But it was beginning to irritate me that they don't seem to make these kinds of toothpaste in the bigger tubes; the kind that would last you for six months.  Having to remember to buy toothpaste once a month or face stinky, yellow teeth can be weighty on the memory.    So last month I went out on a limb, and bought a new kind.  In a big, baseball-bat sized tube.  Perhaps you've seen the commercials for this one.  These commercials almost made me not even try the toothpaste in the first place.  In the commercial, these two overly happy people come upon this overly happy cartoon beaver in the woods.  ""Hey, it's Mr. Beaver!"" exclaims one.  This is the cue for all college-age students to snicker drunkenly.  ""How do you get your teeth so white,""  says the other dude.  And of course Mr. Beaver keeps his teeth so white because he uses this herbal toothpaste that is oh so fine, and it has natural herbs.  Yee ha.  Horrible commercial.  But I bought this stuff anyway.  One, it was in a big tube just like what I was looking for.  Two, I like herbs.  It can't be that bad.  Sure.  This stuff is like brushing your teeth with puree'ed grass.  The taste in my mouth is worse after using this glop.  But I didn't give up.  At first.  After all, it is a huge tube and I paid for it, so dammit, I'm gonna use it all.    I gave up on it last week.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  So back to the toothpaste row in Wal-Mart I went.  I still wanted a big tube for some reason.  It escapes me now, though.  I settled this time on something more normal:  Colgate Total with a Mint Fresh Stripe.  Woohoo, mint!  An herb, yes, but a minty herb!  I first tried it out last night.  It was pretty good.  A whole lot better than that grass paste, to be sure.  Soon after I was done with it, though, my tongue began to feel numb.  And I began to feel a little nervous -- I had been cleaning the bathroom earlier.  What if I got clorox in my mouth?  No Clorox, it was just Colgate Total with a suspicious Mint Fresh Stripe.  Methinks they slipped some Ambesol into this concoction.  I hate that Ambesol feeling, especially on my tongue.    So here I sit, numb-tongued, typing up my toothpaste woes with a calm Renton in my lap.  I wonder what I should do with all this toothpaste.  Maybe I could throw it away.  But no, it's a big tube that I paid quasi-good money for.  Maybe I can tough it out.  I'll try for a bit, anyway.  Maybe my tongue will get used to it.    If you're talking to me, and I sound a little slurred, dont worry, I'm not drunk.  It's just the toothpaste.  __________________________  And now for an update on the Renton + blinds situation.  I had previously thought that he had only destroyed one of the two sets.  I was mistaken.  Last night I made to raise the blinds by the string (there was a lizard amongst us, uggg).  The string came easily, but the blinds themselves did not follow.  Another one bites the dust.  It was rather comical, actually.  Renton probably set that up on purpose.  He discreetly chewed through the string on the bottom, knowing he'd get a kick out of it once I attempted to raise them.  One of the most essential traits of a practical joker is patience."
1SZLFYX,female,24,"Yes, I am back once again, on a Tuesday no doubt.  As it was pointed out to me earlier this week that I tend to do my postings on Tuesdays, I wanted to avoid this predictable occurence, but alas.  I meant to write yesterday, but the broccoli thought otherwise.  Last weekend, I was helping Steven go though his huge batch of mail that he receives every month and a half or so.  Apparently mail is not a daily thing in the little of corner of Auburn in which he abides, but that is another matter.  He had some junk mail, a check (a check!!!), various offers from BellSouth to please oh please come back, a card from me (that I sent the second week of January), and what looked to be an invitation-greetinglike card, all done up in a translucent envelope.  You know, that new style of paper that is oh so 21st century.  Y'all know BellSouth, right?  Oh come on, sure you do.  If you're from around here anyway.  We had the privledge of seeing their big building up in Nashville.  It sure scared the boogers outta me.  I did get a picture, though.  Wanna see it?  Sure ya do.      Ready?      Ohhh, you're gonna love it . . .      Here it comes . . .         Mordor was inspired by Nashville; just had to be.  So anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah, BellSouth mail stuff.  Soon after last Christmas, Steven and I decided that paying for two phone lines along with two high-speed DSL connections was just a bit more money than we wanted to fork over to BellSouth, so we cancelled the service for the Auburn apartment.  Ever since, they have seemed awful desperate to get their 95 dollars a month back.  Uh huh.  Okay, back to the invitation-greetinglike card.  I open it up and begin to read.  ""Okay, we admit it, we let the romance slip away . . . ""  And I am thinking, ""Umm, this isn't the card I sent him . . . ""  ""Maybe we didn't say 'we care' as much as we should have . . . ""  Now I'm thinking, ""Maybe they got the wrong 'Steven' ""  ""Maybe you were right about everything . . .""  I'm starting to think, ""Steven, do you need to tell me something?""  ""Please come back; we promise to be really, really good to you from now on . . .""  My thoughts digress to, ""What?!""  "". . .starting with a phone plan you're gonna love!""    Huh?  ""Come back to BellSouth for local service and enjoy extra flexibility with the BellSouth Complete choice Plan . . .""  What a card!  Literally!  Well I began laughing so hard I almost fell to the ground (which is not all that unusual for me). ""Maybe we didn't say 'we care' as much as we should have""?  Too right.  Well, at least they did say ""Thank you"" in small lettering under the 'amount paid' section of the bill.  Sending out cards like this makes me worry for their sanity more than anything.  Still, you gotta admit it's a good marketing campaign.  It certainly got my attention and emblazoned their name into my brain.  However, I'm still not giving them 95 clams a month."

1SZLFYX,female,24,"An aquaintance of both my sister and I posted an attack on my sister for not inviting her to her wedding of last month.  It upset us all, and we both replied to her posts with my reply at 1:30 this morning.  An hour later I was censored by her removal of my post.  Oh my, but she has awoken the beast.  What follows is my original reply that was written between midnight and 1:30 this morning, the 12th of July.  It has not been edited since then.  I am not posting this to try to appeal to Katie (PK), it is an effort on my part to clear my sister and her husband's name of any supposed wrongdoing.    _______________________________  To clarify, this is Carrie Paulk Williams, sister of Cathy.  To start, I understand the First Amendment; you have a right to say what you want to say to whomever you want to say it.  I am not mad at you because you ranted.  What I am, however, is absolutely disgusted, saddened, and infuriated at your reasoning behind these posts.  So I shall use my First Amendment right to counterpoint you.  First, to clarify parts where I am mentioned.  You state in your reply to Cathy's post that you ""didn't expect to be invited to Carrie's [wedding].""  And yet, in the second sentence of your first post, you complain that being left out of a wedding invite is the ""second time this happened in the same freaking family,"" referring to my wedding of six months past.  If you didn't expect to be invited to mine, why are you upset that this is the ""second time"" this has happened?  How contradictory.  Any information you received about our wedding was most likely given in response to your questions.  I cannot vouch for Sharon, Willis, and the others, but I know all the information you received from Steven was in response to your repeated questions.  He disliked giving you the details, but he felt it rude to say, ""We're not telling you that.""  Neither of us ever came up to you to tell you all about the wedding plans.    That takes care of the direct references to me.  Now on to your attack on my sister.  Indeed, it was an attack.  You meant for it to be heard.  If you did not, you would not have a link to your weblog from your buddy profile.  Cathy is not nor has ever been a spiteful, mean person, yet you talk as if she did not send you an invitation as a personal affront to you.  How dare you suggest such a thing of my sister.  You speak as if you were the best of friends and she stabbed you in the back.  Oh, I know you state later that you were never ""super close friends with"" Cathy and Jason, but you sure give a different impression in your first post.  You list these ridiculous vague ties with Cathy and Jason, such as ""former roommate's [Jason's] girlfriend (now ex),"" you ""were there the night they got engaged,"" and the groom wanted to sign your cast, among others.  Whether you thought you were ""super close friends"" or not, it reads as if you felt like you were a shoe-in for an invitation.  Now, to counterpoint your vague references mentioned above.  ""[F]ormer roommate's girlfriend (now ex)"" -- Yes, Jason and Paul were once roommates.  Yes, you and Paul used to date.  Later, you two broke up.   If I remember correctly, this was about three years ago.  You moved on.  Later you make a reference to Sharon's ex-boyfriend being invited, so therefore you should have been, too.  Cathy is friends with that boy; it had nothing to do with him once dating Sharon.    You were ""there the night they got engaged.""  Um, that reads to me like you were actually there the moment when Jason proposed.  That is certainly not true: they were by themselves on campus. Immediately afterwards they came to me and Steven to tell us the news, where they also called their respective parents.  Then they went to tell their best friend, Sharon.  You just happened to be visiting Sharon when Cathy and Jason showed up.  They had no intention of hunting you out to give you the news.  Now about the Jason wanted to sign your cast comment -- he wanted to sign it because he had never signed a cast before.  That had nothing to do with you specifically, it is just one of those simple pleasures in life that Jason has not yet gotten to experience.  It's a petty little thing, but you made it even pettier by presenting it as an argument for a wedding invitation.  It is a similar situation with the argument of Jason sending you links to their registry and wedding website.  He was so excited about the entire thing, he wanted to share his joy with everybody.  It did not insinuate that he wanted you to buy them something or wanted you to come.  I believe you read too much into these little actions.   ________________________  You state in your second post that you found Cathy's apology ""more upsetting"" than if she had just lied to you and said, "" '[O]ops, we forgot.' ""  Terribly sorry, but it is not Cathy, Jason's, or anyone else's job to placate you so you can feel better about yourself.  That is your own job.  I am flabberghasted that you would suggest it is others' responsibility to make you feel good.  That whole idea goes too deep for this conversation.  It is a problem.  You also state in your second post that what you find ""paticularly stinging is the fact that some of the people that were invited they [Cathy and Jason] rarely talk to and yet the groom talked to [you] a good number of times and they are deemed 'important enough' and [you were] not.""  Who exactly are you referring to?  I have already gone over Sharon's ex-boyfriend's friendship with Cathy and Jason; the only other person I can think of is Paul. If you think that Jason and Paul have not talked in three years, you are mistaken.  They talk reguarly; they have stayed friends.  Cathy has also known Paul since high school.  If you are referring to any other people than these two, please put them forth.     _____________________________  You used your weblog to vent your grievances; that is what they can be used for, among other things.  I do not have a problem with this fact.  You spoke your mind so that others, including Cathy and Jason, could know.  This weekend, they read your post, and they knew.  They were understandably upset, but they did not reply right away.  In fact, they waited a few hours to cool down before they replied.  They chose to give an apology.  It may not have explained themselves fully or gone over your issues point by point, but they apologized, out in the open for everyone to see.    What did you do with it?  You threw it back in their face as soon as you read it.  You did this out in the open as well, for everyone to see.  You gave yourself no chance to collect your thoughts; it was posted in the height of very misplaced hurt and anger.  What do you want from them?  What can they say to make you happy?  I do know one thing:  they will not say they made a mistake in not inviting you.  This whole debacle of the weblog justifies their decision, in my opinion.  You state that Cathy and Jason's apology can be summed up as ""you're not important"" to them.  I'm afraid you've hit the nail on the head:  you're not important.  That is the facts and you need to accept it.  You cannot be best friends with everybody.  You can, however, be annoying to everybody.  Amazing how that works.  ____________________________  As I said before, you have your First Amendment rights.  But you must use those rights with a degree of respect.  By these posts that you have sent online, you have disrespected my sister, her husband, their friends, and their family, including Steven and me.  Cathy and Jason were under ABSOLUTELY NO OBLIGATION to invite you to anything.  Even if they had so much as told you to your face that you were going to be sent an invitation, they would not have been obligated to send you one.  No matter what signals from Cathy and Jason that you express you received, you were not guaranteed anything.    The fact that you expected anything from Cathy and Jason is revolting.  Yes, the First Baptist Church of Auburn is ""big enough"" and one more person would not have ""cramped [their] style.""  However, your specific presence would have 'cramped their style,' as you put it.  To put it extremely bluntly, you were not wanted, just as you were not wanted at my wedding.  For you to expect to be wanted is sadly optimistic.  You should not lash out at others because you think they cause you unhappiness.  Truly happy people do not let the actions of others cause such grief and distress as you express has happened to you due to the lack of a wedding invitation.  All you end up doing is hurting yourself and others.  I am one of those 'others,' notice it is one o'clock in the morning while I am sending this message to you.

1SZLFYX,female,24,"WOOHOO, IT'S GAMEDAY!  I'm down in Auburn, and gettin' ready to walk the campus.  We're gonna go by the bookstore and get some books (duh), and then we're gonna go by the alumni tent, because I have access, and I've forgotten every time this year so far that I've got the privledge to take part of cheap hot dogs, watered down drinks, and some horrible music entertainment.  But by graduating, I've gained the right.  So I'll try it out.  Renton had his first run-in with another cat last night.  Our friends Katie and Lisa recently acquired a calico cat, a cute little six month old named Callie.  So last night we all decide they should meet, they can play together and it'll be so nice and cute.  Uh huh.  Well, at least one side wanted to be nice and cute.  Callie seemed very willing to make friends.  Renton, however, seemed very willing to kill each and every one of us.  Except Callie; he seemed very threatened by this cute little ball of splotched fur that was half his size.  He tried to attack us humans, though, who are seven times his size.  Dude, this cat  growled .  He sounded like a Rottweiler.  Yep, that's my Renton:  the anti-cat.  He was one pissed off feline.  After thirty minutes of hissing, growling, biting, and sulking, we took him back to Steven's.    Granted, Renton was in unfamiliar territory, which gets him edgy anyway.  After the game we just might try it again, but this time in Steven's abode.  Maybe Renton will be nicer.  Renton!  Nice!  Hahahahahahahaha!!!  No, really, we can have hope. . .  After we took Renton back last night, we had dinner and watched a movie.  Callie was just jumping around from lap to lap, being all sweet.  Steven played with her for a long time.  Then he says, ""This cat is much more fun than Renton!""  What?!  He later said he didn't mean it, but I'll never let him live it down.  Renton is fun, you just have to wear leatherhide gloves.  Hey, they're fashionable.  And now, 'tis time to dry my hair, always a fun daily ritual.  War Damn Eagle, let's kill us some dawgs."

This (and more) from someone who knew me perhaps no longer than a week sometime in the past. As opposed to the lacking openness and genuinity from the rest whom I gave a part of my thoughts, a part of my life, a part of my heart. How many men only fell for the aforementioned picture perfect image? Even sadder, how many of them were even aware of the fact that what they desired to possess was a reflection they were so determined to idolize?  Whenever I handled the heart, it bled. The heart was kept in a safe and the make-up was revered. How many times the fuck is disguised as lovemaking?    You fuck ""some body "" but only love ""some one ""!   The mirror continues to muse me.  It takes to be a (hu)man to even get close to the latter. It needs completion of self evolution even to the slightest degree. It needs usurping scary territory. It requires holding tighter as opposed to relinquinshing across the first instant your partner takes a misstep somewhere in the tango. It needs dynamics, a rhythm that takes up many a long nights and even longer days to synchronize. It demands acquintance; Conversance of a scent, a taste, a gaze, a nonsensual detail... It calls for endurance, flexibility and a lot of hit points. It needs to be a virtuoso of survival through horrid terrains. It also depends on spell points for there comes a time when strength is not adequate and a miracle is essential.  Yet for all that to flourish, it necessitates determination.  And if the world lacks something it is not goddamn love but determination, instead!  And that is why I thank you!   For being generous and tagging me along into those moments when you feel deep inside that a rememberance of me fills your surroundings with a sweet aroma. I thank you for giving me a smile as genuine enough as whatever you have in your sanctuary. I thank you for opening a door without having any expectation from me to step inside but an anticipation instead for making me to smell that fragrance. I thank you for the comfort you present although you are miles and miles away. I thank you for not caring about how it would seem or sound to convey your thoughts, your most sacred sentiments and in doing so exceeding all the artificiality that ""man kind"" possesses. I thank you for dismissing all the ""what if""s and overcoming self-restrictions. Thus, I thank you for making me see that there are still men out there who can depict themselves in a chivalrous, articulate manner without a second thought (Because on second thought comes the fear of making an ass of yourself!).  I thank you for feeling for me from across a horizon in a way that makes me think that within only a week you could see through my looking glass more than any men who have ever stepped in my life.. that you not only  listen ed to me but also  hear ed all I had to say. I thank you for the ephemeral bliss, emerging via your thoughts and best wishes, creating a transient Oasis within the abysmal desert stretching all around me.   The world is a better place for there are people like you...  ...you who is astute enough to be   simply,   sincerely,   plainly ,  you!"
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: WHEN A CHILD BLEEDS ::     Timeline:  Past  It is interesting how remembrance may play possum when it comes to one's earliest memories. You rarely remember a stream of events but instead recall captions of your early childhood. Mostly one has photographs of a moment stored in their psyche. When it comes to emotions though, it is much easier. You can instantly categorize and say that you have a ""happy/sad/neutral/normal/painful/merry/whatever"" childhood.   Mine was rather ironic in that sense.   The earliest memory that I possess regarding my childhood is me polishing my nails. For some reason, it was not opposed by my parents who probably thought that it was a childish caprice on my part. Yet, I somehow remember that my father took me out while I still had that polish on my tiny nails and visiting the studio of his actor friend who was really famous in Ponderland during 70s. The caption I have from that visit is me sitting on my dad's lap and the guy telling me something about my nails. I really can't make out what is it, though.   Another moment of note was told me years later by my dad. It was after my family's receiving a dinner invitation to a Professor's house. During that dinner, my father says, there was a moment when I stood by the record player which was caught by the Professor who told my parents that I should immediately be genetically/gynecologically tested for my future well-being. This, though, was opposed harshly by my mother...   ..my mother..   ..who had been the leading figure in my life until her death in 1993. I was born into a middle class family who was living in an apartment in one of the most popular districts of the city. My uncle (from my mother's side) and his family was also living in the same apartment and it soon seemed that my cousin truly despised my being with all his might. Before my birth, my mother was the one looking after him and he loved her even more than he loved his own mother. They really developed a strong bond until I was delivered to their cozy world, thus, stealing the attention that he was so used to. As an adult, I can understand these feelings belonging to a child. However, I was as naive as I could get as a child myself, totally unaware of the fact that I was a threat to this relation. Thus, I constantly found myself being accused of the the mess that he kept causing. The slightest of naughtiness my cousin created was reflected to me and ended up as my being the one who had the fault (he was 5 years older than myself hence could plot his way to these scenes much easily). No matter how innocently I begged for mercy, cried my eyes out stuttering I did nothing, I was beaten to death. My screams (as my Grandmother later told me) could be heard from 2 blocks away and mostly I had to be rescued by someone or another from those moments of torture. Once I was way too close to death that if my aunt did not save me by sheer chance (ie. passing by the street and hearing my cries tearing the street apart), I would have lived only 3 painful years in this world and freed my angel soul.   The beatings ended abruptly one day when my mother, extremely guilty seeming, told me that she was so sorry for all that she had done. There it was, a 33 years old woman, apologizing from a 4 years old kid. This must have been the first instant in my life when I realized that I had to grow up quite quicker than I should. Although the physical violence in my childhood ceased, I remember giving a few extremely intelligent replies to my mother referring to the pain she had caused me occasionally, hence, nailing her to her place.   She even had to throw a china on the ground, shattering it into countless pieces one day so as to avoid hitting me because of one of those witty replies belonging to a child whose justness even she could not deny."
7NFA3OH,female,27,"Timeline:  Present   To a disciple who was forever complaining about others the Master said, ""If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.""    Anthony de Mello, SJ     I am aware that ever since I have been involved in digging the foundations of the Humanity's Team, I have fallen behind with the  Past  timeline. However, these days, I am going through a brand new phase of enlightenment within myself and this hastily leads to my coming to terms with ""all that had happened"" in my life so far. New Spirituality enables me to reconsider the past events in my life with a refreshing understanding through a quite painful but cultivating process which includes the fact that I am not the  victim  of the catastrophes that kept occurring subsequently but rather the realization that I am the  creator  of them. The reason of my falling behind in the continuity of my  coming out  story is probably because when I complete this phase, I will be using a totally new set of vocabulary than I would do at the moment.  Hence, ""the pain of the process"" since it requires a great self realization and being truthful to one's self. Usually, just like everybody else, instead of searching for the  why  of an event, I have happened to actualize it to find an excuse which can also be deciphered as ""disguising the fact that I am the cause of all that I am today with a very reasonable approach so as to ignore my being the magnet of that event"".  Now to turn this train of thought into reality is easier to say than do. Thus, I decided to take another path and looked at my dad's life which has been our lives for the last 5 years. Obviously, it is much easier to consider others instead of looking deep within yourself and the things that you have been casting aside as you kept lying to yourself.  There are certain statements that my dad had been repeating in the miserable course of events which started making sense as I envisioned him under this spotlight. Almost a week ago, dad and I were going through a conversation which was bouncing back and forth between a discussion and a quarrel. It was a bitter one since I was being quite pushy and was deliberately drawing him towards his borders and making him face the reality that he had been rationalizing. In doing so, I had no intentions to ""correct"" him, let me explain this part. A most precious understanding New Spirituality has given me is the element of ""perfection."" Perfection in everything. Yes, even in perfection within poverty (and as you already know, I have been having a thoroughly harsh experience of poverty). I knew that whatever was happening to my dad (and to me via him) was the  perfect  consequence of our choices and states of minds. Thus, just like everybody else, we were creating this ""poverty setting"" for our own good and nothing could be ""judged"" in this process.   Everyone experiences his/her deepest beliefs about themselves.  Now if I was somebody else, this probably would have made no sense yet these are my words my friends. You can come up to me and ask, ""Aura we have been witnessing and reading your life for 6 months and you are telling us that you have deserved this?"". My answer would be, my friends, that it has nothing to do with ""deserving"" but ""choosing"" and to be able to understand that choice here I am inviting you to the very cores of my dad and myself.  Here are the things my father said to me during the course of this conversation:  ""Aura do you really believe that I have not tried? 5 years ago, I arranged meetings with the managers of the 10 topmost firms in this country and they all told me the same thing, ""Sorry, Mr. Mars. You are far beyond our expectations"". This is a silkened version of saying, ""We are not interested"". I tried but I was turned down! At 64, it is not easy to gulp down being rejected. At 64, it is not easy to start all over again...""  Now can you clearly see how he sees himself as? He has rooted beliefs deep in his psyche that ""it is not easy"" to start life all over again at 64. He actually has rooted  fears  about starting life anew which also implies that he finds it extremely hard to be handed with an opportunity for a beginning. He also possesses a pride (which is also a version of fear because everything, I repeat every thing originates either from   fear   or   love  ) that disables him from keep trying since those initial failures concerning rejection had hurt him in the past. Thus, instead of taking an active route, taking responsibility for these fears and accepting them as they are (which is the crucial step towards changing it), he is taking the passive route and justifying his actions and current state.  Let's go back to hearing him, ""...and people are after young, fresh minds instead of an old and soon-to-be obsolete one. That and I couldn't have surrendered to 500 bucks a month as if I'm being pitied. How could you expect me to settle for an amount like that and accumulate the money needed for your new life...""  If you really need one justification, that would be that if dad had ""surrendered to 500 bucks a month"" 5 years ago, he would have approximately tripled his salary 5 years afterwards and as of today. However, no judgments on my part! Never! I am not recording this conversation to belittle my father but rather analyze and distinguish the elements that his deepest understanding of himself have created as our present.  ""...I long for the compassion and unconditional love from my own daughter but I accept the fact that we can never achieve it within our current reality so I search for that compassion in others...""  Interesting. And here I was wondering why on earth I had started feeling irritated by his presence all of a sudden. Why, in 5 long years, had I never ever thought about accusing him of ""failing my trust in him"" but have been doing so now? However, it is very self-explanatory, is it not? My father has been very skillfully creating this outcome by simply thinking likewise and I was just the pawn on his chessboard. He was altering his thoughts (which are the outcome of one's deepest beliefs and the tools of creation) and we were simply acting accordingly.  ""...and even if we did achieve it, I wonder if you could ever forgive either me or your mother for ignoring your birth defect. We have lost the opportunity of building up a healthy parental pattern from your childhood...""  That is even more interesting. I cannot recall claiming the impossibility of building a healthy relationship with my dad even once. Moreover, I never claimed that it was ""way too late"" for trying after this point. On the contrary, I always stated that it was ""never too late"". However, the belief is there on my dad's part. If he does not work to change this ""belief"" than we will obviously experience just that.  However, as I already said, everything is ""perfect"" in its own way. To accept and embrace this perfectness and to have the freedom of choice across these events is the exciting part. That is to say, my father creates a reality that includes me and then I have two options:   1) I can follow this reality. 2) I can choose to create something new for myself.   What I have been doing for the last 5 years is simply choosing the first option. Hence, neither my dad is nor I am ""wrong""; None of us has the ""fault"". They were simply our choices be it consciously or unconsciously.  Nowadays, this phase I have been going through is making me face all these quite brutally. Because I choose it to be so. I have never been a woman who takes things swiftly (which is, yet another choice). Swift doesn't work for me (there you go. Another belief, another  self  selection). I am quite grateful for the Past timeline of Phantasmemoria since it makes it easier for me to go through them once again and reconsider them.  It is brutal. Yet the effect, when not attempted to be put under control, is quite temporal. As Joan Borysenko, says:   ""The paradox of control is simple. The more we try to control life, the less control we have."""

7NFA3OH,female,27,":: FAKE IT ::   Timeline:  Present   There had been so much snow to delight me yet it just went so abruptly, it was surprising. A fake spring painted the sky a deep azure and coveys of swallows scattered and united playfully in the air as they passed high above the skyscrapers. Fortunately, white storks have not returned yet. They are believed to be the ones who carry the actual spring benath their wings and are believed to be the initial sign of the rebirth of nature.   ""Excuse me!"" The smiling blonde (dyed, of course) entered the office that was shoving its modernity in one's face and closed the door behind her. She was wearing a formal, two piece dress as she carried a pile of papers under her arm, ""I hope you haven't waited for too long."" She sat on a comfortable chair behind a neat office desk and I was certain by the look of it that the ergonomy theme was enhanced by an iMaC standing atop the desk. ""Not at all"" I replied placing a bright smile on my lips, ""I have just arrived myself."" which was a complete lie, indeed. I had been killing time around the office for about one and a half hours and had been waiting for her in her office for the last 15 minutes.   ""So..."" she began, linking her fingers to complete the professional Interviewer imagery, ""You are interested in doing voiceovers, I see. Do you have any experience in the field?""   I leaned back and crossed my legs trying to look as comfortable as possible - the only hint of my anxiety were hidden in my dead cold hands, ""Actually, no."" I said in an overtone, ""But we all start somewhere, don't you think?""   She nodded and tilted her head slightly, ""Are you coming from an acting background or...?""   ""No."" I hit back straightforwardly and tried my best to sound as sincere as possible, ""But I have sang half-professionally for years so I have fundemental knowledge about articulation. After all it is a vital key when you are recording in a studio.""   ""Right."" she agreed but I could sense from her narrowed eyes and the rather dense tone topping her voice that I had started loosing her, ""What about diction courses? Do you have a certificate from one of them?""   ""No, I don't."" I replied to reflect my truthfulness (silly me). I had decided the previous night that no matter what I encountered the following day, I was going to be as open as possible. ""Frankly, I didn't know that it was a prerequisite, either."" (Frankly!? God!)   ""Actually, it is."" she said now seeming utterly relieved since this was going to be the easiest if not shortest interview in her entire career. ""What we really look for in a beginner is talent shaped by some degree of dictional education. You see, you are going to be working with many professionals in the field. The majority either have a theatratical background or are experienced with the microphone such as radio djs. Doing voiceovers with them requires at least basic knowledge about timing as well as different types of stresses, pronunciation and dialects...""   I was continiously nodding in the meantime. The chin was up, the smile was still there yet I think it turned to look like a oh-I-feel-like-shit-but-go-on-informing-me-anyway beam. I turned back to reality as she handed a post-it-not to me with numbers on it, ""...try them and once you get a certificate, contact me as soon as possible so we'll see what we can do for you. You sure have a melodic, soothing voice."" I stood up and shook her hand firmly while I was thinking, 'I'd probably try them if you were dying to sponsor me, love.' She accompanied me to the elevator outside and I thanked her once again before saying a final goodbye.   When the doors closed, I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. So this was it! The story of my post-transitional life that I had been trying to alter. I took my mobile out and dialed my dad's while I was hastily exiting the building, ""Hey beautiful!""   ""Dad get me that fake ID.""   ""Why, you were indifferent...""   ""I changed my mind. Get it!"" I stumbled upon something on the sidewalk and cursed slightly as I tried to reach for the bus stop half running half walking. Darn, the bus was overloaded and passed the stop by.   ""How did the interview go?""   ""I was turned down gracefully. Anyway, are you or aren't you getting it?""   ""Are you serious?"" Another bus slowed down and although this wasn't the one I was supposed to take, I got on anyway.   ""I've never been more serious."" Hanging up, I took out my wallet to pay for the ride. If life was so determined to fake it for me, it was high time I would fake it back!"
7NFA3OH,female,27,":: RAIN OF UNIMPORTANCE ::   Timeline:  Present   The owner of the bouquiniste smiled at me and gestured for me to come inside, ""Don't you wait there, child. Come in! It's freezing outside."" Sniffing out of cold a little, I stepped in with gratitude and was immediately surrounded by the welcoming warmth being emitted from the electric heating. ""Thank you..."" I said unwrapping my scarf ""...I thought my dad was going to be around by now. We'd meet here at 5 pm."" He smiled and shook his head slightly, ""I'm sure he'll arrive any minute. Take a look at those books in English we've purchased just recently."" Nodding, I walked towards the adjacent opening which led to a huge room filled with bookshelves overloaded with countless pieces of writing by countless authors from around the globe. I inhaled deeply, savoring the smell of old book reigning within that part of the store. All these things were the products of various minds yet to be discovered... various worlds yet to be journeyed... various ideas yet to be added to my palette of scattered approaches towards technicolored concepts.   Crouching, I started going through the shelves, no matter how hard it was to get a hold on them one by one. Spotting a huge pile of Harlequin Romances and books pulsating with the idealization of feminine desire, I couldn't help but recall those weekends at my best friend's. We used to call them ""Harlequin Weekends"" which were specifically arranged for girls curling up (this is an obligatory trip... the female curl up while they read/watch something romantic) on various spots of the living room as husks of sunflower seeds slowly tower next to them. Not aware of the fact that I was smiling, I reached for a rather colorful looking cover and ended up holding a book titled ""One Hit Wonder"" by some author called Lisa Jewell. I had been feeling a little dizzy with my literary sessions lately mainly due to the fact that I was reading Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard who, after almost a hundred pages, still so buried in explaining cells and demons that he couldn't manage to start describing the basics of Dianetics therapy and how one could get rid of the negative experiences of unconsciousness (ie. engrams) so as to boost their mental potential (after all, this last thing is why, as claimed on the cover, 7 million people worldwide bought the damn book). Holding on to this discovery following the Bridget Jones genre, I got up and headed out to the next room where the owner was busy selling alluring looking pens to a teenager.   I took my mobile out and dialed my dad's only to be informed that ""the person I had called could not be yada yada."" (You missed him love. You're gonna either drag yourself back home and soak your cute little butt under the rainpour or try to look even cuter each minute to the owner of the store so he won't kick you out for mistaking his store for a bus stop). I sighed as I hang up and peered at the rain melting the last traces of the snow away from the streets not knowing what to curse first. My lack of weather prediction and leaving my umbrella back home or the rain that had been sweeping a sight that I had great affection towards?   I was a little taken away by these musings that I couldn't help but shriek at the nose pressing against the door from the other side. My father was a childish sight to be seen with his nostrils flaring out on the glass while he was smirking at me. I opened the door and was so close to yelling ""What the...!?"" but thanks to my common sense rushing forth and whispering ""You're being expected to act with manners in public, woman!"", I bit my tongue and grinned back. After all, he was funny when you thought twice (He really IS funny, indeed. The only thing is you have to practice thinking twice a lot).   Once outside, being the gentleman he is, my father disregarded his load (he was trying to carry 3 huge plastic bags the ingredients of which I really didn't want to know after that bathrobe experience a while ago) and chivalrously held the umbrella for the two of us.... well the problem is... everytime he does this we end up unable to walk properly because I'm taller than him (He's 5'7'' and I'm 5'9'' + heels). So the outcome of his chivalry is either me trying to be as acrobatically defensive as possible against the iron dangerously poking out of the ends of the umbrella randomly while it threatens my visual perception or me bumping my head against the stretched nylon thus causing my dad to loose the umbrella's control. Umbrella control is a difficult skill, indeed, which requires loads of practice for proficiency (likewise, anyone who tries using an umbrella against a hurling wind is prone to have a pissed story).   ""Well..."" my father said as we were halfway towards the apartment ""....guess what happened today?"" I tried my best to avoid the book slipping through my hands when a car turned around the corner abruptly and we were forced towards the sidewalk reflexively as my father punched me on the chin with his hand that carried the umbrella. ""What....?"" I mumbled when we were back on track again. ""Today I dropped by at the Ponderland Artists Association to see a few old faces. Ritzy (Mr. Ritzy is still a popular TV and Theater actor in Ponderland) took out an album and showed me a picture from like...."" He paused as we crossed the road in heavy traffic ""....40 years ago... From the staging of ""Second Edition""... It was from a scene including me carrying (some female name I cannot remember now) on my shoulder and Ritzy reaching out a hand in protest... Made me feel...""   And he went on describing how amazing those days of acting for him. As we entered the apartment, he was still musing about those days while I, on the other hand, was suffering from cluttering teeth and quite assured (once again) that I inherited the musing and chattering genes from him. After all, I managed to add 7 paragraphs that say nothing in particular to my Memoir, didn't I?"

7NFA3OH,female,27,"Timeline:  Present  As you might have realized, Phantasmemoria now has a logo and a cute button down in the Philanthrope section for those who are fond of visual linkage. I owe this to the creative juices of  urlLink Karsh  and I cannot thank enough for the marvelous work he has come up with. He is a great blogger who has been with me from the very beginning. My hearty thanks, Karsh. Keep doing wha... oh wait... I already said that, didn't I?  Aside from this twist, as of today, Blogger turned an upgrade switch on us. Moreover, according to them, they also came up with ""tons"" of new templates to choose from which can be interpreted as we have ""tens"" of new templates. Better than nothing when compared to those 5 mundane, excruciatingly simple templates they had had previously.  One great thing they implemented is the Permalink update which gives each entry its own archive page. Ever since I started blogging, my permalinks have never (ne-ver!) worked right and just when I gave up on ever having proper links to my previous posts, they decided to work things out for me. Now each Permalink has a cute URL ending with their title. Thus, the searcher is taken to the entry which directly comes up on its own. Kudos to them!  Another great upgrade seems to be the commenting. Blogger now has its own comments system, it seems. Then again, for some reason, it isn't working right for me... which is not a grand surprise on my part. Alas, I would be astonished, if it did. Maybe someday I will have a technically-very-able reader who will give me a helping hand and I will implement Blogger's own Comments which will not get archived after a point and end up out of reach for free users (as in Haloscan). I can always hope.  What else? Hmm yes.. the visuality. Now and then, I happen to present a snapshot of a reflection of myself in real life out there. Since I do not wish to overload my Photo Bucket account, these images will now show up in an ""unrevealed"" post somewhere in my Archives as they give way to each other. I will not publicize its whereabouts so that only the dedicated readers (or better say, those who really care) will take their time to locate and see the new photo presented. As I do now, I will inform you that a new photograph is available and you will have your photo hunt at the ""many"" (pun intended) archives to spot the entry it is exhibited.

7NFA3OH,female,27,":: THE UNEXPECTED ::    Timeline:  Past  People can get way too creative when a party theme is concerned. Farewell to summer, hail to winter, cheers to new year, new block, new blog, new hairstyle, successful plastic surgery... Sky is the limit. I wonder when we are such inherent party animals, some deliberately ignore that optimistic part in themselves for the sake of a so called appealing ""whatever"" attitude towards life. Don't get me wrong. When I'm moody, I am quite intolerable myself... And I cannot say I can tolerate 24/7 hyperactive merriness, either (pun goes to all the hedonists of the globe). Mood swings are acceptable if you have a strong personality. But if you are ""whatever""ing everything around yourself so as to wear that apathetic costume that you fail to consider as ""cool"".... all I can hope for would be that someday someone can tell you how cheesy it looks.   Anyway. There we were, so happy that the summer was finally over and that we had to bury our teenaged noses back into books we did not care about, we decided to celebrate it big time. All through the day we shopped, bought food and ingredients, spirits and junk food before we got back to the neighborhood and started cooking up while the guys scattered to return in the afternoon for the grill they were responsible for. I was among the cooks, preparing potato puree with milk and my special fried eggplants coated with tomato sauce reciped by my Grandmother.   The constant gossip need that aroused within Goddess and I was suppressed by the hoopla around us. Girls were coming and going accompanied by the occasional screams due to something overcooked, undercooked or totally gone wrong. As afternoon (finally) arrived, I was quite exhausted. Although boys dropped by now and then there was no sign of Gambit... and this simply added suspense to my weariness.   I went back home (which was only 2 minutes away anyhow), took a shower and sat on my bed clad in a bathrobe wondering (have I mentioned I love wondering at times?) how everything would go tonight. All the neighborhood would be there which meant we were to be at least 30 people at the table. And there he was going to sit close to me when I just wanted to kick him at the [insert fitting body part here] for keeping me on the edge all day. As I got dressed and went back into the bathroom for the controversial hair do, I heard footsteps on the stairs (our summer house was triplex). I was hoping to spill my worries to Goddess so I stepped out of the bathroom...   ...only to face Gambit grinning at me in a breathtaking manner. I had never seen him as someone handsome but rather someone shabby who is always with a stubble and a silent, distant manner no matter how much attention he gets. This clean shaved, perfectly dressed up (a tight white shirt enhancing his tan and build, matched by stoned jeans that fit perfectly to his footballer legs and ... everywhere else) heartthrob was someone I had never seen before. I managed a shaky smile and greeting, I think. Obviously I managed fine since he nodded back, that cunning grin never leaving his face. I returned to the bathroom, clumsily spread some hair gel into my palm and somehow slowly got it over with my ardour while my anger sneaked back in.   ""How come you remained invisible all day?"" I asked to which he leaned his shoulder to the door and crossed arms, ""I was busy getting ready"" he said laughingly, ""Took sometime to bring myself back together."" Obviously, he had brought himself back together quite too well but that was something I didn't dare to utter. Instead, having done with my hair, I turned around to get back to the bedroom saying, ""Well at least you shaved."" (Things never come out the way they should at such occasions. What's sarcasm got to do with it here, right? But that's so me, indeed.) He remained silent for a while, watching me as I strapped a string of leather around my wrist then slowly said, ""You hate stubble, don't you?""   Well.. all I hated then was my entire self breaking into pieces as he unexpectedly took the reins, which I had been holding very carefully all through the summer, from my hands and hideously knocked me out (both physically and mentally) out of nowhere. So he was a diamond in the rough? Or he was a diamond who was aware of his worth but kept it hidden unless an occasion arised for him to enter his charisma to the scene? All these were racing in my mind when we heard Goddess's footsteps on the stairs. She gasped and whistled at Gambit and was playfully teasing him for which I was grateful. For it gave me the opportunity to finally breathe a little and exhale the tension stuck in my lungs.   That was how we left our house for the party... And that was just the beginning."

GC7Q917,female,23,"That't it, I quit!   I'm done.  When I woke up this morning, it became painfully obvious that I blacked out again.  Painful indeed, as my head was pounding from the 2 glasses of wine I imbibed last night.  A drinker such as myself does not black out from 2 glasses of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, but wine will give you a killer headached the next day, regardless of quantity.  But this is besides the point, as it was the tranqs that made me black out...I'm sure of it.  So I'm done.  I am in a tough spot as I take pills to make myself sane, and abuse these very pills.  But I'm done.  I'm drying out kittlings, b/c my memory is gone.  I have been so fucked up for so long and I just let the shame spiral just keep going.  And I want to be doing something productive...not looking for my next high (or low, as it were).  Blah blah blah. Its been said before.  No drinking until Chi-Town kiddies.  I'm serious.  And in this order, this is my plan of action: 1--Sell my piano (i'm hoping to get Jake to do most of the work by telling him i'll split ze profit 50/50) 2--Buy a Synth 3--Buy a plane ticket to Toronto 4--Buy a bike 5--Save up money for more 'good things' 6--Gather info for my possible interviews with Bendis and Millar 7--Gather info for my C.C.C. 8--Try not to kill myself or abuse alcohol and other shite that is just controlling me  LX is my sponsor almost in this whole thing, as he has been able to quit before and is able to both listen and relate.  And I don't want to be out of it altogether.  I just want to be able to say ""one glass of wine please"" and be done with it, instead of drinking straight from the bottle, popping 4 tranqs in one night and hoping for the best.  That's just lame.  God, the money I've wasted on all this.  Ugh...I'm not even identifiable without it.  And I think that scares me more than anything else.  I'm so afraid that I'm not a real person, a special person, without it...so lame.  Anyway, today was a band field trip to Sam Ash and Guitar Center.  And JD had mentioned before that maybe since my car still has some life left in her, I should be saving up for more pressing things.  So a synth is first on my list.  I'm researching right now and I think I'm probably going to go with a ROLAND, prolly a used one off EBAY.  I just need a good beginner synth that will get me started.  I'm also considering lessons to learn how to use the damn thing so I can progress.  I also have decided to fly to Toronto to save time/hassle by driving.  I figure I can save the money for that in 2 paychecks.  I had already taken off tomorrow for the court date that isn't happening now, so I'm just saying fuck it and not going in.  That way I can sit here tomorrow and finish my column.  I still don't have a 3rd thing to write about but I actually may write about DEAD AGAIN, even though Kenneth Branaugh makes me cringe.  That film was pretty damn good.  So it goes.  I'm also gonna probably head to South St. and try to rent THE EYE.  I got GORMAN this week and on Thursday me and LX are getting together for some ""jamming"" since Mike can't practice.  Should be fun.  JD bought me a real nice tank and hoodie @ the Borgata...he's a sweetie.  He made chicken alfredo tonight for dinner and I made garlic bread.  It was yummy.  I'm falling in love with him all over again.  I'm just trying to keep our communication as open as possible.  I don't want to resent him for things unsaid anymore.  I adore MyJD.  Almost mid-July already and I finally painted my toenails.  took me long enough!  Hehe...I just don't want to be a slacker anymore.    I really want to write a short story or something.

GC7Q917,female,23,"A short story amongst friends...    SYBIL AND THE SALT written by Mary, Stefan, Ry the Scot and Rae on 5.27.04   Once upon a time, there was a girl Sybil. Everyday she would travel to railroad tracks to put pennies on the rail.  And everyday the Conducter would shoot Sybil with the salt gun.  She would pick up the rock salt, take it hame, and make pretzels.   Sybil would ask all of her friends to come over and pose in weird positions in which she would then copy the shapes into pretsels.  Sybil decided one day that she would take them to the train conductor to make peace.  The train conductor took them willingly and so the cycle continued of pennies, salt, pretzels and peace.  This happened over 3 years, which some referred to as the ""3 Years Peace Before the Storm."" One day, instead of the conductor taking her pretzels of peace...he threw them on the groud and said:  ""No More Sybil! You have broken my heart!""  The conductor, a fat man with mustard stains on his traditional cap; was remembering events of the past.  Events with Sybil that  happened when she was only a little chile.  Children are innocent! But Sybil was not.  In fact she was the ANTI-CHRIST! and Sybil"" dawned her fangs and tore the conductor's throat out.  With warm blood coarsing through her preternatural veins, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a roll of pennies to finish what she had come to do. ""Death is your judgement--but not your punishment!"" Sybil said with eyes blazing with red light.  Quickly she exposed the roll of pennies and shoved them in his mouth. ""You, the Fathers of Lies, will know the meaning of 'loss of innocence' you evil Motherfucker!!!!""   Out went the passengers, leaving Sybil and the conductor alone. The passengers were an odd bunch all rejects from a Nike sweatshop in Taiwan that fed them through funnels of made sandpaper.  Thought time the all developed a rare throat disease called Scratcheothroatitus.  The sweared death on Nike and its entire corporation.  Traveling to America, the caught the train, the final leg on their trip to the headquarters. NEW YORK CITY JUNE 1st, 2004: NIKE HEADQUARTERS Vice asshole Frankie Fairview, sitting at his desk while a little blond girl enters with a roll of pennies and attacks! Bludgeoning the VP to death with a 3-inch phallic object.  Before this Sybil had figured out what her fate woudl be.  The workers would have come for her if she had sought them out.  They weren't supposed to be a part of this--it was between her and the conductor.  So it goes. And so, with Sybil's last breath--knowing her fate as a murderer and instigator for crimes unseen--Sybil unleashed all she could upon the Corporate Headquarters.  Using her skill she learned from The Father of Lies, she breathed fire with the devil, and brimstone with Lucifer himself.  There was nothing left of that city block when she was done.  Not a terroist act, but an act upon all that opposed the proleteriat.   ""Viva La Resistance!"" was her gutteral cry as she burst into flames. A Phoenix that would never rise again.

We're one split personality disorder of a band.  But I really trust and genuinely like the people I'm playing with, and I think both of them are really intelligent people.

GC7Q917,female,23,"KEOKICLASH notes   As of late, there has been a great debate between me, Stefan and Ry the Scot on the theme of DJ KEOKI’s KEOKICLASH.  I picked this up quite by accident, having stumbled upon it in BORDERS and saw that there was a remix of “Rippin Kittin” that I’d never heard before.  As soon as I told Stefan who the CD was mixed by—he was all like “WHAT???” b/c it seems that KEOKI was a raver DJ back in the day, and quite the drug fiend.  Ry thinks that KEOKI is totally rejecting his younger days of spinning and cashing in on the Electro movement.  I have listened to this CD extensively (it has not left my rotation since I got it a month ago) and the theme that comes across to me is far different than Ry’s cut and dry thesis.  KEOKI starts out his CD in full 90’s mode with a slightly queer rant.  The repeated line “I am legendary you are not” is not only topical for the “you better work” scene of the 90’s but almost crosses over into the “kittenz and the glitz” of Electro.  The next 2 songs focus on the drug scene and its bad effects, Miss Kittin says in her monotone accent “sex drugs and rock and roll…its over.”  PBD (permanent brain damage) is also addressed.  The negativity towards drugs may seem like KEOKI is denying his past experiences but I really think addressing them and showing that he has moved beyond them is displayed more.  The song that really rams his idea home is the voice over which says matter-of-factly “that? That was the “Rave Revolution” of the youth, sort of like a mockery of rave reality…they thought it was all about smiles and sweetness, flowers and candy,  but there is something bitter to taste.  And to think that there isn’t is foolish”  I think KEOKI is trying to say that he has realized the darkness can be in the music, not in the drug use and pill popping.  Electro has that dark and dirty edge that maintains the confidence of its predecessors without the blatant drug culture connection.  I have to believe that KEOKI has embraced a new type of music while paying homage to his roots.  It’s a journey of sorts illustrated through music.   end of notes   In other news, I’m feeling about 1000 times better than I did last week.  The jaw tension is gone, most likely from the tranq-popping.  Getting a full night’s sleep no doubt helps—I didn’t even hear Ze Moto Kitty meowing @ the door last nite.  THAT, my friends, is a good night’s sleep!!! I’m done drinking…for awhile.  I need to save money.  I want to buy a car by next year.  Plus we have about a zillion conventions we’re attending and I would like to have money to spend without charging anything.  I realize that I have debt and maybe sort of always will, but I’m not charging anymore.  I took the credit cards outta my wallet—hopefully that will help.    +++++++++++++++++++end of transmission+++++++++++++++"

H6JG1JJ,female,26,"christmas dinners at the loks'    after an especially hectic evening of work at the restaurant, k. and i amused ourselves for a couple of hours while mum and dad prepared dinner.  waiting for it was an event in itself as k. would run out of the kitchen after mum dropped the still-live massive crabs with foot-long legs on the ground and they skittered!  and i walked in once when dad was beheaded a lobster and tossed it back into the bin of lobsters.  it was kind of eerie to see it extending a leg up as if searching for it's lost head *shivers.*  mum kept saying that mussels were super-fast to steam: ""two minutes and they'll be done!"" and she tended to that as k. and i attacked the lobsters.  she has a super-sized 2-lb one and i found that after some effort (i eat from the head down), i wasn't so hungry enough to finish the tail.  before last night, i thought the indication of undercooked mussels was a closed shell but apparently there are other clues and we learned that ""two minutes"" is not quite enough!.... like with the case of ""dragon eye"" fruit (loong-gnan), all i have to do is eat one bad one to be quite scarred from the incident.  dad also stir-fried lobsters in ginger and green onions so it was refreshing to eat something ""not raw"" for a change in the dinner.  to get more in the christmas spirit, i mixed up some cocktails for me, k., and mum.  mum already had a glass and a half of red wine (wrong colour i gather) during the meal.  after a glass, she was stumbling but her face was still pale.  apparently there's a chinese saying that if your face reddens, it's a good thing, the alcohol is going up.  if you just get paler, it's bad, because it's gone to your liver instead....  anyways, cocktails were yummy (milk and a total of one ounce of bailey's and tia maria).  after half a glass i was flushed and burning and dad told us of drinking stories in bermuda from decades ago.  mum was a giggly mess after her milk cocktail!  now you'd think that was odd after my spiel about temperance only a couple of days ago.  when you do it at home with your family and i certainly couldn't have poured myself a second drink without mum thinking i'm an alcohlic, it hardly feels anymore as if you're drinking.  so i don't think it applies except that i know i'm not really vulnerable after one drink but i still would decline just one drink when in public, when there are uncontrollable factors.  and if my family was not around to watch my intake, i'd have to practice the control myself and limit myself.  the next day we have our turkey dinner.  i'm not too sure the lok family has always had turkey dinner on christmas (or thanksgiving) but we do like any other family these days.  not too much too report - the gravy was too salty and i was all too glad to have only roasted potatoes, baked sweet potatoes, carrots, and chinese broccoli like the time k. and i went to the   galley buffet   and i passed over on the roast for just vegetable medley and mashed potatoes.  that is the way i would prefer  all  my meals - vegetarian, with the presence of meat for flavour but not actually eating meat.  they made me eat lots and lots of turkey.  :(   too much chocolate and too much food  this holiday season.  i haven't jogged a bit and that fanciful weight-training replacement for jogging for three weeks was suspended after a day (it is always most horrible, even on my trusty weight-training routine, on the first day).  i have this sad feeling that while i don't yo-yo diet, i yo-yo exercise (three months on, one month off) and that is the reason why i don't see those amazing results that only appear after half a year of diligence! :(  our christmas movie was   catch me if you can  .  it was a actually a toss-up between it and   two weeks notice   (sandra bullock in a romantic comedy equals the most wholesome comedies these days).  the reviews just keep rolling in for ""catch"" in the newspaper here and on  urlLink msnbc  so we went for it.  afterall, you never know if leonardo dicaprio will have a good movie but tom hanks is a great actor.  and it was a great movie!    ""people think what you put out for them""   (paraphrasing).  i thought that the character played by leo would be smoother but he played the all-too-human con artist greatly anyhow.  i was a bit scared that it was an action (bloody) kind of outlaw flick but it was just plainly funny and heart-warming.  i was hugging my father when we left and anyone who knows me knows that that's me being affected.  recently i have also seen the movie   swingers   which was highly recommended by a. as being really hilarious.  k. didn't like it.  she didn't understand how it was funny.  i found it funny in some parts.  it is  almost  a male response to   sex and the city   but with far less sex!  not knowing what it is like to be eligible male in the dating world, i don't know how true-to-life the movie was - think that a. likes it  because  it is true-to-life.  i can sympathize with the guys - it's a bit of a shark pool in the dating world and i find myself wanting to act at times like the player guy who is the loser in the end and at other times i want to put up the honest front and that the guy who gets the awesome girl (played by heather graham) in the end (oh, and has his exgirlfriend call him after a 6-month hiatus for a good plot twist).     urlLink read more...."

H6JG1JJ,female,26,"it's nice to see halifax's smattering of lights!!   it was really idyllic to get back to halifax around noon and relax the rest of the day.   trust me , riding for two hours in a decade-old mazda 323 whose suspension was going cramped in the middle of the backseat with the sun beating down on you is  not  fun.  chris and i got to go down to waterfront - haven't done that with him and haven't done it but once or twice this summer.  we might be having an  indian summer  in that it was insanely cold (for the summer) and it was 30 degrees today.  sweltering, almost, or perhaps we just weren't used to being hot after being deprived for more than a year.  we walked around the  bishop's landing  area.  they have a handful of ""upscale"" shops and concepts on the ground-level of the super upscale condominium along the waterfront.  for example, there is high-end fusion dining at  urlLink bish , ethnic and upscale cuisine at  urlLink hamachi steakhouse , a spa (bliss), a unique gift shop (gifted), a dentist, florist, an ice cream shop (scoops), shoe shop, and the fourth installment of the  urlLink ""italian....""  series in the form of    botticelli's .  unless i have the scoop really wrong, italian market (young & robie), italian gourmet (doyle street), italian deli (lower water street), and botticelli are owned by the same person.  though botticelli seems to veer away from the concept i saw in the market and gourmet in more than just the name....   someone  was reported to have returned from italy where he learned how to make gelato from the best of them and boasted of then serving the best gelato in the city.  we got each a scoop of pistachio and amaretto (2.95 each) in really nice neon plastic cupcake molds with neon plastic paddles to eat from.  i'm very impressed with the expenditure on presentation even if all the samplers we had this common fragrant scent....  i'm still a  urlLink diomio's  fan though....  we stopped in the    mulan chinese cultural center  on lower water street just across from bishop's landing.  this isn't a particular review since we didn't eat anything there.  they serve light chinese food snacks (like steamed buns and home-cooked-sounding rice dishes) and a huge assortment of tea in a pristine and spartan chinese environment.  it is also a store (wonder about the prices though i didn't poke about too much) selling artwork (some nice paintings and not your stereotypical carp watercolours), chinese fiction novels for kids and primers, tea sets, jade, some clothing....  it's not too trendy but it's nice and it's been a while since there has been a tasteful chinese novelty store.  i wonder how long  peking alley  has not existed....  for dinner we went to  urlLink momoya .  chris suggested a new japanese restaurant on quinpool (andy's) but i'm waiting for someone (reviewer or trustworthy sushi afficionado) to give an opinion first.  you just don't want a ruined sushi experience....  i ordered small tempura udon (6.80) and agedashi tofu (4.50).  chris ordered beef teriyaki (10.00) and the chef's special sashimi (28.00).  and he succumbed to enjoying japanese green tea with the meal.... :)  the tempura was good (forgot that the batter was the way it was - chinese-style) although i have gotten bigger pieces of shrimp before....  tofu was excellent was well.  chris' teriyaki was shockingly large-looking with a 12"" round plate half covered with salad and the other half with rice and full slabs of teriyaki'ed beef covering all the rice.  we call the teriyaki (and my udon) the filler-food because just raw fish isn't enough to quench the appetite.  when we ordered the sashimi to be shared between us, i asked the waitress how many pieces came with it and she responded that there would ""9 pieces.""  i must have made a face or something because the prices i'm used in toronto (and granted i don't get sashimi specials here) are as follows: 3 pcs. each of 4 kinds of fish for $14-16, 3 pcs. each of 6 kinds of fish for $18-20.  so when the waitress did bring out the chef's special and it contained in the neighbourhood of 17 pcs. of fish and some other stuff, she seemed to tentatively asked me if the dish was big enough.  what was i supposed to say... no??  so, the rundown - it contained 4 pcs. salmon, 3 pcs. tuna, 4 pcs. red snapper, 2 pcs. surf clam, 2 pcs. (very small) shrimp, 2 pcs. scallop, and many pieces of salmon roe (the really jelly kind), and many pieces of slimey-eel'y-translucent-fish ( baht fahn yuu ).   how do you put a price tag on ecstasy?   to round out the day, we went to the jordan family home and watched the episode of  enterprise  i missed while on geek retreat and the first 45 minutes of  glad iator.  we munched on popcorn and washed it down with jasmine tea.  :)  (why can you pronounce ""radiator"" both rad-iator and ray-diator but you can't pronounce glad-iator glay-diator?  when the movie came out i kept calling it glay-diator driving my sister up a wall and correcting me everytime.  i deliberately said ""glad-iator"" and she was so used to correcting me she was tricked into saying it horribly ""wrong.""  :p )  when we were driving across the mackay bridge to get me home, i marvelled how much i missed the big(ger) city that i was deprived of for the meeting....     urlLink read more...."
H6JG1JJ,female,26,"what's the real story?   i grumbled yesterday when i arrived at work late and had to prepare a shirley temple, a peach italian soda, and a strawberry soda (2.75).  it's fabulous that we serve $$-drinks, but sometimes when you have lots of other stuff to do, it's a bottleneck to have to prepare them.  throughout his meal, the guy asked for three more of  strawberry sodas .  while his female companion and a small child with him had normal sized meals, he ordered two appetizers for himself: chicken wings (8 pcs., 6.75) and pan-fried dumplings (8 pcs., 6.50, and on-the-spot preparation in the kitchen).  his main course was amusing -- a dish of honey garlic ribs all for himself (9.75).  just ribs, no rice.  and then he placed an order for a  strawberry cheesecake  (4.25) and a  butterscotch sundae  (3.50) while he ordered his fourth italian soda.  i had to smile a bit when it turned out that he ordered both desserts for himself....  which made me wonder if there was some story behind the indulgence.  (he's not fat, btw, rather, he's young and fit-looking.)  wyn: tomorrow he's being locked into maximum security prison and so today is his last day of freedom. mum:  [incredulous]   no....!  maybe he's going away and this is his farewell dinner. wyn: maybe he's in the army and he has to go overseas tomorrow (or soon) to, like, afghanistan. mum: maybe he just eats like this all of the time....     urlLink read more...."
H6JG1JJ,female,26,"not so slack, i think   working at the restaurant isn't the least bit intellectually challenging but it's doing my good daughterly duty to ungrudgingly work for entire shifts (as opposed to working only a few hours) because very soon i'll be selfish again when i start up school again....  this time (compared to last summer where i was saving up for shopping in toronto) i have the very unromantic goal of paying off my credit card bill and saving up a few pennies.  :p  in the summer, i'm extraordinarily excited to be taking  advanced web programming .  i need a second course and it could be either parallel computing (eek!) or artificial neural networks (never thought i'd consider it but here i am....) or intelligent systems.  i first considered software engineering (snore) but i'm  through  with taking courses just because i'll survive them but hate them with a passionate throughout it all.  finally finished  urlLink mansfield park  and mona (who delightfully shares my love for jane austen novels) was right about everything happening in the last 20 pages of the novel!  it was great, so satisfying as usual.  :)  (now i want to see the  urlLink movie !!)  now i'm reading  urlLink neuromancer  which is an ultra-classic uber-geek sci-fi novel to read.  it is, as the bookcover says ""a mind binder.""  but fun, certainly different from mansfield park.  :p  the problem for me is i have no idea what to read that has been recently written - and so my choice of reading gets to be somewhat random.  i don't actually know exactly what i'm interested in reading (okay, for certain some asian-american literature but not the freaked out ghosts-stuff.  and very selected sci-fi: this girl doesn't want to be stuck reading a long series either.)  i hardly watch movies so i read movie reviews and  urlLink enterprise reviews  and compared to those, i don't have much interest in reading book reviews... or perhaps i haven't found a compelling enough reviewer that i can trust... who sents the periodic and occasional review directly to my email account....  paul called me and gave me a really big moral boost for my soul-searching - er, supervisor-hunting... thank you!!  :)     urlLink read more...."

JJTRDON,male,15,"*Goes into mesmeric trance* Wow, was this weekend ever as tiring as hell. My team placed 4th at state for the robotics competition, and thank you all who came and supported us. MSA had three teams there, and considering we're a small school, thats quite a feat. And by the way, I got up at 6 on Saturday. I got home at 8, majorly exhausted. I didn't have enough energy to stomach the vegetable dish my dad made, so I had good ol' pizza...again. What a day, and damn it was fun. Hehe  Then Sunday, I was late to the Darksteel Pre-release, causing me to wait 4 hours until the next tournament started. It wasn't so bad, since I wasn't the only one late. I got up at 8 Sunday, and I got home around 7. Luckily I had no homework. Well...there was that science I didn't do...  Then of course, the wakeup call the next morning coming in the form of an obnoxious, ear-splitting beep. Jazz band was canceled today due to the weather, which was a nice benefit of all this snow. I've got a bit of homework tonight, so that helped. Also, I won't be going to my drum lesson tonight, yet another plus. I want to take someone to the Ice Palace this weekend too...hmmm....  That bastard still hasn't gotten the shipment of Mirrodin boxes, which does contain mine, in yet. It's getting me really pissed too-I ordered it on the 29th of December! *sue for mail fraud...*  Well, I'm off to actually get my homework done, and listen to music of course.  See ya'll lata, Bren"
JJTRDON,male,15,"There are soooo many concerts coming up, its insane. Somewhere around 10.  April 4th: Random at Central Park  April 13th: Jazz coffeehouse at MSA, 7:00.  April 20th: Spring concert at MSA, 7:00.  April 21st: MCTC concert with Random, 7:30.  April 30th: RANDOM concert at MOA!!! Should be fun. *LOCK-IN AT MSA THAT NIGHT*  May 1st: MSA choir concert at Central Park, 7:00.  May 15th: Orchestra concert  May 23rd: Orchestra concert  All that, plus rehearsals, other stuff, yeah...its almost too much.  English paper status: 1.5 pages done, outline turned in.  A small recap:  Math: started chapter 11 yesterday.  Science: Did a web assignment that looked like it was for 8 year olds.  Band: Same old, same old, except there was real fun going on in the trumpet section today...Mr. Shelton had to work that out. I'm sorry, but our trumpet section sucks. Its sound is weak, its 3 players weak, and PETER KARLSTRAND can't play the right f*cking notes. EVER. I know I don't play the trumpet, but if I took lessons, I could play better than him in a few months easily. He fumbles constantly with notes, and our spring concert is 3 weeks away. We NEED our trumpets to play the right notes on Berceuse and Finale. More like we need a few trumpets BACK at MSA. Lets see...Amanda...Eric Gross...Pat Setley...it sucks having a trumpet section of 3, with only 2 people who really know what they're doing.  Spanish: Working on the city maps. etc. etc. etc.  English: 1.5 pages done, and working.  Social: presentations will finish tommorow, current events the same. I'm just thankful we don't have a social studies teacher who brings their own opinions into the classroom. Although...I'm starting to think he's conservative...  I really think I do too much, I think too much, and I try to analyze things way too much. I try to see the ends of everything, and when they're not there, I search even more. Over analyzation takes up too much time. And if I can't analyze something to my liking, I analyze more. Maybe its because I'm Irish, maybe its because I'm German, but I was born like that. It's tough being an overthinker..."
JJTRDON,male,15,"Ever been so tired you can't do anything except lay down and wish you were sleeping? Yep, that's how I feel right this damn minute.  Fact: you can become very groggy from oversleeping. I discovered this is quite true by sleeping 11 hours last night. I would have slept longer had I not been required to get up because of some stupid bike practice.  Speaking of the bike practice: 1. The coach was almost 1/2 hour late, and didn't say ""sorry I fucked up and delayed the ride"", nor did he say anything that included the words ""I'm sorry"" and ""late"". 2. The ride was painful. Painfully short that is. I wanted to go faster than a leisurely pace, and longer than about an hour. The reason (no, I'm not talking about the new Hoobastank album) was, ""some of our riders were tired from racing yesterday."" I've had to race and then ride the next day, so get over it! 3. There was a potluck. There was lots of food. I ate too much, with nothing else said. 4. I think I may be switching teams, because I'm so f@#%ing sick of poor organization, or the lack thereof. I hate starting the season late. I hate missing season opener races, which results from the late starts, which results from the shitty organization. Everything the coach says turns into a pile of ""no development team...will be development team...sort of...comp team only practices, but others invited..."" W.T.F? 5. The coaches lost everyone's orders of jerseys and shorts, so everyone has to pay again. WTF?!? 6. I don't really know anyone on the team. No one to talk to, really. And we all know how terribly anti-social I am...  So this is what 11 hours of sleep plus unorganized bike team coaches can do to you huh? Turn you into a pessimistic asshole, thats what. Well, more like excedingly annoyed and angry. Maybe I can switch to Andrew Kotz's team. Then I actually know somebody that I used to race with. And I hope to God that team's more organized than mine.  Oh yeah, and now I'll close with the lyrics of something I wrote today: fuck lyrics in blogs for today. lol, no lyrics today. If you want to know a song I like, I'll give you song A by band B, nothing else said.  A=The Reason B=Hoobastank  Like I said, nothing else said. Oh, and you're welcome Dylan and Amelia."
JJTRDON,male,15,"So lent’s started, and Passion of the Christ has caused a huge, and unnecessary uproar. As for lent, I haven’t given up anything. I don’t believe in the idea of giving something up for lent as self-sacrifice. Instead, I think that people should give up their time (well, maybe do give something up…lol) to serve and help other people. You give up something to better yourself, right? So then give up your time and energy to do something good, which inherently makes you a better person, and it helps out others too to make them feel better during lent. That’s my theory, so critique me if you’d like. On another religious note, my feelings on The Passion of the Christ: agh!!!! Sure, the evangelicals (who happen to be crazed conservatives) praise its graphic representation of “how it was” for Jesus on the cross, crucifixion, etc. This movie has way too much f%^&ing hype and publicity for what it offers. I myself have not seen it, and I don’t plan to. Ever. Instead of showing the violence and hatred of the time, why not show all of the good things Jesus did? This is just another reason why I don’t particularly like Mel Gibson, along with the Lethal Weapon series. He’s a violence-loving conservative bastard. lol  Moving along ::cough:: ENGLISH SUCKS!!! Well, maybe not so bad, but this project sure seems daunting. I mean, nearly 300 points in about 1 month, tons of work, and the topic isn’t necessarily interesting. Even yet, I managed to write over 200 words on “what it means to be a Murphy” today…lol. Then there’s that social project, which shouldn’t be so bad since we have tons of class time. Over all, the class I dislike most right now is English. Have fun with vectors in pre-calc  The biking season’s closer than I thought-I already have an indoor training session this Saturday. DAMN this snowstorm! It can’t be spring with 7 damned inches of wet, heavy, sloppy snow on the ground, with me shoveling it all away. No, I don’t have a snowblower. Not that we really need them a whole lot, thanks to global warming…and when snow comes, people are up in arms about it.  Thank you, Mr. Bush, for your immense efforts on industry emissions control. You have really helped fuck up our air, and you still deny the existence of global warming. In fact, you try to cover up and eliminate all of the scientific FACTS that point towards global warming. I want to thank you again, Mr. President, on your efforts to weaken the United States Economy and drop the whole damned country into 500 billion dollar budget deficit. And also, thank you for cutting the taxes of fat, rich company-owning bastards all over the country and backstabbing middle and lower-class citizens. It’s really helped eliminate the huge poverty gap. Despite all these wonderful tax cuts, you took the country into Iraq for no real need, except for all that oil that a Texas oilman like you can’t resist. And now the country is stuck between Iraq and a hard place. Thank you, again, for stealing the 2000 election and screwing over the United States of America.  A good book to read: Red, White, and Liberal, by Alan Colmes. He happens to be the host of a news show on Fox news network, which is by coincidence, the most utterly idiotic and disgustingly conservative TV network."
JJTRDON,male,15,"Its worse than last night. I don't think I'll be playing tommorow at all, not for one minute. I'm afraid that if I do, I'll end up cutting my lips and bleeding, which takes weeks to heal.  Anyway...here's today:  Math: I worked ahead last week, yet I still have a bit of homework tonight. How the f@#% did that happen?  Science: Great...another lab. And we still have a lab report to do. On another note, I somehow got into a conversation with Kacy, Will, Michelle, Kevin, and Kevin about sex and masturbation. Uh....yeah weird. It was kinda funny though, I admit.  Band: prepared for concert, need I say more?  Spanish: did a few quizzes in preparation for Thursday's test  English: Got to skip it because of band. Isn't music grand?  Social: see above  After school: took the bus home, ran an errand. To *drum roll* Cottage Grove Florist. I got a white rose boutonerre for the concert, and some other things...  The concert went pretty smoothly, except for the start. I was to open the concert with the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, but it was not to be without any technical difficulties. Firstly, I started playing. The damned power strip that supplied electicity to the percussion section was stuck under the pedals, so they couldn't be pressed. I stopped, and fixed the problem by kicking it out of the way. During this, the piano power plug-1 of 5, I might add-came out. Again, I had to fix the problem. What a joy...  Our last piece kicked major a$$. Berceuse and Finale was pretty dang good, considering I had never played quite that loud during the rehearsal, so I made a ton of people jump. But hey-if you're a percussionist playing loud rolls through that whole thing, and you're wearing a tux, you're going to get pretty hot.  After the concert was pretty fun too...except for the part when I had to load up the drum set for tommorow's concert (yes, there's another) in my station wagon out in the rain. Wasn't something to get jollies out of. I honestly did not know that Adam attempted suicide before, so thats one thing I learned. It also explained why he was out of school for 1.5 months.  I tried putting ice on my lips before (kissing ice...lol), but it didn't do a whole lot. I hate braces with a passion almost equal to my hatred of SUVs, but not quite. Braces suck!  Oh, and I did slip and fall today thanks to this damn rain, and I didn't get hurt at all, so here's some lyrics:  ""Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  When the shadows fallin' and the day turns into night I hear my angel callin' and I can't wait to see the light Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  Sometimes I get a feelin' like a fever comin' over me Just a touch of my angels hand and I'm right back on my feet  Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  Stay with me baby. Come down from the sky Just like an angel. Take me to paradise  Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me""  -""Angel of Mercy"", Johnny Lang"
JJTRDON,male,15,"If the President can get away with lying about Weapons of Mass Destruction, I could get away with lying about when I'm returning from vacation, right? The weather sucked up in Brainerd-cold and rainy. Not good weather for biking...  What I did and didn't do on a 2-day vacation:  Did- -sleep in -ate at China Buffet -ate at Prairie Bay Heartland Restaurant (they have a $157 bottle of wine there...) -biked 15 miles -saw Fahrenheit 9/11 (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!) -went bowling at Paul Bunyan Bowl -played pool at Paul Bunyan bowl  Did not- -go biking enough -see the movies I wanted  So its nearly determined that I'll quit biking and either: 1. start up baseball again 2. play tennis (yay!)  Also another thing I plan to do some day soon is go movie hopping the whole day at Oakdale cinemas. Pay for 1 movie, see 4. Good deal if you ask me."
JJTRDON,male,15,"Yeah...not too smart. Today's only the second time I've played trumpet, and I did for 45 minutes today. The first time was only 5 minutes. My lips are really tired, and I still can't hit the blasted tuning note!!!! GRRRR!!!!  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't expect so much out of myself on the second time, but hey-I need to work hard on it. And yes, the following quote is true.  ""I don't believe you can do anything if you really want to, but I do believe you can play anything if you work hard enough."" Right on, Jamie.  Maybe I should only practice for 15 minutes at first. I'll probably kill my lips and not be able to play for days, so I'll have to slow it down a bit. I do expect too much too fast...  Dammit. Trackstar is working again, so I have to go finish this crappy english webquest.  Today: NO SCHOOL!!!! hehehe I picked up a copy of a fingering chart and lip slurs from Jamie (thanks), did some homework, borrowed a trumpet from Amanda, and practiced for too long. Yeah...not a whole lot, but this week is going to be busy. Tommorow there's the MSA Spring concert. On Wednesday, there's the RANDOM concert at MCTC. Plus I'm going to be playing trumpet a ton this week, so music really is my life this week.  I'll features a song that Minnesota Brass did on Saturday night. By the way, they're phenominally good.  ""Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous night to make romance 'Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I'm trying to please to the calling Of your heart-strings that play soft and low And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush   Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love   Well, I wanna make love to you tonight I can't wait 'til the morning has come And I know that the time is just right And straight into my arms you will run And when you come my heart will be waiting To make sure that you're never alone There and then all my dreams will come true, dear There and then I will make you my own And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside And I know how much you want me that you can't hide   Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love   Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous night to make romance 'Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I'm trying to please to the calling Of your heart-strings that play soft and low And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush    One more Moondance with you in the moonlight On a magic night La, la, la, la in the moonlight On a magic night Can't I just have one more dance with you my love""  -""Moondance"", Van Morrison"
JJTRDON,male,15,"Yep. When I put a little thought into it, I realized that I can't play a horn yet, well, not really. Plus I have no experience marching. I would really suck in Chops. That's why I want to do Park marching band first, so I actually know what the heck I'm doing when I go to Chops drill camp. Yeah, so I'm biking for another year. whoohoo!  Speaking of biking...I went out today, and geez that wind is strong. I got up to probably 35 mph on Lincoln going with the wind, which happens to be flat ground. In highest gear, on Napolean (lol, my sister came up with that name for my white bike, so don't ask), with a cadence of like 100 rpms. It was great. Damn stop signs...yeah, they're fun to run too.  I really hope we get severe weather today. We need rain, and I love watching storms...especially when they hit the school. lol. Its getting hazy again, and this morning nothing happened. Stupid storms aren't forming. Oh yeah, and there's tornadoes north west and north east of here, and guess what? WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY!!!!! AND I CAN SEE THE STUPID STORM NORTH OF HERE!!!  Hm...what else did I do today: 1. Went to church 2. Road my bike around town a while, went to Buddy's house and Jamie's house, only to fine neither of them home. Continued on, and found Jamie and Becky up near Cottage Square Mall, and I they convinced me to start chops next year, and to do Park Marching Band this year. So next year I won't be the only rookie-Becky'll be one too...yay, I won't be the only idiot not knowing what they're doing. yeah, no homework, no chores, and no music yet. I'll save that stupid english web quest for tommorow.  I think I'll feature the song that Chops sang last night, and the weather's great today anyhow.  ""I see trees of green, red roses too  I see them bloom for me and you  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world   I see skies of blue and clouds of white  The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world   The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  Are also on the faces of people going by  I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' ""How do you do?""  They're really saying ""I love you""   I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow  They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world   Oh yeah""  -Louis Armstrong.

JJTRDON,male,15,"I've only got 5 minutes, so I'll try to make this update a highly concentrated piece of random rambling, containing the most information possible that may or may not interest you.  The week so far: crap, except for when one of the gorillas at the zoo tried to bust out and kill Kevin Rosenberg...that was funny.  This week has been pretty much junk so far. Although, I did check out two excellent, and I mean that wholeheartedly, books, both by an author that should be more widely recognized-much more. You get 3 guesses: 1. Tom Clancy? no 2. Michael Moore? no...lol 3. Al Franken? he should be, but no  Give up? Well here's a clue: He's from British, er, in other words, he's British.  Ok fine, I'll tell you: Neil Gaiman is the guy, and Stardust and American Gods (highly recommended!!) are the novels. But I do warned you, these books aren't for everyone. They are generally exclusively for people who actually  want  to read, and not just books required for English class. Also, you need an adult mind, as it is the definition of an ""adult book"". Everyone's assignment: find out more about this author, and write an 8-page report on him. j/k  As for this weekend, I'll be cross-country skiing and downhill skiing up north at Duluth and Lutsen, respectively. Should be hellafun, so as long as I don't break anything performing a 360 helicopter.  Well, I must be going, as the old man needs the internet.  Again, I thank everyone who has given me the ideas and such for this blog. I especially thank Amelia for recommending that wonderful book-it's a must read for all book junkies out there.  Bren"
JJTRDON,male,15,"God, I wish may-term were here. Only what, 4.5 more weeks? Yeah, thats about right.  English paper status: DONE!!!! All 9 pages of text, 2 pages of outline, 1 page of title, 1 page of works cited, and 1 page from the packet. 14 pages total of english crap, and supposedly/hopefully this paper rocks. Its called: ""The History and Roots of American Jazz"", quite a hefty topic.  Here's what happened today in school while I was wishing I was outside on the bike:  Math: We're doing parametric equations right now, if anyone knows what the hell that is. Its breaking normal equations into two parts, an X part and a Y part, both of which are functions of T after this transformation. weird.  Science: I got a 61/65 on the test. not too bad.  Band: blah blah blah, working towards the concert, what else is to say?  Spanish: Sustic got pissed, but I doubt she'll end up doing anything about that paper-wedge throwing the other day. As for the field trip tommorow to Boca Chica, I deemed it unworthy of my time and money, and purposely forgot the slip. My time is better spent avoiding having bio and math homework than eating a frickin Mexican buffet at 10:00 in the morning. I mean, what the hell are they going to serve, eggs w/jabanero peppers? french toast with rice and curry? I don't think so...  English: Paper's done! Paper's done! Now its time for that deadline to whoosh by! Need I say more?  Social: More current events crap, more notes, and more US soldiers dead in fucking Iraq. I'm so sick of hearing about that place...  And I won't go on a rant about the unjustness of the Iraqi war. Not now.  Instead of finishing up with a lyric, which Dylan deemed pointless (lol), I'll end with yet another quote of mine.  ""Half the time in life when you think you're being rejected, you're really rejecting yourself."""

LNKZVVJ,male,26,"I was just chatting with a fellow I am friends with (a hard-core Calvinist theorist with an office across from mine).  He said he noticed that I am much more serious this semester (I think the sports jacket, tie, and nice pants threw him off).  As he puts it, it is how they force you into professionalism, by making all your time focus on your work (teaching, writing, etc.).  Serious....more serious......what a dreadful thought.  As some might say that I was uptight already (something about making diamonds out of coal with some part of the anotomy), this is terrible.  Heck, I titled this thing with a freakin' Latin quote by Cicero!!!!  HEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, soon there will be some fun.  I head to South Bend this weekend to see the dear heart, to attend a dance by the law school.  The dancing fool will come out!  The sleeper shall awaken!  I shall cry havok and let slip the dogs of war!!!!  Oh, wait.....that doesn't sound right.....that comes at student evalutation time (""if any of you are even thinking about giving me bad marks, let me introduce you to my hounds of hell.  I call them 'Fluffy' and 'Cuddles.'  Yes, they think you look like a mighty fine t-bone steak.  Don't screw with me."").  No, that's not right.  They are good kids, for the most part.  Heck, we talked about Augustine today - I was excited, and they didn't commit mass suicide.  So the universe and all within it are in order.  Does bleem-hunting count as too serious?  It's been fun today.  I really have to stop doing that.  Perhaps another sign of seriousness is utter randomness.  I think.  Perhaps.  I'm not sure...."
LNKZVVJ,male,26,"Figure I'll get this out of the way now.  First, it is an open question who exactly Presidential nominee John Kerry meant when he mentioned ""other leaders"" are telling him how they support Kerry's run.  But, now, we have a website to help out  urlLink here .  For Kerry's, ummm...different way of answering the question, give  urlLink this little note  on NRO's The Corner a look.  For something a little more humorous, you may get a kick out of this:  urlLink LEGO playsets  of some major social theorists (Giddens, Foucault, Butler, etc.).  While NRO has the link, I first ran into this interesting group when I got to the grad program.  Some of the theory profs mentioned the  urlLink social theorist trading cards  that the group passed out during a conference.  Yes, we are nerds, and we enjoy these things.  Resistance is futile - you will be assimilated.  And if that is still not enough, give their  urlLink action figure line  a look-at (my dissertation chariman has a printout of these on his door).  This is what social/political theorists do as jokes.  Yes, we are sad.  Humor us.  Now to something completely different: the Spanish elections.  I must say, its results have made me rather morose.  The Spanish people, in a strong, resolute voice, have told those who slaughtered their countrymen, ""WE'RE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Please don't hit us again!!!!  We'll be good, we promise!""  Appeasement, sadly, lives on.  This, though, illustrates what might be the difference between the America and at least much of Western Europe.  In America, an attack happens, and the general mood, at least at the beginning, is righteous indignation at the attackers, yes concerned with security, but also very much focused on retribution by arms.  In Western Europe, it seems the reaction is understandable sadness, but matched also with this idea of negotiating or appeasing those who have already shown no concern for the civilian population.  It is a difference that makes the two perpectives difficult to communicate to the others.  Perhaps all I can say to it is:  Scite vestum inimicum.   [man, I hope I wrote that correctly]  Hopefully, I will have a comment option up soon.  I would very much dig some feedback."
LNKZVVJ,male,26,"Well, it appears I have managed to whittle down the true believers to about four now - I thank you for your high level of endurance.

But, in any case, I will have some stuff up later today - as I am working on the dissertation, I will no doubt need distraction at some point.  It will either be on David Lynch as conservative (there's actually a book about that)(yes, be afraid), being an alien in academia, or a random ""books I dig"" entry.

LNKZVVJ,male,26,"Well, there is one other thing from Steve's post that I did want to mention.  Specifically, on a word that becomes more irritating the more it is repeated.  The line is this: "" Johnson is also an admired historian (admired, that is, by neo-con ideologues such as those at the New Criterion) .""   Some disclosure - I rather enjoy  The New Criterion .  Certainly seems of a higher quality than most the pap that passes as literary criticism these days.  But, that probably showed (in my earlier post  urlLink on taste , I mentioned the new book by  The New Criterion 's managing editor, Roger Kimball).  But, that's not my area of concern.   ""...neo-con ideologues...""  Neo-con, short for neoconservative.  ""Neoconservative"" started out as a term of abuse (used by liberals against those who jumped ship, like Irving Kristol and others), then was taken as a name for a certain type of conservatism (by Kristol, William Bennett, and sundry others), and now has come full circle back to a term of abuse.  For what, I have no idea.   Let me put it straight out - ""neoconservative"" is, in many ways, a meaningless word, and continues to lose meaning each time the word is recited.  I have  urlLink mentioned before  the dreadful uses of this word (especially as it seemed to be a code-word for ""Straussian-influenced conservative Jew,"" insinuating stock-villain cabals out of the  Elders of Zion ), but now it has gone on to incoherence.   I am a conservative, more of the mainstream variety, with some leanings toward theoconservatism (another word made as a term of abuse).  I enjoy  The New Criterion , and heck, even read  The Weekly Standard  sometimes.  Am I, therefore, a ""neo-con ideologue""?  I supported the war in Iraq, and I still do.  Does that make me a ""neo-con ideologue""?  I am a conservative - does  that  make me a """"neo-con ideologue""?   So, it comes to this question - what  is  a neoconservative?  Can anyone give some type of definition?  Probably the best attempt I've seen was done  urlLink Jonah Goldberg  of  urlLink NRO  (in his own style, naturally) in a collection of three columns ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ).  By going over the genealogy of this term, he illustrates just how worthless it is for contemporary discussion.  I tend to see it being partially useful (but even then, only partially) in describing the movement in the United States by some leftists to the right (getting ""mugged by reality,"" in Kristol's phrase) over the middle/late middle part of the twentieth century.  That's about it.   But, let's consider what neo-con seems to mean now.  It appears to have fallen into the same linguistic trap that  urlLink Orwell warned of  in his ""Politics and the English Language"": ""The word  Fascism  has now no meaning in so far as it signifies 'something not desirable.'""  Consider the example - a fascist is a radical nationalist, where all spheres and elements of society (individual, religion, economy, etc.) are subservient to the state, it usually entails a large and centralized government, and sundry other matters.  Clearly, not pleasant people.  And yet, how many times have I heard a supporter for limited government called a ""fascist""!  It would be like shouting down Howard Zinn as a ""running-dog capitalist"" - incoherent.   So too comes the fate of ""neoconservative.""  No one seems to have any idea what the term means, but it is good enough - to say someone is ""neocon"" can communicate so many different ideas (imperialist, warmonger, money-driven, Cheney, ""compassionate conservative,"" Wolfowitcz, religious nut, etc.) without having to put them together in any straightforward sense.  It is a term of abuse, and seems to be little more now."

Maybe that has something to do with Napster and Kazaa, because the last time I bought a single might have been before I discovered Napster.  Or maybe bands just stopped making quality singles because they knew fans would just download the stuff for free since it's only like 1 or 2 new songs?"
G4SRS9W,male,27,"Dave, how many times do we need to send out addresses?  Let me guess, you lost them in the move.  Well, because we love you so much we'll go ahead and send them to you AGAIN....but dont go losing them this time.  Since Esther is joining the team officially(right?), we'll need to get all the needed info and decide where she'll be placed in line.  Does she just fall in at the end of the line?  Or, does she go right away, like after Dave?  What do you all think?"
G4SRS9W,male,27,"I can't figure it out. Everything around me is telling me to like the Rapture - that they're just, like, wicked awesome and can make you get up and shake yer arse around once or twice. And I do dig their music. It totally makes you wanna do that. Except I can't get past Luke Jenner's vocals, so I don't think I'll ever like them that much. Maybe I just have to keep listening and get used to it so it doesn't bother me. Does anybody else think his vocals are just, like, way way obnoxious? It's just caterwauling, in my opinion. If I could just get past it, then I might like the Rapture a lot. But for the time being, it just ain't happenin' for me. Sorry. And #1 on  urlLink Pitchfork's Best Albums of 2003 ??? I don't know about that one...     But I do know about Out Hud. Now that's music that will make you get out yo seat and shake it. And someone in the band thought it best to not ruin the songs by injecting wretched howling at the moon. Seriously, everybody needs Out Hud's ""S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D."""

3NHAQAD,female,23,"i think i am still drunk from last night and being here at work is far worse than sleeping in my bed.    charise is down the street buying me a bagel since that is the best thing ever right now.    i can't even think and i am so not drinking anything until the 9th.  Maybe not even then.  Ow.    No one is in the store, the one guy who came in i think was scared and left since i was explaining to charise why i suck as a person.  Yay charise is here, time to eat and suck less as a person."
3NHAQAD,female,23,"Wow, almost a month.  I suck.  Chris is across the street getting me a raspberry iced tea.  He doesn't suck  Alright, highlights of my last few weeks.  I just feel very fortunate in the position that I am in right now.  The last few weeks have been a whirlwird of fun and excitement and I can't even begin to conceptulaize how amazing this next month is going to be.  By reading, you will find a common theme....  So Marissa, Amanda, and I head down to Dewey the last weekend in September for a music conference.  Each conference gets crazier and crazier, so needless to say, I was really excited.  We make it down to the beach around 4 and check into the Marina Suites.  Oh yeah, the difference between a motel and a hotel.  We established the difference last Dewey Beach Conference, where we discovered that we actually had soap and shampoo and a working clock, and the GTT boys did not.  We got ready for dinner, unpacked some stuff, made some phone calls, and headed out to the Rudder.  Marissa had brought some film equipment for Center Stage and had 6 bands lined up to be interviewed and we were also going to film their performance.  Hence the reason for being there....of course not partying and meeting awesome people.....its all about the business ;-) So we ate dinner at the Rudder and met up with Paul Lewis at the coffeeshop.  En route I literally ran into Jamie from Omnisoul.  They rock and it was cool running into them.  Listened to their new stuff and it is tizzight.  :-)  Check them out at www.omnisoul.com .  So lets seeeeeeeeeeee......  Starting talking to the James Harvey guys before we even knew they were James Harvey guys.  Really nice and their music is really good.  James Harvey is classically trained and his voice is simply amazing.  Also met up with Fools and Horses, Capitol Air, and Stargazer Lily to film and interview them.  Marissa and Amanda were filming and doing the interviews while I braved the crowds and filmed the shows.  The girls stayed at the Rudder since they were already in and I headed to the Cork to see Ken and Steve (GTT) since the girls couldn't get in there.  The Cork was pretty filled up and I found Gilligan, so all was good.  The guys started off with Better (my used to be favorite GTT song) and played some old and new stuff.  My new favorite GTT song is Dear Urgency.  You will like it too.  FIlmed about 15 minutes worth of the show then put the camera down so I could watch from not behind the lens.  Steve and Kenny were pulling the White Stripes thing.  Dave and Chris couldn't make it, but still a great performance.  They ended with Woman Like a Man by Damien Rice.  Incredible. So they ended and I heard from Marissa and Amanda and she were ESCORTED out of the Rudder by a BIG HUGE bouncer.  He took them pass the whole conference while he carried the cameras.  Oh my.   So they were waiting for me at the hotel....then the afterparty....  SO I meet up with the girls and we head to Grottos.  Grottos is a necessity any time we're at the beach.  Like the motto, it's tradition.  As we're walking there, Marissa is tlaking to the Fools and Horses guys (from now on will be referred to as FAH) and we randomly meet them in the parking lot before Grottos.  So we all (me, Marissa, Amanda, Bill, Tim, Matt, and Kent) eat and hit the liquor store then back to 216.  Somewhere between before and then I called up Steve to tell him and the posse the game plan.  Geez, where to now.  So we are all in 216 playing drinking games with terrorist cards.  ASS!  We had to say ""ass"" at the end of every sentence, per Amanda's rules, so that was entertaining.  The fridge was full of ""Sir Coors Orginal"" (that's a FAH saying ;-) ), wine coolers, twisted tea, and various sorts of liquor and sodas.  Sweet.  James Harvey Band and the GTT guys came around shortly after.  As did the cop.  Instead of trying to write in any sense of order, I will just point out the highlights.... -Grammy nominee David Ivory coming into our party looking for Rotoglow -The butt munchie rent a cop -Steve showing me card tricks :-) -consuming lots of premium malt beverages -missing a horse...and a girl... -Kent running around mostly naked screaming ""sexy nipples!"" -The whole room getting silent while Damien Rice was performing, then again for the School of Rock -Tasting the Rainbow and not throwing it -The whole GTT interview, which I was gladly a part of haha -Steve: is she going to air this Me: Shhh....no Steve: Marissa, are you going to air this Marissa: Yes, of course Steve: I hate you. Me: You love me Marissa: Yeah, I'll edit this Steve: YOU CAN'T EDIT THIS!!!!!  Just great times with old and new friends :-) Went to bed at 5 am and woke up at 8 am to drive 87 miles back to Newark so I could open and close the record store....and though i was begged, I didn't think I was going to go back that night...  Caffeine got me through the morning, where as a phone call got me through the evening.  Marissa calls me up and tells me that they are staying and just figuring out what to do later.  So we decide that hanging out in Dewey for another night was crucial.  I get out of work a little early, hit up the gas station, and head back down to the beach.  Insane.  :-)  So I give Marissa a call when I get down there and meet the girls and the FAH guys ... somewhere, no idea where.  We end up at their room at some hotel.  Again, I can't remember.  I call Steve and let him know what we're up to, then its card game time.  We watched the suckiest SNL ever and played games.  Good times.  Then it was time to brave the rain and head over to the Sea Esta where the James Harvey Band and Green To Think rooms were. Odd ly enough, both bands were neighbors and conveniently met in our room the night before.  One of the greatest things about Dewey is that you walk outside and the music from the clubs infilterates the streets.  At the GTT room we drink and take scandelous pictures and stay there since the police are right outside the door.  Why why why do they like to follow us?!?!?!?  We left around 4ish or so to go back to the FAH room to get our stuff, we had no idea where we were going to stay, but we knew they had to get up early, so we wanted to get our things out of there.   Tim was already up, talking to the guard, and let us in the room where we meetup with the other three horses who INSISTED on leaving for Baltimore early and having us stay in their rooms.  We couldn't let them do that, but they made us.  We couldn't beleive that they checked out of their room early just so we had a place to stay.  They wouldn't even let us carry their equipment down.   So again, went to bed at 5 am, wke up at 9, worked the record store from 11-6.   But it was all so very very worth it :-)"
3NHAQAD,female,23,"Ok, that shouldn't be true, but it really does.  I was talking about it with Aurora and Charise, and honestly, alcohol in my life makes my outlook better.  Nothing better than not feeling or having control.  Well, there are some things better, but this is the most accessible.  Charise said it best when she said that its pretty sad that she is excited when she can get off of work to drink.  Oh my.  Drink up, drink up while we are still young. So Saturday.  Oh how I needed Saturday.  I warned Rainbow Chris that since I don't have anything to do on Sunday, Saturday better watch out because I was going to hit it hard... Charise, Max, and I headed out to Raf's party.  He was having a gathering and playing some tunes with his band.  Charise and I discovered some wine and it was pretty much done for as soon as we found it.  After that ran out, the keg was hit as Nate and I hooted and hollered at Raf as he played guitar to the coffee table.  So we decided to leave and go to Deer Park.  Nate wouldn't let me carry my beer in his car so he took it from me and hid it.  I realized I didn't have my bag, so I went inside to get it, where I discovered my beer in the snow.  I attempted to make a beer slushie, while slipping and sliding down the driveway.  I should not do two things when I drink...use my cell phone, and use my computer.... At work earlier, Tanya brought me brownies and we were talking about that night's festivities, so it was decided that Saturday night would find us at the DP.  So I call her to make sure she is there, then dial some more numbers.  I had gotten many a drunken phone calls the night before - cough cough from ohio at 3 am cough cough - so I call Phil back and have no idea what kind of message I left.  Sorry.  Then I call Aurora.  Yeah. At the Deer Park, met up with everyone who I didn't expect to be there, but Tanya brought the whole posse - Chris, Dan, Elise, Oliver, McDerm, Lex, Evan, etc etc.  Stumbled around the DP and realized how cool it is that everyone from all walks convene at the old watering hole.  Ran into some Sallies kids, WVUD people, and riding team people.  Very cool.  Left there and off to Olivers.... Don't know how I ended up in Oliver's car.  I think Chris wanted me to drive his beamer.  Um, that pretty much wasn't the safest option.  So Lex drove and the entire way I chattered and blabbered and pretty much told the two of them stuff I wouldn't say if I wasn't inebriated.  I think they may think I am crazy.  Ah, whatever, I made them laugh.  I think I am placed here on this earth for one reason and one reason only - my life is amusing and allows others to laugh at my follies at my expense.   We get to Oliver's and hang out and be merry.  Snow is good to fall in because it cushions.  Aurora had called and I passed the phone around and I think Dan told her to come, so she did.  And more merryment was had.  Oliver, McDerm, and I tried to play airplane.  Operative word is try.  And yes, where they lie on their backs and I try to fly.   Around 4:30 Aurora and I left for home and we had a sleep over.  We watched TV and talked to Phil and he hung up on us and we went to bed only to awake to freaking cars honking all morning.  Oh wait, it was afternoon.  We woke up around 3 I think.  Oh my. But I needed to have one day of fun where I had nothing responsible to do the next day."
3NHAQAD,female,23,"So I have this hot beverage travel mug.  It's green and I like it a lot.  But it has been causing me problems.    Now, if you are to have a green hot beverage travel mug, one would think that that green hot beverage travel mug would be microwavable.  Especially in this day in age where we all try to attain things as quickly as possible.  Why does a green hot beverage travel mug exist in a non microwavable form? Why Why Why?  This causes me wasted time in the morning by heating my tea in a  microwavable  container, then transferring it into my green hot beverage travel mug.   Sigh."
3NHAQAD,female,23,"Whenever I go away, I have a tendency to make sure my living space is clean, so when I come back all tired and wanting familiarity, I will have it all nice and organized.  So since these next three days will more than likely not be spent much here, I cleaned up today.  And I forgot to do my laundry until 1am.    When you do your laundry at 1 am make sure you don't wash your favorite burgandy sweater with everything else, because you will find burgandy sweater balls on your socks, underwear, and favorite pants that are pink.   Not on all of your favorite pants, just the pink ones.  And usually I will wash all of those things seperately so that they don't fight in the washer, but I only had a few things that needed to be clean."

3NHAQAD,female,23,"Aurora and I hung out on Saturday night contemplating and scheming.  Spring Break 2004 needs a name.  Last year was good because SB '03 rhymed.  I am thinking of something that contains the word ""tour"" with ""four"".  March is already going to be an incredible month, but the end will be explosive.  I can't even imagine what's going to happen.  Here's how it looks, and if you want to join in on any of the festivities, please do.  Friday March 19 - WVUD show, then Wawa for the usual and heading up to NYC to meet up with Mark and perhaps see Megg if the timing is right.  Maybe sleep in the area, maybe head to Maine, you know how we do.  Saturday March 20 - University of Maine to hang out with Meg, then to Portland to see Ryan Montbleau play at the Ale House.  Sunday March 21 - Down to Boston, with a stop in New Hampshire, to see the cities and pick up Lloyd Dobler Effect.  Monday March 22 - Off to the Wobbly Barn for some snow fun and LDE show resort style in Killington, VT.  Tuesday March 23 - Same as above.  Wednesday March 24 - Back to Boston.  Thursday March 25 - Boston.  Friday March 26 - Lloyd Dobler Effect & Carbondale at Northeastern University, Boston  Saturday March 27 - Lloyd Dobler Effect shows Ivy League how to rock.  Princeton, NJ.  Weren't we here last Spring break?  Or Ryan Montbleau in Allston, MA.  Uh oh - scheduling conflict!!  Sunday March 28 - Newark, DE.   All in all, just from city to city, will be 1230 miles.  GAME ON."
3NHAQAD,female,23,"Argh.  Jamie and I rule at life.  So awesome at it.  First off, the last hour of being open was craziness from odd phone calls and strange visitors.  Then whatever could go wrong with our computers did go wrong and they were all fritzed out and some creepy guy was at the window and it was scary and everything blew up on us.    Right now I feel frustrated so I will type this: nfdwiejcfefjewjropermdjdoew"
3NHAQAD,female,23,"Work all day on MOnday, followed by Quizzo.  Chris and Dan were wandering around Newark promoting the Ground Floor show and stopped in Rainbow to ease our insanity.    We lost at Quizzo though we rocked most of the questions.  Unfortunately we were banished to the bottom floor instead of joining the excitement of the 2nd floor, but that's what happens when we're late. :-(     As Dan and I were walking back to my place, I saw a car swerve out from a side street and collide into a telephone pole.  Dan called 911 and we walked over there.  The girl wasn't trapped or bleeding, which was fortunate, just disillusioned.  I had my windows open in my apartment and shortly after I got in I could hear the scraping of metal from the pole.  It was gross."
3NHAQAD,female,23,"Well, I don't even know where to begin. Last night was a great night.   I can't even begin to write right now on how much PMB has been a part of my life the past few years.  If you know me, then you would know, but if you don't then you will read about that all later.  But yes, PMB played an outside show in Newark last night.  Lauren and her boyfriend came down for the show and Karen, Melissa, and I ran into everyone there.  It was just a good time.  It was also like an STN reunion which was freaky haha. I like how Public Safety was there to ensure there was no alcohol and nearly everyone there had sports bottles (see previous blog) or juice bottles in hand.  It was just great to be there with my closest freinds singing away to PMB at an outdoor night show.  It sounded great and the atmosphere was wonderful.  I don't know if my friends enjoyed me serenading them though.  ;-) Having PMB play in Newark in one of my last weekends here was a good sendoff.   Off to Logan House!  Karen, Melissa, Aurora and I trke up 95 to LH to see LDE play next.  In the 15 minute carride we decorates Karen's car with pornographic images and Aurora and I had a conversation with each other while both on Phil's voicemail.  We go in and and a good time was had by all :-)  They played a good set of mostly all originals so yay.  Michelle and Jason and Tim made it down so it was great hanging out with them as well.  And LDE Jenn was there so we made her dance with us :-)  But all in all a great night at the LH once again.  And damn those boys.  I swear every time I see them I end up not feeling so well............. I love LH's backstage, its more like the balcony.  At least no one fell down the stairs this time.  I met Phil's family and think I confused them all.  Stole Phil's visor and someones sunglasses.  Ended up with black stuff all over me.  Gave Phil back his hat, but came home with another hat somehow.  A huge conversation was had about the 9:30 club.....see now there is a debate on who didn't talk to who at the 9:30 club gig they did a ways back.  Dammit for being 5 against 2.    Damn time for work, I will finish this blog when I get back FROM PETE YORN TONIGHT!!"
GG1RLP3,male,34,"I spilled coffee (not, by any means, a new phenomenon) on my t-shirt this morning, while I was writing.  Today it’s a public television shirt with big bold yellow and red logos, meant to evoke a thrift-store-esque devotion to someone else’s donation / passion / life, recycled and reused in my incarnation.   So coffee, I suppose, only enhances the illusion, right?  It’s like a value-added mark of authenticity.   Last night we were noticing that the purple berries we call mulberries which drop off of the spindly tree next to the driveway and stain the soles of your shoes with their juice in the next two weeks as they ripen – had just started to fall.  Lynn reminded Jaelyn that native peoples use exactly this juice to dye their garments.  “They stain their clothes with these berries like we dyed our shirts yellow.”  It was a few moments later, partway into our nightly walk around our circle when Jaelyn inquired: Mommy, do the native Americans have to wash the stains off of their clothes?   Lynn explained that these colors were intentional like the bright trendy turquoise of jaelyn’s pedal pushers, but Jaelyn was fixated on the stain.  How do they get those stains off?  And suddenly, I’m thinking – why are we always trying to pretend that we don’t have stains….why not treat them with a bit more honor?  After all, its not like clean shirts = no eating.  Not like we’re embarrassed that we eat the food that makes the stains, or drink the coffee that dripped on our shirts.  The food and the drink are not secrets that we’re trying to hide as if we were, say, engaging in liposuction or bulemic purging…  And I’ve always said that I liked scars because they’re like bookmarks or hyperlinks on our bodies that assure us that our past genuinely happened to us – was not actually a dream – and that we are in a really concrete way connected to our otherwise unbelievable pasts.    And if you think about it – scars are just a more naturally occurring case of the same thing that tattoos accomplish.    Someone decides to get a tattoo in order to translate NOW into ALWAYS.  They’re kind of like an F-U to mortality. Right? Because they’re only a good financial risk if they’re going to stay around for a long time.  And they’re bound to stay around for a long time if you stay around. And they assert that whatever it is you’re feeling or being or loving NOW is something you’re going to feel or love or be THEN.  No matter what THEN brings (eg. “I love Billy Bob” turns out to be a bad gamble more often than not).  Which is admirable in a world of avatars and fleeting chimeras – someone who actually IS something so completely that they can afford to translate there is-ness to their skin so that people can actually read how is they actually are.    And lets face it – tattoos are pervasive enough now, that we all know that they are SO over.   And scars do seem like a very hip, edgy alternative, but intentional scarring seems a bit – well – inconvenient -- to me right now.  So it seems like stains are the PERFECT way to go.  All the permanence and expressive value of a tattoo, sans risk and commitment.    That’s why I’m leaving my coffee stain on my shirt this morning…"
GG1RLP3,male,34,"............ express ............  i'm blogging from the express terminal at the library.   one would think that such restrictions might help such an over-expressor be a bit more succinct.  but maybe not, since i'm just in it for the experience.   what is it like to live in fast fifteen minute increments?   we sit in lines at fast-food to-go windows, we order out or order for delivery.    at school we learn the great classics in fifty minute time slots.   i just read about a playwriting contest that is for ONE PAGE plays.  music videos collapse the filmic tradition, popular music and marketing blitzes into a six minute visual poem that should express the breadth and depth of meaning and feeling in a song (and/or available on that artists album)  one minute dating allows people to have one minute conversations with a number of available and interested partners in a noisy restaurant room.   hot or not condenses the experience to an even quicker click of the mouse.   outside the window suvs and trucks and minivans zip by into the next fifteen minute increment of their worlds.   but the sunshine and the cedar trees and the unevenly faded red bricks of the Hoover Plant feel much less ephemeral.  They seem to be unphased by all the zipping and zapping.   Christian once commented on a blog that one of the best reasons to affiliate and jump into an institution's life -- and out of the chaos of liminality is because insittutions slow down the experience of time.   I'm intrigued.  Because the pop window that just warned me to save and exit (i have four minutes remaining) tick, tick, tick, is making me almost as nervous as the boundless energy of the two three year olds dancing around their mother next to me -- as she tries to move away from their insistence into a focused zone of choosing a book on kitchen rennovations.  tick, tick, tick."

GG1RLP3,male,34,"- what happened yesterday -    So much happened yesterday.  If I wax essayistic about each *thing*, I could write an alternate universe.    So I'll try adapting the idiom of the internet -- brevity.  Ang & Ryan moved.  (after a long battle with U-Haul clerks who were annoyingly friendly)  Mark & Toby successfully installed the upstairs toilet! (no more midnight treks down two flights of stairs!)  Jeff, with my cowardly help, transported a SKUNK in our mini van from Marcia's back yard (it had lived under her house) to the local park / frisbee golf course. (Wives & Kids cheered as ""Sonja"" ambled through the grass to her new life.)  A woman in A & R's church told them, just before they went to sleep Saturday Night that a woman SHOT herself in their bedroom.  Where they have lived for the last year.    And though Ang didn't say this -- I'm pretty sure that this is a secret that their whole church has been keeping from them.  (The house they lived in is the ""youth pastor house"" for a string of youth pastors.)  Of course my interest in the story is primarily Proprietary --   PITCH: young couple moves from house where ghost has lived unbeknownst to them.  Ghost liked their life so much that she moved WITH them -- but started to act up once she was in a new * place *.      TOBY's ICING on the PITCH: The couple's spending all this effort trying to figure out how this ghost came to be in their new (older) home -- combing through history, etc... but they'll never find a record there, will they?  Because THEY BROUGHT the ghost from their home.   Dunh, dunh, dunh.  Addison slept in his NEW BIG BOY bed for the first two times yesterday and last night.  No problems.  He loves it!

GG1RLP3,male,34,"blog genres   i've been teaching a lot about genre this year -- my unit on genre in Persuasion has coincided or at least overlapped iwth my unit on genre in MASS MEDIA AND SOCIETY --   (hey!, my loyal readership insists, this is the *BACK* burner.  you can't talk about the content of your classes on here...yeah, yeah, i know, but...  i've been more and more interested in the diversity of emerging genres in the blogging universe.   Kelly blogs about  urlLink the RANT  not as a genre of blog discourse -- but of everyday discourse -- but i do think that ranting is a pretty normative genre in this medium.   the other genre i've been keenly interested in recently is the hello? genre.

That sounds like a great way to avoid this depressingly (s)tall(ed) stack of grading...  ***********************************************************************  well.  that's it.  its done.   urlLink Hello?    if you want to join the team of this blog -- (because you have so much spare time) -- let me know and I'll make you a team member.  Minimum membership fees?  find one instance of hello? blogging per month.  if you lag behind in your fees -- you'll be on probation for a minimum of six months.  then we'll have to see about what to do with you...  peace~"

GG1RLP3,male,34,". a perfect moment .  the banks of the creek behind the cemetery which borders the back of our circle overflowed by fifty and a hundred feet today.  Lynn saw it on her run, and we all went down to see.    inevitably we started to wade, and as the children recognized how transgressive the moment was -- we started to frolic.   I'm always reminded that I'm in a perfect moment when I see Jaelyn Running.   She has a funny and completely authentic gesture of whirling one arm -- at full length when she's running in complete abandon.  She doesn't even recognize it when she's doing it -- and can't really make it ""pretend"" to happen.    So today as she ran through the Knee Deep water -- splashing everywhere -- Lynn running and yelling too, Woo Hoo -- and the arm started going --   I had a flash of recognition that we had found one of THOSE moments.  A moment where all the rules go hazy and all the background floats away -- where you are completely and utterly HERE -- RIGHT NOW -- with EACH OTHER.  I flopped under the water myself (brrr!) and then attempted to cross the creek.  The raging creek was at my armpits and despite all my (substantial) girth fighting against the creek --> I got SWEPT AWAY.   I grapped tufts of grass and pulled myself to the submerged shore.    Addison and Jaelyn ran freely and wildly.  Splashing purposely to sit down up to their necks, climbing atop an island tree or water main cap.  We waved to the maintenance workers who smiled at us from their mowers and bulldozers.  We tried to be subdued when mourners drove by, but it was hard.    The world was overflowing and we happened to be right in the flow of it."
GG1RLP3,male,34,"............ quilts ............  am just trying to get prepped for the semester -- the front burner flame is on high -- but I'm excited about the flames (a switch from last semester).  Have been really enjoying hearing from old friends.  Marcaus' voice returned to his blog, and I happened to stumble across a number of old pictures and emails when i cleaned my old computer up -- its good to have old friends who remain true and connected.  I have a deep sense of that.   My mentor from my MA at Andrews, Bev, sent me a handwritten letter. She often does.  It's SO good to get a real live LETTER.  And so good to feel that someone from the past who invested in you still cares.  She'd never know how deeply appreciative I continue to be of her voice in my life from the lack of my correspondence, but I am (deeply appreciative).   We spent new years eve with Greg, Andrea & tribe.  It was warm, honest, caring, delicious, rich, heady time.  Its amazing when you are friends with people from a long time and you start to recognize how much you've changed individually, but how the arcs and rhythms and patterns of your lives continue to be so intersected...  Have I mentioned that I'm obsessed by quilts these days.  Not making them or even looking at them, just wrapping them around me and doing whatever -- reading, movies, writing, talking....  My wife's family has made billions of amazing quilts and they're draped all over this house, but they seem to me to be the perfect object -- an INCARNATION of all that I'm feeling about me and the world right now.    I'm feeling bolstered, secured, warmed, kept and loved by these meaningful connections with people who have loved me for a long time and in really unique ways...The patterns that are emerging in these long-time friendships are unexpected -- they stitch together different parts to the fabric of my life that I couldn't have expected to work together in the ways that they do...  But I feel warmed, filled, re-membered.  peace~."
GG1RLP3,male,34,"- ouch - good trip - the plan -    I'm feeling the  squeeze  of the schoolyear keenly.  Even though we're still a week out from start date.  I feel like we're at week seven (which is perhaps the worst for me -- in a fifteen work semester -- by week eight, i just surrender to the tide).  I'm keenly aware that my backburner space looms large, luminous and luscious in the summer. (little cross - reference to my baptist-exegetical-preaching-featuring-the-age-old-memory-device-of-alliteration-which-can-handily-parse-almost-any-scriptural-passage-upbringing)  And I'm feeling it shrink to a half-operational bunsen burner already.  what will it be like at literal week seven?    Good Trip  (above) refers to Myrtle Beach.  Living with my in-laws in a vacation house on a beach is always an adventure.  It's just funny to me to be in the fusion of Beach Culture (as I've experienced it) and Farm Culture.  Lynn's Dad and Brother have an internal alarm clock which is a feature of their years / life as hog farmers that goes -ding- somewhere between 4:30 a.m. and 5 a.m..  I try to make my way to the public space to write by 5 - 5:30 everymorning, but I was continuously shocked to find OTHER PEOPLE awake!   And then Keith was up by 6:30 -- ultimately there was only one day where anyone slept past 7:30.    The upside?  Lynn and I were looking at each other on the couch by nine each night with the eerie silence of post-apocalyptic desertion.  Everybody was in bed.   Big full moons over the ocean every night.  Wide beautiful swaths of (relatively) un-touristed beach.  Hilarious ongoing laughter of Jaelyn and Keith romping wildly  in the shallow surf.  Waveboarding huge 15 foot waves.  Oh -- and the other feature of Farm Life.  COOKING. Hardcore Cooking at EVERY meal.  ALWAYS sausage or bacon in the morning WITH eggs, pancakes, etc...ALWAYS a HOT lunch (they call it Dinner).  And big, endless dinners.  The whole getting-naked-on-the-beach-thing was an odd yang to the yin of dinner.  So here's  the  blog  plan  for the semester.  I'm gonna *try* to put some words up here every other day minimally -- but I do want to stay committed to the front burners and fronter-back-burners that I should be.  Be assured, though, dear reader, if you're blogging and I have your address, I'm reading you a lot more than I'm writing! I love the ability to be *with* my friends even while so far away.    If you are one of the loyal (two? three?) readers who reads every day -- then you'll recognize that I've broken one of the rules of the non-cyber-universe.  I've gone back in time and revised my plan as it was first published.  With no indication of what it used to say!  Who knows what will happen to Marty McFly now?  will he disappear from the photo first?  or will the Libyan Terrorists in the minivan kill the professor?  Peace~"

8ASNS6M,female,23,"Well...I can't seem to remember what I did this weekend...I cleaned up my new place - pics coming soon...I studied a lot for Anatomy and Physiology (final this Wednesay)...and I studied for Oriental Medicine (thanks to the bf for being my case study for my final project)...I worked on Saturday from 8am - 4pm...went to Chicago Kollaboration (pics to come soon) to see my twin and the other hot NU Lambda (Zeta class) dance...got to chill with two of my nephews (Roland and Brian) and see two of my niceces.  I guess - good things come in pairs.  ;-)  And I got two wonderful personal letters this weekend, too!  Speaking of two - welcome and congrats to the newest KDPhis - Michigan State University's Zeta Class: Roshni Patel and Lily Yang.  And a huge congrats to their Momma Jenny Yang.  I'll have pictures up, as well - we're looking for new tenants for our old location.  And please, no one mention the NCAA Tournament....I can't believe that GA Tech won...and I can't believe how close the games were...so...I guess I""m rooting for UConn.  Yesterday - I got to hang out with my Auntie Bindu and we did a bomb-diggity job cleaning up our old place...man, I'm going to miss our little 1655 N.Paulina house.  :-P  At Kollaboration, it made me think how the Asian American awareness scene in Chicago just isn't what it is in California.  I complained about Santa Barbara and how frustrating it was to get awareness and unity going.  I didn't realize that Chicago would be even harder.  I was blessed getting a chance to take TWO classes with the famous K.W. Lee and get my minor in Asian American Studies.  It made me think of how when Kuan and I went to the premier of Robot Stories here in Chicago - the theatre was so empty and maybe a handful of people were there to meet Karin and see the film.....just thoughts.  :-P  Living alone makes me think a lot.  Don't know if that's a good thing or not.  So, goodbye for now - you'll see me again on Wednesday, after my two finals (but I still have a final project that isn't due until next Tuesday) and hopefully the darn RCN guy will fix my internet so I can be up and running and actually do some real Internet stuff!!!  :-P  PS: Annie and Jin come on Thursday morning!!  WOOHOO - if you're not doing anything that night, come out to Gamekeepers at 6:30pm for some ten cent wings and some fun!!  ;-)  We'll probably be there for 2-3 hours cuz KDPhis can eat!!"

8ASNS6M,female,23,"So today was an interesting day...I woke up to my boyfriend planting huge kisses all over my face and then, seeing him leave.  I dragged my poor body up and forced it to go running - MUST tone my body...and then, from 8:45 - 12:30 I had my Tai Ji Chuan class...and man, after that - my knees were achey.  I headed to the gym and had a pilates class....and then, i came home to realize that my darn laundry room doesn't have a coin machine so I needed to go get money.  I decide to return my videos back to Blockbuster and hit up the Jewel nearby to grab some money...  And then, as soon as I get home - Srey comes over...we end up chatting as girls do and then, Leng calls - we go eat dinner at Joy Yees and the boyfriend joins us...  Anyway - now to the real point of this blog.  Cherry Red - that's the club that we went to tonight.  I went because I haven't been out with the girls in sooo long and Srey was in town from Philly so I headed out - butt tired and exhausted.  But I had soo much fun.  I enjoyed dancing with the girls - catching up with different girls...there were soo many alum there...from UIUC Duyen, Jenny, and Amy to UIC Joy, Bea, Elaine, Char, Stephanie, Ats, Mina, Hana, Linda (beta class), Christina (gamma class), Leng, Aileen, Carmen, Srey, Samera, Linda (eta class) - it was definately nice to feel comfortable.  Not feeling old or having to babysit.  I felt somewhat at place.  The only thing that kept on happening throughout the night.. WHERE IS KUAN? ARE YOU OKAY?  DID YOU AND KUAN BREAK UP?  IS THAT WHY HE ISN'T HERE? OH, HEY - IS KUAN HERE? and *sigh*  I know that the two of us have dating for a while but it kinda sucks that the first thing that you're going to say to me is about him.

O9S57ZN,male,24,"I'm just going through the Feminine Face of God book and it's making me think in some parts. I don't know how much I like this book, but I'm reading it anyhow. It may even touch on a few things that I'm experiencing right now.   I feel a little stuck, a little limited, maybe somewhat like I need a fresh new lemon-lit brush of hope in my near future. Perhaps I just need to trust myself more.   I look every which way, I don't know exactly which direction I want to go, but the transition period is like the birthing process. Yet isn't everything? I've stayed in the womb for so long, maybe 10 or 11 months, and the mother is past restlessness. I'm getting too big. I feel too big. I don't know what the next step will be.   Or I'm on the edge of a cliff. I just want to be pushed off the cliff and into another space so I can ""back up"" and continue searching. Or I could jump.   I don't want to feel worthless or useless or unmagnificent, but I do sometimes. Can't I enjoy a little period of free nothing? And in a way, I am, but I'm worried I'm not using my time wisely. I need to go someplace that I'm needed and I have a responsibility to go there.  Yet I need to be more discontent, because I am not enough.  All my life, well, for much of the recent past, I've dedicated myself to live an authentic life in search of an authentic self and I wonder how to exist anymore in certain situations. Perhaps my goal is to learn that there are elements of authenticity in everything. But I've only focused on myself and on religion for my whole life. Sometimes I think I honestly might be well suited for some pastoral convent. But that would almost be too easy for me.  The thing is, it's not a wanting or a lack of wanting that characterizes my life in the crossroads of being in my (almost) mid-20s and finished with college (so far). It's more of a watching and waiting to make some kind of decision, to fall recklessly into the storm-ridden sky plugged with frizzles of purple and gold into other seasons, the cool inside of an expansive but not eternal lava lamp (kudos to Josh for that one), feeling my bare feet hitting the clouds that are strange compositions of not the usual cotton, but deep oceans and gel clumps and just-before-the-rain kind of air.  I'm glad this blog is called ""rambings from the well."" I seem to take the term literally. Back to the book. Or I will call Jaci.  Jaci, where are you? It's time to watch the Dawson's Creek dvd (wink)."
O9S57ZN,male,24,"i'm sitting here thinking about our blog, and it's pretty sweet action.  all that i read is very thoughtful, pretty serious stuff.  oh yeah, it's all been j.  well, it's all about to stumble downhill like the box car race commercial for the H2.  welcome, thephoeniX.  i would've loved to use that as an id (not freudian), but it was taken.   i understand why everyone's thoughts went awry, perhaps, sunday night - as did mine.  however, i was getting very into the pre-god is speaking to us OUCH moment, which was on reconciliation as part of god's grand narrative.  if j doesn't put a summary or notes from that conversation up, then i'll give the notes i have.    anyway, with that in mind, what about this art exhibition (coming to a well near you - this friday and saturday (see below post)) thing we've got goin' on?  think about art and god's place in it.  i'm not thinking about art being reconciled back to him, really. instead, what will art look like/ concern/ say to us/ be when we are reconciled back to him - or just while we get closer to him during the process of this reconciliation?  can beauty become more beautiful/ pure/ different as god's narrative progresses?  think about it, later, or now"

O9S57ZN,male,24,"Stacey, Quentin, Josh, Justin, Jaci, and I went to see The Passion tonight and it was pretty amazing. Every shot simulated a photograph and the language was beautiful. Although I felt incredibly horrified and saddened that a human being, no less God, was subjected to such cruelty, (so much was just literally difficult to watch), I felt other things too.   I kept thinking how that was God there and how no one could really kill him. They were doing those things to him, but I don't think of him as a  victim. Even in his weakened, blood drenched states, I kept thinking that no one could kill him.    And it made me think how I really don't understand it all as much as I had thought. It's not discouraging. In fact, it's wonderful. There's a lot more to it that I just haven't figured out. I mean, why all that pain and the short life? Why come to earth as a human at all? Why did God decide to do it that way. It's this whole system that's unfolding and that I don't understand. I don't really plan to understand it this week or next year. But maybe someday I will have a better glimpse.    Well, I have to remind myself that this movie isn't the Bible, but it does give me some things to think about. But now I'm very very sleepy, so I will take out my contacts and get to bed. Enough posting for one day. =)  Thank you for making dinner tonight, Stacey!"
MPI1N4T,male,15,"THE LOTTERY BY SHIRLEY JACKSON The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 2th. but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.   The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name ""Dellacroy""--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.   Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.   The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him. because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called. ""Little late today, folks."" The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, ""Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?"" there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.   The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's being done. The black box grew shabbier each year: by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.   Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued. had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into he black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them in the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers' coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put way, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves's barn and another year underfoot in the post office. and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.   There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up--of heads of families. heads of households in each family. members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory. tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this p3rt of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans. with one hand resting carelessly on the black box. he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.   Just as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. ""Clean forgot what day it was,"" she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. ""Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,"" Mrs. Hutchinson went on. ""and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running."" She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, ""You're in time, though. They're still talking away up there.""   Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through: two or three people said. in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, ""Here comes your, Missus, Hutchinson,"" and ""Bill, she made it after all."" Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully. ""Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie."" Mrs. Hutchinson said. grinning, ""Wouldn't have me leave m'dishes in the sink, now, would you. Joe?,"" and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson's arrival.   ""Well, now."" Mr. Summers said soberly, ""guess we better get started, get this over with, so's we can go back to work. Anybody ain't here?""   ""Dunbar."" several people said. ""Dunbar. Dunbar.""   Mr. Summers consulted his list. ""Clyde Dunbar."" he said. ""That's right. He's broke his leg, hasn't he? Who's drawing for him?""   ""Me. I guess,"" a woman said. and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. ""Wife draws for her husband."" Mr. Summers said. ""Don't you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?"" Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.   ""Horace's not but sixteen vet."" Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. ""Guess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.""   ""Right."" Sr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, ""Watson boy drawing this year?""   A tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. ""Here,"" he said. ""I m drawing for my mother and me."" He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said thin#s like ""Good fellow, lack."" and ""Glad to see your mother's got a man to do it.""   ""Well,"" Mr. Summers said, ""guess that's everyone. Old Man Warner make it?""   ""Here,"" a voice said. and Mr. Summers nodded.   A sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. ""All ready?"" he called. ""Now, I'll read the names--heads of families first--and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?""   The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions: most of them were quiet. wetting their lips. not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, ""Adams."" A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. ""Hi. Steve."" Mr. Summers said. and Mr. Adams said. ""Hi. Joe."" They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd. where he stood a little apart from his family. not looking down at his hand.   ""Allen."" Mr. Summers said. ""Anderson.... Bentham.""   ""Seems like there's no time at all between lotteries any more."" Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the back row.   ""Seems like we got through with the last one only last week.""   ""Time sure goes fast.-- Mrs. Graves said.   ""Clark.... Delacroix""   ""There goes my old man."" Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.   ""Dunbar,"" Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said. ""Go on. Janey,"" and another said, ""There she goes.""   ""We're next."" Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hand. turning them over and over nervously Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.   ""Harburt.... Hutchinson.""   ""Get up there, Bill,"" Mrs. Hutchinson said. and the people near her laughed.   ""Jones.""   ""They do say,"" Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, ""that over in the north village they're talking of giving up the lottery.""   Old Man Warner snorted. ""Pack of crazy fools,"" he said. ""Listening to the young folks, nothing's good enough for them. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live hat way for a while. Used to be a saying about 'Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.' First thing you know, we'd all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There's always been a lottery,"" he added petulantly. ""Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.""   ""Some places have already quit lotteries."" Mrs. Adams said.   ""Nothing but trouble in that,"" Old Man Warner said stoutly. ""Pack of young fools.""   ""Martin."" And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. ""Overdyke.... Percy.""   ""I wish they'd hurry,"" Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. ""I wish they'd hurry.""   ""They're almost through,"" her son said.   ""You get ready to run tell Dad,"" Mrs. Dunbar said.   Mr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box. Then he called, ""Warner.""   ""Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,"" Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. ""Seventy-seventh time.""   ""Watson"" The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, ""Don't be nervous, Jack,"" and Mr. Summers said, ""Take your time, son.""   ""Zanini.""   After that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers. holding his slip of paper in the air, said, ""All right, fellows."" For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saving. ""Who is it?,"" ""Who's got it?,"" ""Is it the Dunbars?,"" ""Is it the Watsons?"" Then the voices began to say, ""It's Hutchinson. It's Bill,"" ""Bill Hutchinson's got it.""   ""Go tell your father,"" Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.   People began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly. Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers. ""You didn't give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn't fair!""   ""Be a good sport, Tessie."" Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, ""All of us took the same chance.""   ""Shut up, Tessie,"" Bill Hutchinson said.   ""Well, everyone,"" Mr. Summers said, ""that was done pretty fast, and now we've got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time."" He consulted his next list. ""Bill,"" he said, ""you draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?""   ""There's Don and Eva,"" Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. ""Make them take their chance!""   ""Daughters draw with their husbands' families, Tessie,"" Mr. Summers said gently. ""You know that as well as anyone else.""   ""It wasn't fair,"" Tessie said.   ""I guess not, Joe."" Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. ""My daughter draws with her husband's family; that's only fair. And I've got no other family except the kids.""   ""Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it's you,"" Mr. Summers said in explanation, ""and as far as drawing for households is concerned, that's you, too. Right?""   ""Right,"" Bill Hutchinson said.   ""How many kids, Bill?"" Mr. Summers asked formally.   ""Three,"" Bill Hutchinson said.   ""There's Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.""   ""All right, then,"" Mr. Summers said. ""Harry, you got their tickets back?""   Mr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. ""Put them in the box, then,"" Mr. Summers directed. ""Take Bill's and put it in.""   ""I think we ought to start over,"" Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. ""I tell you it wasn't fair. You didn't give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.""   Mr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box. and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground. where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.   ""Listen, everybody,"" Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.   ""Ready, Bill?"" Mr. Summers asked. and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children. nodded.   ""Remember,"" Mr. Summers said. ""take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave."" Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. ""Take a paper out of the box, Davy."" Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. ""Take just one paper."" Mr. Summers said. ""Harry, you hold it for him."" Mr. Graves took the child's hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.   ""Nancy next,"" Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box ""Bill, Jr.,"" Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, near knocked the box over as he got a paper out. ""Tessie,"" Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly. and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.   ""Bill,"" Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.   The crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, ""I hope it's not Nancy,"" and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd.  ""It's not the way it used to be."" Old Man Warner said clearly. ""People ain't the way they used to be.""   ""All right,"" Mr. Summers said. ""Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave's.""   Mr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill. Jr.. opened theirs at the same time. and both beamed and laughed. turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.   ""Tessie,"" Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.   ""It's Tessie,"" Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. ""Show us her paper. Bill.""   Bill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.   ""All right, folks."" Mr. Summers said. ""Let's finish quickly.""   Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. ""Come on,"" she said. ""Hurry up.""   Mr. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said. gasping for breath. ""I can't run at all. You'll have to go ahead and I'll catch up with you.""   The children had stones already. And someone gave little Davy Hutchinson few pebbles.   Tessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. ""It isn't fair,"" she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head. Old Man Warner was saying, ""Come on, come on, everyone."" Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.   ""It isn't fair, it isn't right,"" Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her."

MPI1N4T,male,15,"Introduction  	A bruise is a burst blood vessel hidden under some skin. Basic scientific definitions tend to leave out the human side of things. Maybe not just scientific but all definitions, the whole race of definitions. Maybe we just walk though life trying to define things so we don’t have to be bothered with the human side. Maybe it makes things easier, less human, less complicated.  	Humans are complicated. We are not the machines you read about in your kindergarten textbooks. We are a mass of tubes and organs all connected to this thing that can contemplate the small things like the opening of eyes to the big things like… God. And most of the time we fuck both of those things up by being distracted.  Ra.cism n – the notion that ones ethnic stock is superior. 	When you look at bruises you first, usually, notice the colour. It’s like a painters pallet viewed through the fogged lenses of a microscope: mingling, reminiscing with all the other colours, having a little cocktail party on that space right between your eye and your brow.   The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language doesn’t in fact have the definition of homophobic.  	I believe that the definition, correct me if I’m wrong, is the fear and hatred towards people who show sexual feelings towards people of the same sex. 	 	Now step back and look at all that for a moment. Humans are hard to find in a dictionary. We usually consider things with more emotion more true, more real, but the dictionary doesn’t have that at all. It has syllable breaks and parts of speech. So why do we go to it for help?   The definition of love, and may I remind you that love is probably the most sought after and revered emotion there is, is as follows: love n – 1. An intense affectionate concern for another person. 2 an intense sexual desire for another person. 	Does that do justice? Does that put into words that feeling you get in the soles of your feet to the lashes of your eyes? Does that put into words your quickness in breathing, your passion, the moisture collecting on the insides of your palms, that complete will to sacrifice anything for this person; this beloved person that you joke with yourself that you could spend your whole life with. Does that do it justice? Does it?       Chapter 1 Matthew  	I grew up without one family. I had families but I didn’t have one. My parents put me up for adoption when I was three. I’d like to say they died or something, you tend to get more respect for that, but I can’t. They left me. 	All my life I’ve bounced from house to house, roof to roof, mother to mother and nothing really stuck. Families would have financial problems themselves, or I’d be a hastle, or they’d just not like me because I couldn’t replace their son.  	I was eight by the time I got an actual home to stay in. They were average. Not in the sense that they weren’t exciting or anything but in the sense that they might be picked for a commercial or something.  	The Robbinsons. Each adult went to college for at least four years. Mr. Robbinson was a salesman is a salesman. He sells computer technology. He gets paid well but the trade-off is a schedule that asks for you at 9am on a Sunday and a brandy glass full of stress. Mr. Robbinson doesn’t drink to excess however you construe your definition of the word. If he was feeling down or stressed, he’d drink. The title habit would better suit the task.  	Mrs. Robbinson is a teacher. She’s the type of teacher that tells her students to be creative and original; and yet still subscribes to every magazine with the latest news on Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman’s break up. She’s a paradox. I cannot tell you who she is. I can tell you what she does.  	Jason, their son, doesn’t like me. Why should he? I’ve taken his place. I’m not him either. I’m white, he’s black. That sort of interruption and intrusion into someone’s budding adolescence is bound to stir up some fury.  	This also I declined to mention. Our difference is our colour. They are a middle class black family and I am a white orphan living under their roof. I don’t often travel in the neighborhood with them because I get treated like shit. I’m the white boy. You hear about racism on TV and on the news. But you only think about it as black teenagers getting beat up back in the sixties. It happens to me though. And I have neither grown up in the sixties nor am I black. It’s just… you can’t be told.  *		*		*  	Matthew woke up around 5:45 everyday. He’d slip, jump or simply get out of bed. It was always dark when he woke up. If it was a clear morning you could look out and see the stars that were still out. 	The morning sky before sunrise is very beautiful. Not may people know. But it’s true. The sky is a thousand different shades of blue. It slides from this deed endless blue to a nice ocean blue, the kind you see when you look down and see the rays of light grabbing your ankles. The ocean makes a frame with the darker blue in the center. The stars close their eyes, a few at a time until there’s one or two left that sit there for a while, then seeing everything is ok, follow suit. The east turns red. The red you find in a blood orange. Deep, slightly purple, slightly orange. It wafts around like cotton actually.  	After Matthew wrote his little mental poem he’d get into the shower and think some more. It usually took him at least seven minutes to get around to soaping. He liked the way the water bounced off the stunted muscle in his shoulders and ran down his legs. It made him feel just a little more superior. 	In the shower he had a little system. He’d first soap his legs, usually the outside first, just because it was easier. When he got to his waist he’d stop to put some soap on his face to prevent acne. He had to wait to do this after the legs because if he bent down the water would run over his face and wash off all the soap. Then he’d rub the bar over his arms. This took time. The feeling of the bar sliding over his muscle made him feel just a little more confident. He let it sit there. If you let a layer of water wash the soap off, you’re left with a nice shine that displays your muscle a little better. If you apply too much water it’ll start to collect into little beads and completely ruin the look. 	After soap came shampoo. He’d take the comb out of the medicine cabinet and comb it all back, then forward, then back again. The shampoo would wash off and he’d stand there for another five minutes, water bouncing off his shoulders. Then he’d turn off the water. But on cold days he has to wait for just the right moment. The moment in which he forgets it’s cold. That is the perfect moment.  	Showers are proceeded by the morning meal. Matthew has no method for this other than to choose he perfect reading material for the day. Paperback novels are always hard to read at the table because one always has to use both hands to keep one cover or the other from flipping over. Magazines, comic books, and large anthologies of… whatever, are perfect. 	Walk out the door, walk down the stairs, walk out another door, walk down more stairs and Matthew’s at the street. A few more steps and he’s at the bus stop. For Matthew municipal transportation is meditation in motion. No one looks at each other or really interacts; get an early enough bus and you’re all alone for your entire trip. He thinks about things. One time he tried to trace his thought cycle but it didn’t work. He hasn’t tried it since. 	Look, see the old man in blue windbreaker and navy polo. 	Look, see the bus driver to tired to do anything other than the scheduled task afforded to him. 	Coffee and Newspapers are the deities of the morning commuter. Entire lifetimes are spent attempting to attain the kind of peace gotten from a simple morning’s walk. *	*	*  Chapter 2 Fast Times  	The school doors open at seven o’clock everyday. Everyday the short Filipino man parks his van, runs across the courtyard up the stairs and opens the doors closest the office. There was always this old Asian man who stood there before the Filipino man came. He always looked so sad.  	Matthew got to school by seven everyday. With Matthew’s determination to get to school early, he, over time, came earlier and earlier. He didn’t do anything important with his time. He sat by his locker in another state of meditation. People would pass him in a moving mural of figures and colour but he didn’t seem to notice. Sometimes people asked him why he sat there. He couldn’t really answer them. He didn’t know. 	“Hey” It was this tall boy. He looked like a seventeen year old wanting to look twenty and independent. “Why are you always sitting here?” 	He pulled off the look nicely. 	“iono” 	He had short brown hair, tinged with blonde and wide cheeks but a narrow, strong chin. 	“You know, getting up and talking to people is much more healthy.” 	He sat down next to Matthew.  	“i guess you’re right.” 	“You guess.” He had a military messenger bag and a pair of Adidas flip-flops. 	“yeah.” 	He holds out his hand, “My name is Jude.” His and already looked older. 	“Matthew.” He wore a green track jacket with white and yellow stripes at the seams of each sleeve. He looked at Matthew with a smile. No teeth, just smile. Matthew looked from Jude’s hand to his stubbly face. 	If you were to classify Matthew’s face right now it’d probably be perplexed, but its intent was not that at all. 	All of a sudden Jude starts laughing, “Has” that bounce out of his chest. “You’re funny. I like you.” 	Matthew smiles, a cute smile, like a little boy who was just complimented by his pretty teacher. 	Matthew liked Jude. “i like you too.” 	“Listen, what’re you doing for lunch?” 	“eating?”  	“No, like do you have plans.” 	“oh. um, no.” 	“Yoouuuuu, need plans. Is this your locker?” 	Matthew looks up. “oh, yeah.” 	“Ok, I’ll meet you here. Be here, ok?” 	“ok.”  	“Ok?” 	Matthew squeezes out a few breaths, “ok.” *	*	*  	“Ladies and gentleman, meet-” he pauses and looks from the small cluster of people to Matthew, “Matthew.” 	He says Matthew the way a feather floats down on a light breeze.  	All of a sudden the mural starts talking. 	“Hey man.” 	“Hi Matthew.” 	“Do people ever call you Matty?”  	He just holds up his hand and mouths “hi”.  	“You two look the same.” Someone said. Jude looked down at his protégé, “He’s my little brother.” And then in a softer voice, “My own little brother.” Giving a short kiss on Matthews’s head then ruffling his hair. 	“What’re we doing?” Jude says with his arm still around Matthew’s shoulder, but his neck leaning out. 	A girl with short blonde hair contorted into various fountains: “We’re goin’ up to get some soup.” She pokes the girl next to her in a Fargo hat complete with flaps over the ears. She laughs and curls up, lifting one leg and poking her back.  	He nods in approval, “All right. Anyone else doing anything?” 	“Zach’s taking me to buy pizza.” 	“Joy. All right we’re gonna’ go up and just sit in the sun.” 	And so Matthew and Jude made their way up to the little brick wall. They talked and talked. It was more like Jude was teaching the untaught, painting a masterpiece on a blank slate.  Jude spoke all of these sweeping statements about anything and everything. 	“Never listen to Rolling Stones after three in the morning unless it is ‘satisfaction’ and you’re in a club or something.” 	He mainly talked about cultural sorts of things. Sometimes music. Sometimes fashion. Politics. Movies. Matthew told him his life story. That was really all he could talk about. Whenever Matthew spoke Jude would stop talking and listen. And whenever Jude talked Matthew would stop talking and listen. And they talked. This was the first time Matthew was ever late for a class. It was the first time he didn’t mind. 	“Where’ve you been.” 	“I’ve been,” he breathes through a smile, “talking to an important person.” 	The teacher just looks at him thinking, ”dumbass.”  Chapter 3 Teeth  And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.  And he sad the he had not won out against him and he touched his hip-socket and Jacob’s hip-socket was wretched as he wrestled with him. And he said, “Let me go, for dawn is breaking.” And he said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” And he said, “Not Jacob shall your name hence be said, but Israel, for you have striven with God and men, and won out” 	 The next time Matthew walked with Jude they were rudely interrupted by a boy in a Celtics jersey and pants that didn’t seem to agree with his waist. 	“What th’ fuc yue doin’, actin’ all gedo. Yue think yue blac. Yue fuckin’ aint’. Goe bac to yo’ mansion. Drink yo’ lemo’nade. Yue as white as mai teeth. Bich.” 	Matthew saw his brother, Jason, standing behind the Celtics boy. He could clearly hear the Celtics boy. But he didn’t do anything. Jude did. 	“What are you doing?” 	“Wuhs ah tahkin’ t’ yue?” 	“No, but I heard you. Fuck off.” 	His teeth don’t even move. His fist does. Matthew thought of how many miles an hour that mass of bone and muscle was traveling at. Jude gets hit in the eye. He stumbles back into the lockers. Matthew ducks down and runs into the Celtics boy’s stomach, pushing into the opposite lockers. He pounds on Matthew’s back. Only now did Matthew really realize how large this boy was, maybe six feet. The boy brings up a knee into Matthew’s stomach and Matthew rolls onto the ground. From the ground he sees his own brother trying to take down Jude. Matthew shouts no but he can’t hear it. He gets up and does the exact same thing to his brother that he had just done to the Celtics boy. Jude pulls Matthew off and to thank him Celtics boy punches him again. And it’s over. Matthew and Jude are yet again sitting against the lockers. 	“Do you need a place to sleep tonight?” 	“yeah. if i go home he’ll kill me.” 	“I doubt he’d kill you.” 	“he just might.” 	“Really now?’ 	“oh yeah. god honest truth.” 	“Huh, interesting.”   Chapter 4 Romeo  	They sat in Jude’s room, Matthew on the bed looking off the to the side on the walls, Jude on the floor sitting against the dresser looking at the wall behind Matthew. 	Matthew turned to look at Jude. 	“where’s your bathroom?” 	He lifts his arms and points to the door. “When you get out the door, turn left. It’s the first door you see.” 	“thanks.” Matthew unfolds his leg from under him and walks into the bathroom. He comes back with a white washcloth steaming from warm water. He crouches down in front of Jude and starts patting around his face.  	You can look a thousand other places on a person’s face other than their eyes. 	Matthew pats the cuts on Jude’s lips. 	“you know, chicks are into body damage” Matthew says just above a whisper. 	“I’m not into chicks.” Matthew stops mid pat for a slight second and continues. “Good Pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this.” 	Matthew smiles. He looks again off to the side and his cheeks flush. Jude chases him with his face leaning around to look him in the eye, smiling proudly. He gently grabs onto Matthew’s hand and lowers it. Watching it the entire way.  	“O then, dear saint, let, lips do what hands do.” And Jude kisses him. “Then have my lips the sin that they have took.” 	“sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d, give me my sin again.” And they kiss again, kissing until it is unclear where one begins and the other ends and who gives and who receives. It was not a wealth of passion or lust. It was a warm feeling.  	 *	*	*  	That night, Matthew lay on the bed and Jude lay on the floor. At one point Matthew peeked over the side of the bed down at Jude. Jude lay there, with his hands clasped at the base of his head. Neither were asleep so he crept down and lay his head on Jude’s stomach.  Chapter 5  	Matthew and Jude. It is not carved in a tree. It is not scrawled on a stuffed heart. It is not sent along with a bouquet of roses. It is not Lifetime. It is not Hallmark. 	It is one’s affection for the other. It is laughs at stolen jokes. It is common disliking of dislikable characters. It is ones tardiness. It is ones love to another. *	*	*  Chapter 6 Times at Home  	When Matthew was about six he lived with a young couple, fresh out of college. They were idealistic types. They thought that maybe they could actually change the world with their votes. They didn’t wear Gap or drink Coke. They were complainers, but they were happy. Matthew lived with them for a year. 	Every Saturday morning the man, Adam, would clean house while his partner was out at work. Matthew remembered sitting on the floor with crossed legs in the patch of sun that streamed through the windows, watching Adam clean everything, up and down, listening and singing along to R.E.M.’s Automatic for the People. Sometimes Matthew would get up and help. Mostly he liked to watch, he’d take in more that way. He wanted to be like this man. He was kind and caring. He was calm and patient with Matthew, teaching him new things whenever he could. He was the only father Matthew would ever have. 	One Saturday his partner came home crying, sobbing into her hands. Adam dropped his cloth and ran to her. He put his hands on either shoulder and bent over to look into her face, asking what’s wrong. She just grabbed him, shoving her face into his chest.  	“What’s wrong?” He asked, over and over again. “It’ll be ok.” And he gently took her into their bedroom to lay her down. He didn’t come out for another twenty minutes. And when he did, Matthew was able to see his blonde facial hair against his skin.  	Matthew ran up to him, “It’s ok Adam. It’s ok.” And Adam melted onto the couch. Matthew crouched next to it, with his nose peeking over the side. 	The next month, Matthew was moved to an agency, and in another month or so he’d moved to a different house. Adam’s partner had lost her job. He never saw Adam again.  Chapter 7 Sweetness Follows  	“Did you know that Irish people used to be considered black?” Matthew boasts eagerly to show off his new knowledge. He skips ahead a few steps as he and Jude walk up to their usual spot during lunch. “Yeah, when they first came to America everyone hated them because they took jobs.” 	“Interesting.” Jude breathed, looking behind him. 	“There were so many. I wonder if my family came over in the first few waves.” 	“How do you know you’re Irish?” 	“I don’t know. Someone told me one day. I guess I just accepted it. It was probably a doctor.” 	“Yeah.” again, looking away. “Matthew, I can’t eat with you today.” 	Matthew stops a few feet away, and turns around, and looks at Jude. Jude stands there skimming the area, then puts his hands in his pockets. “Why not?” 	“I’m supposed to meet someone.” 	“Who?” 	“Abel.” 	“Abel?” 	“Yeah.” 	“I’ve never met him.” 	Jude doesn’t say anything for a moment. He turns away from Matthew and folds his arms. Matthew steps to his side. “What’s wrong?” 	“Nothing, nothing.” 	“Well then why do you look so glum?” 	He turns around, “He and I are together now.

Matthew is puzzled; less puzzled and more scared.  	“I love you Jude.” 	Jude looks away again and mumbles out a few laughs; nervous laughs; laughs that say sorry. Sorry I cannot return your…  	“Jude?” 	“no.” 	“Juude?” 	“NO MATTHEW! NO! no.”"

Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""Everybody Plays The Fool""   I've never been a big fan of April Fool's Day.  The idea of purposely trying to trick people has just never sat well with me.  That, and I'm really freakin' gullible, and folks can nail me easily.  Let's face it--I probably am way too trusting.  I accept what someone is telling me at face value, most of the time.  And while that's good, it means it's real easy for someone to trick the pants off me on days like this.  Ah well.  Such is life, I guess.  Okay, need to go draw tomorrow's comic.  Word.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Huey Lewis & the News, ""I Want A New Drug"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""Just Thinkin' Of A Series Of Dreams""   So Friday was a good day.  We got paid (always a plus), I hung out with Ev for his birthday (which was the 14th, but guess why no one was available to do anything on  that  day), and proved that I'm a geeky fanboy by purchasing the  urlLink Megatokyo Volume 2  book at Hastings.  Very nifty stuff, with a bunch of extras that aren't on the website.  Now if they'd just get around to getting the first volume reprinted, I'd be set...  Anyway, it was a good day, as stated, but a strange one.  Ev and I had lunch at an international food store down the street from our apartment complex.  Gyros, humus, and a bunch of other stuff with names I cannot remember, and which I could not pronounce even if I  could  remember.  Most of it was just...odd, and not really to my taste at all.  The humus was especially weird, and nothing that I would eat of my own accord.  It was an interesting cullinary experience, but not something I'll repeat anytime soon or with any regularity.  Also tracked down a DVD for Beth that she's been looking for (the second Harry Potter flick, actually).  Everyone we've looked, it's been bloody expensive (still like $23, which is ridiculous considering it really wasn't even as good as the first one).  Anyway, found it used at a store today for $8, and it was in excellent shape, so I snapped it up.  She was much appreciative of it.  In the morning, I'm heading up to Oklahoma City for the Metro Library Book Sale.  My folks gave me a bit of money to purchase books specifically in this instance.  My parents are really kinda weird, I've decided--on the one hand, my mother berates me for the stupid stuff I do (and the important stuff I should do that I haven't done) every time I speak with them.  Then they turn around and spoil me, whether it's giving me money to buy random books or by purchasing me clothes specifically for the history conference next weekend on what I think is a whim.  Which they actually did--there was a message on my voicemail from my mom informing me she'd purchased an ""outfit"" for me for next weekend.  I only hope it's not a sailor hat and a jock strap, or the historical community could be in serious trouble.  Yeah, have I mentioned the history conference next weekend?  I'm presenting the paper I wrote last semester for my 19th Century Europe class in an abridged form.  Yeah, it's only 12 pages instead of 25.  I actually couldn't cut anymore of the paper without losing vital parts of the argument.  I'm curious to see how this one fares as compared to the one I presented last year, which took first place in the graduate non-American section.  On a related note, the paper I'm working on for my 20th Century Europe class this semester--which takes the  Lord of the Rings  and Tolkein and proposes that the novels actually reflect his own peculiar anxieties and concerns as a Briton in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly with the idea of the British race ""failing""--I'm hoping will be good enough (and original enough) to submit to a Tolkein conference in England that's going to be held sometime next year.  Can you imagine me presenting a paper on the  Lord of the Rings  in  England ?  How much of a dream come true would that be?  Dunno how likely it is, but there's always hope.  I've been in a weird mood the past few days.  I wasn't able to really pinpoint what it was or why it was occurring until earlier this evening when I was briefly visiting with Beth.  She's already heard back from both of her top choices for graduate school--Florida State and Miami.  Both meterology programs (two of the best in the country, especially for hurricane research, which is what she wants to do) accepted her, and with impressive fellowships at that.  She only sent out her applications over Christmas break.  I also know that Amanda Erisman has already heard from at least Tulsa, and was accepted there with a good fellowship, if I remember correctly.  Yet I've not heard from any of my schools yet, and I applied back in early to mid- November .  I guess part of it is envy.  Florida State--Beth's top choice--is offering her full tuition and a $22K living stipend.  I'm sure Miami's will be similar.  I don't know what Amanda's being offered by Tulsa, though I'm sure it's good.  Both of them are doing science--Beth is meterology, and Amanda is biology.  Both are very hot fields right now.  Meanwhile, history--and most of the rest of the humanities, for that matter--are flooded, bloated with too many PhDs.  I'm an above average historian at least, but in a time when excellent historians are a dime a dozen, is above average good enough?  One has to wonder.  Perhaps if I'd pushed myself harder while at Ozarks and while here at OU, I'd be in a better position?  Or maybe if I'd chosen a different field, one with some decent job prospects after graduation.  Part of me does wonder what would have happened if I'd put forth a little more effort in areas that didn't come as naturally as history and the humanities do.  Areas such as math, or science.  Would I have as many worries and concerns about my future if I'd gone into one of those fields?  Would schools be begging to have me attend instead of the other way around?  Admittedly, it's a fairly academic question, no pun intended.  I went into history, not meterology or biology or one of those other ""-ologies.""  I went into the humanties, knowing the job market wasn't great, knowing there were severe limitations placed on what I'd be able to do.  But I guess I also thought maybe that the rules didn't apply to me, that the world would make way for me to do whatever I damn well pleased, and that everyone and everything would cater to my whims.  It's a nice dream, you have to admit, but it's not very realistic at all.  It means there are many things I'm having to learn the hard way along the way, and that's never entirely pleasant.  But I also think that, despite the obstacles I face, and the apparent envy I have of my friends who are getting these nice offers, I'll be content with my chosen profession.  I'm not cut out for biology, or for meterology.  I can't do accounting, or marketing, or computer science.  I can write, I can think about things in a fairly abstract manner, and I can analyze documents and ideas in a fairly impressive fashion.  I can do humanities.  I can doodle a bit, and who knows?  There may be some monetary future in that, though probably not enough to sustain me or feed me or anything.  Perhaps enough to augment a real job with some fun cash, but that's about it.  I'm learning to be realistic.  I know I have some skills and abilities, and I know I have some limitations.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to work with what I have to get around what stands in my way.  Now I'm learning to make the most of the abilities I possess.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Cake, ""Love You Madly"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""There's Always A Siren Singing You To Shipwreck""   I was talking on the phone with my mother earlier this afternoon, and she mentioned to me that our church decided to fire the youth direction, who has been at UPC for about seven or eight years now.   Why?  They felt her job could be done by a couple of volunteers from the local Baptist college.  Admittedly, Rachel herself (the woman who was the youth director) and the guy who was youth director when I first joined the youth group way back in 1994 started out as college students volunteering.  But Rachel had become the full-time youth minister, and was doing so much with it--mission trips, gatherings, and so much more.  The church's reasoning?  Budget concerns.  It strikes me as sadly amusing that we keep thinking of the church as a business concern.  Admittedly, the church has business stuff that it needs to take care of--payroll, monthly bills, etc.--but isn't a church supposed to concern itself more with its world mission than with money concerns?  As long as the church still operates, does it matter if it makes or loses money?  Oddly enough, the church actually has plenty of money.  However, most of the money we have is earmarked for specific things--erecting a new building, missionaries, things like that.  The money's usually not donated to the church for the payment of the minister and other church employees.  As my mom commented, we'll end up like the other Presbyterian Church in Shawnee ended up (before it merged with our church)--we'll have plenty of money that we can't spend, and no one attending the church.  So many members have already left, so many will probably leave now that the youth director's gone, and God only knows how the poor interum pastor is supposed to handle all this.  On an unrelated note, let me share a new (well, new to me) webcomic that I just finished reading today-- urlLink Digital War , which I found through  urlLink The Jaded  and recognized as a prolifict poster on the  urlLink Keenspace Forums .  Digital War is an interesting read, and well-drawn.  The current storyline is a quasi-LOTR parody with some nice twists, and the main character, War, rocks your socks.  So go check it out.  There'll probably be a link to it over at  urlLink Dim Bulb  as soon as I get around to it.  In other news, I finally beat Final Fantasy Tactics Advance this afternoon.  Seventy-six hours plus of gameplay.  Good game, though.  Of course, now I'm without a game to play for the GBA, having beaten everything I have...oh, wait, except MarioKart.  Still have that!  But that's not really one you ""beat,"" per se.  ...yeah, need a new game.  Or I guess I  could  start working on things like my thesis...maybe....  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, ""There There"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""She Don't Mind The Late Night Radio""   Well, yesterday I finally beat Battle Network 2.  Kicked that final boss's  ass , man!  Woo!  So now I'm working on finishing up Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.  I still have a bit left, and I've been playing for nearly 70 hours.  That's almost three total days' worth of engagements, job switching, inventory perusal, and learning kick ass new abilities.  A friend of mine told me a mutual friend was having trouble last night, so I sent the mutual friend a random, exceptionally sappy email.  She hasn't killed me yet with laser vision, so I can only assume she appreciated it rather than the alternative--wanting to see me dead in a gutter clutching an empty bottle of cheap whiskey.  Which isn't to say that isn't a distinct possibility sometime in the near future.  Assuming I can find some cheap whiskey that I can afford.  I talked with both parents (separately) last night, and my dad mentioned the OKC Metropolitan Library is having its annual book sale this Saturday.  He then said he was going to deposit $20 in my account so I could go buy books.  The books at these things cost about a quarter to fifty cents.  And he gave me $20.  I am gonna have so many books after this thing...  The only drawback is that I have to drive across town to be at the Fair Grounds at 9.30 am Saturday morning.  No sleeping in for Chuck!  Only half an hour of work left.  It's rather quiet--everyone suddenly left, all at about the same time.  So now the only people in here are employees.  We're all sitting in a row at the computers, typing away and not interacting.  It's sad and humorous in a weird sort of way.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, ""Faster, Sooner, Now"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""What's Wrong With This Picture?""   It's early.  I'm at work.  People in Madrid are blowing each other up for ridiculous reasons, people in California are deciding to reneg on tacit decisions made decades ago, the Oklahoma State Legislature is trying to get rid of quarter beer night, and I still have too many pages left to type on the Master's Thesis.  Yeah, it's a great morning, alright.  When did our nation become so damn stupid?  When did we all become so full of hate and fear of the mythical ""Other"" that we'd trample their rights, deny them equality, and refuse to recognize them as humans?  I'm not gonna rant and rave about this for paragraph after paragraph.  There are people much more eloquent than I already expressing just how ridiculous and insipid these things are.  I just wonder whatever happened to humanity.  When did we become so callow and heartless?  As a history major, I think I can pinpoint the exact moment--the minute we started acting out against one another.  So really from time out of mind, we've been finding new and exciting ways to hurt each other and strip one another of humanity and dignity.  Stupid world.  Stupid fucking world.  ~chuck cottrell  Song of the Moment: REM, ""Wake Up Bomb"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""Hey Now, You're An All Star""   I got an interesting email today.  It was from  urlLink Keenspace All Stars , a website devoted to ""acknowledging the best of Keenspace,"" to quote the site.  Interestingly enough, Crooked Halo was one of the comics on their list for the month.  I have no idea who nominated or voted for me, but I'm very, very honored.  I'm in the company of such Keenspacers as  urlLink Count Your Sheep ,  urlLink The Jaded ,  urlLink Mixed Myth ,  urlLink Fallen Angel Used Books , and  urlLink Reasoned Cognition .  Anyway, for those of you reading this (you probably also read the comic, I'm assuming), thanks for reading Halo, and I'll try to maintain a level of quality that deserves such recognition.  In other news, I got an old Phil Collins album on CD today.  It's  No Jacket Required , which was one of my favorite tapes when I was younger.  The album's chock-full of great tunes that I know by heart and still remembered, even though I haven't heard most of the songs in years and years.  I remember when that tape was part of my usual musical regimine.  The other tapes were Collins'  Face Value  (another great album), Tom Petty's  Full Moon Fever ,  Into the Great Wide Open , and  Damn the Torpedoes , Led Zeppelin's  ZOSO  ( Led Zeppelin IV , the one that had weird symbols for the title), the two Traveling Wilburys albums, and the Black Crowes'  Shake Your Money Maker .  These were the albums that I constantly listened to until I got a CD player and CDs.  When I wasn't listening to those tapes, I was in the living room listening to dad's records.  He had lots of great stuff--Beatles albums, the Eagles, Electric Light Orchestra, solo stuff from the former Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and others that I can't even begin to remember without going back in and looking at them.  Granted, I mostly just listened to the Beatles records...the number of times I sat there with  Help!  or  Sgt. Pepper's  filling the headphones and my ears are too many to count.    So all in all, it's been a good day.  My run today was good--it took me about half an hour to run around my neighborhood and then around campus, so that's roughly 3 miles or so (because that's about how long it should take me to run three miles, even if I'm running a 10 minute mile, which I think I'm moving faster than that).  Also took Ev up to Circuit City in OKC to exchange a DVD player that didn't work, and that worked out well for him (they gave him store credit, which was better than what I thought would happen--I figured they wouldn't even let him exchange it period).  All told, life is pretty good, and could be much, much worse.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Phil Collins, ""Inside Out"" (it was always my favorite song on the album)"
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""Set 'Em Up And Let 'Em Fall""   So Wendy tells me that she found out she got hired on as the new drama teacher at Fairfax High School in Fairfax, VA.  She starts in September, but her training starts August 26th.  Her current job ends August 24th.  The point to all this is that she doesn't get to come visit Oklahoma in August like she was planning to do.  The other point is that now she owes me a trip to Cancun.  See, we made a bet a year or two ago that the first one of us to get a teaching job (regardless of the level) would take the other to Cancun.  So now she gets to take me.  Of course, it'll be a while, because she'll need to save up money and she wants me to bring a girl along (since she'll be bringing her boyfriend Tim).  It'll probably take me longer to find a girlfriend than it'll take Wen to save up the money for the trip, but that's okay.  Still waiting to hear back from Ferguson on my car.  I'd like it if they'd let me know within the next hour or so, so I can get the car before I'm supposed to be at Everett's.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Pink Floyd and Van Morrison, ""Comfortably Numb (Live)"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""Be Mine, Be Mine""   So I went to check my mail this afternoon, and found a package in my mailbox.  This came as something of a surprise, as I haven't ordered anything of late and was unaware of anyone planning to send me a package.  Yet there were my name and address on the package, clear and discernable.  I took the package inside and opened it, and found an old Valentines' box.  The box itself looked to be about 15 or 20 years old, but again my name was written on it.  No clearer as to why I had this package than I was before, I opened the box.  The contents of the box turned out to be Valentines from various members of my church.  Seems they'd decided to send these little packages full of Valentines and candy to all the church members in college.  It made me smile and was very sweet of them, and made my afternoon very nifty.  And since life can't let me go with positive points, it had to hit me with something annoying.  Mom got my bill from the university today, and I'm only enrolled for 8 hours, not 9.  Which is stupid, because the class I should be enrolled in 4 hours in is currently only set at 3 hours.  I know I changed it to four, though--I still have the email the computer system automatically generated when I changed my hours.  So tomorrow I get to pester the registrar's office and get them to fix it so I'm enrolled like I ought to be.  It's not going to be difficult to get done, just tedious and time consuming.  It's a nuisance more than anything else.  In other news, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance for almost 70 hours now, and I've just now finished half of the possible missions.  I'd like to beat all 300 missions, but I don't know if I'll have the patience for that.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, ""Queen of the Slipstream"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""Flagpole Sitta""   Well, remember all the complaining I've been doing of late about how lonely I am?  That's all ended, it seems.  Friday night, I hung out with Everett for like six or seven hours, watching disc three of Blue Seed (only one more and Blue Seed Beyond left!) and just chatted.  Then Saturday evening was spent picking Beth up from the airport, having a quick bite of dinner with her, and then both of us joining Jess and Dom for a game of bowling (I totally 0w|\|z0r3d...or something like that).  A wonderful evening, yes indeed.  And tomorrow is spent with folks from both the school paper and work at meetings for each.  Oh, and for information's sake, my comics in the OU Daily will run on Fridays, it seems.  It's as good a reason as any to read the school paper, I guess.  I also spent way more money today than I should have.  Not on dinner and bowling--no, those are very acceptable and good uses of money, and I don't regret them at all.  No, I'm referring to the fact that I went and bought a GameCube.  Why?  Because I'm tired of not having a decent game system, and because I've been saving money for one.  I've only got one controller right now (and since part of the reason I purchased this thing was to do multiplayer games, that'll have to change), and only one game--Rogue Squadron II--Rogue Leader (Star Wars game!  Woo!).  No memory card, so I can't save anything (which means I get to keep flying the mission against the Death Star every time I turn the thing on...which isn't necessarily a  bad  thing), but I've ordered a memory card, and I should have it in a week or so.  I really probably shouldn't have bought the GameCube, to be honest.  Money's gonna get tight here pretty soon, and so will time.  But I'm of the opinion--an opinion I've held for several years now--that you can't just work all the time.  Sometimes, you need to unwind, cut loose, and shoot down some TIE fighters, y'know?  Or play some MarioKart.  Or Smash Brothers Melee.  Or Zelda.  Or Soul Calibur II, which also happens to feature Link of Legend of Zelda kickin' some serious ass.  Etc., etc.  Really, that's mostly rationalization, and I know it.  I also know my spending habits need to improve greatly, or I could be in serious trouble.  I keep telling myself, ""okay, no more spending after this,"" and then I go and spend more.  But I really do need to stop now.  I'm not going to buy anymore games or movies or CDs or anything like that for a long time now.  I probably need outside help with this, so anyone who feels like trying to mother me (other that my actual mother--she'll just yell at me), let me know.  I need someone to keep me on the straight and narrow in these matters.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Band, ""The Weight"""
Y3ZESSJ,male,24,"""I Was Up All Night Making Up My Mind But Now I've Got My Doubts""   Had a shouting match with my mother earlier today.  That was fun, if you define ""fun"" as ""something that was agitating and annoying and not really something I wanted to do.""  Yeah, fun.  Her problem is that she thinks I need to stop feeling defeated by the whole grad school thing.  She also thinks I've been dragging my feet in regards to papers and alternate plans and suchlike.  I blew up at her and chewed her out at a high volume for a good two or three minutes about that.  I was filled with semi-righteous anger.  Semi-righteous because, to an extent, she's kinda right.  Not totally, and this isn't something I'd admit to her, mind you, but enough that it rankled.  She's also kinda wrong.  I didn't think I'd need to re-apply to this blasted school.  I thought I had Ohio State in the bag.  Finding out I didn't meant I had to rush to try to get things taken care of to stay here, if I need to.  It also means that stuff I should have been working on, I haven't been, because I've been a bit depressed.  Okay, very depressed, I just haven't shown it as much as the last time I got a rejection letter from a school (Washington University about a month ago, for those of you keeping score at home).  But it's there, believe me.  I haven't done very much on the paper for my class this semester, and I have been dragging my feet on it.  And now I'm having trouble finding sources that'll work (though some research work this afternoon may have turned up some worthwhile sources).  I don't know why I'm so apathetic and lazy this semester.  Mom pointed out that I was much more productive last semester when I had a couple of classes than I am this semester with only one class, and one that I don't even really have to attend every time at that.  I guess I'm the sort of person who needs deadlines and structure.  For better or worse, I'm not very self-motivated when it comes to certain things.  School happens to be one of them.  Comics, of course, aren't.  Neither is my writing.  But schoolwork...yeah, sometimes I'm not so into that.  Which is ridiculous, since this is what I'm wanting to do with the rest of my life.  Then again, maybe that's what the problem is--maybe this isn't what I want to do with the rest of my life.  Problem is, I don't know what I'd do with the rest of my life if not this.  As much as I'd like to, there's no way I could ever make a living with my comic or my writing or anything like that.  They're fun hobbies, but that's all they're ever likely to be.  And I'm fine with that--I enjoy drawing and writing, and that's what really matters.  It's really just a nice dream that someone would pay me enough money to live off of for doing that stuff.  No, I need to find a ""real"" job, I guess.  I need to get this next degree, and become a professor.  I really do like the idea of teaching.  I already enjoy sharing what I know with people all the time.  Getting paid for that is a dream I can reach.  Well, if I can get into another graduate school, it is.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Eagles, ""Peaceful, Easy Feeling"" (yeah, if only)"

Yesterday I was astute enough to get to a Border's bookstore and search out a coin book to find out their present value.  You're not gonna like what you hear!  Are you ready? Now I ONLY checked two of the coins, the 1935 D and the 1919.  To further flummox your ""uncanny"" financial cunning, I want you to know that the coins can fall into about 12 different gradings, or qualities that define the coin's condition.  Knowing that I further want you to know that these coins, though still SECOND from the BOTTOM in the grading scale were still worth, well, A BUNDLE!  Yes, the 1935 D weighed in with a value in U.S. dollars at $0.10 and the big winner, the 1919 penny stumbled across the finish line worth $0.15!  Of course, I fainted dead away and fell to the floor.  Several clerks had to attend to me to bring me around.  Lucky for me, I had the presence of mind to hold onto the two pennies with a tight fisted grip when I lost conciousness. After awaking, it felt as if prying fingers had tried to force open my fist; I think someone knew what I had.

IZ2P1TQ,female,23,"For all you guys that didn't like the post on my  urlLink Machiavelli-style flirting  don't read this entry. If you're still reading on, I wanted to let everyone know that once again I manged to use my flirting abilities to my advantage. I booked a hotel for NYC on hotels.com, which has no cancellation, no change policy. I called Saturday night and cancelled the hotel,  without  paying the HUGE fee. I lucked out and got a young guy on the phone, and I found out he was based in Texas, and well, don't you know it, I live in Texas, too. So many things in common. And no $250 fee for me. Yipee!!"
IZ2P1TQ,female,23,"First off, since I am sitting in bed, crippled, and bored to tears, I have been terrorizing everyone's blog with random comments. And for that I must apologize. But I really am bored. And the vicodin is telling me to do strange things-- like comment on Blogs.  Anyways, whilst having ice cream with Farouche (who graciously came and picked me up) and Red, I remembered something my buddy RP (if you IM me, he's the dude on skis that I have as my buddy icon) told me in New Mexico the morning he woke my ass up at 8:30 AM to go hottubbing.  RP, ""It's gonna be a beautiful day, F. Wanna know how I know? I look outside and hear the birds chirping. And somewhere in the woods there's a squirrel humping a turtle. How can it  not  be a good day?"""

IZ2P1TQ,female,23,"Yesterday afternoon, I awoke around 5 from a groggy nap. I was late to Farouche's happy hour. She was having drinks & fondue at her place. I rolled out of bed, not really sure where I was or what was going on. I was so sleepy-- I guess two hours a sleep per night for the past two weeks will do that to you!  Got to Farouche's & started munching on the goodies. I was still confused about what was going on around me-- Farouche & Red just laughed. The fondue was excellent-- she had cheese & chocolate fondue. I ate them both in massive quantaties. But by the end of the night I was eating the chocolate fondue with a spoon. Yum!  Me, Farouche, & Mr. Humane hung out for a while. Munching on the goodies, drinking, & watching movies. After a while, my buddy Apostle called and asked us to meet up w/him at Club de Ville. We didn't  really  want to go downtown, but once we heard the Scottish burr of the guy partying with him, we happily got up, got dressed, and went downtown (the mention of free beers didn't hurt either!).   We walked out of Farouche's apartment, only to hear Red exclaim, ""Where's my car?!"". It had been towed. Red was a trooper and decided to go out drinking before getting her car out of jail.  Met up with Apostle & Scottish boy, who bought our drinks. Hung out, chewed the fat. Usual bullshit. Good times. Found out Apostle was fired from the bar where he worked because he was caught by TBAC drinking on the job. Oops.  A little while later,  urlLink Rugby Boy  (not to be confused with Mexican boy, aka, my latest Playboy) called & asked me to meet up. So I dragged Red & Farouche to the dive where the rugby boys hung out. At least we got more free drinks.  Went to get Red's car out of jail-- by not I am so tired that I am feeling delirious. I am falling asleep in my car, so I Thailand to stay awake. Thanks to her amusing conversation I didn't fall asleep at the wheel and turn into a statistic.  This morning, I woke up to my phone ringing at 9:45am. Dammit, what  do  I have to do to get some sleep around here? It was my mom, just calling to chat. Dammit, again.  Got up, checked my computer and saw that BW had IMed last night. Haha. It's his little brother's 21st birthday and they were partying it up! In the IM he told me to come over and party. Oops. Missed that one. So I called him and woke him up this morning. haha. Oops again."

I was the only girl in a swimsuit; all the other girls, ""didn't want to get wet"" or ""had just washed their hair.""   I was the first person pushed in, of course. And I was still wearing my sarong.  But that's the story of my life.   I love crawfish. And I especially love sucking the heads.

IZ2P1TQ,female,23,"For those of you I haven't told yet, here are my MRI results. Pretty grim.  ACL-- torn. Initially they thought it was 100% severed, but no, the bastard is hanging on by a thread (literally). My knee is so loose that the dr was amazed that I had been  walking  on it for the past 6 months (and even more so that I had been skiing and kickboxing on it, too).  Medial Meniscus-- ?? Where is it? It wasn't in the MRI. It has popped out of joint. That's why I can't straighten my knee. The Dr wants to go in and fix my ACL, but he can't operate until I can fully extend my knee, which I can't do because the meniscus is in the way, blocking my knee extension.  I  have to pop my meniscus back in to joint . WTF???? Talk about PAIN!! I have been trying to straighten my knee all day, to no avail.   Surgery scheduled for Friday, April 16th. In a WEEK. The Dr said he's gonna pop the meniscus back in for me (unless I can do it before then) and ""clean up me knee.""  CLEAN UP MY KNEE?!? . My knee isn't a fucking kitchen!!!! Arg! And I have to be back on my feet for school on the following Tuesday. Dammit. Dammit.  DAMMIT .   Conclusion. After this first ""minor"" surgery (why do they call it minor? is  any  surgery ""minor???) I have to work on my knee's mobility, and when it's back to 100%, they're gonna go BACK in and fix my ACL. A much less ""minor"" surgery. Life is gonna be one fucking party for me in the next few months.   On a lighter note, at least I got my honors cords today, even though I skipped the boring ceremony. Being on crutches  does  have its advantages."
HI03IG7,female,39,"I think that's what my nephew must be calling me. Because on Saturday when I followed him around to all of his games, his poor team had really bad luck and lost every one. It was definitely not their day. While they had some decent plays, the other teams were smacking that ball and grabbing it out of the air in unbelievable ways, plus our guys had a few sloppy mistakes besides.   But yesterday? You know, when I couldn't go to any of the games? They won! Yes, every single game. For the championship of the tournament. Uh huh. When I wasn't there to see it.   I think my nephew is going to request that dear Aunt Keri just not bother to come and watch him play anymore. Or I won't hear about the games. Or maybe I'll hear about them but I'll get the wrong field location or the wrong starting time or something. Cuz I've gotta be a jinx. Poor guys. Sorry B!"
HI03IG7,female,39,"I so enjoyed conversing with Hutch over the past couple of days in the comments that I think each day I shall have one post devoted to a Question for Hutch...   Who knows what I'll ask? But it'll be just for you Hutch.   Here's today's  Question for Hutch: Not to get too detailed here (or in your answer), but after the FF dance, we headed up on the hill to UB for food and beverages and then to WP. On the way to WP we walked past the place you and I first met, right? And my memory says we also went across the cartwheeling place and at that point something happened which stressed us out... Has my memory simply embellished and so you have no idea what I am talking about???    I ask this question because I'm seriously beginning to doubt my memory on this point and am wondering if I've made that whole incident up. If you  don't  know what I'm talking about, next time we do lunch, we need to talk about the FF dance so you can tell me what  did  happen that night! :) Or e-mail me. Soon. I'm getting old.

Between going to lunch to toast Lilah on what would have been her 99th birthday, running back to town to get Kel from school, heading home for a while to let Bear, the devil dog, out for a little while, then off to my known-her-since-diapers girlfriend's Mary Kay business kickoff party tonight... it was just a busy day!  I ran tonight watching the premier show of S&H... I only did 3 miles though since it was 10:30 pm. I was already kind of tired. So I watched part of the show without being on Lurch. I was right, it will be the perfect amount of time on the treadmill to watch an entire show while I run.   Thanks Easter Bunny!   Today's Miles:  3  Total so far:  324.75  Still to go for goal:  175.25  Finally, here's a poem, written by my cousin last year when my grandma passed away... in honor of Lilah...   Grama by Jody Brown Miranda 1-17-2003    Blessed with the Luck O' The Irish  She was born on St. Paddy's Day.  Grasping a rosary in her fist  and a feisty desire to pray.     She set her sights on Mr. Brown  and married her Scottish mate  the two of them, side by side,   worked hard and set their own fate.     Soon God sent them four little lassies  and a lad for all to spoil,  helped in childrearing by the Catholic Nuns  all hyjinks were quickly foiled.     Her claim to fame was an ample bosom  and her talent for song and dance.  As a kid I remember her snappy housedresses  and her disdain for young ladies in pants.     I remember Grama Lilah in her apron  at home and in the Catholic School gym   makin' chicken or spaghetti for banquets  or decorating Christmas ornaments with trim.     I also remember the Thanksgiving treats  and the stomachaches we'd be feeling,  and all of us cousins listening in on the grown-ups  through the vent in the first-floor ceiling.     My sweetest memory brings the faces  into sharp focus after all these years.  Grampa Howard hugging and kissing and tickling  'till her laughing eyes filled with tears.     Memories and tales came tumbling out  as we strengthened the Brown family ties  as we waited for her Guardian Angel's descent  as we whispered our loving goodbyes."
HI03IG7,female,39,"Stolen from  urlLink Lucy ...  1) First Grade Teacher:  Mrs. Iverson. She was so cool – and gave me such confidence. I was a good reader and got to be a reading assistant to other kids. When they sat in front of the class to read aloud to others, I sat beside them and helped them on the words they didn’t know.  2) Last word you said:  Bear!  3) Last song you sang:  ""Well it’s a marvelous night for a moon dance…"" (I’ve got Michael Buble’s cd in my car and when I’m driving anywhere alone or with Kel, I crank it and I/we sing along at the top of our lungs.)  4) Last person you hugged:  Keith just now as I realized we were so busy loading the car with his stuff in a hurry to get back last night to get Kel and her friend on time from the play that we didn’t even hug hello!  6) Last time you said “I love you"":  last night to Kel in the car on the way to town – she’s really having a tough couple of days after making some bad choices not using her brain so much as her heart  8) What’s in your CD player:  car – Michael Buble, bedroom – John Mayer’s Heavier Things, kitchen – Meet Joe Black soundtrack *sigh*, portable – Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker’s “Best Of” for running  9) What color socks are you wearing:  barefoot  10) What’s under your bed:  lots o’ dust and dog hair  11) What time did you wake up today:  10ish for the last time  12) Current taste:  water from taking my meds and clariti*n  13) Current hair:  short but not spikey today with just a few grays still.  14) Current clothes:  just replaced my nightie with yesterday’s clothes so I could run downstairs in the room Kel and her friend slept in to look for something  15) Current annoyance:  the fact I haven’t showered yet, heh  16) Current longing:  chocolate   17) Current desktop picture:  David M. Bailey playing at the concert we attended last year with the local folk group which accompanied him and the beautiful pipe organ of the church as the backdrop behind them. It’s my own photo from the concert, but I think there is something similar on his website that I’ll  urlLink link  to if I can find it. You can't really see him in this photo, but the guy playing drums in the back reminds me a lot of the photo of  urlLink Mark  on his website. You don't have a drummer in your family who lives up in Minnesota, do you Mark?  18) Current worry:  Kel has some problems with friends.  20) Story behind your username:  I’m not really using my user name. I have a user name of KinnicChick and the story is a local thing.  21) Current favorite article of clothing:  don’t know if I can pick just one thing. I just bought a skort from title ix that is really comfy and easy. Also bought a t-shirt dress that I love that is comfy and easy. Also bought a little black dress that is kinda sexy and cute and makes me feel pretty that I’ll be wearing to Phantom tomorrow (not from Title IX). And I love my comfortable low rise levis jeans.   22) Favorite physical feature of the opposite sex:  it’s always been about the hands. I fell in love with the look of Keith's hands first. I could tell they were an artist's hands. He was a woodworker and had those strong and thin hands - sensitive.   23) Last CD that you bought:  shiza, I can’t remember. Thinking… I think it was Jason Mraz’s Waiting for my Rocket to Come.   24) Favorite place to be:  Home  25) Least favorite place:  sitting in traffic.  26) Time you wake up in the morning:  when I have to. Used to be a lot later. I’m becoming an earlier riser. I wake up a lot earlier when the shades are open. Go figure.  27) If you could play an instrument, what would it be:  the piano. I do okay, but I’d be lots better with my left hand.  28) Favorite color:  green froth – the color of the walls in my office and sun room.  29) Do you believe in an afterlife:  yes, but more in a nextlife kinda way.  30) How tall are you:  5'4'  31) Current favorite word/saying:  Not my favorite, but seemingly stuck in my vernacular at the moment... ""I'm just saying..."" Maybe we should call this current overused phrase and just shoot me whenever I use it...  32) Favorite book:  The English Patient and To Kill A Mockingbird and Pride and Prejudice (tie)  33) Favorite season:  Autumn  34) One person from your past you wish you could go back and talk to:  Mr. Nederloe  35) Favorite day:  Every one  36) Where do you want to go:  Lots of places, actually.  37) What is your career going to be like:  writer for hire! Heh…  38) How many kids do you want?  just the one I’ve got  39) What kind of car will you have:  mini cooper  40) Type a line you remember from any book:  “Ma ma ma Mice Aroma” from the book of misheard song lyrics…   41) A random lyric:  ""Well I won't back down, no I won't back down  You can stand me up at the gates of hell  But I won't back down   Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around  And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down  Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down   Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out  Hey I will stand my ground  And I won't back down.   Well I know what's right, I got just one life  In a world that keeps on pushin' me around  But I'll stand my ground and I won't back down   Hey baby there ain't no easy way out  Hey I will stand my ground  And I won't back down  No, I won't back down"" Tom Petty, of course"
HI03IG7,female,39,"On the road again...    I've said this before but running outside is nothing like running on a treadmill. There are the obvious things to deal with like the hills and the rocks, the traffic, the people and the bugs, the weather and the pounding on the very hard pavement. But the things I've missed out on doing all those miles on Lurch too!    The anticipation the first couple of miles going today's route, wondering if I'll maybe get a glimpse of Sam Shepard out working on the fence or checking on his cattle at his writing studio, or maybe just driving away in his pickup truck (no, I'm not a scary stalker fan, I've never asked for an autograph or honked or go out of my way to drive by or anything, just enjoy the occasional accidental glimpse)...     The happy surprise realizing the family with the scary old malamute have moved out of the old farmhouse so I won't be chased by THAT old dog anymore...     The sound of the water rushing in the Kinni at this time of the year and the splash of the occassional trout when I stop on the bridge to stretch...     The croaking of the frogs in the swampy area at the second bridge where the creek runoff is particularly high...    The honking of the pair of geese that are scared off when I run over the third bridge...     Stretching my legs and really being able to  run!  You just can't do that on a treadmill without preplanning and getting the speed just right and everything coordinated just so...    The weather! (yes, I know I mentioned that as a negative, also - you understand, I'm a Wisconsinite and I've been stuck in winter for  months!  It's 85 degrees and SUNNY here today... gorgeous!)...     There is this jingling sound just past the farmhouse where the crabby old dog used to live on the opposite side of the road on a windy day... It sounds like the most beautiful windchimes you can imagine. I believe it is an old barbed wire fence that is now cut apart and rolled up and just hanging there blowing around in the wind. It sounds magical.    The birds!...    I still have to go  how far  to get back home???    Thanks for my new running shoes mom and dad! They are really comfortable. I probably should have broken them in a little slower than taking them straight out and pounding the pavement for 5 miles, but the road was calling me today. It was fun!    Calling all fellow runners (are there some of you lurking?)...  What do you do to break in new running shoes? Especially shoes that are a totally different brand and type than you have ever worn before?  Today's miles: 5.2 Total so far: 489.06 Still to go for goal: 10.94  Going to get the kid from school now. Guess that means I'm finished with the computer for the day. Or until around 11 pm at least."
HI03IG7,female,39,"It is so blustery out there I just can't believe it. The tops of the trees are really whipping around for not having any leaves on them to be caught by the wind. They're talking about a 40 degree day so that should melt some snow. They're also talking about rain changing to snow for tonight, so the warmth won't help clear winter away much should that occur.  The varying temps and sporadic snows have made for some interesting poses in the pink flamingos of late. They look like they are doing a coordinated and synchronized dance out in the woods. It amazes me how some are leaning left and some are leaning right but all look as if they are doing exactly the right thing because they look so coordinated and I feel I should put some music on a speaker and dangle it out the window for them. But I suspect they hear their own music already...  It's time for my favorite candy to be in the stores again... Cadbury mini eggs. Good thing my favorite candy is only available for a small window during the year. I'm blessed that way. Unfortunately, it now comes in a BIG BAG like everything else that America manufactures. How's that for this week's question of the week, a day early... a bit of a no-brainer again since last week's had people thinking too hard. We can alternate like that...    What is/was your favorite candy?   And don't forget to think back to all those candies that are no longer available that you use to race to the corner store with your nickles as a kid on allowance day (back then I was partial to candy cigarettes - how politically incorrect those have become - and candy lipsticks with that red dye that caused cancer).   Okay. I'm going to run around and clean house for a while now because it needs it. Then I'm going to hop on Lurch if there is still time before getting Kel from school (told you it needed it). Then we might be off to a movie. I'd like to accomplish some writing time and a cup of tea or two at some point, too. Hope you all have a great day.   Run results...   Today's run:  3.06  Total so far: 303.18  Still to go for goal:  196.82  Didn't get to update last night with the miles because I fell asleep before Kel got off the computer, so there you go!

HI03IG7,female,39,"Blogger has made so many changes! It looked totally different when I signed in this morning to make my updates and I didn't even recognize it. I still don't recognize my own blog. This is practically too much to bear!  The weekend was so gorgeous! I got lots more done in my foundation plantings. I don't have to plant them, they just needed some serious work because I haven't done much to them for the past couple of years so they kind of took over the place. Right now as I gaze out the windows of the office, there is quite an amazing bunch of color out there. The crab apple is bursting with white blossoms, the pink flamingos are in parade up the yard, the rose breasted grosbeaks have returned and are gathering on the feeders, there is a male cardinal on the ground beneath the feeders, there are two male indigo buntings - stunning in their indigoness (word???) in the incredibly green grass, the blossoms of the azaleas that weren't beaten off in the storms last night are so close in color to the flamingos that it's funny. The barberry add a nice deep dimension to the colors. And the bright yellow of the millions off dandelions that sprang up overnight pop out quite nicely giving the whole thing a star-dappled backdrop effect. Wish you could see it! But you can't. Because I can't post a photo.   Today I'm going to be running for survivor Nancy Lindstrom. This is my writing buddy, traveling buddy, Instant-Messaging buddy Marge's dear friend. This is what Marge has to say about her...    I have a Survivor friend I would like to request a dedication for ...

HI03IG7,female,39,"I can tell on this day before Thanksgiving that as the holidays approach, they are going to be some tough days for getting on that treadmill. I mean, here it is the day  before  Thanksgiving and it is 4 pm and I'm struggling to get on the monster.   Also, the holidays are going to mean that my cheerleaders are busy with their own lives and not hanging out on their computers just waiting for me to need their assistance... So here I go. Just letting you know that it's a tough day. But I'm going. Right now. And I sure am glad I've got Barb to run for. This one's for you, Barb... I'll be back."

But onto the articles...two articles currently active. They are:   1. Random Thoughts, Collection 1 2. You know when you've played too much C'n'C   Cheers to Jamie for the second one :). Now, down to discussion as to whether the things on Jamie's katana action thriller (j/k) are eggs or blobs. IMHO, eggs generally do not go around decapitating, dismembering and disembowling (my 3Ds) each other, unless they're in flash movies...on the other hand, blobs IMO don't have a regular shape, they resemble the things which inhabitate the bottom of a cesspit. So let's all just say that those 3D-ers are blobby eggs.   ~Tull,   Black Ghost Studios staff"

Everyone that worked there was younger than me, seriously.  ( i'm 17 )  They were the slowest Taco Bell I have ever seen.  It was increadible how long it took them to prepare a mear two soft-taco plus hard-taco for this one lady.  Ginger  hates  Taco Bell.  She took ""special"" medicine before we went.

It is so beautiful that I want to deflower it.  I could walk there if I wasn't a recovering BigMac junkie or if I liked to walk!   I decided the other day when I was on a ride out to R. Pickles parent's (the cucumbers) for a bbq that I really don't like walks.  I'd rather stay in a relatively smaller area and jump around preferably with a ball.  I have to have a purpose to my leg motion. ""Let's go for a walk."" ""Nope, let's do something useful."" -I beat MaxPayne 2 last night.  I like running my proper nouns together.

Luftextarasmiles and a 25% (50+25+25=100) chance that I was taking sugar or not sugar.  I won't know for a couple of years until the study is over. But anyways I feel much better and yes I will have that burger. Tomorrow I start Prozac.   Also, tomorrow I go see David Bowie and Polyphonic Spree.  Personally.

""Tipple crackers."" What was that about?  So ... the girl person of the lovely couple (who really needs a much shorter name so now she's Jill, which she really isn't) Jill's dad got sick and she had to go visit him in Atlanta.  So, I get to go to see Bowie in her place with Jack (who played frisbee golf with me on Sunday and who I actually outdrove and, i said it (or am about to (parantheses)), outplayed on a few holes). So, Bowie tomorrow night. Tonight? Kill Bill Vol. 1, dorks.  And Costco hot dogs, dorks. And redheaded kisses, dorks. And leftover girly Smirnoff drinks, dorks. But now? It's time for ""More Shit Brent Found"". Here is one more of my writing examples that I found when I moved.  This is from creative writing and a bit more structured and punctured. It's a ""Finish the story after Big Teacher Worked at Pizza Place finishes prompt"". The set up was this: It's Halloween (this was written in the same year, and more than likely on the same day, of the Career Math Halloween entry ... ""shovel in head"") and this girl is driving home from a party.  She is all alone and she stops on a bridge.  The bridge is supposed to be haunted.  She does not like this situation.  She starts to strip.  She is super super stacked.  She whispers, ""Brent, show me the triumph.""  I whisper, ""Does that mean  ....  Back to reality.  The night is dark and the bridge is dark and she reaches in her back seat for her flashlight when all of a sudden she feels a man's head.  He he. (my story starts now) THE TRAGIC ODYSSEY OF A HEAD ON HALLOWEEN ""Hmmm there shouldn't be a head (he he) in my back seat (he he).""  Carolyn thought. She was right.  Her car did come with many options; air conditioning, AM/FM radio, cruise control, but most deffinitely not leathery, bald heads. ""Gasp,"" she gasped.  (""Brent, good writers don't do this."" ""Yeah, well, good writers don't pee on your face."") Suddenly the head spoke.  Its voice was a raspy voice one that sounded like sandpaper against concrete. ""Gack dat ackgah,"" said the head. ""Here use some of this,"" said Carolyn pulling some throat spray from her bag. ""Dack mak ugk,"" gagged the head. (I should have written ""dackmakugked the head""). ""Oh yeah, no arms, just a head,"" observed Carolyn. ""Here let me bring you up front so I can spray it in your throat."" So Carolyn picked the head up and plopped it on the passenger's side seat. ""Say 'ahhh',"" said Carolyn. ""Aggkahk,"" said the head. She sprayed the head's throat.  He smiled. Carolyn liked his smile.  ""Mature,"" she thought. ""Hey thanks, babe,"" said the head. ""Did you call me babe?"" asked Carolyn, astonished. ""Sure enough, sweet thing,"" replied the head. Carolyn was shocked, she couldn't believe it.  She couldn't get a man even if he was just a balding decapitated head.  So she leaned over and opened the passenger side door and pushed the head out. ""All men are scum, even dead ones,"" she said. Now the head had been through a lot in his day but it doesn't matter if you were made part of the undead yesterday or last century, it still hurts to be shoved out of a Rambler going 60 miles per hour (which was stopped before, Brent). However, my future self is a picky ass, and as the head hit the pavement it bounced 15 ft. in the air!  This caused the head to fall over the bridge and land safely in the river below. ""Thank goodness all that gel I use solidified into a hard rubbery substance on my scalping,"" said the head, ""I may be bald, but I still know that gel is important."" Well, it doesn't take the decapitated head of a rocket scientist to realize that heads sink in the water.  The head had to think fast.  Suddenly he remembered. (Here's a good question/lesson for aspiring young writers: when you realize that you have created an impossible situation for your character that doesn't even allow for much of a story do you  a.)rethink your entire piece b.) brain storm with fellow writers.  Your peers are your best resource. c.) come up with this ridiculous idea) ""I'll use my outboard motor,"" he exclaimed. He'd almost forgotten about his signing bonus from the Dark Lord from when he joined the ranks of the undead.  So he yanked on the cord (how) with his teeth and the engine started instantly. ""Purring like a kitten,"" said the head. Well, the head had a grand time skimming across the surface of that lake.  He only wished he had some skis he could strap on (he he) to his chin. But once again there was trouble.  How does a decapitated head reach the choke button and thus cut off the engine? (?)  He doesn't (well played, past me). So the head had no choice but to try and jump the shore and land in some leaves.  Well, he cleared the shore all right, but he didn't land in leaves.  He landed in a bag of Halloween candy of a tot passing by. ""Hey, Ma, somethin' done landed in my bag,"" said the little inbred. ""Well, what it be?"" asked the mother. Gazing in the bag the child replied ""A head."" ""Well, I be ... is it one of them heads of the undead that have been going around?"" asked the mother. ""Yes,"" the child replied, ""and he has an outboard motor attached to him."" ""Hooey,"" hooed the mother.  ""Mug him and take the motor."" ""Sure, Ma,"" said the boy. So the little child proceded to beat the head with a stick. ""Hey, I'm just a head,"" said the head. ""You could just take the motor."" ""Shut up, devil head,"" said the boy, delivering a rather vicious blow. The last thing the head thought before he passed out was ... H A P P Y     H A L L O W E E N  Well, dorks, it's time to go do things and stuff.  Remember when things aren't working out as planned have someone get beaten with a stick.  It will draw attention from your problems and quite possibly land you a motor."
T7N1P53,male,24,"Fucking Friday, bro. Dorks, I am full of spirits.  I'm talking 'bout the angel tickles kind, not the Jack Daniels.  This new diet is kicking ass.  I feel my compounded-frat-boy-beer/LSD gut dropping off.  Although, last night the lovely couple and I went out for hamburgers and french fries.  I'm allowed one naughty food day a week.  I cut it down to just one bad meal for the first week.  Now I'm back on the protein kick. Shit, that last sentence reminded me it was time to eat and I just dropped a peanut into my keyboard it's stuck under the 11111 key.  Fuck it, it's not really MY keayboard. Yesterday I had coffee with one of the sports guys from the Seattle P.I. (the only newspaper with a mustache and a Ferrari 308).  It was a nice coffee as such ... We discussed pro sports versus college sports, LeBron James, journalism and the rigors of being a sports stringer.  It being the middle of high school basketball season and since I have a fulltime job that doesn't let me (I just got the peanut out!) get out until 4:30 I won't be able to start working with them for about another month.  Then it looks like I'll be covering baseball games or track.  Either would be fun. After that I headed back to work and then out for burgers, which was followed by a 2 mile walk with the L.C. and their dogs.  It was fun and wet, as are most good things in life. Tonight with the R.G. I have a well-earned steak dinner, which will probably be followed by ""Family Guy"" episodes and a box of wine.  I'm so European.  Smirksome. Tomorrow is the big mini golf rematch between me and my lovetickles.  A few months ago I, trying to be a nice guy, let her win.  Only I wasn't anywhere smooth about it.  On the final hole instead of easily missing and making it look real I reared back and hit it as hard as I could. ""Oops."" I forgot I wasn't dating that kid from ""Life Goes On"".  I'm talking about the retarded one, not the girl who wore glasses. So, there's that tomorrow (lay money on me) and then the cruise and Shins concert on Sunday.  My, The Shins on Sunday. I wish the time would hurry up.   Speaking of which, does that new Ashton Kutcher movie look like it was made by 14-year-olds?  Not tempting at all.  It has that big fat kid in it who couldn't see the sailboat in ""Mallrats"" (Kevin Smith isn't original and has hepatitis).  I can't stand that guy.  Every movie he's in he plays this big tough guy when in real life he'd be too fat to hit me.  I'm more scared of the kid who played Goldberg in ""The Mighty Ducks"" than this clown.  Man, if I saw that guy I'd totally switchblade him and his precious Goth hair and ""Der, I need a sandwich 'cause I'm a meany"" attitude.  Dammit, I hate fatties and Goths.  Football.  Monster trucks.  Midwest culture.  Closed mind.   Whew, where'd I go there for a second?  Back to ultra-hip land ...  Yeah, so the guy's kind of a joke if you ask me.  Hip recovery. On that note, have a great weekend, Dork Johnsons.  Let's all of us get laid."
T7N1P53,male,24,"urlLink    My weekend? Oh, dorks, this! I, for being America's Boyfriend, received a robotic dinosaur as a gift from R. Tops. And THEN we were endowed with the honor of watching a friend's kitten! What happens next? You should know! When R. Girl slips out of the bedroom for a second, it's Kitten Robo Dino Wars 2004!"
T7N1P53,male,24,"Did anyone else notice how quickly the major news outlets dropped the ""9/11 Commission Finds No Iraq/Al Queda Link"" story?  Don't you think it deserves a little more attention than whether or not Reagan's face should be on the million dollar bill? I grow tired of lies and 9/11, dorks.  Three years of  urlLink fear  is enough.  ""They could have  urlLink 9/11ed the Space Needle !""  Are we really going to let paralell universes scare us now? They didn't fly a plane into Safeco Field, get over it.  Did the Mariners win? No? Shit. Witness the  urlLink the greatest photo   ever taken by man or beast. Hahahaha, dorks, now that's something to get excited about.  P.S. I forgot to tell you, dorks!  I saw a hobo woman in Seattle's U District on Sunday with a sign that read ""Homeless mother yah, blah, rarrgh!"" only the ""r"" was turned around like in a  urlLink Toys 'R' Us  sign. Why?  It's not even that cute when a kid does it, or actually when someone trying to show that someone is young so they reverse the R ... because everyone knows the ""Correct Positioning of the Letter R"" lobe of the brain doesn't develop until puberty. Back to my observation of the woman. No? A song? Yes!  I don't want a real job. I'll just beg for your change. And when I vomit on the street don't look at me strange. From crack to smack to Jumbo Jacks I really need to score some I don't want a real job 'Cause if I had one I couldn't be a  urlLink Hobo  Mom!"
T7N1P53,male,24,"Hey, hey, babydorks.  This has been a great weekend. Were any of you ever in junior high?  Did you ever have that Friday night were your mom dropped you and a girl off at the movies and tossed you a couple extra bucks to get some popcorn.  The movie was ""Tommy Boy"" or some Sandler/Farley/Segal epic.  You had your popcorn you laughed and you stole a few kisses.  After all of that you dropped the girl off (just a few precious but compromising feet away from your mom's Aerostar) and stole one last kiss. That was my weekend, you sweet and lovely dorks. Me and R. Girl had that one defining moment in a relationship.  That one moment isn't a second, that one moment isn't even a minute.  Nobody has ever defined how long a moment can last.  And, if Webster is reading, a moment can last a few days. We had pictures devolped today from our past few weeks together.  I really liked the one of us on top of the troll statue (read back for more info) and asked for doubles. This is a defining moment in a relationship, because.... ""I want to put this picture in a frame ... is that O.K."" ""Yes it is, why wouldn't it be?"" ""Because it's the ""Frame Stage"" are we ready to go to that stage yet?"" ""Yes, let's go to that stage."" On Friday I score some very potent and very west coast weed.  I haven't done drugs in months.  But when someone hands you a shitface fuckload of potent, grown in grandpa's back yard weed, you don't say ""No thanks"".   You say ""Who's got brownie mix?"" So, upon advice, I poured a quoted ""5 months worth"" of very potent grass into a batter of brownies. Let bake for 25 minutes. Become so shitfaced that .... ""Where do you hide it all""  ""How about in your neck, shit look at that fucker"" ""Did I have legs"" ""Are there hills?  Help me with the hills."" ""Did you want the chair? A chair?  Did you want to find the chair?""  ""What the hell are you talking about"" You wake up at 6 in the fucking afternoon the next day!  6:00 p.m.?  What the hell do you do then?  Drink beer and rent movies, that's what. So, today I was more productive.  Me and my sweet, sweet baby went and spent our weekly day downtown.  We had a great day of window shopping and gyros.   An old woman with a camera set up this situation for me. Old woman:  Do you want your picture taken? Me: Yes.  What? Old woman:  Do you want your picture taken?  Do you want the camera, you can have it. Me: Yes, I want the camera. Old woman: Five dollars. Me: No way, I thought you were giving it away because you are high. (Walk on for a moment) British guy: Are you guys not from around here? (This guy is acutally sipping from a STARBUCKS cup ... only 400 yards from where Starbucks first opened.  Very Seattle.) Me and R. Girl: Yes, we are. British guy:  Well, you aught to be careful.  That's one of the oldest Seattle scams in the book. (This guy walked near us for 5 minutes without talking.  I know he wanted us to ask him more questions about how to avoid Seattle's downfalls, but I didn't care ... he made me feel like a tourist asshole enough anyways). What scam? Oh here's a camera for 5 dollars!  Fooled you, it's only worth 4.50!   A scam!  Like I'm dumb enough to let some old crack sucking camera whore run off with my money? ""Oh, it's a Sony?  Well, here's my debit card, go shopping with this.  What? My social security number?  Sure, you DO have a camera."" So, it was a good day except for British asshole ruining my good natured ribbing of the local crack heads.   Oh and there is the haircut I got on Friday at misogynist barbers. Short and sweet. ""You know what I do with a first date? I tie them up and beat them.  No, wait, how did that comic say it?  I tie them up and drag them by the hair and then I beat them unconcious.  No, it wasn't ""unconcious"" ... I think it was ""senseless""."" So, needless to say, I came out of that place with a MOTHER FUCKING G.I. JOE, MARINE, HAIL TO THE CHIEF, HAND ME A GUN AND WATCH ME SHOOT UP A SCHOOL haircut that is so fucking short that I feel naked without a hat. Ahhhh, at least I have a sweety.  She jokes and tells me she likes it while others go ""Goddamn, did you fuck a weedwhacker?"" I need a new hat, dorks."
T7N1P53,male,24,"Two highlights from my drunken Seattle-to-Raleigh conversation with Kurtis ""Baby Got"" Backs, the best drinking buddy I've ever known.  Highlight #1!  Me: So, you read my blog, is it good?    Kurtis: Yeah, I have to say I laugh pretty often, except when you tend to over-politicize.  Me: What do you mean?   Kurtis: I mean I can't believe you like Michael Moore.  Me: I never said I like Michael Moore.  I think that it's important that he's putting out a message that the average American public has not heard before.  Kurtis: I guess.  Me: It's like Jesus.  Did you know Jesus never washed his hands after using the bathroom?  He'd be like ""I need to pee."" Then just say ""Hey, let's break bread.""  People still liked him.   It's not the man, it's the message.   Highlight #2!  Me: Yeah, so I told R. Girl that when I die that I want my tombstone to say: Brent Kinkade Son. Brother. Husband. Father. Zombie?  Kurtis: Good one.  Me: Do you think it should have a question mark after ""Zombie"" or should it be a period?  Kurtis: How about some elipses?  Like, ""To be continued"".  Me: Perfect!  It's like I could come back as the Zombie King!  P.S., dorks, as much as I think Pete Yorn and The Smiths' ""Panic"" kick ass seperately ... together they suck harder than a whore. Also, on Hwy-167 last weekend I saw a redneck driving a truck with a witty Calvin-peeing-on-something bumper sticker. What was it? ""City boys"" The redneck was peeing on city boys.  The irony is ... you have to usually find a city boy to find someone into that."

T7N1P53,male,24,"Wednesday to you, dorks.   It's quiet in the halls of the place that gives me money for porn.  Maybe the soccer moms are planning an attack.   Battlestations! A lady stopped me in the hall today, ""Just so you know, my 22-year-old daughter fell off my scooter."" ""Oh yeah?  I once rode a bike off of a cliff and smacked my nuts on the handle bar when I landed.  So, who wins the stupid story contest, lady?"" Actually, I just filed her babble-dabble under ""Useless Stranger/Daughter Scooter Related Injuries"" in my brain and went on my way. Not much of words back from place me want work.  Send e-smokesignals today as requested by chief, short word back thanking for pow-wow.  Not respond again, young brave not want seem pushy.  Brent, did you yell at a foreign person or a retarded person last night? Both.   I went to buy some beers at a gas station. This chick in front of me accidently dropped a bottle of girly smirnoff drink.   ""I will pay for it,"" she said. ""What happens, man?"" said the unruly store clerk. Mumble, grumble, bumble (stopped paying attention for a few seconds because I noticed even NEWER flavors of Doritos!) Then... ""You don't have to call me stupid!"" said the girl. ""What happens, man?""said clerk ass again. ""Your boyfriend got the gas, outside the pump, go him,"" said retard. Girl walks out followed by clerk and jerk.  They seem to all have a little talk in the parking lot.   When they come back in I decide that the place is too weird and put the beer back.   ""Sir, I help you!"" ""You guys are weird, I'm leaving."" So, I get to the car and R. Waiting asks me ""What the hell was going on in there?"" I explain, she tells me that the guys were yelling at the girl in the parking lot while her boyfriend just sat there. ""Hmmm,"" I thought, ""I must really have been into those Doritos, because I missed all of that."" Then I said, ""Not while Batman is around!"" ""What?"" said R. Huh. So, I marched back into the store and looked the clerk right in the eyes. ""It's rude to yell at women,"" I let him know. Then I looked at old redneck retard. ""Rude!"" Then I left.  I am America's Boyfriend. Later, dorks, it's time for naps!"
T7N1P53,male,24,"I write no blog this week.  You know.  I know.  Hulk smash. I could not wake up today ... but boy-oh-boy I could wake up yesterday.  Because .... R.

Even if it wasn't my birthday yesterday it sure was  great way to wake up.  I wish stuff like this would happen more often. Typical jerk sales clerk: Thanks for buying socks, Happy Anniversary. This reminds me that I used to have (when I had my own bathroom during college) a piece of paper torn out from a magazine that just said ""Christmas"" over my mirror.  I think the same principle is at work here. So, guess what I do this weekend, dorks.  Hulk guess. I'm putting my security deposit down on an apartment that R. Cupcakes and I finally decided on.  It's damned near official, dorks.   Hulk nervous.  Hulk never live with girl before.  Well, Hulk live with girl roommates.  Hulk know isn't same thing.  When girl roommates have girl boo-boos Hulk say ""Drink, hush"" and girl roommates go to boyfriend.   Hulk sure Hulk be fine.  Hulk like redhead girl.

Shut up and suck Dr. Phil's cock, Oblivious Boy, he's near climax ... And isn't that a good point.) - The march of the anti-gay bootstraps. - The anti-science ""But ma baby's imbilical cord should be placed in a holy trash receptacle 'stead of being used to help the cripple boy walk"" and ""T'aint never been no water on Mars"" ... Oh, the Mars thing!  Why are people scared of water on Mars?  Why?  I know!  I know!  Dammit, dorks, I know!  If there was water on Mars then maybe there could have been LIFE on Mars!  And if there was life on Mars than what does that say for the creationists, the Baptists ... your God, What does that say for the entire South?  If God didn't just make life on Earth than maybe he didn't make just Adam and Eve, maybe he did make Adam and Steve (Arrrrrrrgggghhhh, the anger from this phrase makes me want to run my truck over a panda), maybe Moses didn't part the Red Sea, maybe Jesus could fly (awesome), maybe Cain and Abel were cyborgs sent back to decide the future of mankind (Cain: Step away from Eve.  Abel: Never Cain 5000!  You may have the shotgun but I've got the dynamite!) ... Maybe an Army of gay men and women and people who don't want to see the new Mel Gibson movie and people who don't feel they need a gun to gain an erection or that we shouldn't hit Hindus and that a pious bastard is worse than one who commits adultery, maybe this army will rise up from under the grip of ""God's Army"" and say unto those who are left open mouthed and jaws in their limp pants licking and eyes bulged out BECAUSE they have witnessed that man can be strong and glorious without a God and they will see this new race of men powered by the knowledge of Mars life and ask onto they ""But what can I believe in now that my superstitous beliefs have gone"" and the new man will say ""Lo, but believe in thy self""  and old man will say ""But I suck and I'm scared"" and new man will smile and say ""You've got some Dr. Phil juice on your lip."" -Um, where to go from there? The Oscars were pretty good ... Oh yeah!  Why does every critic keep saying ""The Bored of the Rings"" ""I'm so bored by it, Oh it was so boring, Bored""  ... Harry Potter rim an atheist,  what's wrong with these people?  ""Oh, I have to pay attention for more than a minute and there's no Hillary Duff?  Boring.""  and ... ""Lost in Translation was boring, so boring, nothing happened, it was boring.""  No it was different not boring and don't worry too much some new 'Lion King' sequel will be out soon enough for you.  ""He, he, that ol' warthog pooted"". Now put your lips back on Dr. Phil he's randy again. - And Haiti!  I'm not going to act like I'm I know anything more than Haiti except that I do not want to go there ever, but I'm not an idiot. Stupid president in the news: ""Maybe Aristide should step down."" (Cut to the next day: Aristide ""leaves"" for Africa.) Aristide: ""I was forced to leave at gunpoint by the Bush machine."" Bush machine: ""Naw, come on, America, the silly black man is lying to you.  We just happened to send 50 Marines to the country a few days before he left.  50 Marines seems like quite a small number to make any difference in a chaotic country doesn't it? But, it seems like more than enough to get one guy out doesn't it? Don't worry though because ...."" - Something like 180 people died in Iraq yesterday because of sucide bombers.  You don't know 180 people.  Can you wrap your head around that?  Everyone you know could have died in Iraq yesterday.  And now they're saying the guy that's heading up all of these suicide bombings and gureilla tactics in Iraq was within our reach when we first entered the country.  But, no, we had to focus on getting Sadam.  That's right, because that hole he was governing had to be liberated.  180 people died yesterday so Bush could make Daddy happy.  180 people.  Everyone you know.  Prior knowledge once again ignored.   JOKE TIME! How can you spot an elephant on the moon? He's the one with the big ""E"" on his space suit. And.... (here's a joke I made up while I was making a no-bake cheescake the other day) Me: Hey, what do you call a chicken who hits its young? R. Stumped: What? Me: An egg beater. And on another positive note ... naw, we'll save that one for later.  But until then, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DORKS!"

DKR8SCA,female,24,"Hi everyone. Thanks for stopping in to my blog. It's a gorgeous Saturday in Southern California. Today was a big day for me as Cavie got her eye fixed. As stated earlier in the blog, I was in a car accident and a mean vicious girl hit Cavie and caused the headlight and blinker to come out. The blinker was destroyed but the headlight wasn't. Either way there was a big gaping hole where the headlight panel use to be. Today I went to the wonderful people at Carsmetics in Costa Mesa, California and had them repair the light. It looks so much better and it didn't do a whole lot of damage to my wallet either. I am so happy to have Cavie back as a whole and now all I need to do is get some rubbing compound and work out some of the black paint on my car and get those tiny dents taken out. It's not a huge deal so I am just happy because it could have been so much worse.  Later in the afternoon I got to hang out with my best guy friend in the world, which we all know is JOEL! We had a good time just going to Home Depot and having lunch together. In case you wondering why Home Depot, there are two things in my house that need repaired in my downstairs abode and Joel is fixing them for me. I have a closet door that the track is broken and I need a new medicine cabinet. Either way, those are the things that need done and Joel is such a good friend to want to help me. We went to price supplies at Home Depot and I totally loved it. That is a great store ladies. If you have never been in there, it really isn't that bad. I have found that I really like hardware stores now and auto parts stores. I really like the idea of fixing things myself and/or watching Joel fix them (wink wink) Either way, It was a fun time at the Home Depot. We went and had some subway for lunch and I had this salad that was really good but it took me an hour after eating it to realize that they forgot my chicken! I was pretty astounded that I paid $5.29 for some greens. Oh well, move on Erica!  It was amazing because this morning I got on the scale and I was 4 lbs lighter. I don't know if that is particularly healthy or not but I am so stoked about being 224 lbs now and not 336 so I am ok with it. I am hoping for a 2 lb weight loss each week so that was huge for me. I covered 2 weeks in one. I know that won't happen very often so I am kinda marinating in it today. Overall, doing really well with the weight loss and dreaming of being in a bikini when I am done. Don't worry all, you'll see because I will wear it to the grocery store, in the snow, etc... Just kidding  My night was pretty uneventful except for I met a new interesting person. I am meeting some really great people lately and God is defintely opening doors for me to understand my strengths. I am just being patient for his perfect timing and perfect people to come into my life. By perfect, I don't mean flawless...I mean right for me. Anyway, a big thanks to Joel for a great day with him and a big thanks to everyone who is praying. Still looking for a second job so keep the prayers going. Have a beautiful day all and ~Shalom~"
DKR8SCA,female,24,"Hi everyone. How is everyone doing this fine Tuesday. I am hoping this finds you all doing well and healthy. My day was absolutely the busiest I have seen in weeks. Today we went to kidnap the R.A.'s for breakfast for floor moms/sisters. We had a great time and our R.A. is super nice and very organized. I like her a lot. It looks like it's going to be a fun first year in Floor Moms for me. We have a lot of fun stuff planned and I am looking forward to it. Later in the day I worked and had lunch at Heather's house with the library girls. We had a great time chowing down on salad and pizza and of course chatting about things that aren't appropriate. It was a great time.  Overall I worked all day and took a mid day nap and that's about all that happened. Oh well, I guess it was a boring day for me but either way, a good one!  Love you all and ~Shalom~"
DKR8SCA,female,24,"Yesterday I did pretty well on everything even though it was a very busy day. I literally ran all day with things to do. I got some pictures taken and so I was in Long Beach and then at work and my day didn't stop!

DKR8SCA,female,24,"Happy Sunday everyone. I am happy to report I actually did work out last night. I came home from work and started dinner while I cleaned up things in the house. I ran 2 loads of dishes, 3 loads of laundry, and cleaned up minor things in my room. After dinner I did the Walk the Walk --firming walk. This video includes a little cardio to get you pumped and then goes into toning. It works your arms with weights, it works your legs (inner and outer thigh both) and then it also works your trunk or ab area. It's quite a workout and I can sorta feel it today. I am hoping that Heather and I will find some way to incorporate exercise into our two days together although she doesn't need any. I am going to work out after dinner tonight before heading off for Nor. Cal because Joel and I will be in the car for several hours and I don't want to not use any energy. Keep me in prayer as I am travelling and need some exercise while I am gone. If I don't get the opportunity to post up there, I will do it when I get back for the days I am there. I will keep good records. This blog is helping me to stay accountable. I want to record that I exercised so it makes me get motivated. Have a great day everyone and ~Shalom~"
DKR8SCA,female,24,"Yesterday was a first day on my quest to lose the rest of this crazy weight! I am so tired of it. I am going to start posting my food intake and exercise for each day so I can log what I am doing with myself. I will always be one day behind since most days I will blog before dinner. I will be weighing in each Saturday and posting on Sunday or the next blog time! I can't wait to get this done!

I am nervous that I am going to be chillin at home with myself for my birthday. I sure hope not friends! :)  Today I met an interesting boy. Have you ever met someone and thought ""could they honestly have this much in common with me?"" There is this guy. We'll call him Mike because that is his name.  ha ha. He is a psych major @ Northridge, drives a new Honda Civic (fast), thinks that ""big"" girls can be sexy, (Hallelujah) and has pierced nipples. I know that last part threw some of you off but oh well. Let's be honest, I am interested!  Oh well, I'll keep you all posted on the happenings for my birthday and on from there. Overall things are about the same. Working on getting things caught up and losing weight. I guess that's about it. My birthday is on Monday so that's exciting. I also get to spend Tuesday and Wednesday with Chris so I am looking forward to that. Anyway, I'll write tomorrow as I don't have much to say. Have a great day everyone and ~Shalom~"
DKR8SCA,female,24,I have been so bad lately about exercise. I had such a busy day yesterday with work at the library and Chris that I seriously didn't want to exercise when the day was over. I have to get back on the ball so say a prayer if you think about it. Have a great day everyone and ~shalom~
DKR8SCA,female,24,I am seriously a deviant. I decided last night to do NOTHING in the realm of exercise which is no good. I was supposed to do a cardio workout which would have been good for me but I was bad and didn't do it. Let's hope I get my butt in gear tonight and get crackin on working out because I have to make goal next week. The pounds are coming off people...I made goal this week so I am not quitting here. Please pray I get myself in gear! Thanks and ~Shalom~
DKR8SCA,female,24,"Happy Birthday to me! I am 24 today people and getting closer and closer to my goal weight. This is indeed a happy birthday. Here is my food/exercise log for yesterday (August 8, 2004)  Breakfast:  1/2 whole wheat bagel w/ low fat cream cheese 1 one a day weight smart 1 iced water  Lunch:  nothing  Dinner:  2 oz turkey smoked sausage 1/2 cup baked beans 1/2 grapefruit 1 iced water  Snacks:  1/2 cup chocolate chips  Exercise:  I was totally lazy last night and did not exercise except for I took a little walk while I was on the phone!  Have a great day everyone and HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!"
DKR8SCA,female,24,"Hi everyone. I would love to say that this post will be more fun and happy but seriously, I have had a horrible day already. I had a very big trauma happen on Saturday that has spilled over into the weekend and today. I have been fighting this problem and will still be through tomorrow. Do you ever just wonder ""when will it end?"" I am wondering that on a moment to moment basis right now. I am seriously overwhelmed.   A week or so ago I had a very hard time physically and since then I have really been trying to take care of myself in the physical health aspect. These last couple of days it has become apparent why I needed to do that. I mean, had I let my health go, this could have killed me. There have been moments in the last couple days where I have thought my head might fall off from stress. I don't know if there is an actual ailment where your head falls off from stress but I am pretty sure if it can happen, it will to me. I really am not a pessimistic person but this life...could make me one!  I wish I could go into what's been happening in my life but I would rather not publish it on the internet. If you are that curious, give me a call and we'll talk. There are just some serious crisis matters plaguing my life right now. I would love to just let it go but there are things humanly that have to be done. I am trying very hard to surrender all of my fears, worries, heartache, and stress to God and that's all I can do right now.  I am still healthy and taken care of so God is still on the throne. No matter what happens I just want to make sure and give him my praise and adoration as He truly deserves it. I hope this post lets you all know that things will be ok but I am in deep need of your prayers for stress release and provision. Thanks all and ~Shalom~"
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"To the list of war opponents who, before the war, believed Saddam had WMD. Or at least they wrote as though they believed it. With some of these folks, it's difficult to tell anymore if they mean what they say. From an  urlLink  L.A. Times Op-Ed   piece by Joseph C. Wilson, Feb. 6, 2003:    There is now no incentive for Hussein to comply with the inspectors or to refrain from using weapons of mass destruction to defend himself if the United States comes after him.  And he will use them; we should be under no illusion about that."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"It a post, I wrote that the ""9/11 hijackers spent their last nights in strip clubs and booze halls."" Someone asked if I could verify this. I did a quick check, and discovered that the report is that the ones who lived in Florida spent their last week there hanging out in a topless bar. I don't know if that forms any part of any of the official reports on the hijackers."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"Christopher Hitchens invites himself to join the week's fad:  urlLink  war supporters expressing varying degrees of remorse or redefining their expectations about Iraq.    (Notice, of course, that the anti-war voices rarely seem troubled by this need to keep feet planted on some sort of moral and intellectual terra firma from one hour to the next.)  Hitch searches his soul and finds:   The thing that I most underestimated is the thing that least undermines the case. And it's not something that I overlooked, either. But the extent of lumpen Islamization in Iraq, on both the Khomeinist and Wahhabi ends (call them Shiite and Sunni if you want a euphemism that insults the majority), was worse than I had guessed.   And this is also why I partly think that Colin Powell, as reported by Woodward, was right. He apparently asked the president if he was willing to assume, or to accept, responsibility for the Iraqi state and society. The only possible answer, morally and politically, would have been ""yes."" The United States had already made itself co-responsible for Iraqi life, first by imposing the sanctions, second by imposing the no-fly zones, and third by co-existing with the regime. (Three more factors, by the way, that make the Vietnam comparison utterly meaningless.) This half-slave/half-free compromise could not long have endured."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"Pundits, prophets, and political hacks are tearing through  urlLink  the 9/11 Commission Report,   hoping to fetch up a weapon handy to beat the other side. But the big picture? After all that talk and anguish and tawdriness, nothing new. The whole country got whacked that sunny morning almost three years ago. We all stared at the pictures and the video footage, disbelieving, stunned. Nobody expected it.  OK, I'm not supposed to expect it, and neither are you. But what about the men and women in power? The report doesn't change the answer: Nobody expected it. And after the report, all sorts of recommendations for how to change Congress, the spy agencies, and the entire structure of government, start to percolate. They'll be dead by Election Day.  Because this is our choice: do we want to live in a country where spies are limited, government keeps its hands off its citizens, and people practice their freedoms uninhibited? Or do we want a government that is ruthlessy efficient at spying, anticipating trouble, and keeping track of every detail that might someday connect to something else?  We've looked at that choice and turned away. Invade Afghanistan, attack Iraq. Argue about peace and oil. Change one party for another. Those things we can do, they can drown out the bigger questions.  How can we engage in a generation-long struggle againt an amorphous, stateless, potent, rich enemy that takes the form of a branch of one of the world's great religion, without fundamentally changing the nature of our government and national culture, without becoming a different nation than what we are? Look what the Civil War did to us in four years.  This bit of the report, detailing events of 1998, is nothing new, either, in principle.    On December 20, intelligence indicated Bin Ladin would be spending the night at the Haji Habash house, part of the governor's residence in Kandahar. The chief of the Bin Ladin unit, ""Mike,"" told us that he promptly briefed Tenet and his deputy, John Gordon. From the field, the CIA's Gary Schroen advised: ""Hit him tonight -- we may not get another chance."" An urgent teleconference of principals was arranged.   The principals considered a cruise missile strike to try to kill Bin Ladin. One issue they discussed was the potential collateral damage -- the number of innocent bystanders who would be killed or wounded. General Zinni predicted a number well over 200 and was concerned about damage to a nearby mosque .... By the end of the meeting, the principals decided against recommending to the President that he order a strike ....   Some lower-level officials were angry. ""Mike"" reported to Schroen that he had been unable to sleep after this decision. ""I'm sure we'll regret not acting last night,"" he wrote, criticizing the principals for ""worrying that some stray shrapnel might hit the Habash mosque and offend Muslims.""   The principals, he said, were ""obsessed"" with trying to get others -- Saudis, Pakistanis, Afghan tribals -- to ""do what we won't do."" Schroen was disappointed too. ""We should have done it last night,"" he wrote. ""We may well come to regret the decision not to go ahead."" [9-11 Report, page 147-148]   In the cruel math of Realpolitik, trade 200 lives for 3,000? But subtract from your mind, if possible, every image of 9/11, every falling, burning, bleeding body, every tear and gasp of rage. Then kill the same 200 people on the chance -- mere chance -- that this one man might succeed in his plan to wreak devastation on America.  And imagine the reaction in the U.N. General Assembly, in the Middle Eastern mosques, in the German and French press."

1DIH5ZK,male,44,"I'm sorry that John Kerry dropped the idea of a tax on gasoline, because it was one of the best things he's proposed, and we need it. I'd like to see gas cost at least three times as much at the pump as it does now. That would push forward toward a resolution of some of the worst problems the country faces.  It would be more equitable as a tax, because it would fall harder on the rich or those who choose luxuries over practicalities. Nobody made you buy that SUV. Some relief structure would have to be built in for necessary work such as doctors in rural counties, but that could be handled in the tax codes. As things now stand, everyone, frugal or not, pays taxes that subsidize the current (relatively) low price of gas.  It would begin to change America's collective lifestyle for the better. People would walk more, bicycle more. That would help slow the obesity epidemic. It would make inner cities more appealing as places to work and live. That would turn the tide on another frustrating cancer in the nation.  It would encourage car companies to bite the bullet and make more fuel-efficient vehicles. And it would pile on incentives for research into alternate energy sources. If people drive less, pollution levels will subside, and if people use less gasoline, we'll be less inclined to drill for it in fragile environments.  Americans would continue to buy gas, of course, but more of the money we spend on it would go into the government services we need, rather than into the pockets of our false friends the oil sheiks, who use it to fill mosques and madrassahs around the world with West-hating Wahhabist imams.  And if you think you're paying more at the pump than you were 20 years ago, please remember that  urlLink  you're actually paying less."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"A fairly high-ranking official in the Coalition Provisional Authority was a local guy, Don Eberly. After the CPA's mission wound up last month, one of our reporters did an interview with him and wrote up a story. Due perhaps to the newspaper's continuing lack of interest in anything to do with the redevelopment of Iraq, however, the story hasn't run.  Here's a few excerpts: Eberly has been with the CPA since March 2003. He lived in Iraq for nearly four months, overseeing and reconstructing the Ministry of Youth and Sport, one of 24 ministries rebuilt by the authority. After he came back to the States, Eberly worked as the director of social policy, advising senior staff members in Iraq in education, higher education (particularly the universities), health, youth and sport, labor, and social affairs. Now that the authority is officially dissolved, Eberly is putting the finishing touches on the transition of power in Iraq and the coordination of privately donated equipment and supplies from U.S. companies.  ""A lot of what is going on in Iraq now involves a huge amount of oversight and coordination with Washington. There are serious bucks going into Iraq. With the CPA phase-out, we're facing huge demands from Congress for basic reporting. 'How are you doing with education?' 'How are you doing with health?' 'How are you spending our money on contractors and subcontractors?' 'What's the state of reconstruction across dozens and dozens of categories?' ""  Sometimes he runs the pick for Iraqi officials, tackling issues before they become problems.  ""Part of our mission, in fact -- to use football terms -- is to be the defensive line. Because we do what we do, people in Iraq are not bothered every day with calls that come from Congress and the media. We're the front-line representatives.""  Eberly said the now-defunct authority is still moving computers, high technology supplies, health care supplies and equipment, pharmaceuticals and educational supplies to Iraq on behalf of mostly U.S. companies.   ""I just shipped 30,000 medical textbooks about (a month ago).""  ""I do not at all sugarcoat reality in Iraq. I don't see any purpose served in that. We're not serving the people well by being anything less than forthright. The negatives are already well-known. We know about the security challenges. We know about the insurgency. In America, we say location, location, location; in Iraq we say the top three issues are security, security, security.""  ""Yet Iraq does not have a general insurgency like the one U.S. troops faced in Vietnam. If there were a general insurgency, we'd all be in big trouble. The truth is that it is a quite limited insurgency. One that's large enough to do substantial damage on a daily basis, but it is, in fact, quite isolated.""  ""There are vast areas of the country where Iraqis are essentially getting on with their lives. There has been, long before the creation of the CPA, a lot of local Iraqi leadership. They're running the towns and cities and are managing municipal services and organizing town councils. A good bit of the country is actually working relatively normal.""  Bue he said the insurgency has succeeded in opening a rift of ""pervasive fear and mistrust"" between the Iraqi people and U.S. soldiers.  ""It is a very unfortunate side effect and makes doing the job a lot harder. There is a lot of barber-chair concern among Iraqis about things that are going on in Iraq.""  Eberly said there was a bipartisan agreement that regime change should be made in Iraq. Sept. 11 deepened those concerns.  ""Most people standing where the president stood at the moment in time when the final decision had to be made would probably have made the same decision. The weapons of mass destruction issue will remain with us for a long time and I have no idea how it will settle out in history. People have a tendency to forget that Saddam Hussein was himself, in the words of the Iraqi people, a weapon of mass destruction.""  Eberly said, most forecasters are predicting significant progress this year in Iraq's economy. ""This is locally generated economic growth. It should be a pretty solid year. It's hard to see that kind of progress when your television screen is filled with violence and destruction.""  ""One of the interesting questions, I think, that history will ask is, 'Did we handle de-Baathification properly?' You've got to get rid of the people who were sympathizers of the previous regime. And that's where it gets complicated because it's gray. How do I know where your sympathies are, Mr. Senior Baath Party official? What was your role?""  Eberly said there was a blanket policy that the top three levels of the Baath Party government had to go.  ""Then we had a policy inviting officials back on a case-by-case basis. That gets complicated because one of the biggest concerns is, what do you do with the people who had power?""  Many were mere administrators who had committed no crimes. Yet many couldn't be invited into the new administration because their ideologies were in doubt.  ""The minute you relinquish control, they have all the advantages, in a worst-case scenario. They've got connections and can easily take advantage.""  But they couldn't just be left idle. ""You're talking about some very talented people. People who had all the power before and knew all the tricks of the trade when it came to manipulating the political environment to go about achieving what they want.""  The Iraqi army faces a similar problem. ""The question there is, 'Should we invite the previous army back?' Some of them are professional soldiers and will show allegiance to whoever is in power. This kind of soldier is not an ideologue. But if you eliminate a professional soldier and disarm and shame him in front of his family and community, you've got a big problem.""  ""De-Baathification was the toughest part of our jobs as senior advisors. I spent so much time on De-Baathification because any blanket approach was not adequate. It almost had to be case by case. It's like schools of fish in the ocean swimming together. You don't know friend from foe when it comes to political issues. It is impossible to have a high success rate when it comes to hiring back someone who served in a mid-level capacity in Saddam Hussein's government. It's extremely difficult to get that right. You're talking about thousands of people.""  ""De-Baathification was extremely complicated. If you didn't drill down far enough, if you didn't dig deep enough, in terms of removing close ideological ties to the old administration, it would be like replacing Hitler without removing Hitler's Nazi party."""
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"IMAGINE if, on D-Day, the Nazis had been allowed to place camera teams on Omaha Beach — with our suffering soldiers forbidden to interfere. What if, on top of that, the Germans had invented American atrocities against French civilians — and our own officials defended their right to do so in the name of press freedom?   That's the situation with al-Jazeera in Iraq.   Staffed by embittered exiles and pan-Arabist ideologues — the last Nasserites — al-Jazeera is so consumed by hatred of America and the West that the network would rather see Iraq collapse into a bloodbath than permit the emergence of a democracy sponsored by Washington.   Despite his slaughter of a million-and-a-half Muslims in wars and campaigns of repression, al-Jazeera cheered for Saddam during Operation Iraqi Freedom, inventing Iraqi victories. Its staff reacted with horror to the fall of Baghdad — and suppressed film clips of celebrating Arabs.   Since then, al-Jazeera has glamorized Islamic terrorists (who, were they ever to come to power, would close al-Jazeera and butcher its staff) while portraying the Baathist campaign of murder and sabotage as a noble freedom struggle.   Al-Jazeera is so bigoted and morally debased that its reporters and producers delight in Coalition casualties, in dead Iraqi doctors and engineers and (above all) in dead Kurds.   Al-Jazeera not only encourages the assassination of American soldiers, but pulls out all the stops to excite anti-U.S. hatred throughout the Arabic-speaking world.   The response of our own officials in Iraq? Al-Jazeera is only exercising freedom of the press. Isn't that why we fought to bring down Saddam?   This is idiocy, a perverse political correctness based upon a rejection of common sense.    Read the whole glorious thing:  urlLink  Killers with Cameras  , by Ralph Peters of the New York Post."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"A Townhall piece by Dennis Prager, titled  urlLink  ""People are Good; the World Stinks""   (4/20/04). He rants a lot, and comes from a Christian perspective (which I don't), but when he hits it, he hits it:   If you love goodness and hate evil, this is a tough time to stay sane.   Israel has killed Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the Hamas terror leader, and almost every nation in the world and the nations' theoretical embodiment, the United Nations, have condemned Israel for doing so.  World leaders and the world organization have said almost nothing about Communist China's ongoing destruction of one of the world's oldest civilizations, Tibet. World leaders have said almost nothing about the Arab enslavement and genocide of non-Arab blacks in Sudan. But they convene world conferences to label Israel, one of the most humane and decent democracies on earth, a pariah.  In order to retain my sanity, I ask the reader's indulgence as I use this column to express personal thoughts.  I have contempt for ""the world."" I cherish and admire countless individuals, but I have contempt for ""the world"" and ""world opinion."" ""The world"" has never cared about evils inflicted on human beings. The Communist genocides meant nothing to humanity. The Holocaust meant nothing. With almost no exception, the mass atrocities since World War II have likewise absorbed humanity less than the Olympics or the Miss World Contest.  I have contempt for the United Nations. It is one of the great obstacles to goodness and decency on this planet. Its moral record -- outside of a few specialized agencies such as the World Health Organization -- is almost entirely supportive of evil and condemnatory of good. It is dominated by the most morally backward governments in the world -- those from the Arab and Muslim worlds, the Communists during their heyday and African despots. It appointed Libya, a despotic, primitive state, to head its Human Rights Commission, whose members include China, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Neither the United States nor Israel sits on the Commission.  I regard the European Union with similar revulsion. With little opposition, Europe murdered nearly every Jewish man, woman and child in its midst, and a half-century later provides cover for those in the Middle East who seek to do to the Middle East's Jews exactly what the Nazis did to the European Jews. For the European Union to condemn Israel's killing of a Hamas leader, when Hamas's avowed aim is another Jewish genocide, is so loathsome as to board the incredible. For Germany and France (who, unlike America, have almost never shed blood for the liberty of others) to do everything they can to undermine America's attempt to liberate Iraq is similarly repugnant."
1DIH5ZK,male,44,"Wow. The AP actually ran some (mostly) positive news from Iraq last night, and my newspaper actually ran it this morning.    Officials: Rebuilding of Iraq Progresses   Tue May 25, 4:42 PM ET 		  By ANWAR FARUQI, Associated Press Writer   DOHA, Qatar - Oil production and electricity supplies are up in Iraq there are more telephone lines and schools have been renovated, but Iraqi reconstruction is still hobbled by a lack of security, officials said Tuesday at a conference of international donors.    While the usual litany of problems is cited, which is fair, the article does not stint in reporting the good news.   [Iraqi Planning Minister Mehdi] Hafedh said that despite problems with security, there were a number of achievements. Power generation has surpassed levels before last year's U.S.-led invasion, as have oil exports, now averaging 1.5 million barrels a day, he said. According to the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, the average peak electricity production in the first seven days of May was 3,376 megawatts.  ... Hafedh said 2,500 schools have been renovated, telephone lines had increased 20 percent, and some 1,500 hospitals and clinics were operational. He said that Iraqi students would get $40 million worth of new textbooks in the coming academic year after the first grant agreement was signed two weeks ago with the World Bank to release donor funds.  Ross Mountain, the resident U.N. coordinator on Iraq, appealed to donors to look beyond headlines about violence to see what has been achieved. ""Amid the daily media diet of bombs and slaughter, we here need to recognize that there are significant positive developments being accomplished by Iraqis, including with their international partners,"" Mountain said. Col. Robert S. Ferrell, of the U.S.-led coalition's program management office, said 73 development projects are under way, and many more would start in June. He said $2.3 billion worth of construction was taking place in the electricity and oil sectors. 	 	   And so forth. So am I ready to eat my words about biased media? Not quite. For one, yes, we ran the story, but we buried it deep, on page A4, below the fold. And for some mind-boggling reason, we illustrated this story with this photo:       which carries the caption:  U.S. Army soldiers rush to evacuate an injured comrade in the center of Baghdad, Iraq after thunderous explosions at the capital, Tuesday.   Really, could this be more clear? Why not run a story saying ""meat protein is good for you"" and illustrate it with a picture of a man choking to death on a hot dog.  Still, I suppose even that would be more fairandbalanced than the work of  l'Agence France-Presse.  Here's the lede to their version of the same story:   DOHA (AFP) - Iraq issued a cry for urgent help from donor countries as aid only trickles through and violence rages ahead of the US-led coalition's June 30 deadline for the handover of power.    Good Lord, are they really talking about the same meeting? You have to wade through 11 paragraphs of horror stories (none of them fresh) and bland background to get to the good news.   But the minister also listed achievements such as opening 2,400 schools, 240 hospitals, 1,200 clinics and one million telephone lines -- 20 percent more than under the ousted Baathist regime.  UN special representative for Iraq Ross Mountain noted progress in the field -- several hundred schools rehabilitated, five million children vaccinated against measles in March and April, 11,000 Iraqi refugees helped to return home from Iran and Saudi Arabia, nine million litres of water tankered to Baghdad, Basra and Fallujah daily at peak, 40,000 people employed mainly in water and sanitation schemes.   And then it's back to the gloom and doom."
BEOGR3J,female,37,"Rock and Pop CDs: Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live In Hyde Park (Warner Bros)  Tom Baxter - Feather And Stone (Columbia)  Reviewed by Graeme Virtue    IT must be great being a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan in 2004. Ten years ago, the Los Angeles pranksters were making wiry, freaky punk-funk that could increase your blood sugar and make your sex magic, but all their UK record company was interested in doing was endlessly re-releasing their signature track Under The Bridge in an effort to make it a hit. Boo hoo.  For the last two years, though, there’s been a steady stream of solid RHCP product; their By The Way album and its brood of nagging singles, then a greatest hits (their second), then a DVD and now this: a double live album that clocks in at over two hours, collated from their three sold-out shows at London’s Hyde Park in June this year.   Despite their chaotic career arc – stratospheric highs and grubby, druggy lows – the Chilis have survived to become one of the biggest bands on the planet, almost by accident. No matter how you feel about their deliriously melody-laden recent material, they’ve earned the right to release a live record to mint their moment at the top .  Of course, live albums are usually an indulgence, for both record buyer and band. Here, you get reasonable versions of most of their best songs – from Throw Away Your Television to Can’t Stop, Scar Tissue to Zephyr Song – but without actually being there, the wind occasionally snatching the tune out of your ears, it can all seem a little flat, despite Flea’s heroic bass manipulation and Anthony Keidis’s unwavering vocals.  The most interesting moments are the throwaway ones – the cover of Joy Division’s Transmission that serves as the introduction to Right On Time, a falsetto I Feel Love and a medley of famous drum solos (!). Unfortunately, there’s also a three-minute trumpet workout from Flea, pointlessly filtered through a guitar pedal and a final, final encore of Give It Away that stretches out into a plodding 10-minute jam. Under The Bridge still sounds good, though. Maybe they should release this version as a single.  His record company are obviously hoping that he’ll slot nicely into a lucrative commercial sector somewhere between Keane and Damien Rice, but there’s real substance to Tom Baxter. H is quavering voice sounds like it’s been around the block a few times, and thanks to string-laden musical settings that owe more to Nick Drake than the usual cash-register jazz, there’s a sense of honest craft to the Irishman’s debut album Feather And Stone. There’s an emotional honesty to songs like My Declaration and The Moon And Me that gets under your skin, although it’s an intimacy you’ll be sharing with thousands of others in six months or so, when he’s deservedly massive.   01 August 2004  guess i got lucky being in the states then here for their highs there, and there highs here. interesting though how now they are so popular here, and well-marketed here as well."

If mixed with ammonia or acid-based cleaners (including vinegar), chlorine bleach releases toxic chloramine gas. Short-term exposure to this gas may cause mild asthmatic symptoms or more serious respiratory problems. (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   To be on the safe side, don't mix chlorine bleach with anything -- or just avoid chlorine bleach altogether.  Phosphates  Phosphates are minerals that act as water softeners. Although they are very effective cleaners, phosphates also act as fertilizers.  When cleaning products go down the drain, phosphates are discharged into rivers, lakes, estuaries, and oceans. In lakes and rivers especially, phosphates cause a rapid growth of algae, resulting in pollution of the water.  Many US states have banned phosphates from household laundry detergents and some other cleaning products. Automatic dishwasher detergents are usually exempt from phosphate restrictions, and most major brands contain phosphates.  Alkylphenols and their derivatives  Alkylphenol Ethoxylates are found in some laundry detergents, disinfecting cleaners, all-purpose cleaners, spot removers, hair colours and other hair-care products, and spermicides.  (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)  Alkylphenol Ethoxylates are endocrine disruptors.

All of these products can release pollutants while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.

(Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   EPA's Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas.  Additional TEAM studies indicate that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans. (Source: EPA)   Trichloroethylene is one of the chemicals suspected of causing a cluster of childhood leukemia cases due to drinking water contamination in the town of Woburn, Massachusetts, in the early 1980s. The subsequent lawsuit against the polluting company was the subject of the 1995 book and 1998 film, A Civil Action. (Source: Children's Health Environment Coalition)  High levels of toluene can put pregnant woman at risk of having babies with neurological problems, retarded growth, and developmental problems. Xylenes may also cause birth defects.  (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   Styrene is a suspected endocrine disruptor, a chemical that can interfere, block or mimic hormones in humans or animals. (Source: Children's Health Environment Coalition)   VOCs such as xylene, ketones, and aldehydes are found in many aerosol products and air fresheners. Researchers found that babies less than six months old in homes where air fresheners are used on most days had 30 percent more ear infections than those exposed less than once a week. (Source: Washington Toxics Coalition)   Levels of formaldehyde in air as low as 0.1 ppm (0.1 part formaldehyde per million parts of air) can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes, nose and throat, stuffy nose, nausea, coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, skin rashes and allergic reactions. (Source: Children's Health Environment Coalition)   Babies frequently exposed to aerosols had a 22 percent increase in diarrhoea, and pregnant women frequently exposed to these products had 25 percent more headaches and a 19 percent increase in postnatal depression compared to those less frequently exposed.   Paints, cleaners, and other products with no or very low levels of VOCs and other hazardous ingredients are available."

BEOGR3J,female,37,"What causes sinusitis?  Most cold viruses only result in a blocked nose. However, if the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages and sinuses swells up, this can block mucus drainage. Mucus builds up causing the pressure and pain of sinusitis. Bacteria or fungi are more likely to grow in sinuses that can’t drain properly, and bacterial infection often causes more inflammation and pain.   Chronic sinusitis is caused by anything that irritates the lining of the nose over long periods and causes the mucous membrane to swell. Examples include:   *	grass and tree pollen, *	cold air, *	alcohol, *	perfumes, *	damp weather, *	allergy to house dust mite, mould,and fungi, *	chronic drug use (""snorting"").    People who have allergy-based asthma often have sinusitis as well. Indeed, any problem with the nose that blocks the drainage holes can produce sinusitis. This can include polyps (small nodules of mucous membrane), and injury that causes the bridge to lean to one side (deviated nasal septum).  Tooth and gum infections can spread to the sinuses. Rarer causes of sinusitis include conditions that weaken the immune system such as HIV and cystic fibrosis. Swimming, air pollution and smoking can aggravate sinusitis."

BEOGR3J,female,37,"Posted on Fri, Jun. 25, 2004     I M A G E S     The Darkness Only by seeing the Darkness can retro fans see the light  BY JIM ABBOTT Orlando Sentinel   With his feathered cat-suits, over-the-top falsetto and the defiantly retro arena-rock of his band the Darkness, singer Justin Hawkins invites parody.  Just be careful with the comparisons: AC/DC and Queen are fine enough, but Spinal Tap raises the singer's hackles — even if the band's amplifiers sound like they go to 11.  ""That comes only from journalists who don't know anything about rock, someone who has only watched 'Spinal Tap' and 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' and starts writing for an indie paper,"" Hawkins says by phone from London. ""Anybody who says we can't write songs is, frankly, lying.""  More than image, the secret to the Darkness is the unexpected quality of its ""Permission to Land"" debut. The band followed the validation of selling 2.6 million copies worldwide by taking Britain's Ivor Award in May for the year's best songwriting. The Darkness makes its Twin Cities debut tonight at Roy Wilkins Auditorium in St. Paul.  ""I can't get that miserable about things when there are people in certain corridors that appreciate what we do,"" Hawkins says, using a very nasty word to dismiss those who don't respect the band's talent.  ""They still need a piece of us to sell their magazines,"" he sniffs, then stops to reconsider. ""Does that sound arrogant? Ah well, there's nothing worse than false modesty.""  It certainly doesn't become a rock star whose band has sparked followers ranging from British Prime Minister Tony Blair to comedian Jack Black. The latter, who embraces rock's broad comedic possibilities in cult favorite Tenacious D, has described the Darkness as a welcome throwback.  ""A delicious fresh breeze in an otherwise stale rock landscape,"" Black told Entertainment Weekly.  Not everyone has been so supportive. The band never even considered Hawkins as lead vocalist until his rendition of Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" at a Millennium Eve karaoke contest opened the eyes of his guitarist brother, Dan Hawkins. Early British club shows inspired record company scouts to head for the exits.  Another band might have been devastated, but Hawkins was energized.  ""It was encouraging because it's always the bands that struggle that have enduring longevity,"" he says. ""Cream, Aerosmith, bands like that.""  While he doesn't dismiss every band that follows a trend, Hawkins didn't want the baggage that came with being part of a hot new sound. He envisioned the Darkness as something different, even if it sounded like band members had raided their parents' 1970s and '80s vinyl collection.  ""I'd rather be compared to 1970s and '80s bands than any 1990s bands because there's no one in the 1990s that we'd aspire to be like,"" Hawkins says. That ego resurfaces in his assessment of the band's impact in its native Great Britain.  ""I think it's akin to Nirvana. When Nirvana came along, everything that came along next sounded like a watered-down version. Every now and then, there's a band that... shows that music doesn't have to be formulaic.""  Or at least can revive a different formula. Besides, if the soaring vocals and monster guitars on the MTV-driven ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"" or ""Get Your Hands Off My Woman"" are derivative, they also happen to be genuinely memorable.  And, for all his bluster, Hawkins is surprisingly magnanimous about the angst-ridden emo bands and earnest, shoe-gazing indie-rockers that contrast so starkly with the overt showmanship of the Darkness. He loves Radiohead.  ""Jeff Buckley was good, wasn't he? There's good and bad in just about any kind of music, but I'd say with the words ""earnest' and ""entertainment,' it's hard to get both in the same sentence really.  ""Still, I would never say that I hate any band,"" he says. ""There's people I hate, but there is room for everybody.""  Among the people that Hawkins dislikes are the members of Staind, who tried to have the Darkness yanked from the radio playlist at K-Rock in New York.  ""They tried to get us off because they didn't want to be on a station that played the Darkness,"" Hawkins says. ""They think we're a joke.""  He utters another very dirty word, then softens his tone: ""I would never do something like that. That's really wrong.""  Despite that controversy, the Darkness is still on the air in New York and elsewhere. Hawkins is optimistic enough to be shopping for a few rock-star perks.  A mansion?  ""I looked at one this morning,"" he says, ""but I'm really looking at cars now.""  He has narrowed the search to ""a Jag, the only true British car really. I'll deal with the mansion later.""

4Z06CQK,female,24,"This One's for the Children:   Lesson 1, The Special Needs Child    For those not in the education field, let me enlighten you. Each student that is diagnosed (medically) with a disability must have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). It outlines goals, deadlines, and accommodations that MUST be performed in the classroom. This is a legal document and failure to follow it could result in (you guessed it) legal action against the teachers. Now, let me take you back a few months to when I was still student teaching... A student in homeroom is misbehaving right before the bell rings for end of the day dismissal. The bell (finally) rings and the ""real"" teacher who I am working with starts talking to me. Her: He's a special kid. (Then proceeds to tell me about the other times she has had him in class and he's misbehaved and how his accommodations are outrageous, and she didn't follow him.) Me: Were these things the IEP outlined? Her: Yes. Me: Oh, well, what is he diagnosed with? Her: I don't know. They didn't tell me. Me: (trying to feign innocence) It wasn't on the IEP? Her: No, they didn't show me that part.  THAT IS UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY WRONG!! THE DISABILITY IS WRITTEN TO TOP OF THE IEP!! WHAT'S THE POINT IN HAVING AN IEP IF NO ONE KNOW WHAT MEDICAL CONDITION THE STUDENT HAS!?!?!? Just an example of why I'm not teaching. I cannot be around people who don't do their job. A teacher who does not follow an IEP is not doing their job.  (side note: any special educators out there that know more about the IEP process and discover that my findings are wrong....please let me know. I would hate to hold a mental grudge against that teacher when I there is no need).  I'm usually not that angry. However, the discovery that I've wasted 3 years of my life does tend to get under my collar."

There's been a rather vile stench emanating from the refrigerator for the last several days.  I'd removed all of the potentially spoiled food/condiments/etc. from the fridge late last week to no avail.  So last night I pumped the cleaning music (read the hardcore stuff), rolled up my sleeves and dug in.  After removing the entire remaining contents of the refrigerator, cleaning the door, and both racks inside, I moved down to the storage drawers in the bottom.  After I removed the first one, I knew I was in trouble.  There was a puddle of murky looking water festering under the drawer.  After I removed the second drawer, the vile stench intensified.  I had found the source of the stench.  The murky pool of festering water was stinking up the entire kitchen.  I cleaned it up, then called the landlord who promptly said,  I'll have a new one over there tomorrow.   He wasn't kidding.  He showed up at my door at 8:15 this morning with a brand spanking new refrigerator.

After we got done with our jaunt up the mountain, we headed towards TGIFriday's in Nashua only to discover that it wasn't there anymore.  We then decided on Ruby Tuesday's, but no one could figure out how to get into the parking lot.  After three attempts, we finally made it.  We got back to Boston around 10, and Snyder's dumb roommate's car was in the driveway, but not at home.  He finally got ahold of the dolt and got into his apartment around 11:45....

CPUJDY8,female,25,"Yup I have heartburn.  I ate too much toffee before bed last night and in the middle of the night I kept having to roll onto my stomach to muffle the pain.  Go me.  My brother got back from Canada today and rang me up.  Simone told him when he got home - he didn't get the email.  Nice one hosebeast, way to start criticising  before  there is a problem!  She better not say anything to me about it.  I have a host of responses that I probably wont use :P  I put in my dole form today, was first at the counter so the 45 minutes I put in the parking meter was a complete waste of my ten cent coin stash.  Then I saw the ONE DAY ONLY OMG SPOTLIGHT SALE ad on TV and went to Spotlight with my Mum where I didn't buy much because it was ALL CRAP.  I got a marking pen, some fabric paint and a stencil because I want to try hand painting fabric.  Jeez their fabric is shit.  I saw some brown embroidered taffeta that I really really really wanted but couldn't afford :(  It was only $10 per metre but I dont get money until tomorrow!  I didn't mind too much, I spoiled myself terribly at the sale on Friday.  I'm already digging out patterns to make this stuff into.  Anyway the funeral is tomorrow at 3pm in Berwick.  In her infinite wisdom my Mum will only go with my newly returned brother so we have to go to his house first while we wait for the hosebeast to return from work and she 'may be late'.  In Brunswick.  I pointed out that is somewhat in the opposite direction and that I was happy to drive but Mum told me to drop it.  She wants us all to go together and for Damien (oldest son) to drive.  It's going to be hard tomorrow.  I rarely see my Dads family - they all look exactly like my Dad except they're not and remind me of being a kid again.  And when my grandma (their mother) died a couple of years back, at the gathering afterwards, one of my cousins who I hadnt seen since I was like 6 came up to my sister and I and snapped ""It used to be me that never came around - now it's you guys"" and walked off.  I was gobsmacked.  Weddings, funerals and Christmases sure drag up some weird actions out of people.  I'd only met her once too!  The rest of them are fine though, they understand.  It's just as hard for them to see us.    I am quite uninteresting at the moment otherwise!  I have no desire to do much, probably the weather.  I was pretty happy and bouncy on Sunday until I found out that Don died and since then I've been flat and tired.  I'll be sad tomorrow at the funeral.  I understand the importance of funerals now.  They are a very necessary closure and carthasis.  You need to concentrate that grief and let it out or you'll be flat and tired forever.  You also need to meet and even bring up the angry thoughts in your head to people who have no idea they've done nothing wrong.  Even if it's only so you can go and feel bad for ragging on people you hardly know :P  Looks like it's the week of epic blogs if you're still reading!  Maybe I'll go lie down for awhile."

We used to make a cubby out of the couch, and use the extra cushions to make a tunnel leading to it.  It was so exciting!"

CPUJDY8,female,25,"Tonight I decided to have a crack at melt and pour soap.  Armed with simple directions and the tip ""spray vodka on airbubbles"", off I went.  Overboard.  Completely overboard.  At first I thought you were sposed to melt it quickly so I did and it foamed.  And I added essential oil.  And carrier oil.  And kaolin clay.  And mango butter.  Then I poured it into the molds.  Later on I found a sliver and tried to wash my hands with it.  It cleaned my hands, but didn't lather at all.  Further reading informed me that the melting point of soap is only 60c.  One other site said 120c.  Another said 185c.  Whatever, point taken, dont overheat your soap or it foams and you get airbubbles.  The upside is, I have super duper moisturising soap.  No way am I using it on my body.  My brother is happy though he has mega dry skin and will probably love it.  Oh and I got too enthusiastic with the essential oil too.  I used rosewood and mandarin.  It would be nice if I hadn't of used the maximum amount so that it didn't smell like Lush, but amateur.  Not to worry, my Mum loves that twangy aromatherapy smell so she's happy.  I got to make something, and both my Mum and brother like it, so it's a win-win-win ;D"
CPUJDY8,female,25,"Its PMS week.  I have put on another kilo and am beginning to wallow.  To avoid the spiralling pits of hell I shall endeavour to keep busy.  Tomorrow my tasks are:  1 hour of DDR. Email MTIL and ask him to sign Centrelink form saying I dont work there now on Thursday. Mark exams and/or clean room.  That should do it.  Today I put in my timesheet, went to Centrelink, and then went fabric shopping which was satisfying.  I'm only wallowing because I got to the point where I could try nice new shirt on, noticed it was tight, and discovered I'd put on even more weight.  So demoralising.  I'm beginning to feel really really angry at frustrated because I havent been able to DO anything in my own home because I've had to stay silent for Raph or Mum.  So no DDR.  And no DDR means absolutely zero exercise.  Zero exercise at 5'2 means really fast weight gain.  The shorter you are the fatter you get.  I'm too pussy to exercise in the cold and I can't afford a gym membership and I bought the damn DDR mat instead of a gym membership anyway!  So I feel cooped up and trapped and frustrated and fat.  Man I just want a job so I can move out and play DDR as much as I want.  I dont want to feel angry, depressed, and fat!  But right now, at 11pm, my belly and I have to sit here and bear it.  That's what fucks me off the most.  The times I want to do something about it I can't.  And not just night time.  If it's the day Raph is studying or someone is asleep.  Or watching TV.  Maybe I could download Stepmania and use it on my PC but that means buying an adapter. Goddammit I am pissed off.  And Raph is going to China on Friday and I should be glad but I will miss him.  I just wish he didn't have to study at the fucking kitchen table :P"
CPUJDY8,female,25,"Just discovered I'm getting paid a bit over $100 than what I thought I was.  Once again, I will pay off my credit card, allocate myself money for the next fortnight, and put some into savings.  However rather than use the extra to buy myself something useless and temporarily satisfying, it's going straight into my savings.  It's curious because the more money I have, the more save and less I spend, whereas the less money I have, the more I want to spend it.  It's a security thing - if I'm not getting much I need to surround myself with crap, if I'm getting lots, I can live in the safety of the numbers in my ING account."
CPUJDY8,female,25,"I am turning into my mother.  I am completely addicted to buying expensive designer makeup.  It's not like I even want to wear it really, most days I just dag around in whatever and no makeup, and I'll wear it if I'm going out.  No, my motivations are far far more shallow.  I like the cases they come in...I like the logos and the shapes and the weight and the heavy black or heavy gold.  I got my  urlLink Jean Patou Lipstick  the other day.  I bought it because he designed in the 1930s (this is a rerelease), for the flappers to look like a cigarette lighter.  It's a beautiful design, and nice and heavy and cold in my hand, and really does look like an old world cigarette lighter!  I love semi ornate stuff.  I dont think you can get that one in Australia and even if you could it would be around $80.  I paid $35.  I love  urlLink strawberrynet !  I love Hong Kong!  Importers of ridiculous amounts of cosmetics and designer ranges!  I could never get like this about clothes.  I was looking in shops in Victoria gardens the other day going ""I'm not paying $40 for that!  I could make that for $10!"" which is a bit problematic because while I  could , I probably wont.  So here I have found some materialism.  It's not clothes, or homewares, its makeup.  Well, makeup in nice expensive casing.  I wouldn't go out and pay $400 for creme de la mer regardless of how good it was for my skin because the bottle is ugly.  Actually I wouldn't pay $400 for skin cream anyway.  $35 for a lipstick is one thing, paying full price or over $100 is quite another!"

4I1F2FO,female,16,"Ok, so I finally have enough energy to post a bit, but I'm not exactly in the best mood, but it's usually a trade-off, so whatever.  First off, I agree 100% with Josh on just about everything except the whole mania bit, cause I'm not lucky enough to get that. (Good job for all of you who actually picked up on that bit of sarcasm.) I'm tired of the whole Becca-Philip-Rosie situation too, and if I hear one more thing about it, I swear I will have a reason to go back to that hellhole they call a hospital.  Second thing, which Josh definitely already knows about: For the most part, the reason I went to the hospital is because I didn't feel emotion- God, I love intellectualization- but they broke my mask, so now I am a real bitch to just about everybody until I learn to actually control this stuff.  I either don't feel at all or feel way too passionately; it's pretty much an all-or-nothing situation.  I'm also completely self-centered and don't care about anybody but myself, with an exeption or two others thrown in occassionaly, so don't load me down with your problems yet. Wait until I can get my own problems dealt with first.  It may take a while.  Find someone else to dump the crap that no one will care about in 20 years on- but not Josh, he's got enough stuff to deal with between the two of us. (yes, Rosie, that DOES include you)Third, the reason I haven't actually talked to anybody but Abby and Josh yet is because I've got a freakin' social anxiety thing that won't go away, and quite frankly, Abby didn't make things too much better in that department.  Remind me to thank her later.  I did finally make it to a restaurant today, which was a miracle, but all the same... Anyway, congratulations to anyone who had time to read this before I remember that I wrote this post and delete it.  Then again, my memory is not so hot these days.  These drugs have me fucked up [refer to Josh's post here] to an extreme.  Welbutrin is making me insane, Trazadone is about to kill me, and I get a new one called Effexor here in the next week or so.  I'm jealous of the Trileptol- that is one amazing drug.  Everybody but me got it- I almost did, but stupid Indukuri decided that it may not be the best thing for me, so I get Effexor, which is basically the same drug with worse side effects.  Look them up sometime, they're really fun.  Ok, now I'm rambling and the Trazadone has kicked in so these last few sentences have probably not been so coherent, but I don't really care.  I'm going to bed.  Oh, and Rosie, why are you showing people the blogs?  Josh, if I haven't deleted this by tomorrow morning or so, you may want to do that before I really offend people. Of course, you'll get a big laugh out of it first.  Oh well.  Good night."
4I1F2FO,female,16,"In response to Lindsey's request, I am posting an article from a recent chemical journal.  New Chemical Element Discovered   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element,  tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have one neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons,which gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons.  Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than a second.  Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.  Research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities. It can usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.  Scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising."

Whatever.  I did drive my dad's new car today tho. It's not so bad...2001 Oldsmobile Alero. It's a GM product, and that sucks really hard. But it's not so bad...ok, there's no horn. The CD player is really bad. And it smells AWFUL in there, no matter what we do. So if no one wants to get in any time soon, I  definitely  understand.

9TD1PDP,female,26,"I would not attack the faith of a heathen without being sure I had a better one to put in its place. ~ Harriet Beecher Stowe   It wasnt long ago that I came out of a restaurant after eating lunch and saw a truck, a normal moving style truck except that on the side, in vivid color was the image of an aborted fetus, broken and mutilated in the gloved palms of a human being.  The images took the entire side of the truck on all sides and in tiny black print there was a web address for  urlLink The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform .  I nearly lost my lunch at the sight of this truck sitting in the parking lot of a restaurant, then I wanted to cry, third I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs at whom ever would be so deranged as to drive such a thing, let-alone park it in a place where children would see it.  Now I will tell you that I am not an advocate for Abortion, I believe that its wrong to take a life, especially a life that has not the ability to choose to be born in the first place and certainly doesnt have the ability to choose death.  I believe in God and while I believe that a woman should have the right to choose everything else about herself, that is not one of them no matter the circumstance.  There are other choices to be made, adoption for one.  Still that is just my opinion and not one that I try to force on anyone!  Okay, now back to the topic.  I endeavored to try to understand why such a thing would exist.  When I went to their website I only got angry.  A high and mighty organization who endeavors to tell others how to live and results to scare tactics.  Disgusted I spent many hours contemplating this organizations purpose and what they must be thinking, I came up with only anger.  These groups give all Christians and Republicans a bad name.  Organizations like this one make us all look like crazed, picketing, take a stand for whatever is good today, type of people, and all in the name of God!    The lord provides us all with freewill from the moment of our birth, I only believe its a shame to waste it on this ignorance.  The lord is a forgiving, loving god and slinging brimstone at anyone YOU dont like defies the entire purpose of faith in God.  Sometimes I think its not a wonder that the lord drowned everyone in the world once, and sometimes I believe that its a shame that Jesus choose to give his life for such ignorance.  I thank God for the sacrifice of his son, for without them I would never know forgiveness like I do now even thought I feel unworthy of his sacrifice, I thank him none the less.   I only have one thing to say, Love thy brother and I do not consider this radical group loving!    ~Kristyn"

9TD1PDP,female,26,"""The impetuous seed of creation does not exactly come forth on little cat feet."" ~Georgianne Cowan, from ""The Sacred Womb""   I think my ability to observe the unusual in everyday life is growing keener.  This afternoon, after a frusterating three hours packing, I went out to get a Blizsard at Dairy Queen.  When I was coming back, I noticed a well dressed man in a three piece black suit and shiny dress shoes carrying garbage out to the dumpsters.  Though I was not in a great mood, it made me smile.  I am chalking it up to the strangest thing I have seen, at least today.    I am dabbling in a book called  Fruitflesh, seeds of inspiration for women who write  by Gayle Bradneis.  If you're a writer and a woman, I reccommend this book.  She discusses in the introduction how the observation of a strawberry changed her life. The meditation exercises in the book revolve around the observation of different fruits.  The book is one that helps teach the power that observation has in each of our lives and how our lives can be inspired and enriched by simply seeing, actually seeing, what's around us.  It's a facinating read.  I am also currently working on my first assignment for my writing group and let me tell you I am having a blast. It's coming along nicely, though I will not say what it is and I am having a very good time.  I am also in school right now taking english and government.  I am not having the greatest time with either to be truthful.  I enjoy english, though the finer points elude me sometimes.  Government on the other hand must have been put on this Earth to torment and torture us to ultimate bordem and self loathing!

9TD1PDP,female,26,"""The only think necessary for the triumph of evil, it for good men to  do nothing."" ~Edmund Burke   Freedom for All  America, the land of the free?  The Supreme Court of the United States have issued a recent ruling in the case of Lawrence & Garner vs. the State of Texas that would make even the most skeptical or radical think twice about their own opinion of freedom.  In a 6 to 3 decision, the US Supreme Court struck down so called Sodomy Laws in the state of Texas, making it unconstitutional for two men, or women, to be arrested for non-commercial, sexual acts in private.  If I had been asked before this ruling had come forth, I would not have believed that such a body would make such a ruling.    It is my opinion that it is not the responsibility, or business, of the law to govern social issues.  The law is to protect our liberties liberties that they so often infringe upon.  From the platform on which I stand, gay rights are a social issue, and not one that the supposed veil of ignorance which shrouds the law has any right to decide upon.    The argument has been made that should gay and lesbian citizens be granted the privilege to marry, it would lead to a decline in opposite sex marriages.  This idea is ludicrous to say the very least!  Granting gay rights will not make more gay people, and currently the gay populations stay unmarried.  So, if gay men do not marry strait women, and lesbian women do not marry strait men, I ask how there could be a decline in strait marriage?  Allowing same sex marriages would change very little in the grand scheme of things.      I suppose that there are a number of closet homosexuals that exist in the world, yet I believe that they would still exist no matter the laws.  Homosexual people who do not admit their true sexuality generally behave this way for fear of social stigma.  In a society where a gay man can be tied to a fence and beaten to death, the social fear of persecution is a major factor in rejection and denial of sexual orientation.  Religion is another factor in such closet behavior, as are family, and friends.  In the end, the law plays a very small factor in the way people act socially, especially concerning very sensitive issues such as sexual orientation.  The prejudice of the law -in a government that is supposed to be indifferent- has forced the highest judicial body of the United States to decide on something that is not now, and never was their business in the first place.  The court has overcome all pressures and prejudices to prove that perhaps freedom is the most important thing after all.  America is a country that is founded on the basis of freedom for all, not freedom for some.    I have ever hoped that people at the very core of them- had learned to overcome societal prejudice for the greater good of its citizens. People are people, weather gay or strait, black or white, old or young, and every single person in this world should have an equal opportunity to not only survive but also strive and be himself or herself.  Who you choose to love is your own business, I only find it refreshing that the supreme court believes that freedom to love, or at the very least not be persecuted and thrown in jail for that love is our fundamental right.    When all else fails, the argument could be made that enforcing sodomy laws is nearly completely impossible.  I ask how the law enforcement agencies could lock people away for being two consenting adults, consenting?  Law enforcement has a difficult enough time solving violent crime and can barely regulate prostitution which is sexual deviance right in front of their faces.  Drug addicts, thieves, prostitutes, child molesters, rapists, murderers, and the like are all very serious and very real criminal issue.  How could two people who love each other and want to be left alone to their vices in the privacy of their own homes compare to so many true criminal acts?  ~Kristyn"

I have to say that I am sorry and if I insult anyone, tough! I know what I believe and if you disagree you can email me, however let me say you will not be able to change my mind.    I was watching a special on Tech TV pertaining to the rather large problem of people pirateing music off of the internet.  I have to wonder why people do this.  People just do not seem to understand that it is STEALING!  If you download a song for free off of the internet, rather than that forign concept called BUYING it, the people who put their time and effort in creating that make nothing, nada, not one red cent!!!  I know people who wouldn't walk into their local convienience store and steel a candy bar, but they persist in downloading tons of pirated music, movies, and games from the interenet...why?    Now, God bless the music industry, those who have downloaded thousands of stolen songs are getting sued!  GO MUSIC INDUSTRY!!! The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is persisting in suing those who are guilty of steeling.  From what I understand there will be no jail time, but monetary compesation will be sought.    Whatever your opinion is, whatever you believe about his anomaly, there will be no mistaking what I believe.  Why is it that people are comfortable committing crimes when they can commit them from the comfort of their own homes?  Why are people willing to steel if they think they're safe from persecution?  Does the population of the pirates not realize that their IP addy can be tracked, the government CAN find you, you are NOT safe from persecution,  you CAN be found and sued!!!

Bickham and Ive come to the realization that my procrastination in writing, my fear of writing, my confusion about weather Im ready to write, is all rather irrelevant if I do indeed intend to be a writer.  If I do, then I should begin to write, and forget the rest, its unimportant.  So, that is what I have decided I am going to do.    I am going to try to treat my writing like a job.  Work on it 4 hours or more a day and write down my hours.  That way I can see how often I am writing and for how long, it will also help me to keep writing.  Everyday I am going to write, and maybe some on the weekends, maybe.  I am going to try to start writing seriously.    One of my major apprehensions is that I am terrible at grammar.  I feel like I just dont have the education to write professionally.  I suppose we shall see.  I have to overcome the fear and the angst at writing.  The only way to do that is to write.    So I, as of yet, have no idea what I intend to write.  I just know that I am going to.  Maybe Ill start doing the writing prompts from Writers digest.  I got a calendar with writing prompts on every day of the year, from Writers Digest Book Club.  Its really nice, so I am going to start using it, I think.  I also have several good books, including  The Writers Idea Workshop  &  The Writers Idea Book  both by Jack Hefferon.  They are full of writing prompts for every day of the learning experience.  I really believe that most of my problem stems from the fact that I am not the most patient person.  I dont want to be an aspiring writer I just want to be a writer.  However, rationally, I realize that I have to an aspiring writer first.  Its a progression of things, the life process of learning to be a writer, and writing a novel, short story, article, whatever.   I am also tired of being in college.  Im 26 years old and Im barely through with half of my associates degree.  Matt and I are intending to go to a 4-year college soon, but I just want to graduate.  Several of my friends from high school, with whom I no longer have any contact due to very unpleasant circumstances - have graduated from college.  My ex-husband has his masters degree already, and his sisters are even graduated from college, and theyre several years younger than I am.  Its very discouraging.   So I have to breath in and out, and control my impatience.  All the patience I have will pay off someday.  For someday I will write a novel, wish me luck!  ~Kristyn"
9TD1PDP,female,26,"People create their own questions because theyre afraid to look straight. All you have to do is look straight and see the road, and when you see it, dont sit looking at it walk.   ~ Ayn Rand    Morals; motivation based on ideas of right and wrong. Ethics; A set of principles of right conduct. In my life I have made some mistakes.  I have lived immorally, treated myself like shit, given in to temptation on more than one occasion, and not always followed the word of God.  So I suppose you could say that while I do now have a sense of moral and ethical right and wrong in my own mind and within my chosen actions, that hasnt always been so.  However, since gaining that strong sense of my own moral mind I have grown very aware of how each and every action will affect my moral beliefs.  I am unwilling to compromise!  Okay let me get on with it, most recently I have been asked to do something that I felt was morally and ethically wrong.  The obvious answer to the question would be no, except in this case it took some thought.  In this case, violating my own moral beliefs would have given a friend the opportunity to live a better life and get a better job.  Violating my own moral beliefs would have seen that she could make more money, get some much needed insurance, and generally be a happier person.  All of these being true, I had to put a great deal of thought into this particular predicament.   When is it right to knowingly and with forethought violate your own moral and ethical beliefs?  I personally believe that the answer to this question is, never.  I personally believe that if you pick and choose what to spend and break your morality on, you will loose a sense of why you adhere to morals at all.  In the case of my friend, I decided that I would not do her that favor she required to make her life better.  I know it may sound cruel, but I choose to adhere to my morals.  If she had lived her life in correlation with her own morals and ethics or even knew what she morally believed for that matter- then she wouldnt have been in the predicament to begin with.  If she had lived by mans law, or in accordance with her own health and safety, she wouldnt have been in that predicament.  So in the end it came down to weather or not I was willing to give in and break my morals to make up for a series of bad choices on her part.    Another problem was, once I cut through all the bullshit, that I knew that if I did this one favor for her, if I helped her out, nothing would change.  She would go on doing that thing that got her into the predicament to begin with, and other lives could suffer for her problem.  Again I was unwilling to risk others for her problem.    In the end I said no to helping her, and hopefully she will not ask me again in the future.  Still I hope that our friendship has not been strained by this decision, if it has and she is unwilling to understand that I had to do what I thought was ethically right, then perhaps she was not the friend I believed her to be in the first place.  ~Kristyn"
9TD1PDP,female,26,"In a country where morals, ethics, and standards supposedly rule our ever action, law, and way of life, America is on a serious decline in adherence to its very own ethical high horse.  Our claim to be a morally and religiously righteous country of good wholesome middle-class suburbanites is on the decline.    It is most likely that the citizens of other countries look on America as the holy grail of good government, while their governments have labeled us the proverbial playground bully.  Adhere to American standards and ways of life or die!    Its wrong.  Other countries have every right we do to their own moral and ethical substructure!  They have every right we do to form their own way of life and government based on traditions that have worked for them for thousands of years.  So why does America believe its our right to go in and kick the ass of anyone who is different from us?  Was America not built on diversity and difference, in the common goal of escape from the tyranny of an uncaring king?  The answer is yes, we were.  Now, in light of the fact that Americans have been caught hurting peoples of other countries simply because they could, I am forced to wonder, if they have that much time on their hands, why are they there at all?  In my opinion this folly by American troops proves that our time in Iraq is coming to an ultimate needed end.    In one case, a Texas Republican Senator said that yeah, the tapes were bad but they deserved it because they did worse to our people.  In my opinion, there is no justification for what happened, none!  Americans do not do these things, Americans do not torture POWs; Americans do not hurt others for the sake of enjoyment.  From where I stand, these actions by American soldiers make them no better than the Enemy.  I begin to wonder who the enemy actually is?  Weve captured Saddam, so whats left Bin Laden?  But wait, wasnt he our enemy from the very beginning?  One would think so, especially in light of the Al-Quaidas actions against American on 9/11.  So why wasnt he our prime target from the beginning?  I believe that was what the UN, Germany, & France were trying to figure out.  Now it is true that Saddam Hussein was a mad man.  It was true that he was oppressing and torturing his own people for his own sick, twisted political scheming.  Yes, he was a homicidal tyrant; that was never in dispute.  Had George W. Bush just said we want him out because hes a killer totalitarian perhaps he would have gotten more support from Congress, the UN, France, and Germanyperhaps?  So now we are looking for weapons of mass destruction and I would be willing to bet that the Bush administration will find them just in time for the election.  How do we, the little men aka American citizens- know that the weapons have actually NOT yet been found?  The answer is that we know solely based on the word of George W. Bush and his administration.   George W. Bush, the president who has nearly from the beginning, been unwilling to tell us anything.    I am not voting for G.W. Bush again, thats for sure!  Not to mention reports which say that George W. had an axe to grind with the Middle East when he entered the oval office.  People from the inside saying that he had intended to go to war with them from before day one.  I would believe it now, though I wouldnt have then.  Isnt it strange how ones perception of the truth can change over time?"
9TD1PDP,female,26,"""Logic is the beginning of wisdom; not the end."" ~Spock Star Trek VI Final Frontier   I just, tonight, got the opportunity to watch the original  House on Haunted Hill  with Vincent Price.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  It was really nothing like the remake thank the heavens.  While the remake was terrifying, it was also seriously lacking in content.  Movie remakes are seldom worth two nickels, they are over done and generally nothing like the original, usually thats a problem but with this movie I it proved to be a delightful surprise.  Sadly, remakes seldom do justice to their predecessors.   Take for example  Anna and the King , a remake of  The King & I .  It was terrible, it didnt follow the story, they added a whole lot of unnecessary fluff, he didnt die, and in the end they got together.  What about all of his other wives, Annas just going to become another one of the Kings wives?  In the original,  The King & I , the king dies.  It wasnt sad, he died, he didnt live to fall in love with Anna.  It was a beautiful story defiled by Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.  I really wanted to enjoy it, I didnt.  Another example is  The Count of Monte Cristo .  I loved the original; I loved the remake more!  This movie is the perfect example a remake gone right. It had all the right elements, all the right story line, and it added things that only enhanced the story, didnt detract from it.  Tonight, I really enjoyed  House on Haunted Hill .  Vincent Price is a very spooky guy.  When the movie was over Matt asked me if it scared me?  No, it wasnt scary but I can see how it could have been in 1959.  The effects were good for such an old movie and the story line was good.  It was only 75 minutes long, so it was not too long or too short but rather just right.  This was actually the first time Ive seen the movie.  Matt bough me a box set of AMC Movie Classics, 24 movies, 12 disks, $25.00, what a steal!  I havent seen any of them but considering that I love old movies, Im sure Ill like most of them if not all.    Tomorrow, Matt is going to buy me some more movies.  I got  How to Marry a Millionaire  when I got the box set and I loved it.  I was actually looking for the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection, but no one in town has it. Today, I got  The Seven Year Itch  with MM -though I haven't watched it yet. So tomorrow Matt is going to get me some more of the movies from the Diamond Collection. Probably  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bus Stop, Theres No Business Like Show Business, Some Like it Hot, and a few others  I cant wait!"
HD31XRI,male,17,"I am pissed off like shit in a bucket right now. I feel like I just got screwed out of the title... maybe it's because I did. Damn Frank and his semi-infinite combo bullshit to hell. In fact,  fuck all those cardshop geek motherfuckers , especially Twitch, because that bastard makes crazy rules judgements like mad. They all can take their ""damage on the stack"", ""in response"", and ""tokens in the graveyard"" and shove em straight up their candy ass! (old school Rock style) Next time someone beats me in a cheap manner like that one of three things is gonna happen: 1) I flip the table over, jump on em and just start swingin... 2) I tap five lands and bring the ""bat"" card into play (which is in reality an actual baseball bat) and hit them directly in the fuckin head... or 3) I rip up the card that is causing me the trouble and throw it in their face, and then take the fucker's deck and throw it into the nearest fan, and proceed to laugh like a maniac.  We'll see who cheats who when I launch a grenade into that place and blow it to the fuckin moon .  You might think it's funny that I get so mad about Magic cards, but I meant it to come off that way. Plus you gotta understand that I don't appreciate getting fucked over, no matter what the situation may be. Also, if you think that was funny, you would probably like to know that I plan on robbing the cardshop one of these days. When it happens, and they're asking around to see who did it, do me a favor and  don't tell em it was me .   Did you know that today's date is 3/3/03? What an anomaly!"

HD31XRI,male,17,"Dahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!  I hope everyone is doing better than me, because if not than the world as a whole is one pissed off sonofab**ch. (haha chris) An obscene amount of trash overwhelmes me right now. I'm feeling very frustrated and pissed off. I should probably explain before I wig out. From the beginning, here's what happened. I sign on in World Chess Network (some online chess thing where you can play people from around the world), the first thing it tells me is that my trial membership ends today, great. That wasn't really a big deal to me because I'm not a chess club kook or anything, no really i'm not. I was doing pretty good up until that point, my rating was pretty high. I even won a couple games when I first started, making me like 6-1 overall. Then I got cocky and challenged some guy that was way better then me, he whooped me. So I challenge some guy who had a way worse rating than me (I emphasize, way worse), and I didn't really pay attention and underestimated him. So he beat me with some crazy maneuver, and he won really fast. I just laughed at this because it was pretty funny, he even said it was pure luck. So then I challenge some kook who is about even with me skill wise. I start off really good, and i'm talking mad trash the whole time, because I think the guy's a moron or somthing because it seemed like I was dominating him. I continued dominating him up until the last 30 seconds. (there is a 20 minute time limit) All the guy had was his queen and his king, and I guess that's all it takes, because he took out every single f**k*ng guy I had, there had to be about 11 of them. One by f*ck*ng one. It was seriously the gayest trash of all time. He checkmated me when there was 5 seconds left until he lost by time. Damn that sucked, and it wasn't so bad that I lost, it's that I talked extreme trash and called him a loser, biotch, insulted him, and told him he was gonna lose repeatedly. He showed me, he even called me weak, even though that might not sound so bad, it pissed me off. But I did learn a couple things from this experience: never talk trash during chess, never challenge people unless they suck really bad, and if you beat me at chess then you are a piece of sh*t a$$hole that has no life. Chess is gay anyways...  Now thats not even what I'm mad about, because I'm not even very good at chess. The thing that really made me mad was Mega Man 5, because if I'm losing at some craziness like chess I don't really care. However, if i'm losing at a video game, then i'm gonna be mad because I pride myself at being the master of video games. The game has been pretty hard, and it has given me a harder time than the other preceding Mega Mans, but difficulty I can deal with. In fact, I like games to be a challenge. The thing I cannot deal with is bad design/ programming, commonly seen in crappier games than the Mega Man series. The part I keep dying at isn't hard, it's bad level design, pure and simple. The level is perfect up until this glaring flaw, it is stupid and near impossible to pass. I will spare you the details because it would be crazy to explain this crap in depth. I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned it, it messes up the whole game. I tried it like 15 times and it won't work. If it wasn't a ROM and I had the actual game I would have already thrown the cartridge way the hell down my street, chased it down and slammed it on the ground again, gotten my sledgehammer, and smashed it into a million pieces, and then peed on it. I swear. I am seriously considering throwing this controller through my monitor and destroying my whole computer and/or smashing my Mega Man X cartidge and flushing it down the toilet for consolation. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do right now. I think i'll do what I always do when this happens, play it some other time when i'm happier. Because right now I have the determination, but I just don't think I can do much to help the situation when I'm so pissed off.  Now that I have calmed down and thought about it, I have realized that I am really drowsy, tired, hot, and sweaty...and I have a splitting headache. I apologize for writing about this before I noticed I was just in some crazy mood and wiggin out. I know that this entry was poorly written and had the most uninteresting, dorky subject matter of all time. Even so, I'm going to leave it on here (i could delete it you know) just for a laugh. It will also give you a glimpse of how trashy I can be when I'm angry, and how funny it is. I'm gonna take a shower and go to bed, even though its early.(Yes, 10:00 is early for me) Later."
HD31XRI,male,17,"Well, it's 3:12 am on a school night and I'm still awake. This is certainly not cool, not by any means. But on the plus side, I did get my Agriculture Project done. I also managed to download Haggard, finally. So I will be watching that as soon as I can. Which will probably be Saturday, since I'll be sleeping all day and night Thursday (tommorrow) and going to the football game and otherwise wigging all day on Friday. As far as tiredness goes, I am usually more awake when I sleep for 2-3 hours and then go to school, than when I sleep for 5-6 hours and go to school. I don't know for sure why that is, but I suspect it's because when you sleep for such a short period of time, it's like you haven't even slept at all, and you're not as tired. I dunno, even if I am tired as fuck tommorrow, I'll live through it, so it's ok. Plus I plan on eating a large breakfast including waffles, syrup, and milk galore. So that should help. But for now, I'm off to pass out on my bed and awaken 2 minutes later. Or at least it will seem that way..."

My parents rode out on the hog and Amber and Chas are with Karley and Dan, respectively. I'm just chillin out / making a cd with the Bittersweet Symphony on it, because I love that song. I do miss Jesseca, but I called her three times at 4, so I don't know what she's doin. I fixed my Kazaa (yes!), and as a result I am revitalized through the joy of music. I am supposed to go to work with my dad tomorrow, even though I didn't really volunteer to do it. He just accused me of picking my hours and I gave in. LoL, my dad cracks me up. I have these movies to watch but I don't know if i'll get the chance to do it. I'll probably just watch them tonight and sacrafice the luxury of on-the-job alertness because I stayed up too late.

HD31XRI,male,17,"It's awesome rocking the hoodie sweatshirt on a warm day. You can't even argue about that one.  I have discovered the secret to success: owning a Chevy S-10. Pimped out or not, those things are the shiznit. I won't say i'm definitely getting one for fear of being one of those assholes that say they're getting a certain type of car and talk about it all the time then change their mind at the last minute, but I will say that it is the car (or truck I should say) I hope to get. Everyone loves trucks, and after careful study I have determined that S-10's are the ones that people like the most. For me it's not a follow the crowd sort of thing, it's more of a S-10's kick all kinds of ass kind of thing. The main benefit of having an S-10 is being able to say ""pure Chevy power"" all the time, I look forward to it."
HD31XRI,male,17,"I have come to discover that I must be some kind of mutant, because my peripheral vision is off the charts! I can even see behind me if I turn my head ever so slightly, it's very cool. What a weird thing to talk about right off the bat...  I was like totally falling asleep during first block. I usually stop myself from doing that at all costs because I like that class, but i'm just tired so I try to stay awake and pay attention. I just gave up today though and quit trying to feign consciousness. I was all laying there with my face in my book wiggin out (hardcore sleeping). I'm surprised nobody noticed, or maybe they did, because I would have no way of knowing. I slept for the rest of the period and it was really crazy when I walked out of there because I was still half asleep, I must've looked like death warmed over. I don't know why I was so tired, I didn't even go to sleep late last night. Maybe it was because Mr. Phillips wasn't there (he's on his honeymoon), and Mrs. Applebee is ugly and boring. Yeah, that's probably it.  So let's see, what has happened to me recently? I had late night conversation with Justin the other night, it was like three in the morning, but it was cool. I went and saw  Phone Booth  with Jesseca on Friday. I didn't think I liked the movie when we were leaving the theater, but the more I think about it, the better it seemed. So I dunno, it was pretty good. I heard from a reliable source that some kid said he was gonna beat another man's shit. Now that is hilarious, think about it. ""Hey! I'm gonna beat your shit!"" Hardy har har.  Now for a couple of interesting/ funny (I thought) quotes that I found while surfing the EGM message boards:  Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, ""Think again, bat man."" -Jack Handy-  I can just feel my I.Q. go down 20 points each time I start up the disk and it's not exactly a good feeling. But hey, if you like football you should be able to stand it, but that's just my opinion. I don't know why I feel stupider playing the game. Maybe it has something to do with people running around smashing into each other and yelling at the other team who can run into the other team better and make grunts and clicking sounds reverting to their primal instincts of yelling, grunting, and beating the pulp out of the opposition, then making a franchise out of it with stupid people who smear colored paint all over their bodies and tip cars over and beat the pulp out of each other and so on and so on... I just don't find that entertaining, or any video games based off this activity entertaining. Each game feels the same and is the same to me.  -Some kid talking Madden 2003 and other sports games-  I laughed my ass off when I first read those, i'm not sure why but they just struck me funny I guess. Especially the second one.  And i'm spent."
HD31XRI,male,17,"I didn't do anything useful today. I woke up at 3, called Jesseca, she said she would call me back. So I fooled around for about an hour until she called. Then I got mad when she said I couldn't come over, clammed up, and got off the phone shortly after. I layed down on my bed for a couple hours deciding whether or not to bash my cd player and cd holder with my new bat. Ultimately I decided I would save that for a time when I had a better reason. I got online at like 6 (I think) and I thought I had cooled off, but I ended up wiggin out and having to get off before I started bitching at Jesseca, something I didn't want to do because I would only do it out of anger. I tried to think of something to do that would cheer me up but I ended up just sitting and thinking about it for like an hour. Then a movie came on Lifetime (it just happened to be on that channel), so naturally I watched it. It seemed dumb at first, but then it got really good, and then it winded back down again to the ending, which sucked. Oh well though, that took my mind off of things for a couple hours. I went in my room and passed out after that. I woke up at 11 something facing the wrong way with my head aching, wishing I would have slept through to the morning. But no such luck, because here I am, wide awake on the computer typing this journal. My day was far from perfect, but it's almost over now so that's good, things can only get better whenever they're this bad. I just hope I didn't piss Jesseca off too much, because I was never mad at her, but I may have made it seem like I was, and that's what I'm worried about...For now I'm just gonna try and burn a couple CDs so my day wasn't completely unproductive, and I should probably get to sleep fairly early(I'm shootin for 3am) so I don't wake up extremely late again. So that's my day, it was pretty gay, but hey, I coulda been shovelin hay."

I was complaining about how I'm trying to single-handedly finish this half-gallon of milk that expires in two days. I was like, ""Oy, I put it in my cereal, I drink it with some coffee for flavor, but oof, all that milk just makes me so BLOATED!"" Then this woman at a nearby table turns abruptly and shoots a disapproving glare in my general direction. She wasn't ballsy enough to look me directly in the eye, but shoots her pissy pussface look at the somewhat area of maybe my table. Apparently, she was an old crone-hag whose meal was soured by my indigestion.  I know I was in a restaurant. But who wants to make boring genteel talk, when there are more urgent matters to address, namely lactose intolerance? What is so wrong with the word BLOATED? I didn't use gasssy, I didn't use fartarded, I didn't use monster poot. I was just trying to make some pre-dinner conversation before our appetizers. Is that so wrong?

Meaning, they're cute, but in the wake of the White Stripes blues-garage global conquest, there are smitchens of bluesy riffs in-between the cutesy verses. And by bluesy, I don't mean Howlin' Wolf black man blues, but Jack Whitey blues filtered through a Japanese-cute sieve. Gone is the grit and the dirt, the pain and the done-me-wrong woe. Present is a Hello Kitty attempt at soul. I think if these girls keep at it for four years, they'll conquer the world.

I had a picture of Kathi Wilcox and Kathleen Hanna on the wall of my teenage bedroom and thought they were the epitome of cool in their miniskirts and ripped stockings. Seeing Kathi play for the first time, I was disarmed by how normal she seemed. She smiled like a normal person; she talked like a normal person; she wore black tights and plain vans like a normal person. I expected a sneer and a cooler-than-you attitude, but instead she was cool because she'd grin and laugh at her mistakes. Now THAT'S cool.  They covered an Etta James tune and during their encore they played another old soul song. If Christina likes singing the soul, why doesn't she incorporate it into her own songs? I think this is the logical direction, Christina. Take heed!  No other observations except her voice reminds me of Mel C. (Sporty Spice): same phrasing, same reedy tone. Who else can hear it? Hands?"
Z7J09CG,female,26,"Sunrise, Sunset   My honey (as my co-worker R calls him to my dismay) is back, but he's going away again this summer. This time for three months to Wisconsin for a photojournalism internship. He wants me to drive out there with him. It will take us five days and we will stay in motels of my choice. I'm looking forward to the roadtrip but wonder what will happen when he's gone that long. A month wasn't bad, but three might be a bit much, no? And then I think, who knows if we'll even be together by that time, anyway.   It was awkward for a few minutes when he came over, us relating as bf/gf, more solemn and timid than we used to as friends. I tried not to make fun of him as much, seeing as he's more sensitive about it now and he refrained from doing anything asshole-esque. He laughed at my idea of us spending stupid Valentine's Day at home watching tv as 'letting the romance die too soon'. But I'm vehemently opposed to getting a mud bath, so we'll have to compromise somewhere in the middle.  He lost some weight and got darker.

I gave him a book that he doesn't already have (which I purchased with the Stacey's gift card I found on the street) and I am almost done with his scarf. I looked at his photostory of the family who lives in a cemetery and told him of my recent visits to the factory. It's been 14 whole hours and we haven't fought once."
Z7J09CG,female,26,"***   Yesterday Abby and I saw a movie ""Anything But Love."" It was recommended to me by my movie buff co-worker, Gargyle, and it was... ok. It was worth my time because the kissing scenes were so... terrible. I was amused by the way they made me uncomfortable and squirmy. The kissing was awkward and passionless. There were no squeaky suction-y kissing noises. No sweet puckering of luscious lippies. The first kiss was a chaste press of the lips between the guy and the gal. It was like they were co-worker and co-worker, priest and nun, or... my mom and my dad. Boring! I can see that shit for free at home.  Then there is a kiss at the end with the gal kissing Andrew McCarthy. I laughed because I was embarrassed. As she closes her eyes and goes in for the liplock, Andrew McCarthy coyly pulls away before he indulges his passion. That is so GAY!!! Andrew McCarthy, you are so gay!!! Why the hesitation? She is clearly better-looking, better-dressed, and a better kisser than you! I don't understand! That is such a metrosexual move! I am exacerbated by the fact that he was trying to be all sexy, but he has a weak chin and that unblinking googly stare! He is no matinee idol, but a pasty nerdling with an overbite. Andrew, know thy station!! He pulled away, as if he had other options and was reconsidering. That is unbelievable and so, so, gut-stabbingly, gas-inducingly gay. So I laughed, but really, I wanted to cry it was so gay."

I was her friend cohort and Eaton (her sweetie) brought his friend Tom and before you knew it, it was just like high school...would have been if we went on double-dates instead of practicing dance routines in her living room and hosting bake-offs against the boys. Tom is a landscape architect who lives in the Mission and likes emo music. We bonded over Sleepy Jackson and ""shy clams"" (clams that don't pop open when you cook them). He was nerdy, courteous, sweet and handsome. We sat next to each other at the Asian Film Festival Music Videos presentation.  Before that, the four of us shared tapas at a French restaurant, told stories of car breakdowns and Canadian cuisine, and strolled down Fillmore street in the most amazing evening weather San Francisco has ever experienced, complete with lilac smell permeating the air. It might have been perfect if it was June 15th and M was leaving for good and I was looking for something (someone) to take my mind off things.

Z7J09CG,female,26,"Noisepop Day 1: The Unicorns @ GAMH   I got there early because I wanted to hear the opening bands. I figured, Kevin Arnold (Noisepop Big Cheese) would not be unkind. He would open my ears to new bands and enrich my life. There were three bands that opened and here's my synopsis:  Restiform Bodies: Crap Irving: Crap Why?: Total Crap  I bear with crap because once in a while an opening band will rock my socks off and steal my heart. Examples: Bart Davenport, The Lovemakers, and Adam Green. If I hadn't arrived early to see these openers, my life would have remained shallow and meaningless. Not true last night. Last night the openers made me question my existence and why was I not snuggled up in the warmth and pillowy softness of my bed? Why... am I here? Why... am I being subjected to this crappy music made by egocentric and charmless indie guys? In the spirit of description and long-windedness here's an elaboration of the umbrella term ""crap"":   Restiform Bodies : Musically, they were like Gold Chains, but without the balance of a female voice to counter the testosterone. Essentially, RB is a white guy indie-rapper with dexterous and quick rhythmic rhymes. He had good flow, but not much range or performance. He wasn't magnetic or compelling, he was just there. White guy indie-rapper, what is it about you that'll make me take note? What differentiates you from the rest of your brood? It's not that I need a schtick, it's that I prefer to watch people with fire or hunger in their eyes. This guy was able but he didn't have a driving message or a palpable connection with the audience. He didn't need us, and so, it was torturous.   Irving  -- 5 skinny indie guys with overgrown mussy hair and scruffy faces. They started off singing a sweet 3 part-harmony that was fey and soothing, but 8 measures in, they turned it into a screechy wall of adrenalinized noise. Guys. Why do they always have to assert their masculinity? Why do they have to ruin good songs by putting up a wall? Literally and sonically? It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to sing sweet songs. I understand what they were trying to do: subvert conventional songwriting structure, continuity, and mood by juxtaposing sweet and light with heavy and charged, but they didn't do it intelligently. It wasn't balanced. They had some songs that were ditty-like and playful, but seriously, they need to practice more. They weren't tight and lacked cohesion. The best description I have for Irving is that they are 3 lead singers in one band. 3 run-of-the-mill, middle-of-the-indie-road lead singers.   Why?  - This band was tight. They were cohesive and focused. I just didn't like their music. The singer is passionate, but the crazy kind where you want to leave the premesis because you will get hurt. He spat a lot when he sang and during one song he went spastic and purposely smacked his head with his fist. He was full of self-loathing rage. Kind of like Oliver from ""The O.C."" Out-of-control and dangerous to himself and the people in front. Does lead singer also snort coke and tote guns? Where does reality end and TV begin? I can't remember what the music was like. I just remember tuning out and thinking why was I at this show when I could be at home listening to The Unicorns.    The Unicorns  - I endured 3 hours of sonic hooey to get to these guys, and it was worth it. It was worth the 3 hours of wasted non-refundable time. They came out barefoot and dressed in pink stage costumes. The keyboardist had a pink polyester cape with brown fur collar with matching pink pants. He wore a white shirt with pink suspenders. The guitarist wore brown pants with a regular belt and a pink fabric belt below it. He had no shirt on but wore a pink tie. The shirtlessness didn't disturb me because he looked like a 10-year old boy: small, pale, and undeveloped. There was a drummer too but he was a putz. I forgot what he wore.  They're fresh-faced and so young. The blurb in the noisepop program said they're straight out of high school, but they look straight out of grammar school. Once they started playing though, I was in heaven. If this is the future of rock, the future is in good hands. They're babies, but they're precocious, wise, sentimental, and enormously talented. Seeing them was like witnessing history. I was in the front row and they were alive and energetic and present in every song. How can a sound that's so relevant and versatile and perfect come out of these babies? Why is it that these Canadian boys can let down their defenses and sing without contrivance or a sarcastic sneer? There was no posturing, just silly fun, and great great music."

He wonders what the Jews want--it seems to him to be clearly Biblical, and he quotes the pope as approving it.      Or are the Jews asking Christians to clear them, in past and present, of responsibility for Jesus' innocent blood and to solely hold the Romans guilty for his death? The fact is, Pilate, the representative of a cruel imperial power, was reluctant to crucify Jesus and finally washed his hands in front of the crowd to declare his innocence of Jesus' blood.      Anyway, the Jews attempted this in 1965, when Pope John XXV in his well-known Nostra Aetate, cleared the Jews of today from the guilt of killing Jesus, demanding that Christians treat them well.      Being a significant step to stop persecution against Jews, especially following the Nazi period, this noble attitude by the Pope was widely understood by people everywhere, although with reservation by some churches. Among those was the Coptic Church of Egypt whose Pope, Shenouda III, was a historian before being a theologian and knew the historical facts fully well.       He argued that if the forgiveness was meant for the Jews of the past, then Jesus himself had forgiven them. If the aim of the forgiveness was to ignore what had happened, then this would amount to twisting history and censoring facts.      He also said that forgiveness should be preceded by the acceptance of guilt, so had the Jews repudiated the crimes against Jesus to deserve this forgiveness? ...       Gibson is a member of a Catholic community that doesn't approve forgiving Jews for their killing of Jesus. This may be the reason behind his recent effort to keep this past event a living memory. This is surely an unpleasant memory.      ...the Romans wanted to satisfy the Jews, and convince them not to demand Jesus' killing.      However, even this bloody effort didn't pay because the Romans hadn't comprehended the Jewish philosophy of crucifixion. Jews believe that the ""crucified are damned by God,"" so the priests insisted on the crucifixion of Jesus to demonstrate his damnation before their people....      Some critics say The Passion of the Christ contradicts the Nostra Aetate. But that argument is baseless because the Catholic Church has forgiven the Jews and not cleared them of the guilt....      Jews will attack the movie relentlessly, just as they have been lobbying for a long time against any American or European researcher who defies their version of historical events.

Meant as a bit of music for a dance of the ""savages"" in Rameau's early 1700s opera, this tune became quite popular in French Louisiana, and apparently was the only bit of white music that caught on with the natives, and they played it in their own gatherings and danced to it. Rameau apparently was immensely pleased when he heard of it.   Ok, so the singers for the concert aren't quite up to scratch, so we've decided to drop the chorus from the concert. That's a weight off my mind really, I've been stressing myself out these past few weeks trying to locate singers at short notice, not to mention teaching people their parts.

NFV9QJB,male,26,"Watched this film last night with a bunch of friends. At the end of it, I heard some girls going ""wah, you mean it's based on a book?"". Lady Athena give me strength...  WARNING: Rant ahead. This one's LONG. I don't usually post ultra-long reviews of films like this, but being a Classicist, I've taken this desecration of Homer personally.  What do you get if you start with the first great narrative of Western civilization, then remove all the psychological complexity and profound characterization?     Troy    If you're someone to whom ""Homer"" means only the stupidest character on  The Simpsons , this may not be off-putting. If you think the Bronze Age began when Brad Pitt's tanning bed was delivered, you may not care. And if you know Trojans only as impediments to procreation, Wolfgang Petersen's grandiose, hollow war film may seem like gold. The rest of us may wish he'd plunged head-first into Homer's wine-dark sea and stayed under.    This Iliad purist doesn't know where to start. Let's try starting with the time-frame. Writer David Benioff compressed 10 years of battle into 17 days (I counted) and ignored significant characters.   From the very beginning, where the historical preamble of text explaining the ""background"" gets shown, I started shifting in my seat. ""Greeks and Trojans"" they said. Now, even though in English we tend to think of the war as having been between Greeks and Trojans, here wasn't such thing as ""Greece"" in the times the Trojan Wars took place. ""Greece"" was a bunch of city-states, led by more or less independent kings: Sparta (Menelaus), Mycenae (Agamemnon), Ithaca (Odysseus), Phthia (Achilles) etc... Those people, by the way, called themselves Achaeans most of the time, and that's what Homer calls them. ""Greeks"" doesn't appear in the  Iliad  at all. Agamemnon neither conquered nor unifed Greece. Greece was still a collection of loosely allied kingdoms at the time of the Trojan War. The Greek kings fought to get Helen back because they had all wanted to marry her and pledged each other that they would defend the one who won her hand against any tried to take her away, not because they owed Agamemnon fealty.   First the men. The cast's Achilles heel is its Achilles, who ought to be a heel: arrogant, lazy, stubborn, cruel, deceitful and foolish. Homer created Western literature's first anti-hero in this demigod, upon whom the Greeks' hopes rest despite his long reluctance to fight Trojans. Pitt turns him into a simple, sullen rebel against Greek leader Agamemnon, a generically stolid warrior who wonders in the best tradition of the 20th century crap: ""what's all the killing for?"" He comes to life only in sword-to-sword combat with Trojan prince Hector (an excellent Eric Bana). The rest of the time, even in bed with the captive Briseis, this Achilles is as wooden as the Trojan horse. Achilles also declines to join his friend Patroclus in bed. Patroclus is his  ""beloved cousin""  rather than, as Shakespeare so piquantly put it,  ""his masculine whore.""  And, just to dispel that expectation from the start, our very first view of Achilles finds him in bed with TWO babes. When Achilles bedded Briseis, my friend  urlLink Anthony  very evilly commented,  ""I hope he's using a Trojan!""    Stupid filmmakers have changed the key to Patroclus' death - in the  Iliad , Achilles tells Patroclus to lead the Myrmidons, and is thus responsible for his lover's death. A pity Hollywood didn't have the guts to show Achilles' bisexuality. Would Pitt's female fans still have come to watch a near-naked Brad Pitt getting it on with some guy? Sure, why not? It's not like he's ever going to get it on with most of them anyway. I'll be posting about the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus soon - I'll reread the  Iliad  and come up with some ideas.    Is it my imagination or is Pitt's designer leather skirt about four inches shorter than everyone else's? Pitt also poses his way through the film. He preens, he prances and he pouts. And when he summons his men in to battle it is with an accent that knows no location on earth. It has a tinge of the British in it so maybe that is where he was aiming. But he doesn't hit that target. His cry outside the walls of Troy -  ""Heck-tah! HECK-TAH!""  sounded like a  ""can Hector come out and play, Mr Priam?"" .  No wonder Hector didn't look too worried.  Achilles, who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem, has been turned into ""Fabio on the beach"" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). I must say though, he did look really good with his shirt off, especially the scene where he was conveniently covered in vaseline.    They've removed the importance of Shield Brothers and gotten rid of, surprise surprise, the importance Patroclus has in Achilles' rampage. No idea what I'm talking about? Patroclus and Achilles were lovers, or at the very least, the dearest of ""bosom friends"" and shield brothers.   At the root of the film's troubles is the Petersen's biggest miscalculation: leaving out the gods. Though the Gods are referred to obliquely, the film keeps them firmly out of sight and mind - the implication being that they aren't there at all. It's Homer as secular humanist.  But the Gods are what make the  Iliad  so grand. To tell the story of Troy without the back story of the Judgment of Paris, for example -- in which the handsome prince is forced to pick between the goddesses Aphrodite, Hera and Athena by giving the most beautiful a golden apple -- is to suck the tale of its vigor. And when Paris challenges Helen's ex-husband, King Menelaus, to single combat and starts to lose, what a difference it makes for Paris to cower in terror and scurry away, as the film depicts, rather than have Aphrodite swoop down and spirit him away, as in Homer's version.   Lost in the translation is the vivacious, compelling tug of war between Gods and mortals. Sure, the Gods are immortal, but they miss out on the joy -- the excitement -- of being alive and knowing you have a finite time on this Earth. Homer's gods meddle, bicker, squabble and, in many ways, are less noble (and more fun) than the humans they try to push around. Even Homer's martial epic would best be subtitled, The Gods Must Be Crazy. In the  Iliad , the Gods are a meddlesome bunch -- Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite and the rest are always zipping down from Olympus to butt into human affairs. Homer would've had no story without them. There would have been no Trojan War because Helen would never have been abducted. Achilles, the story's hero -- and the son of a Goddess -- would have never been born.  Benioff and Petersen made a fatal mistake by excising the gods, who are mentioned vaguely but never interfere with the action. One points of the  Iliad  is that fate and the immortals rule us, despite our attempts to assert free will; we must be righteous partly because the Gods may end our lives at any time. Hector is Achilles' equal in the  Iliad , until the goddess Athena disguises herself as Hector's brother and betrays his trust.  It's vain Aphrodite, goddess of love, who gives the Spartan queen Helen to the Trojan prince Paris, as Helen's his reward for judging Aphrodite winner of a beauty contest.) This infuriates Helen's husband, Menelaus, who convinces his fellow kings of Greece to seek revenge. Without a sense of destiny and divine command behind them, Paris becomes a common seducer and Helen a cheap tart. (The smaller-than-life performances by Orlando Bloom and German actress Diane Kruger reinforce that impression.)  Oh, and what on earth is the temple of Apollo doing on the beach, outside the city walls? That's supposed to be the temple of Troy's patron god. What is this, San Apollo fuori-le-mure?  In just the first half hour of the film, most of the back-story of the Trojan War has been jettisoned. Gone is the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, where the shunning of Eris, the Goddess of Discord, sets the wheels of the Trojan War into motion. Gone are the twin prophets Cassandra and Helenus, who are the voices of reason of Troy. Gone is Hecuba (or Hecabe), the mother of Hector and Paris, who tries to stop her younger child from traveling to Sparta to act on his romantic impulses. Gone is Paris having been exiled from Troy at an early, due to a prophecy he would lead to the downfall of Troy. Gone is the fact that Paris not only stole Menelaus’ wife but much of his wealth as well. Gone is Menelaus calling upon all of Helen's old suitors, who made an oath long before that they would all back Helen's husband to defend her honour. Gone is Agamemnon having to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Artemis(the twin sister of Apollo) in order to secure safe passage on the oceans to travel to Troy. Actually, much more of the story has been shuffled off, including a lengthy battle against the Teuthranians, whom the Greeks originally thought took Helen, since Menelaus was away at a funeral when Helen was squired away, but who needs all that rich texture when you only have 165 minutes to tell your story, and you wasted the first fifteen setting your hero up as the Grecian Fabio meets Han Solo?   Achilles never really gets a scratch on him even though he is in the thick of a battle full of spears and swords, never mind that he is not revealed to be the son of a Goddess or wearing armor forged by the Gods. He is only a mere mortal here. For anyone who read the poems or is familiar with the stories, there is too much missing.    THE MOST POIGNANT PART OF THE STORY WAS CHANGED!   I'm talking about Book 6 where Hector says goodbye to his family... why oh why did they change that?! Go read the Iliad, and you'll see what I mean.   What's left? Not mythology, to be sure, but a rather bland sociology lecture on the realpolitik of power and the human waste of war. Now, such a contemporary sermon is well and good, but ancient Greece ain't the place to preach it. Also, there's carnage, accomplished over and over with the best computer-generated images money can buy. We're treated to at least four funeral pyres and countless scenes of slaughter, which achieve tension and emotional resonance only when a few great foes go one-on-one.   So they've removed the Gods and all hint of the supernatural, but it also includes a reference to Achilles’s heel, which, in the absence of the gods, is merely a payoff with no setup. Traditionally, Achilles's prowess is the result of his mother dipping him in the river Styx’s Invulnero-Water, since the water makes invincible whatever bodypart it touches; but since she held him by foot, his heel didn't get the treatment. Also, Paris is given a vision from Athena where she practically holds up a sign pointing to Achille's heel saying ""AIM FOR THIS SPOT"". Let's not forget Apollo, who's pretty pissed at the Achaeans for having violated his sanctuary and priests, guided the arrow of Paris to Achilles' heel.   Without that having been established, the crucial arrow to Achilles' heel makes us think, ""Right. The heel. I remember that. What exactly was it about?"" The scene's inclusion is therefore a stupid loose thread left dangling after the story was trimmed and re-hemmed, and his thrashing around when he is hit in his hamstring with an arrow after he has suffered far stronger blows to the rest of his body becomes almost comical.  And what the hell is Achilles doing taking part in the taking of Troy? He's dead LONG before that happens in Homer.    urlLink Anthony  pointed out quite correctly that the Iliad is about Gods and heroes. This film has humanised the heroes and eliminated the Gods. Epic is about heroes, not humans. It's perhaps unfair to expect contemporary Hollywood moviemakers to do justice to Homer or the legends of the Trojan War that have inspired artists and writers through the centuries. It is definitely unfair to expect Hollywood moviemakers to be comfortable with any notion of honour, even though the behavior of classical heroes like Achilles and Hector is inexplicable without it. However,  Troy  goes to the other extreme: Belief in the Gods is shown to be absurd, and whenever a character invokes them, he is making a ludicrous mistake.  As a result, the film lacks any sense of fate, destiny or even why this war's heroes should be memorable. Troy takes all the wind out of Homer's sails. This is an epic made by a modernist who doesn't believe in epics. Doesn't believe in the honour of battle, or the status of a tragic hero, or the ideal of romantic love, or the dictates of an omnipotent god.  It's OK to create a political explanation for the Greek expedition, making punishment for Helen's abduction a convenient cover story for Agamemnon's imperial ambitions. But without honor as a primary concern, Achilles' fury at Agamemnon for taking away his lawful prize, the priestess Briseis, doesn't really make any sense.  There's a movingly human scene in the Iliad, one of the most beautiful and noblest scenes from the poemin which Glaucus and Diomedes stop fighting to exchange their armours as a gesture to the ties of hospitality that binds the two. Homer considered Diomedes so important that an entire book of the  Iliad  is dedicated to him. Unfortunately that scene is absent because they've completely eliminated Diomedes and regal warrior Aeneas does only marginally better -here he's a Trojan teen in a toga who speaks one line.)  Agamemnon (Brian Cox) sniggers that the foolish Helen has ""proved to be very useful""— and he must have fought the urge to stroke his beard like Ming the Merciless. His pettiness cheapens the character's shrewd intelligence. Cox goes so over-the-top as a thoroughly evil Agamemnon that you wonder if he isn't deliberately sabotaging the movie. His performance raises an interesting question: Which is harder to watch, a talented actor giving a performance way below his game, or a really dreadful actor demonstrating for all time his utter lack of talent?  If ""Troy"" doesn't put an end to the movie career of Orlando Bloom, there is no justice in movieland. Could somebody remind Bloom that we are in the Homeric Age - not Middle Earth - when using the Bow he morphed into Legolas. All I needed was an Cave Troll to come up and smite the Greeks. After he kills Achilles with an arrow, I was half expecting a voice from below to shout,  ""that still only counts as one!"" . Please, Bloom... change professions. You should not be allowed to act, legally. I am amused by the thought that teenage girls might actually buy a copy of the Iliad, perhaps hoping to find an insert with pictures of him. There was that bit when Paris and King Priam are looking at the Horse (it's hideous) left behind by the Greeks, and Bloom comments ""burn it, father"". I couldn't help thinking ""oh, he HAS to be gay... he has taste"".   Sean Bean makes a canny and trustworthy Odysseus of Sparta, although even Cecil B. DeMille himself might have resisted the scene in which the character sees a soldier carving a wooden toy horse and -- say! -- the light bulb goes on over his head. And Australian actor Eric Bana thoroughly atones for last summer's ""The Hulk"" with his performance as Hector, Paris's older brother and the most capable and most tragic figure in the entire saga.  The first major battle sequence, with Achilles and his hand-picked Myrmidons storming the Trojan beach, might be exciting if it weren't a flagrant carbon copy of the D-Day opener in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The final scenes, with Achilles searching the dying Troy for Briseis, suggest ""Titanic."" The large-scale battle scenes are impressive, but they suffer by comparison to those in Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson has made it pretty difficult for directors of epic movies for the forseeable future). Then there's that scene where the Trojans set ablaze giant orbs of thatch and bowl them straight at the massed enemy. Scary it isn't, but you sure do want to sing along:  Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!   Now the women. Diane Kruger's Helen. Ha. She's pretty in a sort of Californian High-School way, but no way would she be a woman for whom a thousand ships were launched. In the Iliad, it says when Helen is in Troy, two old guards catch sight of her and say ""it is no shame that men should fight and die for such a beauty as this"". I can't imagine that happening with Kruger, who seems to have wandered in from the next-door audition for Eastern European Bond girls.   I read somewhere Catherine Zeta-Jones was a possibility for Helen, and I can imagine a LOT more ships being launched for her. However, Bloom had already been cast as Paris and she would've looked too old for his consort.  Pity.   The movie's real erotic object is Pitt's Achilles, really. Just look at the number of times he slowly undresses and washes his body.  They've eliminated Cassandra the priestess. Cassandra was given her powers of prophecy by Apollo, who wanted to gain her favor, but after getting her powers she rejected him. Instead of taking back the powers, he cursed her to never have anyone believe her prophecies. When Hecabe was pregnant with Paris, she had a dream that she gave birth to a flame that destroyed Troy. Cassandra said that the child would destroy the kingdom and he should die. However, the dream was interpretted by someone else the same way, and Paris was taken to a mountain top and left to die of exposure. He was found instead, and raised as a shepherd. Later, when he came back to Troy, Cassandra recognized him and again warned them that he would bring the death of the kingdom. She attacked Helen upon arrival, again warning everyone, and again being unbelieved.  At the end of the trojan war, she warned the King that there was an army inside the wooden horse, but no one believed her then either.  the one with the gift of foresight. She knows what is going to happen, and that is why she tells the Trojans ""beware of Greeks bearing gifts"". It's one of the key lines of the  Iliad . POOF. Disappeared without a trace. During the sacking of Troy, she was captured by Ajax in the temple of Athena and raped, but since Ajax has been killed by Hector in the film...  Where is Hecuba, the Queen of Troy? They seem to have misplaced Priam’s 48 other sons and all 50 of his daughters. I understand that it would be extremely difficult to have them all, but they left out such key Trojan royals as Deiphobus, Polyxena and Cassandra. As I said, I understand leaving these characters for the sake of it being a complex story, but they’re not even  mentioned .   Helen. Helen was not sent to Sparta to marry Menelaus, she was the daughter of Leda and Tyndareus (previous king and queen of Sparta), her real father was Zeus which explained her beauty. She chose to marry Menelaus out of all the suitors in Greece and the alliance was made upon the suggestion of Odysseus that the suitors agree to join together and stand behind her choosen husband if his right to Helen is challenged .  Briseis? Briseis was not a cousin to the royal family nor was she a priestess of Apollo. Briseis was the wife of King Mynes of Lyrnessus, which was an ally of Troy's. According to mythology. Achilles sacked Lyrnessus, killing Briseis' husband and her three brothers. Achilles then took her as his prize, making her his concubine. He fell in love with her, and during the tenth year of the Trojan war, Agamemnon, decimated Thebes, taking Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo. Apollo got pissed when Agamemnon refused to give her back, and ""came down from Olympus darker than night, though he is known as the 'bright one'; and shooting his golden arrows at the Achaean camp, he caused a plague that decimated the army.""  Agamemnon was told by Calchas (the same prophet that told him to sacrifice his daughter) that the plague was created by Apollo's wrath over the pain of his priest. Agamemnon agreed to give back Chyrseis as long as another prize was provided to replace her. Achilles, hearing this ridiculed Agamemnon, calling him a schemer, and to punish him for this, Agamemenon took Briseis from Achilles. That is why Achilles refused to fight anymore until Patroclus was killed by Hector.   They've elevated Briseis' existence from chattel (and minor sub-point) to Trojan royalty and a love story. (For goddsakes! A love story!) I am so sick of stories of women who are enslaved and then fall in love with their captors/rapists/enslavers!   Hello, where are all those nutty left-wing liberals and feminists when you need them?   They have Briseis kill Agamemnon. Unbelievable. Oresteia, anyone? Hello? Clytemnestra - are you listening? 'cos if you are, you're going to be really happy... you don't have to kill your husband anymore! Your son doesn't have to come back to kill you anymore! Of all the wrecking of the myth, this is the WORST. This is SACRILEGE.  The very idea that Hollywood could so alter one of the greatest tales ever told to say that anyone but Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon is, to use an apt Greek word,  hubris . It's disgusting. The point that Agamemnon goes home to be killed by his wife Clytemnestra is the basis of the  Oresteia  - the cornerstone of Western Drama.  Benioff might as well make a giant 40 foot robot come in and kill him because, well, if he can change important events in the poem such as the DEATH OF THE KING OF THE MYCENAEANS, then adding a 40 foot robot bent on destruction shouldn't be a problem at all.     For such a high budget production, you would think they could have afforded to have Chryseis, Cassandra, and Briseis...  WITHOUT  bunging them together into one unlikely character! Briseis killed Agamemnon? No problem! She can stand-in for Clytaemnestra, after all, Briseis' character was standing in for virtually every female in the Iliad.   The film's entire female cast is basically just an elaborate background tool set up so that the men have a distraction when the battles have died down. This treatment of the women and the elimination of the homosexual love between Achilles and Patroclus makes the film the worst sort of Hollywood heterosexist whitewash imaginable.    I must remember this if I ever become a Classics teacher and give a test on the Iliad or Greek Mythology. I shall make sure to ask questions whose answers are very different in the book and flick - that way we'll see who did the reading!   ""How does Agamemnon die?"" (trick question)! That'll teach'em to read the text! No, he is not killed by Briseis!  What the movie doesn't explain is why Helen would leave with Paris after an acquaintanceship of a few nights. Is it because her loins throb with passion for a hero? No, because she tells him: ""I don't want a hero. I want a man I can grow old with."" Not in Greek myth, you don't. If you believe Helen of Troy could actually tell Paris anything remotely like that, you will probably also agree that the second night he slipped into her boudoir, she told him, ""Last night was a mistake.""  Hector tells Paris how he remembered when Paris was 10 years old. Hello... Wasn't Paris abandoned at Mt Ida, raised by a shepherd and later returned to Troy as prince?   Ajax was not killed by Hector, instead Ajax wounded Hector without sustaining an injury. Later he and Odysseus made speeches who of them should get Achilles' armor, and Odysseus won, so Ajax started killing his own people too after going berserk, and later he comitted suicide.  What is this nonsense about ""the sword of Troy""? Aeneas didn't carry out the sword of Troy, he carried his father, led his son, and carried the statue of Troy (a goddess figure) according to the  Aeneid .   Patroclus was an accomplished warrior in his own right, not the untried boy presented in the movie. Patroclus, who looks a little like Achilles, wears his helmet and armor to fool the enemy, and until the helmet is removed everyone thinks that Achilles has been slain. So dramatic is that development that the movie shows perhaps 100,000 men in hand-to-hand combat, and then completely forgets them in order to focus on the Patroclus battle scene, with everybody standing around like during a fight on the playground.  Menelaus? He's supposed to survive the Trojan War and get back to Sparta promptly, where ten years years later he tells Telemachus all about his father (Odysseus). He is not supposed to die on the second day of the war.  By treating Achilles and the other characters as if they were human, instead of the larger-than-life creations of Greek myth, director Wolfgang Petersen miscalculates. What happens in Greek myth cannot happen between psychologically plausible characters. That's the whole point of myth. Great films like Michael Cacoyannis'   urlLink Elektra  , about the murder of Agamemnon after the Trojan War, know that and use a stark dramatic approach that is deliberately stylized. Of course,  Elektra  wouldn't work for a multiplex audience, but then maybe it shouldn't.  Then we've got the Trojan Horse itself. It’s a monstrous thing, hammered together out of ship planks, and painted a menacing black. Why anyone would bother hauling it home beats me. In Homer, the soothsayer of Trojans tried to warn King Priam that the horse was a danger but Poseidon sent his sea serpant to silence him, unlike the film where the soothsayer/priest was encouraging Priam to bring the horse into the city. Also would it have killed them to be a bit faithful to the script and show the horse so large that the Trojans had to demolish part of their city walls in order to bring the thing in?    Paris and Helen run off together at the end. I repeat - Paris and Helen run off together at the end. Excuse me? He's supposed to get mortally wounded and go crawling back to his first true love, the nymph Oenone on Mt Ida, whom he abandoned when Aphrodite promised him Helen. She has the power to heal him, but refuses to because he abandoned her. He dies right there and she is grief-stricken, etc. Paris hence dies long enough before the Greeks breach the city that Helen is married off to Deiphobus, another of Paris’s brothers. I was looking forward to Paris dying. But turns out that the writers changed it...grrr. They kill Brad and Eric, but they can't kill Orlando. Were the writers afraid that a few million teen Orli fans were gonna hurt them or something?  Helen is supposed to go with Menelaus, but since they've already killed him, she might as well go with the cute one, right? Andromache is supposed to be dragged off into slavery. Astayanax (Hector's teenaged son) is supposed to be hurled from the walls of Troy by Neoptolemus, Achilles' son. Aeneas' son Ascanius doesn't seem to exist in this movie, and how could he if his father is like, 15? Homer has Menelaus come into the palace at Troy, intending to kill her. As he finds her, Helen bares her bosom, and the beautiful sight affects Menelaus so much that he forgives her everything and brings her home. Of course, in the film, Menelaus died at the hands of Hector, so that couldn't happen...  The really bizarre thing about the script was that despite the listed inaccuracies, there were several things that only those well-read in the Classics would understand. For example, Thetis’s wandering around in the water for no real reason seems extraneous unless one understands that she was the daughter of a sea god. She also seems pointless unless one knows that it was her prophecy to Achilles that gave him the choice between a long life of obscurity and a short life of glory. Furthermore, at the end of the film, when several Trojans are fleeing to Mt Ida, Paris stops a teenage boy who is helping an old man to flee. Paris asks the boy what his name is, and he says ""Aeneas.""  Paris then hands him the ""Sword of Troy"", which as previously mentioned, if it is in the hands of a Trojan, Troy would never fall. Unless someone knows about the  Aeneid , etc, they wouldn’t get this reference, nor would they realize that the boy was basically carrying Anchises on his back. Never mind the actor playing Aeneas is actually 16, and therefore too young to be married to the eldest daughter of Priam and have a son. After all, do you really need Ascanius to rule Alba Longa for 30 years? Nah.  Imagine a movie based on the Bible without Christ, angels, or miracles. Or Lord of the Rings without magic or wizards. Imagine the Titanic taking its maiden voyage down to the French Riviera in late July, where the only ice to be seen for miles and miles were the ones the bartenders were putting into the drinks. Imagine Frodo and Sam reaching the Cracks of Doom in a week by taking a little known short cut that does not appear on any map of Middle-earth. That’s about the level of change made in adapting the  Iliad  to the screen, and that is simply unacceptable. I can't figure out why they made so many of the changes they did. They're not little details by any means, and saying that it's not supposed to be the  Iliad  doesn't excuse the fact that the story goes against every source of myth related to the war, not just the  Iliad .    ""Don't look now, dudes, but there're, like, a thousand ships outside. But never fear. The pecs of Troy -- um, princes of Troy -- are ready.""  They also show plenty of male flesh. Granted, it was nice to see lots of splendid muscles from Pitt and Bana, but did Petersen really have to desecrate the Iliad in order to do that? Couldn't he have made a film about bodybuilders or competitive swimmers instead?    Adaptation of the  Iliad ? Perhaps  rape  would be more appropriate.  Some things that really got to me: the pronunciation of names. Yes, I understand that in Latin,  Priam  is pronounced  Pree-ahm, —that one I could accept, but they did some odd things with the other names:  Briseis  is now  Bri-say-iss  and Menelaus is now  Meneh-louse .   MUSIC   Unmemorable. Horner, who's done fabulous work elsewhere, gives an eminently forgettable score here. It's one of those ""we can tell the Greeks are about to appear because the music's changed and the drums have started"" sort of soundtracks. Plus, epic films have epic soundtracks and themes. Doctor Zhivago had ""Laura's Theme"", for example. If I'm not humming the theme or theme song as I leave the cinema, it's not an epic soundtrack. Way too much ""aaAAAaaaaaAAAhhhh"" music going on. Easily his worst soundtrack in 20 years.   SET & COSTUMES   Despite all the technology and GCI battle scenes, the biggest problem with Troy is a simple filmmaking 101 blunder: If a period picture wants to seduce an audience into suspending disbelief, a director must create not just a physical world, but an emotional one as well. In recent flicks such as The Last Samurai, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, there's the sensation that we've happened upon a fully realised universe that was buzzing and thriving long before the camera crew stopped by. But for all his eye-popping set pieces, Troy still feels phony. Everyone seems to have just shown up that morning- nothing about the landscape looks lived-in. The costumes are all shiny and brand-new, the actors even shinier and prettier. The armour everyone's wearing looks like they took it out of the plastic wrap right before they jumped off the ships - either that or polishing armour is part of the ritual of preparing for war (it's not).  Is it just me or does Achilles' armour look like it's from a mail-order fetish catalogue? According to the  Iliad , his armour was forged by the great god Hephaestus. And with today's amazing special effects that are obviously available in Hollwood and used elsewhere in the film... it's not much to ask for the armor to LOOK somewhat impressive if not god-forged. The armour of the period is quite extensively described by Homer, bronze breastplates with silver and tin and enamel ornamentation, bronze greaves etc. The stuff they're wearing in the film looks like leather and moulded plastic. Of course they couldn't have their actors jumping around in heavy bronze breastplates because they're bloody heavy (those ancients were made of sterner stuff than our modern men) but they could have made an effort to make it look less cheap! After all, this film did have a budget of $200 million!   Which brings me to the costumes. I suspect they must have run out of money at this point (the film ended up wildly over-budget and over-schedule), because if you look closely, the nobles of Troy are all wearing tie-tyed cotton fabrics in white and blue. One can even spot where the knots and rubber bands were tied. Somebody please tell the costumer that bright blue and white tie-dye belongs in 70s California in hippie-settlements, not the world of Homer.   The Greek kings all look like old bikers. In fact, the Greeks look pretty much like every OTHER people trying really hard to look like Greeks. They're kind of a cross between Minoans, Medieval Europeans, and Vikings. It's a sad day indeed when the Greeks aren't Greek. One of the gang I watched the film with commented that the Greeks looked more like Dwarves from LOTR.    HISTORICAL DETAIL   There were more Greeks in one scene of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" than there are in the entirety of ""Troy."" In keeping with the Eisenhower era-style casting, the rank-and-file Greek army -- you know, the nameless barbarians who get brutally slaughtered -- has a few guys who look as if they might be of Italian or Middle Eastern descent. I read somewhere the extras were Bulgarians (rather pissed off at being paid $12 USD a day). What's the point of having some actors spout Greek in the big crowd scenes? I definitely heard a ""Malista"" somewhere.   The swords in the film are made of steel - and definitely not bronze. WHY IN ZEUS’ NAME IS THERE IRON IN THE BRONZE AGE? There's a reason this age is called the BRONZE AGE - they didn't have iron or steel tools yet.   Further nitpick - why do all these sword dramas feel the need to have the sound effecty ""kkkssssszzzing"" when a sword is drawn from the scabbard? I've worked with all sorts of swords and NOT ONE ever makes that sort of sound.    I have to laugh at the celebration around the wooden horse. Of course, the Trojan women are doing a Mayim step (that’s an ancient Hebrew dance step. Enough said) And of course, there was a random guy doing backflips. Ah, movie cliché #987.  What on earth were llamas doing running around the streets of Troy? I know they filmed in Mexico or something, but what are South American animals doing in a market place in Asia Minor in in 1200 B.C.?   When praying, the characters of Troy are depicted as kneeling before the statues. They couldn't have had a historical or classical consultant on this film, as everyone knows the Ancient Greeks and Homeric heroes STOOD when they prayed - in the ancient ""Orans"" position of forearms raised, palms facing upwards when praying to the Olympians or palms down when praying to the Gods of the Underworld. They most certainly did not kneel.  While we're on the topic of religion in the film, in the scene when Hector and Paris return to Troy, as they're entering the great hall, one sees clergy milling about, presumably the priests of Apollo, who is patron of Troy. One knows they're meant to be clergy not because they're wearing funny clothes (pretty much everyone is in this film, aside from Pitt who seems to show more skin than clothes) but because they're wearing hats and holding golden staffs which are directly stolen from Greek Orthodox  CHRISTIAN  Bishops' vestments and regalia. The staffs they hold (called  Pateritsa ) are terminated by two serpents looking toward an orb surmounted by a cross - an example may be seen  urlLink here . The priests of Apollo are also wearing on their heads these tallish cylindrical hats covered with a black veil - they're called  Kamilavka  ( Kalmilavkion  in the singular) and are worn by Bishops, dignitaries and monks - a picture of a bishop wearing it and holding the serpent staff may be found  urlLink here .    What the hell, did they think Greek Orthodox = Greek Pagan?      THE SCRIPT   Oh, the script. Did director Wolfgang Petersen imagine that if his actors acted as though they were reciting Shakespeare, it would make the dialogue, which alternates among the pompous, the banal and the just plain dumb, sound like Shakespeare? When Paris, who's so gorgeous he could have played Helen, nuzzles the Spartan queen in her boudoir, she coos, ""last night was a mistake,"" just like any soap opera star.   ""You must be Hector,""  says Achilles, on their first meeting. Ouch.  ""Burn Troy Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn Troy to the ground!"" screams Agamemnon during the sack of Troy. HA.  Benioff's script tries so hard to be high-flown and solemn that it ends up funny. The speech is hokey enough that hearing it once almost induces groans. Hearing it over and over and over again, as we do here, ensures groans. Enough with the immortality business, already! A lethal drinking game could be crafted from the number of times the script solemnly refers to ""immortality"", just as it could for the number of times that Pitt strikes a body-builder's pose as horns in the soundtrack adore him.  We also get countless speeches about how  ""the world will never forget this war/our glory/your bravery/the mighty sword of blah-blah-blah.""  If you took a drink each time someone said one, you'd be snockered halfway through.  ""Immortality, take it, it's yours,""  Even our great warrior signs on. He sings a chorus of the pathetic blues (seems his Achilles heel is really just a bad case of angst), and then gives the sad song a positive spin:  ""The gods envy us. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed.""    How can I take Achilles seriously after hearing him utter the line  ""It's too early in the day for killing princes” ? That and the  Rules of Epics , which require all critical death scenes to occur in Act 3. Bana's Hector has his moments, too.  A couple of times, by the expression on his face, I thought he was going to go green, you know,  Hulk out .   Hector Smash! Don’t make Hector angry Achilles. You won't like him when he’s angry.”  Orlando Bloom elicited a big laugh from me when he swept Helen into his arms and vowed  ""We'll live off the land. I'll kill deer and rabbits,""  or something to that effect.   Though, I don’t think it was supposed to be funny.   David Benioff’s adaptation is laced with the dialogue of a angsty teenager who never studied the classical works. One of Agamemnon’s men says  “if we turn back now, we’ll lose all credibility”.  How about some poetry to the language?  REWRITE:  “If we turn a blind face, the four winds will spread our cowardice to every corner of Greece.”   That’s a centuries-old epic I can buy, not crap like  “I want to see my son grow old and have girls chasing him.”  The film needs  “my eyes want to look upon my son, bathing in all the flavour that life has to offer,”  not  “May the Gods be with you.”   That last line is not made up and one which even George Lucas would admit sucked.    Menelaus:  ""Where is she?""  Guard:  ""Sir, your wife left ... with the Trojans.""    One would assume that a $200 million summer blockbuster could have found space on the payroll for some random lackey to comb the script and extricate any errant one-liners that could be potentially misconstrued as silly condom jokes by annoyed, impatient audiences. It calls to mind a quote from the estimable film critic Homer Simpson: ""Your movie is more boring than church."" I believe neither Homers would approve.  In an  urlLink interview , Benioff recently said, ""This is the mother of all epics, the cornerstone of Western literature. If I screw it up, classicists around the world will issue a fatwa and assassinate me with bronze daggers.""  He'd better be borrowing Brad's protective armour then. If I were in the mafia, I would seriously start a vendetta against those who allowed this film to see the light.    Please just pretend like you read the Iliad before you make a screenplay. This goes beyond interpretation (read: O Brother Where Art Thou? Now that's an excellent interpretation of the Odyssey!), this whole movie entered in to Classics heresy. The whole ""inspired by"" is nonsense. We wouldn't have people giving that argument if the story was of a character whose name was Jesus Christ, who was from Nazareth, parents were Mary and Joseph and instead of being crucified, instead he was whisked away by a gang of robbers, and he ends up becoming an alcoholic, womanizer and a gang leader and comes back and destroys the Roman Civilization. A director could easily put a disclaimer at the end saying ""Inspired by the Life of Jesus Christ"", but we all know what would happen then.  But yet, respected Classicist  urlLink Mary Beard  says:  Among those of us [professional classicists] who look on, a few will be curmudgeonly carping at inaccuracies or misrepresentations of the original. The majority will welcome the publicity for their subject. Many (myself included, I should confess) will already be penning articles on the ""Pittian Moment In the Reception of The Iliad"" or devising new courses on ""Classics in Film"" or ""The Trojan War in Popular Culture"". The chances are that Troy will have a longer life in a university department near you than in your local multiplex.""  and ironically, she's right.  If they had done a good job, I perhaps could have had a sequel to look foward to. Now I fear it. The only good sign I saw in the whole bloody film was that they killed enough main characters (in the wrong way), that perchance they can't attempt to ruin my beloved Odyssey, Aeneid and Oresteia, right? Plus, no Gods and monsters means the Odyssey and Oresteia can't be made by them right? Oh Zeus. I hope so.  If you really want to experience Troy as it should be, go out and get a translation (I recommend Lattimore or Lombardo's versions), and read it for yourself. Better yet, learn Homeric Greek and read the original. If you want to actually see it...might as well wait for the rentals to come out (if I ever buy this on DVD it'll be as a comedy). If you want to see really hot men go naked (forgot how many times I almost jumped at the screen seeing Brad Pitt and Bana), then by ALL means, do go and watch it. As for the $200 million spent... all down the drain. If you want to see a comedic adaptation of Iliad without being too offended, then gooo ahead and watch. I thought the movie was hilarious. It shouldn't have been, but it was. Every time they screwed up, I just burst out laughing. Especially at Bloom's Paris  . Because honestly...    In the Odyssey, Homer calls Odysseus   ""ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθ' ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμὸν ἀνδρω̂ν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα* πείρων, δὴ τότε γ' ἀτρέμας εὑ̂δε, λελασμένος ὅσσ' ἐπεπόνθει.   one who in time past had suffered many griefs at heart in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves; but now he slept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered. "" (Odyssey, 13.90)  Now, taking a cue from Odysseus, I'm going to have a nap. Hopefully when I get up, I won't be so angry."

What we have right now is an American government that seems to honestly believe that they have a right to interfere worldwide, but they have no responsibility in preventing the predictable blowback from killing Americans here at home. In other words, for the foreseeable future, Americans need to be prepared to sit around waiting patiently for terrorists to strike while thousands of young men and women in the Middle East are driven to joining terrorist organizations by endless wars care of Uncle Sam."

Another long day spent at work. just like the previous days, left work at 11pm. supper with Dawn and then free cab home (courtesy of TAS =P ) Past few days have been really enoyable, though tiring. Working so closely with Dawn for 14 hours a day, its been so much fun. Being so buried within the huge stress around us, we have to force ourselves to enlighten each other and the nonsense and noise we create during work simply helps put us at ease. by the way, my New Balance shoes arrived today.

53VOBGD,male,37,"Recent news about the effectiveness of abstinence programs in the US are reporting things in a really one-sided manner.  Here is a better angle on the story.   urlLink Abstinence Programs Proven Effective, But Not Foolproof    Abstinence Programs Proven Effective, But Not Foolproof  If you ever want to see an egregious example of press spin, not to mention shallow science reporting, just read the New York Times and glance through the headlines on any given day. The latest example is a headline reading ""Study Finds That Teenage Virginity Pledges Are Rarely Kept.""  Although I have a bone to pick with cultural conservatives, I'll get to them later. Now I'm going to pick on the left-leaning bias of the press, and slipshod reporting when it comes to matters of science.  I've scanned several news sources, and all pretty much ape the New York Times' coverage of this story, some nearly word-for-word: 88% of teens who take a pledge not to have premarital sex wind up breaking it, and those kids have almost (almost) as much risk for developing STDs. Therefore, the press suggests, the study ""challenges the assumptions underlying the Bush administration's promotion of abstinence programs.""  Pfaugh! If you ever needed proof that reporters are, for the most part, completely ignorant about science, and tend to be reactionary about conservative ideals, you can look no further. Not only is the negative spin ridiculous, but they don't see fit to name the study or where you can go to read a copy of the original. Most of the press accounts haven't bothered to point out that these abstinence programs were first brought to the national scene by the Clinton administration, either. The Bushies have only continued what the Clintonistas created.   But let's look at what the press accounts tell us, when you ignore the spin and look at the (rather measly) data they've actually reported about the study:  1) 12% of the kids keep their pledge and never have sex before marriage. If I told you I could reduce the rate of heart disease or cancer by 10% with a certain program, almost any doctor on the planet would consider that exciting news.  Indeed, just this week, physicians everywhere were excited to learn that certain drugs reduce risk of heart disease by 16%, and as high as 26% in some cases. So it seems to me that if we can confidently state that abstinence programs reduce teen sexual activity by more than 10%, they cannot rationally be called a failure. The numbers could be better, but then again, these programs are in their infancy and might well be modified to improve those odds.  2) All the press accounts say that the kids who take the abstinence pledge wind up contracting STDs at almost--almost!--the same rate as kids who don't take it. Implication: there's probably a minor reduction.  3) The press accounts all acknowledge that kids who took the pledge delayed onset of sexual activity by an average of 18 months. This is a huge reduction.  4) Mysteriously, not a single one of the press accounts mentions pregnancy. But why is it that I find it impossible to believe that kids who delay having sex by an average of 18 months, with 12% of them never having sex at all before marriage, are likely to be a group of kids who have a lower overall unwed teen pregnancy rate? Why is this not in the reporting?  5) The press accounts all acknowledge that the kids who took the pledge are more likely to get married. They also say the kids who take the pledge and break it ""wind up having sex before marriage,"" but what percentage of those are kids who have sex with their fiance/fiancee? They don't bother saying."

According to Timberlake, Jackson, CBS and MTV the ""wardrobe malfunction"" was unintentional -- nudge, nudge, wink, wink.  Who is fooling who?  It might have been unrehearsed but it certainly was not unintentional.    Who loses?  Certainly not the entertainers.  Jackson and Timberlake just got a huge amount of publicity which for them is like money in the bank.  MTV and CBS will not lose much either.  The big losers are the NFL and the public.  The NFL lost a lot of credibility with the public who will think twice before letting their children watch another half-time show.  The public loses even more as our children will grow up thinking that it is perfectly acceptable to humiliate women in public and treat them as sex objects.  Don't be surprised to find the scene at the end of the half-time show repeated dozens of times in local highschools by teens who think that what they just saw was somehow ""cool"".  In my opinion, the NFL should hold the networks and performers responsible and sue.  The public should hold them responsible as well."
53VOBGD,male,37,"I am really enjoying this little book by Joseph L. Cannon a missionary in Japan about a generation ago.  It is called ""For Missionaries Only"" and is full of wonderful nuggets.  Here is an excerpt entitled   Jack of All Trades, Master of None      What is a missionary?  What is he supposed to do?  I have never met a missionary that wasn't  an astute juggler of many balls, a switch hitter who played all the positions, a chameleon called upon to reflect every situation, a variety store, a mulligan stew, a strange mixture of heaven and earth.  think of what a missionary is called upon to do, and what he does.  he is a financier, a public relations man, a fund raiser.  He must be an educator, a personnel director, an able administrator.  he must be a linguist, a translator, interpreter, author, and publisher.  He must be a practicing physician, nurse and first aid man, a counselor, anthropologist, and sociologist.  he is expected to be an English language expert, an ambassador of his country, to have a keen insight inot national and international politics, and alwasy be able to take the right position on any problem that arises.  He is a philanthropist, organizer and operator of benevolent institutions, a lecturer, orator, and teacher of many things.  We might add that he preaches the gospel once in a while, too!   We have a saying, ""Circumstances alter cases,"" and this aptly applies to the role of the missionary.  The missionary's own background, education and inclination effect his role.  What a missionary does and can do is determined, also, by how old he is, how long he has been on the field, the education level of a people, the climate of the country, the economic level of its society and the political stability of an area.  All are factors that influence the work of a missionary.     A changing world can mean a changing role for the missionary.  But there is one trade the missionary must be master of to deserve the name.  I want to emphasize that the missionary is primarily a gospel preacher, a bearer of good news.  His work is to save souls.  There should be only one mission for his life, one role that must supersede all others, in order to be worthy of the name ""missionary.""  This is the unchanging role assigned by the Great Commission, ""Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel...""     In too many cases, the missionary becomes a Martha, troubled and worried about many things.  He needs to hear the Lord when He says, ""Only one thing is needful,"" and like Mary, choose the better part.  Though he may be busy doing many good things, if he fails to proclaim the gospel, he will see fruit without a tree, light without a sun, water will blow and nothing will remain.  His field of many labors will be a valley of dry bones.  He will have failed because, among the accumulated wares of a life with many roles, he will have left dust-covered, and neglected, the most important role of all -- his mission to seek and save the lost.        Oh Lord, that I would stay focussed on the one mission that supersedes all the rest!"

53VOBGD,male,37,"urlLink Achikochi: Tokyo, The World's Most Expensive City?    There we go again: The U.S. consulting firm Mercer Human Resource Consulting has published his yearly Cost of Living Survey. ""Tokyo kept its number one spot as the world's most expensive city"", according to Mercer's press release (June 13th).  Umbrellas for 100 yen, hamburgers for 59 yen and 1,000 yen haircuts - Tokyo offer them all. And yet can Tokyo be the most expensive city in the world? The answer is: No, absolutely not!  The Cost of Living Survey is designed to help companies decide the remuneration for executives posted overseas. It is thus weighted in favor of rented accommodation in well-heeled neighborhoods and items such as a Burberry-style raincoat that costs 70,000 yen (600 USD) in a Tokyo chain store but only 189 USD at an equivalent outlet in New York. The survey also emphasizes Western tastes in its basket of goods and services. Rice is not included, but white bread is, costing almost twice as much in Tokyo as in New York.  This survey is not the ""Cost of Living Survey"", but the ""Expatriate Executive's Expensive Life Style Cost of Living Survey""   True, true!  There is a bubble down in Minato ward where the expats are where everything is expensive.  Come out to Ome and things get a lot cheaper.  The reason?  Land is cheaper.  Therefore rent is cheaper and it keeps trickling down.  The rent for an apartment downtown is easily 3 times as much, but then the commute from here is over an hour."
53VOBGD,male,37,"urlLink CNN.com - U.S. missionaries knew the risks of helping Iraqis - Mar 16, 2004      This is part of the missionary life that people would like to forget, but in a very real way these missionaries laid down their lives long before they were gunned down by those they came to help.  David and Carrie McDonnall could have spent their first years of marriage getting ahead but chose to sacrifice the ""American Dream"" and lay down their lives for the Iraquis.  Larry and Jean Elliott had already given their lives for over 20 years in Honduras and when they could have settled down for a well-deserved retirement they chose to go to Iraq instead.  Karen Watson quit her job with California's Kern County Sherrif's Department to become a missionary.     Every missionary gives up a life that they could have led.  They give up seeing friends and family.  I think one of the hardest things for me is not getting to know new family members back home, not seeing children until they are almost grown, finding my parents have gotten older each time I go back to visit.    A missionary call is a call to go and die.  The Apostle Paul said ""I die daily!""  Every single day I could choose to hang it up and go home and live for myself.  Every day that these missionaries worked in Iraq, they could have said, ""No more, I can't take the fear and the strain and the thankless work -- I am going home.""  But they chose to stay because of God's great love.  God has taken them home where there is no fear and no strain and much reward.  Pray that their sacrifice would not be in vain, but that many Iraqis would see their unselfish love and many more missionaries would be inspired to give their lives - daily."

53VOBGD,male,37,"Yesterday, I watched my first Super Bowl in years.  Football is not really very popular in Japan and so it is almost impossible to watch the big game on Japanese TV.  But this year some Americans in the church invited me over to watch the game with them on the base.    Wow!  What a game!  That was one of the best games I have seen in a long time.  (Which is not saying much since I haven't seen a Super Bowl in probably over 10 years!)  But this was a knock-down drag-out slug-fest of a game.  In my opinion it was a contest between a team that opitomizes discipline and skill (Patriots) and a team that has incredible drive and the ability to make very clutch plays. (Panthers)  It made for an extremely exciting and close game with the victory ultimately going to the Patriots in the final seconds.    I am probably more of a Panther than a Patriot, when it comes right down to it.  I am not that well disciplined and my skills still need a lot of work.  But I really, really want to be in this game!  I want to be here when the Lord calls Japan into His kingdom.  I want to risk everything and all that I have because I believe that it can happen."

53VOBGD,male,37,"Tonight we remember what Jesus did for us on the cross.  I am planning on doing a traditional service with worship and reading of the seven words spoken by Jesus on the cross.  After each word is spoken we will extinguish one of seven lights until there is only one light left.  With the last light we will all quietly leave the church and close the doors and await the joyous news of Jesus' resurrection on Sunday morning.    Those of you from a liturgical or ""high"" church background will recognize footwashing and Tennebrea.  Those of you from a more free and casual church background will wonder what we are up to with these ""rituals"".  When rituals occur year after year without explanation they can become old and stale and meaningless.  But when they are used afresh they can be very powerful ways of communicating essential truths.  In our context of Japan, there is always something lost in the translation.  So acting out God's truth is a powerful way for people to know Him."

I was ready to shoot someone, anyone, by the time I stepped off the bus this morning. Not only was it crowded as always, but the only convenient seat was next to our bus' resident hick. You know, the NASCAR-cap, hunting-clothes, American-flag type. The fucker doesn't even pretend to see me as I ask him - nicely, mind you - to move over.  Dammit people, this is the  Main Line : we're all supposed to be in nice cars and nice clothes and at the very least above whatever IQ is needed for the basic bodily functions. The plain and unfortunate truth is that money can buy a lot of intangible things. Happiness, yes, to a point. Love, from Russia, I'm sure. Intelligence, I used to think so. Since when did we have to deal with rednecks?  And then, when I sit down in my seat, I sneeze. One of those gross, icky sneezes. Ugh. But as I'm getting off the bus, Erin, with her impeccable timing, is also getting off hers. Damn it was a relief to see a face I know and love. That in itself was enough to reset the day-counter back to zero from the negative-whatever it was on the bus. And then there was Vanessa and her photo. We all know what I'm talking about, no? And if you don't, well I'm not at liberty to explain. All you have to know was,  that  made my day.  Oh yeah, somewhere along the way I got an award for French for something. I guess that makes a small plus to my day-counter.  The other big thing today was Julie's remark, which I swore was made only as a gesture - you know, one of those phrases that pops out of your mouth, without your even realizing it, which is designed to do little more than allay the fear and worries and frustrations of the other individual. She said something along the lines of, ""Oh come on, you can do better than that."". And I would have left it at that, a gesture, a meaningless phrase, if it hadn't been reiterated again. Thanks, guys, even if you're all simply conspiring to find that exact thing to say at exactly the right time - even if they're all naught but gestures - you still managed to make me feel better.

I don't know if my eyes are burning with blood, tears and rage or with insomia. I was actually thinking about that message on my friend's profile... Today is the official salute to all the losers, those who don't care to be on top but rather just want out of the dog pile. A salute to those of us who can't tell the truth since we don't know how. A salute to the candy man on the street eyeing little girls not cause he's horny but cause he lost his daughter. A salute to the poor people with nothing but misery and desotution. A salute to the high order of 'I don't give a shit since I've been shot. Thank god finally.' And lastly a salute to those who don't want to exist and don't care that no one thinks that they exist. Salute. **update: I have MySQL mostly working, or working enough, now to start on the PHPadmin."

They are greedy evil troll whores who work at the hospital.  Now I am on a payment plan and have to pay interest to the billing trolls they use at the hospital because they are too cheap to send out a bill each month at the hospital.  I have to pay some company that is somehow crackwhore troll related MCS...they are a third party billing company.  How come they get to get monies and aren't even involved.  I didn't agree to be paying another company for my surgery.  Show me the monies.  Shit...I'll send my own self a bill for 1.5% interest a month.  But get over it Paul it must be paid.

GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Experimenter   That was the result of the personality test yesterday.  It said something about me being dominant and blah blah blah.  Oh and that I love to cause trouble but also like to fix things.  I think that could be true.  But the experimenter part is so true...it said something like you will try anything once...anything.  That could be a really bad thing to have as a personality.    I have tried many things but I don't know if I have a line to draw.  I mean of course sex with animals, family members and other gross shit like that is duh out of the question.  But other than that I can't say that I wouldn't be up for anything.  I can't see myself eating raw tomatoes but like four months ago I ate them at Ruby Tuesdays and didn't have a problem with it.  Now I can't even think about a raw tomato without being sick.  And I'm sure we all know that I'll do any type of drug except for heroin...unless I was given it without knowing.  That is so scary...isn't it?  I don't think that I could do crack, crank, cocaine.  But here I am saying ""I don't think.""  That usually means you would do it.  Doesn't it?  No...I'm over the drug scene.  Really...the only thing I take now is a random pain killer for my leg and back...allergy pills, paxil, and sleeping pills.  Other than that...that's it.  See I also think that April would do anything at least once except for what I've excluded for myself.  The only other thing I know she wouldn't do is anal sex...but you never know?  Wink Wink...I'm just fucking around with you April.  She has swore off anal sex for those of you who do not know her that well....and she will never do it!  I'm really proud of her for biting!  I told you it was wonderful.  Now all you have to do is be bitten...I think you will find it very exhilariting.     I need some h2o   I really wanted to go to h2o last night but seeing that April and I didn't get to bed around 3 or 330am Friday night it was out of the question.  I feel asleep at 6 pm and got back up at 9pm.  Then went back to sleep at 1030pm and got up Sunday morning at 11am.  That's pretty bad.  I am in the mood to get messed up and shake some ass.  While Frank shook so much ass that even I was wore out...the temptation to go to the club is growing stronger and stronger everyday.  I really want a long island iced tea from h2o.  They are really good.  And they are huge and only 5 bucks.  Maybe next weekend.  Is it bad that I'm like really tired and I've only been up for like 2 or 3 hours?  I think not.  Tonight...the mission if I choose to accept it is to get drunk...like my mom did last night!  Ha!

It has become the tent of imagination since I do nothing but sit at home all day and night.  Rose, my really for real crazy aunt said that it seemed we were in Egypt and that she could hear camels coming to pick her up.  April said now all Rose needs is a turbin and to desert boys to fan her.  And the cigarette ashes on the table have now become the sand in the desert that rose and I have been staying in all day for the hell of it.  I think tomorow it will be a fashion show tent and Rose and I will change outfits and bust through the curtains that surround the damn thing (it is a fucking damn thing since it took forever and five days to put up).  We will be like the models in ""Head over Heels"" the movie but more spectacular.  We have fun dreaming up new adventures to where the tent is taking us.  Kee-mo-sa-bee says:  To infinity and beyond.  May your tent stay with you and Rose and adventures be ah' plenty.  This tent is taking over our lives.  It's just one of those crazy things.

GQ4CPVF,male,24,Mimi   So for Halloween everyone at work wants me to be Mimi from Drew Carey.  Of course I'm going to do it.  But I'm going to be the Miss America version of Mimi.  I've already started making the dress.  I have the perfect vinyl pink hat with feather trim.  And glittery purple glasses.  I'm going to tell people I'm Mimi...but in actuality I will be Pamela Boobsgiggle.  Because the hat reminds me of Pam Anderson's hat that she wore to the VMA's.  And my boobs do giggle in this dress I've started to make.  I will have a picture if I think I look hot enough.    But other than that I'm not in a very good mood.  Maybe it's the craving or whatever but I'm tired too.  God let the 27th get here so I can get some professional help.  I can tell by last night this is not going to be a good week.  I'm going to watch a movie and maybe fall asleep again...that's the only time I feel comfortable when I'm feening probably because I go all comatose.
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"400 and more to go     This is officially my 400th post. Jeezy Squeezy, I never thought that I would have made it this far. Work is the same old same old tonight. I got another email from O.J. He is extremely nice. His presence alone in emails are so close to home.  He makes me feel that I have a friend that I have known before the mortal coil was snipped.  So O.J. please note that you are very much appreciated and welcomed.  Saturday night was a blast. I woke up at 8pm on Saturday night. Called April and headed to her cousin Kimmy's house to play cards until 230a.m. Much fun and laughter was had. On my way home I get a call from April that Amanda had called her house and woke her mother up trying to get ahold of me. So I called Amanda...who was completely tore up. So I turned around and headed back up to Amanda's house. Billy, Amanda, and Rhiannon were blitzed. I had a couple of drinks, played truth or dare, and chatted. It was great hanging out with them. I have missed that for quite some time now. I was feelin' pretty good by the time I left. We will definitely have to do it again Amanda!!!!  So now it is Monday...well actually Tuesday because it is 1:34a.m. and I'm at work. Things are running smoothly so far. Monday usually forcasts the week ahead so I'm glad everything is running calmly. I'm supposed to go camping this upcoming weekend with April and Adam. I thought it was this past Saturday but it wasn't. And thank God it wasn't because of the storms we had Saturday night. So we will see how this whole camping thing goes.  I just hope that I survive. I'm bringing a battery operated television with me though...because I want to at least be reminded that I'm living in the 21st century while I'm out in the wilderness on Saturday night.  My mother went to the doctor's today...she has walking pneumonia. My father has strep throat. So far I have evaded illness. And it had better stay that way. They are both on anti-biotics...I'm hoping this will make them immune. If not I'm going to be one cranky bitch come the day I get sick again.   P.S. it is now 2:44a.m.     Being teased and tortured for so many years in school I always have this feeling that people are talking about me. I guess it is some type of paranoia or something. When they whisper or start laughing as I approach it doesn't matter. Tonight when I got back from the store Paul D. and Shannon ""aka Soon to be renamed JerkOff"" N. starting laughing as I was walking toward them. I heard Paul D. say as I entered the door ""I know...I know."" If they are going to makes comments about me then they need to do it to my face...because as we all know I am not the one to fuck with when it comes to finding out you have been whispering about me behind my back. As many of my friends know I am the King of Vengence and I always get it. Regardless of the price. So Paul and Shannon need take this advice if they think their mental games of whispering will not have reprocussions.   It is now 4:09a.m.     And I am letting the bullshit from earlier get to me. I need to learn to brush it off because no matter where you go in life you will always have a barberic asshole not far behind. If shit was said so be it...if not then my bad. But all I have to say is that thank God for the truck drivers I do talk to. They are some of the nicest people I have met."
GQ4CPVF,male,24,"Fuck the pepper...pass me the EPT   I feel like I'm either pregnant or on the rag.  I am emotional one second and a bitch the next.  Does our brain tell us to go through all of this?  If it does I wish that it would just set itself on one emotion a day.  I am so impatient today that it is driving me crazy.  I am becoming more impatient with not having a special someone in my life.  I think I'm going to hire a boyfriend in the meantime.  Yeah, I am not that desperate.  Anyway, I watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (new edition) last night.  It was okay.  You see I'm not that much on horror movies because when I watch them I tend to not want to sleep.  I already have enough problems sleeping and enough issues with the dark so there you go.  But I didn't even move last night.  I haven't had a full night's sleep in about 4 months.  I took 5 Tylenol PM's and bam knocked out.  I can't do that again.  Taking all the stuff is so not good for your kidneys.  But tonight I'm gonna just because I want to sleep so badly.  Back the the subject I didn't even dream about LeatherHead or whatever they call him.  He was ugly...ugly terrifies me but for some reason no nightmare.  LeatherHead is my newest best horror movie friend.  We are doing lunch next week.  I highlighted my hair last night.  It looks wonderful.  Or as Cheri would say ""fantabulous.""  I really think God built me wrong.  I think I was supposed to have brown hair with blonde highlights when I was put together but on that day the beauty shop was all out of that style wig-for-life.  So I must chemically torment my hair and make it how I see fit.  After all I am in control of my destiny.  And destiny just happens to like me with blonde highlights.  Well kids I smell chinese food so something must be brewing.  So consider me off like a prom dress.  P.S.  And no I have never worn a dress to a prom.  Only for Halloween.  LOL."

Steven Spielberg's film adaption of Israel hunting 'n killing the Palestinian terrorists responsible for murdering its Olympic athletes at the 1972 Munich games is  urlLink going forward :   urlLink The New York Post  recently ran some gossip that Steven Spielberg's ""Mossad"" project was delayed due to concerns over terrorist threats to the production. Well,  urlLink Spielberg Films  has let it be known today that there is no truth in the Post's story regarding the film's delay, period. Steven Spielberg's spokesperson Marvin Levy cleared up the matter today with the following definitive truth:  ""Thanks for checking with us. The NY Post story was wrong about the speculation about the delay. It is and has been the script pages which continue to get to Steven almost every day. That's the reason for the delay"" Levy said. The Post story (along with many other sources) have also been calling the film ""Vengeance"", although it has been made clear a few times from DreamWorks that the project will not be specifically based on the George Jonas book ""Vengeance"" (although DreamWorks/Universal has optioned the rights to Jonas' book as it potentially is one of the contributing sources to the project). Good news. And huzzah for Mr. Spielberg! Hopefully he'll retain Ben Kingsley despite the delay."
OH30YIX,male,27,"Man oh man. The BC team can't even successfully issue a terror warning without escaping serious and warranted scrutiny. What's the deal? The LAST thing we want is to make it look in any way as though our side is politicizing something as fundementally and importantly non-political as evaluating and reporting terror threats. But these days it seems that we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. Raise the warning level and we are criticized of politicizing terrorism. Don't raise the warning level and, well, we're not making the country safe in the face of new threats. This sounds like one of those game theory matrices in which the dominant strategy is an inefficient outcome."

Easley has the initiative and control over the state agenda, why doesn't he campaign and play some positive ads about himself...unless, of course, he has nothing positive to say for his first 4 years.

WP39PNZ,female,33,"Members of the Church, from time to time, are asked  urlLink the question , “Are people excommunicated because they’re gay”.

In addition, they would be excommunicated if they were involved in any sexual activity outside of marriage. I have even  urlLink used  these as my answer when given this question.    The Lord's law of moral conduct is abstinence from sexual relations outside of lawful marriage and fidelity within marriage. ( Church Handbook of Instructions , Vol. 1, p. 157)   However, this answer lends itself to another question. What of those homosexuals in Québec or Massachusetts who are married? Would they be excommunicated if they are having sexual relations—albeit homosexual—within a lawful marriage?  If so, then why is the above answer so commonly used? If it’s not an issue of sexual relations within marriage, why do we use that to veil our answers?"

WP39PNZ,female,33,"One of the most important aspects of a good workout is to weight train, especially as one gets older. It is reported that this is the most forgotten part of most women's exercise regimes.   I love weight training. I began about 11 years ago (after trying it once in a blue moon as a teenager and pre-teen) without weights. I used Tony Little's programs as suggested by a room-mate at the time. I really enjoyed the changes it made in my muscle strength and how it helped with weight loss even without actual weights.  I continued weight lifting with some light weights after we were married, for a few months, but got out of the habit and didn't pick it up again until a few years ago. I still continued using light weights but I found it wasn't making any difference for me, or at least not much to be noticeable, so I was glad to start at the gym this past January where I would have access to heavier weights and weight machines. Now I see the difference it is making and I am really pleased! My strength and shape are really improving, I have more defined muscles and I know it is helping increase my metabolism. It also feels literally wonderful! I know it helps increase my energy and improve my cardio workout as well.  There are some common myths about weight training for women and the main one is that it will increase bulk so much that she will look like a female bodybuilder. This doesn't happen! Or at least, it won't happen without some incredible time and effort and extreme weights.   There are many benefits that weightlifting can provide women (or anyone for that matter) and these are; keeps weight off, strengthen immune system, decreases body fat, benefits certain types of arthritis, decreases osteoporosis risk by increasing bone density, increases strength and endurance, increases energy, gives you a nicer body shape (sculpts your body), makes you less prone to low-back injuries, decreases your resting blood pressure, decreases your risk of developing adult onset diabetes, decreases your gastrointestinal transit time thus reducing your risk for developing colon cancer, increases your blood level of HDL cholesterol (the good type),improves your posture, lowers your resting heart rate which is a sign of a more efficient heart, improves your balance and coordination and elevates your mood.  Frankly I can't see any negatives to it! It doesn't have to be a difficult process either. You can start out with 1 lb weights and I believe you can even get half lb weights. You can adapt your workout to fit almost any body type or physical challenge. When Tony Little first started his no weight strength training program it was because he couldn't do actual weight bearing exercise due to the fact he had been in a severe car accident and was in a wheelchair for a significant period of time. So you can even start without weights by making the movements and tensing the muscles. Weight can be added as time goes on. Exercise balls are a wonderful addition to strength training as well and I am learning to make good use of them. I used to shy away from them, but I love them now! They are great for all sorts of strength and balance training, and wonderfully beneficial for the all important core training.   So it's a part of exercise I HIGHLY recommend! Have a wonderfully active day!"
WP39PNZ,female,33,"We were discussing chapters 31 through 33 of 2 Nephi today. One thing bugged me that always bugs me.  It seems to be a popular belief that we are baptised to receive a remission of our sins, or more specifically baptism washes our sins away. The problem with this conception is that it minimises the role repentance plays in the conversion process.  Remission of sins is not granted through baptism alone or solely on the merits of baptism. Remission of sins comes as a result of our commitment to Jesus, just as it does after baptism. For our sins to be remitted we first need to exercise faith in the Saviour. We need to exercise faith that He lives, He loves us, He overcame the effects of physical and spiritual death and that his life is an ideal pattern for us to follow.   urlLink Amulek taught  that following our faith will eventually lead us to repent. As our faith in Jesus grows our desire to be more like Him grows also. This in turn will convince us to both feel sorrow for and forsake our sins. This is done through repentance.  Following the forgiveness of our sins and commitment to be like Him, we feel a desire to express our commitment. We do so through baptism. Baptism serves as the manifestation of the covenant we make with Our Brother to follow Him.  Following baptism, we are baptised by fire and the Holy Ghost, which subsequently  urlLink sanctifies us .  You see, remission of sins comes as a result of a process. We need to have faith in Jesus, repent of our sins, be baptised and receive the Holy Spirit. I honestly fail how leaving out the other three (whether literally or intellectually) can honestly give us a remission of sins.                  urlLink Read more..."

WP39PNZ,female,33,"Well I am supposed to do my stats this Sunday but you will all have to wait for a few days, probably Wednesday. Don't worry, I still plan on updating. I will be at the end of my second set of 12 weeks! Wow, I can't believe I am through it twice already. One more set to go!  Anyway, on a sort of unrelated but not really unrelated topic, we start school in less than 2 weeks (30 Aug). Sinéad is beginning Grade 1. And Regan is ""beginning"" preschool. Not officially but he doesn't want to be left out so we are ""starting school"" for him too. We are homeschooling and I have been planning and scheduling and we are going to be BUSY. With my workouts and school and field trips and housework and playtime and laundry and just everything we are going to be one hectic household. But in a way I am looking forward to it because I am way more organised and under control when I have a ton of stuff to do! We are planning it week by week because...well, life happens! I still have time for morning gym visits then we do school in the afternoon. I will have to wake up early though to get my housework done. But that's ok! I am excited to start homeschooling and so is Miss Sinéad. She wishes we were starting TODAY! Grandma bought her a Barbie lunchbox even though she won't really need it to GO to school but it will sure come in handy for field trips and picnic lunches. Regan even got a Spiderman lunchbox. Ah, the joys of childhood.Don't ask me why they are so infatuated with Spiderman or Barbie. It honestly just happened. I used to say that my daughter/s wouldn't be Barbie fanatics because of the whole Barbie image, but Sinéad over-ruled me and so it happened. We don't go overboard though, lol. Sinéad starts ballet again a couple of weeks into September (her 3rd year) and we have to buy new ballet shoes again! Her feet just keep a-growing. Anyway, I know this seems unrelated to my odyssey, but it is related too, because well, just because. :)"
WP39PNZ,female,33,"Microsoft released Windows XP Service Pack 2 yesterday. Part of the service pack includes updates to Internet Explorer.   On the plus side, IE now  urlLink comes with  a native pop-up blocker. It also requires user authentication for drive-by downloads. Another cool feature is the “Add-On Manger”, which is similar to Firefox’s extensions manager.  On the minus side, these improvements are only for Windows XP users. As well, there appears to be no change in its level of compliance with web standards. Of course, there is still no tabbed browsing.  The  changes are welcome, but I do not know why IE is so intent on letting the competition slowly gain market share. Microsoft seems unusually content in its current market share of the web browser market, but its failure at innovation and adoption of web standards and consumer-drive conventions is causing a slow but steady exodus to better products.  I will stick with  urlLink Firefox  at home."

What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?  Novels. And nonfiction (mostly science, philosophy, or anything that catches my eye) I love fiction. I write it too, by the way.  2. What is your favorite novel?  Here's my list. 1. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, Douglas Adams 2. Life of Pi, Yann Martel 3. American Gods, Neil Gaiman 4. Jurassic Park, Crichton 5. Any Discworld Novel by Terry Pratchett  3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Honestly I don't read poetry. I write it, and I love to do so, but I think other people's poetry is dull because it's written just for them, a direct outpouring of a soul. Which is also why I don't really let people read mine.  4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  The classics. I have Moby Dick, Don Quiote, and A Tale of Two Cities on my shelf, never sat down and read them.  5. What are you currently reading?  As it says to the right, a book for general readers about string theory, and also a novel about a postwar european detective I just picked up."

4VSEFM9,male,34,"I don’t know if this makes any sense or not, but here is a stream-of consciousness idea for your consideration.  I have heard of alcoholics or dug addicts having a brief moment where the logical mind makes one final, intense push for the person’s attention, the so-called “moment of clarity”. I definitely can relate to that from a depression standpoint. No matter how miserable or messed up the Beast has made you feel, there are moments where your logical mind forces you to look at everything about yourself and your world, good, bad, and in between, with a non-judgmental eye. Intervention from friends, loved ones, or even just caring strangers willing to help another human being, is very helpful, but sometimes the realization must come from within. If you can recognize this and honestly appreciate the good parts of life, no matter how briefly, I think it gives strength to carry on, to struggle though the darkness, and hope for recovery.  My heart hurts with the realization that there are many who cannot or will not see the good and gain strength. I think I have gained more compassion for people who seemingly have nothing to live for, but they probably do. It is just hidden too deep for them to see, shrouded in a fog of mental illness or addiction, and it is even more difficult for anyone else to see."

I realized then that Joe Normal had dimples. How had I missed that before? It made him a bit out of the ordinary. Oh, well.  I decided if he was free of lower body peircings, I wouldn't fault him the dimples.  Dimples! Why in the name of Aunt Susie's fuzzy navel, was I stuck on the dimples?  I realized I was starting to like Joe already, and it was only 8:30... too soon for attachment.  Sometimes these things go off schedual. I reminded myself. It's happened before you know. Liking the guy before he made it to your room. You still went through with it.  True. I did, but it was hard.

""What can I get for you?"" a waiter in a green T-shirt and cut-offs asked between smacks of chewing gum.  ""There's no chance you have anything stronger than a Mr. Pibb is there?"" I asked.  ""You can get a pitcher of beer if you have an I.D.""  Beer! Yuck! The last time I'd guzzled that crap, I woke up in a pool of urine and vomit that I was sure had to taste better than the liquid that got me there.  Just then a kid threw a rubber ball across the room and smacked me in the side of the head.  I dug in my purse for the I.D. ""Make that TWO pitchers."" I said"

1Z7404S,female,35,"What drains the passion from a person? There used to be a time when there wasn't enough time for me to say all the things I wanted to. Now, I can hardly think of anything worth saying. I've been thinking about the hair story I started some time ago and have been feeling a little interested in working on it and seeing where it goes. The main problem is I'm not entirely sure what I want it to talk about. At the time I started it, I was playing with the idea of how asian beauty is processed in the American psyche, which I still think is a good motivator. But what do I want to say about it. I think there are still a lot of stereotypes about people of asian decent in America--primarily that they are somehow still foreign and not actually from America. People always ask where are you from. What's your nationality? As if America and American cannot be the answer. So we're back to the way asian beauty is processed and how asian woman view themselves in relation to the American ideals of beauty. I like to see how the ""hipper"" asian women do things like have their eyes widened and dye their hair blonde. I should say Korean women, because I don't know if Japanese-, Chinese-, etc.-American women do these things. But Korean-American women love looking good. They love their DKNY, they love their cellphones, they love their platform shoes, they love their razor-sharp hairstyles, they love their cosmetic tattoos."

I'm sitting here thinking about going grocery shopping before I pick up my daughter rather than after. My primary reason for wanting to shop without her is that I get away cheaper for the trip when she's not with me. I remember when my siblings and I were children we'd drive our mother crazy by re-enacting the commercials for every product she picked off the shelves. My daughter doesn't recite the commercials as much as tell me  why  I should get a certain product.  ""Mom, this helps you clean everything really quickly. Like, super quick."" ""How do you know this?"" ""I saw the commercial, and it worked really fast."" ""What do we say about the stuff on television?"" ""It's a lie.""  Well, I am off to grocery shop sans the child."

1Z7404S,female,35,"Today I've got another really special guest with me in the studio. Her name is Kristen and she's an archaeologist in Texas with the U.S. Army. Kristen and I went to high school together in Utah. Being non-Mormon in Utah is enough to make people friends in high school there, but we were also reporters on  the school newspaper together, and that's probably how we really got to know each other. Kristen also was a very good friend of my sister's, who was in the same year as Kristen. I'm a year older than the two of them, so I was really more of a mature, fiercely intelligent woman role model for Kristen. :-) At any rate, let's get started with the interview.  KC: Kristen, when we were in high school, you were really committed to the idea of becoming a journalist. You wanted to go to Columbia and really go all the way with it. I'm curious to know how you shifted gears and ended up in archaeology.  KW: good question! When I went to college, I started out a communication major with every intention of becoming an international journalist. I diligently signed up for my first required courses in communications (a core requirement of courses had to be filled before you could be ""accepted"" into the journalism program or something like that).  The first course had some vague innocuous title like ""Intro. to Mass Communications.""  On the first day of class our instructor had us go around the room and explain why we were in communications as a major.  To my dismay I was surrounded with a bunch of eager freshman wanting to become (and these are quotes), a ""PR representative making 80k a year"" and, my personal favorite, ""the next Jane Pauley""....now that in and of itself was not enough to drive me away from the field...after all I was an idealist, hopeful that I could save the world through obective reporting of world events.  However, with every assignment, I became more dejected about the field.  One of our projects was to develop a ""spin"" for the Exxon Oil Company in addressing the Valdez Oil Spill.  In hindsight, I can see that there was a reason to prepare an assignment, this was a general communication class not a journalism class.  I was offended and simply wrote a paper saying that I would encourage Exxon to admit their error and take proactive steps to mitigate the damage, working in conjunction with the environmental groups who were the most vocal about the spill to clean-up the spill.  I received a C for not thinking creatively in how to spin the issue.  The PR wannabe-Young Republican who wore a tie to class everyday received an A for finding a way to blame it all on the Captain and not directly acknowledge fault.  I hated the class and stopped giving it my all immediately...there were mountains to hike and hours to be spent hanging out talking about important issues.    At the same time that I was dragging myself reluctantly to that class, I was thinking back on a class I had taken the quarter before.  The class was called ""The Human Past"" and it intrigued me.  I had never been too much into science in high school but in this class, genetics and the role of physical sciences in uncovering the mystery of human evolution and adaptation fascinated me.  The class was writing intensive and after the first exam, the professor had berated a mortified room of students about the poor quality of writing and how disappointed he was that only 3 students had managed to write coherently and earn an A.  Well, you can guess who one of those students was!  Nothing like a little positive reinforcement.    I still hadn't given up my journalistic goals, but I had become more interested in pursuing international politics as a degree rather than communications which I felt wasn't going to give me what I wanted (in my idealistic mind).  I can't really pinpoint when I decided to officially pursue becoming an archaeologist, I just know that the classes in cultural anthropology I took to supplement my international politics class were far more interesting and stimulating to me.  I loved exploring the mystery of how culture defines us as human beings and the role it has played in world geopolitics.  After my first archaeology class, I became even more hooked on the idea of literally digging stuff up to piece together history.  I loved being outdoors and out in remote places, I found it hard and still find it hard to spend long periods in big cities and stuck in offices.  I thought archaeology was the perfect way for me to stimulate my mind and my body at the same time...and now, over a decade later, here I am!     I could go on and on about it, people are confused. You should have seen my parents when I said I was switching majors, I consoled my Dad with the idea that because of the intensive writing involved in Anthropology, many people used it as a springboard for law school.  In all reality, I did toy with that idea as I wanted to pursue Environmental and Native American Rights law, but couldn't give up dig-in-the dirt archaeology.  Also, as an irony, the girl who was editor-in-chief of paper before me, Sherri Murry, also became an archaeologist. She got her masters like me and works in SLC as a professional archaeologist.  Isn't that funny?  KC: Actually, I don't think it's such a far stretch that you (or Sherri) ended up in archaeology because it's still a form of story-telling, and not in the sense of fictional story-telling, but in the journalistic sense. What do you do? You piece together bits of evidence you've collected to come up with a bigger picture and cohesive story of what happened. Like you, I became disillusioned with the journalistic field when I was in college because it seemed so obvious the push was more on how you had to write a story to increase submissions and viewers. I did consider just switching to PR because I thought, hey, that's really all it is. I'd rather just be truthful and call it what it is. In the end, I finished out with journalism, but you can see it's not where I stayed. I got sick of writing what other people wanted me to write and not being able to tell what I saw as the truth, so I focus on my fiction now because I can tell the stories I want to tell. Now, with all of that out of my system...what comes to your mind when you hear ""Utah?""  KW: Love your comments about your own experience with Journalism.  I don't think PR is so bad now either, after all, at least it is explicit, whereas I wonder with the media...whether swinging a blatant liberal or conservative agenda it bothers me that there is very little objectivity.  First thing that comes to mind when I hear ""utah""?  Well the first thing I do is physically cringe (I swear! I did it just now)...the second thing I think of is ""STERILE"" and ""STIFLING""...it is a place that just scares the s#$t out of me because I think it tends to just drain the individuality out of people in the long run.  My brother still lives there with a wife who comes from a mormon family.  She doesn't practice the religion but she carries the values and behavior at some intrinsic level despite her attempt at liberal posturing...and my brother, my family feels like he isn't the same person, he has started talking like a Utahan,  you know that sing-song kind of nervous voice...and they are just so sorta uptight and afraid of anything different.  In fact, this year was the very first time their whole family traveled out of state to come see my parents and us in Santa Fe.   My brother thinks Utah is so great, but I just can't stand it, the minute I get there I start feeling repressed.  Does that make sense? I went there for some training with a co-worker and he didn't believe all the stuff I said about it but after a day or two, he changed his tune to ""I can't believe you are right, this place just FEELS oppressive.""  And now with all the growth, it has all the negatives of big cities with none of the positives despite all their attempts to internationalize (is that a word) the place for the olympics.  There is a woman I work with here who is a civil engineer and she grew up an airforce brat in Layton.  She is Catholic and the first time we both realized we were from Utah and NOT mormon we both launched into this laundry list of common things we hated about the place.  She never wants to go back there to live, even though her parents retired there and she does visit them with her husband and child.   There is just something that Utah does to you, there was an article on MSNBC.Com during the Olympics from a reporter who grew up there as a Non-Mormon and it really articulated the experience well. I wish I had bookmarked it!  Have you read that Jon Krakeur book on the polygamists in Utah? It really is a well-written history about Utah in general that really captures the overall feeling of being in Utah and not running with the Righteous so to speak!  KC: Actually, I haven't read the book you mention,  but last I time I was in Utah visiting my friend Erin, I actually got to see a polygamist family up close and personal. We were hiking at Zion and we were at the visitor's center and there they were in all their glory. I was really excited because I'd never seen a polygamist when I lived there. Oddly enough, they reminded me of the Amish. They kind of dressed that way. The really funny thing (maybe not so funny, really) is that the husband was just gross looking. I mean, there was nothing about him that would make you look at him twice, let alone let him touch you, and there he was with his multiple wives?banging away every night, I'm sure. I'm sure they didn't appreciate me staring at them like they were an exhibit in a zoo. When I first started college, people couldn't believe the things I told them about living there. I do try to get back every few years to visit friends, because they're still my friends despite it all, and I can't help but lovin' them. Now, who is the guy in your past that you think ""what if"" about?  KW: Yeah I saw polygamists when I worked in a government public affairs office in college there, they would come in for forms and stuff...kinda funny how they are anti-government until they need welfare and stuff like that because the man is too lazy and busy procreating to earn a living to support all these women and children...very strange..people do have a hard time understanding what it is like. When I used to spend my summers up north of the Arctic Circle, my colleagues looked forward to the after dinner relaxation in the kitchen tent and would pester me for stories of Utah and Mormons..funny, huh?  What guy do I think ""What If""?  Easiest question ever, I've always wondered about a guy in high school in Virginia, Christopher Getty.  When I started school there after moving from Austin, TX, I felt in major culture shock. My family had moved us from the richest school district in Austin (where we were the ""poor"" family) to the middle of rural Virginia farm country where we were suddenly, the ""Richest.""  I had never been out of the suburbs except on vacation and was shocked by the demographics of the high school population.  They were equally shocked by me with my odd clothing (MTV had been a staple in Austin).  Christopher was this preppy guy who had moved there the year before from Texas and he was immediately friendly to me and started talking about Texas and our shared love of good music.  He was popular, a swim team member, fine looking and he was always a good friend to me.  I'm sure his prepster friends gave him a hard time about me (oooh, it sounds so ""Pretty in Pink"" now!), but he never shied away from being a friend to me when they were around or anything like that.  Of course, he never asked me out on a date or anything but when I moved to Utah, I remember being shocked that he had actually written me back after I sent him a letter (he actually sent me a tape that he talked on and put some tunes on, I thought it was cool).  I don't know what happened to him, I'm sure he is either settled down and happily married with 1.5 kids or maybe even gay (with my luck)! But I always thought we would have ended up a really cool odd couple!!  There is also Preston Trent Staats from my junior high days in Texas. We were going steady until I dramatically broke up with him for daring to want to hold my hand in school!! Too much physical contact for me in my opinion! I thought he was even geekier and more boring than me.  He tried to win me back with a Garfield calendar at Christmas....I wasn't impressed.  I later found out from my best friend there (who I still talk to also!) that he ended up becoming an Olympic level swimmer (actually tried out for Olympic team, may have been on it) and was really good looking and had got a PHD in computer science and owned his own software company in Austin and ran triathlons...sigh...don't know where he is now, maybe Austin but also might be getting an MBA at Harvard last I heard (ironically I don't know if he is married, but I can't imagine he isn't!  What about you? Who is your ""what if?""  Is it someone from Weber?  hint hint, anyone I know ;^)  Sorry my answers are so long! I can't shut up when it comes to dredging up memories!  KC: My ""what if"" is a fellow Weberite; although, I don't know if you knew him. I dated him the summer before I started college, my friend Erin's brother Steve. It was a very whirlwind sort of romance and the only one in my life where I felt completely swept off my feet. Of course, there were too many barriers for it to really work. There was the religion issue, just to begin with, and the fact that he was in Utah and I was in Pennsylvania. But, I still like to wonder about it because it's really the only relationship I've had where it came to an end because of logistics rather than due to the fact that we were done with each other. There's nothing more intriguing than a relationship that didn't have the chance to run itself out. At any rate, he made me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world at a point in life when every girl should get to feel that way. So, I owe him a lot for that. Also, don't apologize for the long answers?you're an interviewer's dream. No prodding needed here. :-) OK, I'm going to liberate you now. What thing from your past have you been hiding because you'd be absolutely mortified if anyone knew?  KW:I remember you dating someone but I can't remember the guy!  Oh well, I'm surprised I remember as much as I do, but it always seems to be odd stuff, like the place I used to eat lunch at Weber with Angie, some stairwell near our lockers and I'd hog all Ang's lunch because it was usually some awesome leftovers of your mom's Korean cooking (the fact that there is not one but several Korean restaurants around me since it is an army town balances the negatives of being in Central Texas! Although I still can't find some of the things your Mom made (some spicy pancake and a kinda stew like thing with rolled up ricecakes sticks in it...mmmm)  Anyways, I digress, as usual.....avoiding the issue obviously.  What thing are you hiding from your past that you would be absolutely mortified if anyone knew???? I suppose it would have to be an affair I had with a fellow graduate student whilst I was coming to the end of a turbulent romance with my ex-fianc?e...although we had officially decided to become unengaged we were still a couple working on things supposedly (although it was mostly me trying to deal with this very intelligent, tortured writer guy trying to get into graduate school for philosophy).  The fellow student was someone who WAS just engaged to a girl he had dated for 7 years and who I knew and liked.  They were also having relationship problems, but that really is not justification for what happened.  It was an easy way to escape problems by running to someone else.  It stopped obviously although I have to admit by that point I was starting to like him a lot since my relationship was failing so miserably.  He married the girl but they ended up divorcing a year later (weird huh, almost 10 years together and then marriage made them implode).  He rushed out and married the next girl he dated and they have a kid.  We email as friends but we've never really talked about what happened. I feel most awful about my ex-fianc?e, for all his faults, he was always faithful to me and made me feel beautiful.  He just was so devoted to reading, wandering the wilderness on solitary journeys and writing that there wasn't a lot of room for me.  I really wanted us to work but even though we tried after our ""Disengagement"", it didn't really work. I think the main problem is that I could never really come clean and tell him what happened and he deserved to know that...but I was afraid it would devastate him and felt ashamed.  So I've kept it to myself, only two other people really know it happened.  My ex-fianc?e and I stay in touch, he has moved toFrance to pursue his writing dream, but I still can't bring myself to tell him.  Shameful isn't it? I hope you edit this down! I used to feel really awful about this, while I'm still not thrilled with it, after observing and talking with people over the years, I realize I'm not the only one who has made some hurtful choices in my life.  KC:Wow! I don't have anything that good. All my secrets revolve around stuff I haven't told my parents. So, I'm going to come clean with you. Dad, that time Laura Glenn got drunk and I told you I didn't, well, I did. I feel really bad about that one because when my father looked me straight in the eye and asked if I was telling the truth, I looked him straight back in the eye and said, ""When have I ever lied to you before?"" And he took my word for it. Also, I took birth control pills in college and had sex before I got married. OK, that felt good. Now, in what way do you think we (Americans) as a culture have failed our children?  KW: Man, you are so good! I debated about just going with the run of the mill, I lied to my parents, but I never really did. I always told them about when I drank and my parents pretty much accepted me living with my ex-fianc?e and knew I was sexually active, they just wanted to make sure I was safe and covered my bases...my Mom took me to the doctor so I could get my birth control pills!!!  My Dad just kinda pretended he didn't know it was all going on! It was safer for him that way!  In what ways have we as Americans as a culture failed our children?  I have to say that there are probably many ways we have failed: in not protecting our environment more, in not protecting our country more, in not giving greater recognition to the past and in emphasizing the ""Me"" in American....I hope I can write my ideas out here because there are a lot of things that bother me.  It bothers me that kids today are exposed to so much hedonistic and greedy behavior via the ""role models"" put out there by the media. Whether it be Britney Spears or Kobe Bryant (I know innocent until proven guilty but still his behavior was wrong) or 50 Cent the rapper, we feed our kids a culture that it is o.k. to be a superficial person.  If people say to me that Britney Spears is about female empowerment, I laugh, she doesn't even know how to spell the word much less explain what it means (and I'm not saying girls should stomp around in combat boots and not shave their legs, just that I don't think Britney gets balancing femininity with equality). Kids today get bombarded with the notion that the easiest way to be a success is to sing well like on American Idol or play sports or just be attractive.  The show Survivor summarizes to me the problems I see in American Culture.  As an anthropologist, the notion of Tribe means a group of folks with shared values and behavior who stay together as a result of their common experience.  On the show survivor, the goal is to outsmart and outwit your teammates to win a big wad of money.  That doesn't make any sense, a ""tribe"" would never behave in that way.  In most primitive societies, groups of people banded together find communal sharing a better way to deal with exterior pressures.    I feel sad, I think we grew up in a generation that was more socially and politically conscious than youth today.  The technology that was supposed to improve education for future generations in some ways is contributing to its demise...videogames, sound bytes, etc.....in some ways we have shortened the attention span of an entire generation!  Awareness and study of the past, of theatre, of art, of literature are all important aspects of a modern society.  I don't think the Technological and Scientific advances we've seen would have taken place without them...it is like that Sting commercial for music and math, have you seen it?  I guess that sounds really depressing and it probably shouldn't.  First of all, I don't have kids so I guess I don't have a great perspective although I do outreach and programs at a lot of schools and am sometimes horrified by what I see.  On the other hand, I do think there is a lot of hope for the future based on my positive experiences from schools and also from witnessing my own niece and nephews.  There is plenty of good out there, I just hope that this fascination with the gluttonous media blob of reality tv and greed is balanced out some.      Phew, this soapbox is making me dizzy!!! If that doesn't make any sense, I wouldn't be surprised, I was putting down my thoughts quickly.  Edit down or condense into something legible, if you can!  This was great fun!  KC: Is that your polite way of telling me you've got more important things to do right now? :-)  KW: no! I'm still finishing up lunch! It just sounded like it might be the last question! Gal, I could write all day about stuff and since I'm stuck in front of a computer anyway with this mapping I'm doing, what the hell? :^)  KC: OK, since you're still willing to answer questions. What's the best piece of gossip you've heard about someone we went to high school with?  KW: What is the best piece of gossip from high school?  Geez, I don't know, I remember hearing that one of my best friends, Jodee Knight, got married and divorced later which was kinda shocking to me....I also found out that a guy (Danny Wade) I was in World History with ended up being gay and living with a flight attendant partner in SLC(and he was not a drama guy, he hung with the popular-sporto crowd)....Seems like I should having something more ""juicy""...I mean Angie is a little bit of a story but she is my friend so I don't count that!  I think I was gossip for a little while because when I was at home after my freshman year, I hung out with Brian White and we both had become, um very briefly, deadhead potheads...I'm sure some of the old crew talked about that but we were in college so it was ok to be smokin' (and I did smoke cigarettes for a long time and lived with someone out of wedlock, gasp, the shame!)... I feel like there is someone big I'm missing but can't think of it....whatchya got?  Anything good?  KC: No, I don't have anything really, really good. Although, I did hear that before Jennifer Cragun got married she went in for a gyn check-up and the doctor felt a large tumor on one of her ovaries, so they scheduled for immediate surgery because they thought it might be cancer and when they opened her up, the tumor was an egg that had tried to develop without being fertilized and it had teeth and bone in it. Of course, when told this, I found it hard to believe and said, ""Are you sure it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy and they're just trying to cover up the fact that she had sex before marriage?"" I still think that's the case. But that's probably the best thing I've heard. Did you even know who Jennifer Cragun was? You were friends with Jodee Knight? I have to say that really shocks me. There was nothing about her that would make me think you could be friends with her. I definitely want to hear more on this, but, alas, I have to go pick-up [my daughter] from school.

1Z7404S,female,35,"The Cure is playing on the streaming radio station I like to listen to. Cool beans. Looks like it's going to be good weather this weekend, which bodes extremely well for my barbeque. Maybe the child is coming home tonight, maybe not. Hopefully, she'll be home tonight. But you never quite know with my mother. Apparently they were all in Ocean City for the past couple of days. Wish I could've been there. I wish I could interview someone. If you know someone interesting, let me know about them. It would seem I've exhausted my supply of interesting people. I've sent out a couple of stories in the past week. We'll see how this round goes. I'm sleepy and my neck hurts. If I ever get really rich, I'm going to hire a personal chiropractor to crack my neck for me whenever I desire it."
1Z7404S,female,35,"So, I really have nothing to talk about but I am going out of my mind with boredom. I figure rambling on the ole blog should fill a little time. I saw this program the other night on Discovery channel about face transplants. There are three surgical teams around the world currently working on performing a face transplant. The hope is that this sort of surgery would make it possible for people who have been severely injured and deformed by, say, fire to live relatively normal lives again. The doctors want to transplant the face of a dead donor onto the receipient's face. It was really fascinating. It was particularly interesting because the night before watching this program, I happened to watch this movie on HBO called Something the Lord Made about the first heart surgery.   The show and movie parallel each other because they both deal with radical new surgeries of their time. It's interesting to watch how ignorant it seemed for doctors to be so afraid to operate on the heart back then because heart surgery is so common place now. You wonder why were they so afraid. But watching the show on face transplants, you see that that's how many people are greeting the idea of this type of surgery. There's a lot of fear. Like heart surgery today, I'm sure face transplants won't phase a soul in fifty years.  I am now heading into my third week without the child. I miss her. Although, I'm sure when she's back and we're caught up in the normal routine of life, I'll wonder why I spent so much time wishing away my freedom. We always want what we don't have, stupid humans that we are. We've got the big barbeque this weekend. Should be fun. Hopefully the good weather they are predicting will hold true."

In his tenure with the Yankees, El Duque pitched ably (but certainly not spectacularly) for several seasons... yet he thrived during the postseason.  Will El Duque make the Hall?  Of course not.  If Brady keeps up his pace, should he?  Of course not.

I'm not a fan of Will Farrell, especially in large doses, but the movie did have a few quality laughs, particularly from Steve Carell of ""The Daily Show.""  It's also loaded with guest stars and cameos: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Jack Black.  This group, along with Owen Wilson, has become the equivalent of the crop of comedians who appeared in some combination in basically every comedy from the early 80's: Bill Murray, John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Harold Ramis.  Compare their talents and the films they were in ( Ghostbusters ,  Stripes ,  Caddyshack ,  Vacation ,  Little Shop of Horrors , even  The Great Outdoors ) to the work of the current guys and there is no comparison.

C46XW2J,female,23,"urlLink      If you've been following this at all, you'll know that this past weekend we had Brooke's Bachelorette Party. [insert super-excitement here] Very kindly, Katie's father loaned us his beach house in Orange County for the entire weekend, and also paid for all food and alcohol we consumed in his house, as well as the limo for Saturday night. (Not to be outdone, Katie's mother - her parents are divorced - paid for a very lavish dinner Friday night.) Here are some pictures from the event - all the  good  pictures are unfortunately still on my other camera, and need to be developed. But here's a taste.       urlLink     These are the monogrammed goodie bags that we put together for everyone. They all contain a personalised margarita glass and mix CD and a penis-shaped swizzle stick (nothing but the classiest!). The bride's bag also contained a tiara, an inflated penis balloon and a candy necklace. You know, the essential going-out accessories.         urlLink     This is Chad, our pin-up doll. We couldn't find pin-the-penis on the pin-up, so instead it was bow ties. We were all aiming for his neck, where a bow tie should properly go. Brooke was aiming for the crotch region, and you'll see she got quite close (hers is the brown bow-tie very close to his underwear). Me, I don't have so much aim. Mine is the one on the ankle.          urlLink     This is some of the alcohol we consumed. Note the cute festive margarita glasses. Here, we're drinking chocolate martinis - equal parts vanilla Stoli and creme de cacao, with a floater of Godive liqueur, and a rim of cocoa powder. After this, we played that wonderful drinking game, Never Have I Ever, and I learned far more about Brooke's sex life than I wanted to know.          urlLink     This is more alcohol. Please note that there are six bottles of wine. Those are Katie's dad's ""cheaper"" bottles. The red is a 1990 vintage. It was amazing. There was a lot more white in the fridge, along with bottles of Veuve Cliquot. We actually did not get through it all, surprisingly. But that's because after I started making Negronis (equal parts Campari, gin and Punta Mes, along with half a juiced orange), we didn't really remember that the wine existed.   urlLink     Because I am obsessed with food, this is the pizza that I made using the pizza oven. It had pepperoni, mushrooms, roasted garlic, provolone and mozzarella cheese. It was amazing. It was even better in the morning when I was hungover beyond belief. Yum. Pizza.  So Friday night was the quiet night, as everyone had to get down to the beach house. We had dinner, then played drinking games. After a day tanning outside, Saturday evening we made pizza, drank some more, then took the limo up to Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, where we went to such infamous establishments such as  urlLink Saddle Ranch Chop House , where we made Brooke ride a mechanical bull, and  urlLink http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/78219?cslink=search_name_noncust&ulink=search__searchslot1_520__0_profile_5_1"">Miyagi's , where we danced some. I hope  never  to return to these places - they're so gross and icky, but absolutely perfect for a bachelorette party because they're full of sketchy guys who will eat candy off Brooke's candy necklace, and make a big production out of the entire affair. The penis balloon was an amazing hit. So it was fun, even if the bachelorette was more appropriately attired for an evening at the country club instead of an evening out on the town. Who wears white pants going out? But whatever. What's important is that we all had tons of fun, were very drunk the entire weekend... and ohmygod it's so scary that the next time I see Brooke will be in August, for her wedding. But I'll have a fit later about how we're too young at 24 to be getting married.   Good times were had, and that's all that matters."
C46XW2J,female,23,"So last night, I did something I always hate doing. Gah, nothing illegal, take your dirty mind out of the gutter. It was a whole lot less innocent than that, but in my book, such a no-no. I took sleeping pills to fall asleep.  I've always been a lucky person when it comes to sleep-related matters. That is, I close my eyes, and fall asleep. Just like that. A heavy sleep, too. It used to annoy the crap out of my college roommate, who suffered from insomnia and had to take prescription sleeping pills that only worked half of the time, and ear plugs, in order to fall asleep and hopefully stay asleep. It really annoyed her those times the phone rang when we were both asleep - in my blissful conked out state, I wouldn't hear it, but she unfortunately would, so she'd have to climb down off her loft in order to answer it - and most of the time, the call was for me. (Generally, some guy I had hooked up with the week before who was hoping for a late-night booty call - the poor manners! If they had called while I was awake, I probably would have obliged!)  And I think that sleeping pills are generally such a bad idea - if you go to bed around the same time every night, get enough sleep so that you don't have to rely on caffeine to stay awake the next day, you don't really need them. Or, at least, this is what I keep telling crankypants, who has the very bad habit of drinking like 5 Diet Cokes (at least it's Coke now, he used to drink Pepsi which I think tastes like sugary swill), then  needing  to take sleeping pills to fall asleep to counteract the caffeine he's ingested during the day. Obviously, if he cut out the cola, he wouldn't need the sleeping pills. Anyhow..  Being in medical school, in addition to tampering with my health, has also screwed up my sleep. In that, sometimes I get so stressed out I can't sleep. Okay, wait, that never happens. Haha. I'm just trying to blame something else on med school.   However, the debacle of the previous night, where I couldn't stay asleep because I was  so  sick, just sucked, and I was determined that that wouldn't happen again. So out came the sleeping pills (OTC stuff. None of the fun prescription drugs. I don't see the benefit in having two doctors as parents if they don't prescribe you the good drugs. However, I have enough Cipro to protect the entire East Coast in case of an anthrax attack, I swear.).   But then I started worrying. The reason I couldn't sleep the night before was because I got so congested I couldn't breathe, so I'd have to get up to blow my nose. What would happen if I was knocked right now, got so congested I couldn't breathe, and then  died ? That would be a horrible way to die - death by snot.   So I fretted over this matter for awhile.. and then decided, what the hell, might as well take the sleeping pills. If I died, so be it. But if I wasted another day languishing on my futon (which really is a lot of fun) instead of studying for finals, it would not be so good.   It turned out to be a good idea in the end. I had a quite lovely dream about Paris.. actually, all of my dreams are stressful, for some reason, and involve some modicum of strife, trouble, worry and/or angst. It's really very curious. Why can't I have nice peaceful dreams?  And my dream got all sorts of facts about Paris wrong. I mean, there is no such place as the Place d'Ailancourt, and the 19th arrondisement is not in the southeast corner of Paris. And Paris does not look like Fantasyland. And if you don't have money to pay the cabdriver, acceptable currency are not animation cells that are on a film strip that you pull out of your camera. I know where all the Herve Chapelier stores are - there are only two, not three like I dreamed, and they're in the 1st and in the Latin Quarter, not over in the 13th. I also know where all the Petit Bateau stores are, and none of them are in the 13th either. It is quite sad that I do remember this, yet can't remember diddly-squat about medical school.  However, the one fact I did get right in my dream was regarding my favourite restaurant of all time, Au Gamin de Paris. I even remembered the correct street address in my dream - 51, rue Vielle-du-Temple, in the Marais. It's nothing fancy, usually isn't in any guidebooks.. but it is the best place ever. I was first introduced to it my sophomore year in college, when my roommate and I went to Paris for spring break and dined there - her grandparents had an apartment around the corner, so lucky her, she'd known about it for forever. It's definitely not Alain Ducasse, but it's good, solid food. The kind of cooking where they allow the quality of the food to shine through, rather than it being all about technique and decoration. It's the first place I'll eat at when I arrive in Paris, and the last one before I leave, it holds  that  kind of place in my heart. When I studied in Paris the spring of my junior year, I'd eat there approximately once a week. I'd always order the same thing - salade au confit de canard, a carafe of the house white, and finish with a slice of their amazing gateau au chocolat a la mode, or the tarte aux fraises, if it was in season. It sounds simple, but it was simply transcendent - the salad was a bed of mixed greens, with this amazing dressing, chunks of duck confit, and apples scattered in there as well. The desserts were always on display at the bar when you walked in - it was truly a treat when the strawberry tarts were in season, their crust was flaky and buttery, the strawberries naturally sweet. The chocolate cake was another marvel - dense, rich and amazing, it needed the ice cream to cut the chocolatey goodness. And the people there were never mad that I bucked traditional French convention and only ordered a salad and dessert, rather than a first course (which would have been the salad), a second (usually some meat or fish) and then dessert. Rather, they were amused that I ordered the exact same thing every meal, and often joked that they weren't even going to bother giving me a menu because what would be the use?   That was indeed a fantastic semester of eating. I even lost weight, eating everything I wanted - probably because I walked everywhere. When they'd have yet another transportation strike, instead of cabbing it home, I'd walk back from my office in near Place de l'Opera to my apartment near the Bastille. Not a short walk, by any means, but it would be quite pleasant. And I'd walk around during my 90-minute lunch breaks - primarily because I hated eating by myself. And I ate all the bread, chocolate and cheese I wanted, drank more than my fair share of wine.. and I lost weight. Ah, the unfairness of it all. I really need to move back to Paris, that's what it is. And after describing my favourite meal at Au Gamin... sigh.  The next year, I returned for spring break, and of course dragged everyone to Au Gamin for our first dinner. When we sat down, the owner of the restaurant came over to our table and said, ""Welcome back, it's been such a long time!"" Quite honestly, there's no better greeting than that. (This annoyed my college roommate, since she had been the one to introduce me to the restaurant, and they did not recognise her at all. Hahaha. Stupid wench. I am just a more memorable person.) And the waiter almost smirked when he took my order, since of course it did not deviate from the norm. There is nothing better than to be remembered. Especially in Paris, which is (stereo)typically snobbish, especially towards Americans.   I worry now that he's forgotten me. It happens, I haven't been there regretably in two years. But someday, I will own an apartment over there, definitely in the Marais, near Au Gamin, and I'll always be that silly American girl who orders the same meal every time."
C46XW2J,female,23,"Okay, this post was originially going to be titled, ""Things I Need to Remember to Say to Fuckwit When He Calls,"" but then I decided to email my thoughts instead, because even though he said he'll call (and I know that he will), I really didn't want to wait until that unknown date, and be taken off-guard (again). Also, I'm far better with the written word than the oral. And finally, you know that feeling when you’re so hungover that you have two options: to puke and get the misery overwith, or to just sit and hope that the feeling passes? It's definitely the former situation right now.  So after the wonderful weekend sitting (okay, drinking) on the beach (""It's 4 o'clock. Who wants a cocktail?"" ""I'm already on my second one!"" ""Who's cooking?"" ""Doesn't matter, who's the most sober?"" Oh yeah - my new favourite cocktail is a variation on the orange blossom martini - 1.5 shots of gin, juice from 1/2 orange, 1.5 tsp sugar, all shaken together and strained into a glass filled with ice), deepening my tan two further hues and nearly getting killed by the neighbours whose very illegal fireworks got out of control and exploded so close to us that they scorched Katie's father's glasses  while he was wearing them , these are the choice bits from the letter I sent him. Because it's good to remember what I wrote.    The spark is indeed a beautiful and glorious thing. However, at the same time, there is no way it can ever continue in perpetuity. It’s impossible to expect the spark to last forever is something a 12-year-old girl, imagining a “grown-up relationship”, dreams of. If it does last forever, then there’s something wrong with the relationship, that you’re not comfortable enough with the other person to show your true colours, to lounge around him/her in sweats, burping and drinking wine out of a rocks glass instead of a proper stem... The glow doesn’t mean you’re settling, by the way. We should all find the glow. The glow is what makes you happy to see the other person at the end of a long hard day. It’s what makes the fights tolerable. It’s spending the entire day with one another, without the need of scheduled activities in order to be happy. It’s what makes relationships last, what gives them staying power.    You know right away if the spark is there or not. And then you make the decision of whether it’s worth it to continue dating or not. It doesn’t take 2 years to figure it out. And if this spark was so goshdarned important to you all along, and you dragged out this relationship for 2 years – why? If you knew from the beginning that you needed this spark to make things work, then there is no bloody reason we should have been dating at all. You could have told me at any point that it wasn’t working for you, but you didn’t until last week. And that means you lied. For twenty-four months, you lied through your teeth to me, with such facility that I didn’t even know you had these doubts.    To be quite honest, I’ve felt the spark before, but not with you. It wasn’t a sudden  coup de foudre , as it was with others, that bolt of lightning, that feeling of butterflies in your stomach when you first meet someone new and you just  know  that something is going to happen. No, it wasn’t like that with you in the beginning at all. Or at any point that summer in New York. And if you had asked me at the end of that summer how I felt, I would have attributed to you the title of “perfect summer fling”, a great 8 weeks without commitment, ties or expectations. Then that next summer... we started dating again. I didn’t know what to think at the beginning. Or at the end of the summer, for that matter. Or for any of the following months after that... but after 8 months, a year... we were still dating. And one day, I don’t remember when, I realised that I felt this glow. That perhaps it hadn’t started out with sparkling fireworks, but there was something which I deemed far more important and lasting. And it made me happy, it quieted most of the questions and doubts that I had.    You say that you should  always  want to hang out with the person you're dating. Just plain stupid. Do you want to have no life of your own? Hell, I didn't want to hang out with you all the time while we were dating; I valued my time alone and my time with other friends. Co-dependency is not cool. Having separate yet joined lives is.    Compromise is not the same as sacrifice. Until you understand this difference, things are  never  going to change. Compromise is when I flew down to visit you even though you were too busy to reciprocate, because I cared. Sacrifice would have been my applying to grad school in DC/Cville just to be close to you. Believe me, I considered it, but realised I couldn't give up the chance of going to school in NY or Boston, even for you. All my actions over the past two years were those of compromise, not of sacrifice. Besides, I could never want the person I'm dating to think he's sacricifing himself for me. That just smacks of a character weakness I could do without.   Upon his receiving and reading this letter, my friend Kate vocalised my thoughts the best, ""It's like a train wreck - he's going to want to stop reading it but he can't, and I hope that the miserable fucker gets it at work and cries his eyes out, leaving everyone at work to think that he's deranged and maybe needs psychiatric help."" We can all hope that.   What I wanted to write, but didn't? ""If you claimed you felt the spark with girls you've dated in the past - why aren't you still dating them. Why? Right, that's what I thought. The spark bullshit is just a lameass way to say 'I have commitment issues'."" I mean, I think it's definitely a valid statement... but yeah, I decided not to bring it up. I show admirable restraint, if I do say so myself.  Petty revenge  would  have been so much more fun, and people had such good ideas. But I'm trying (really really hard) to be mature. More boring, perhaps, and if I were psycho there'd be fun stuff to read... but alas, that's me. Always trying to be the better person.   After I sent that off, gosh, you have no idea how much better I felt. So, if anyone knows of any cheap tickets from LA to Paris for the next month (cheap, like under $800, not the $1200 they currently are), that would be really really cool.   (And yes, the title of this post is the same as the subject on the email I sent him. Wasting my creativity on the fuckwit, sigh.)"
C46XW2J,female,23,"I think I already knew that, but it's always endearing (read: perplexing) when the above statement is confirmed.   Following on crankypants's proclamation that he wants a red hat, with pompoms.. I decided to ask Kevin, my partner-in-crime, whether or not he thought I should really add earflaps. What I learned: If the winter hat has pompoms dangling from a string, then you need earflaps. If you have earflaps, you need a dangly tie also. If the pompoms are attached to the hat rather than hanging off a string, then you don't need earflaps. If the hat does not have pompoms, it doesn't need earflaps either. Following on the heels of those cardinal rules regarding winter hats, was the request (or rather, command): ""Since you haven't found me a tall blonde to date in the past year, I want a hat too. A green and blue one. Hunter green and navy blue.  With dangly pompoms. And earflaps. And the tie for under the chin. ""  Obviously, it was my mistake for asking for male advice. And now I'm to make two damn crocheted hats. What do I look like, a winter hat factory? I have better things to do with my time, like eat and sleep and shop.   And I don't understand what this fascination with pompoms is. Weren't boys supposed to outgrow this once they started grade school and/or took control of their own wardrobe?"
C46XW2J,female,23,"Favourite ad of the year (okay, so far)  From A Diamond Is Forever: It's like kissing the ground she walks on. Without actually putting your lips to the cement.  Hm. It's slightly paraphrased. But you get it."
C46XW2J,female,23,"So every morning, one of the first things that loads when I open my internet browser are cheap airline fares. It's really a bad idea, and I should change my homepage, because it's just sooooo tempting to just pack up and go. Screw school, the world doesn't really need another doctor, anyway. When it's cheaper to fly to Paris from the East Coast than back home to LA.. well, why wait? Under $200. I spend way more than that on dresses that just accumulate in my closet, waiting for the ""perfect occassion"" for me to wear them.  And since I'm in school, and not enough of my friends are getting married anytime soon.. those dresses are just collecting dust.   Then again, the amount of money I'd spend shopping while in Paris... oh, it would be ridiculous. So it's really not a bargain, after all.   Maybe I should just move there. Then I'd stop dreaming about being there.  Or I could just buy more dresses. It's an investment in its own right, of course."
C46XW2J,female,23,"I want a hot dog for lunch, but don't want to have to leave my apartment before class to get it and bring it back here to eat, and I don't want to eat it in the Biomed building. I wonder if I can call someone who's in class right now and get him/her to bring me a hot dog for lunch during the lunch break. Probably not. Dammit. Maybe I'll say I'm suffering from a massive protein deficiency even though I had foie gras for dinner Sunday. But that doesn't count."
C46XW2J,female,23,"Why I like staying in crankypants's apartment:    He has cable. I do not. While I can get along fine with just NBC, there is a certain luxury to watching the  urlLink Food Network  all day long. Between that, MTV, and  urlLink  Mad About You  , there is no reason to leave the apartment. Actually, I just need the Food Network. He thinks I'm nuts when he leaves me watching the Food Network, and returns 3 hours later, and I'm still on the couch watching the Food Network.     He has a toaster. I do not. This does not seem like such a big deal, but seeing that I'm addicted to bread, not having a toaster in my apartment means that I eat less toast, which is good for me. But while I'm here, it's toast all the time. Yummy.    He has DSL. I have a dial-up. I can't validate the cost of DSL just for one person, but he seems to be able to do so.   Weird things about crankypants's apartment:    He has two printers, one laserjet and one inkjet. Why does he need two? I really don't know. He says the one is better for colour printing, and the while the other one only prints in black and white, he can highlight it and the text won't run.   He has an electric hole puncher. That's right. Because apparently a manual one is too much work to operate. This contraption, however, can only punch 15 pieces of paper at a time, and does each hole one at a time. It's a little ridiculous.   He has 8 lamps in his living room. 1 of these is a chandelier, 1 a 3-headed lamp. That means there are 14 light bulbs in this one room alone. When he is present, more often than not at least 2/3rd of the lights will be on. One day, the light bulbs are going to revolt and not turn on. (This is especially strange because for the longest time, in  my  common room, I had Christmas lights and one desk lamp. I obviously did not really study.)   He decided, one day, that the linoleum in his kitchen and bathroom was ugly, and decided to ""retile"" using large squares of black and white contact paper. He did not cut the squares straight. The end result is a rather warped Alice-in-Wonderland flooring.    For the longest time, he was missing his card table (which serves as his dining table) and a couple of chairs because they were in his trunk. Yes, of his car. When it's nice outside, he likes to drive next door and set up his table and chairs on the front lawn of some university building and study there. There are patches of dead grass on their lawn because he does this often enough, and sits in the same spot every time.  But enough of that. Needless to say, he is a bit of a weirdo. An endearing one, but one nonetheless. We haven't even touched upon his closet yet. Oh dear."
C46XW2J,female,23,"Apples : Are only good when they're straight from the tree. Apples that have been sitting in supermarkets are not as flavourful, and therefore not worthy of eating. Plus, they only taste good when spread liberally with peanut butter.   Pears : So hard to find good ripe ones. Either they're too hard, or too mushy. Plus, the skin is too thick, so you have to peel them to enjoy them.   Oranges : I love oranges, but I hate peeling them. I don't like it when the pith gets stuck underneath my nails. My mom used to peel oranges for my lunch. I wouldn't eat them if she didn't. I miss when my mother made lunch for me. (Oh wait, she does, every summer when I'm home again.)   Bananas : Are mushy. I hate mushy foods you can squash against your hard palate. Plus, my father made me eat two a day when I was little because it was good for me. Therefore, just like milk, I avoid bananas like the plague. Unless they come with ice cream on top.    Mangoes : See ""oranges."" Add cutting to the ""hate peeling"" sentence. But when I go home, my mom cuts a big bowlful for me every day. Then I lay in my hammock and eat them and read a trashy novel. It's rather pleasant.    Persimmons : See ""oranges"" and ""mangoes.""    Pineapples : See ""oranges"" and ""mangoes"" and ""persimmons"". Add, hard to find really good ones.    Grapes : I will only eat the green seedless ones. The purple ones aren't as good, and the ones with seeds, while the best, are too labour-intensive. I will only eat them if someone peels the skin for me and removes the seeds, as my mother did when I was really little.   Starfruit : I will happily slice and eat these. But they are very hard to find.   Watermelon : See ""oranges"" and ""mangoes"" and  ""persimmons"" and ""pineapples""   Honeydew : See ""oranges"" and ""mangoes"" and ""persimmons"" and ""pineapples"" and ""watermelon.""   Cantaloupe : A melon I don't actually like, because it sometimes has a funny texture and taste. And it's ugly on the outside. It creeps me out.     Cherries : Since buying Ranier cherries, which are like little bits of candy, I have been spoiled. No more normal Bing cherries for me. But Ranier cherries (which are this lovely colour of yellow and blush red) are expensive, and harder to find.   Strawberries : I like these. But I rarely eat a whole box. So they all go to waste. So to prevent this, I don't buy them.   Kiwi : The seeds get stuck in my teeth. I like the white centre, though. The green flesh is always sour. I have come to the conclusion that I don't eat fruit because I am so damn lazy. This is probably not a good enough reason. But at the same time, it just goes to show that I need servants to prepare my fruit for me so that I'll eat it."
C46XW2J,female,23,"As I looked over pictures from Friday night before sending them out, I realised that they all had one horribly common trend: that I don't remember taking any of them.   I am a happy drunk, a fun drunk. Not morose and maudlin. And the best part of it is that while people realise that I'm drunk, they don't realise quite  how  drunk I am, which is usually about 3-4 drinks more than they're thinking. I have very lucid and coherent conversations, apparently - I say apparently because I don't recall them the next day. It is quite scary that I black out/forget things so often, but I haven't harmed myself yet. So it's okay, at least for now.   However, drinking a magnum+ of wine is not recommended under any circumstances."

A98XKGK,female,24,"Cold Sir...   I woke up this morning and was surprise to see myself shivering.

A98XKGK,female,24,"Disappointing in the End   Yesterday was pretty interesting for me emotion wise.  I have been happy, sad, sleepy, moody and disappointed all on the same day but not at the same time.  But it was an really interesting day nonetheless.  I was happy... Finally in Ragnarok, my friends and I finally got our guild up.  Now, all we have to do is gather enough experience to level up so that we can help the newbies that play in the game.   The guild was designed for this.  The reason why we build the guild was to help out newbies level-up in the game.  So that they wouldn't be cheated by other people who would want to cheat them as they progress along the way.  It was pretty amazing too since it was like a hive mind.  The next thing I know we would be saying ""We are the Borg..."" because I get to communicate with them everywhere I go.  But it's really great to know who's there and who isn't.  I was moody... The afternoon went on and I was a little moody when I was with my aunt.  I love her, don't get me wrong but the fact that she acts that she thinks she knows everything really annoys me.  I was moody that time I was with her.  I was saying one-liners and pretend that I don't hear her sometimes.  It was a good thing that when that play that she invited me started, she was quiet and didn't pay attention to me....until the play ended and she was saying over and over and over again that the play was good.  Don't get me wrong, the play was fantastic.  I even got the signatures off all the actors of the play and I didn't regret watching it but I guess I would have loved it more if I was with my siblings or my friends.  Anyway, my aunt and I got separated when I went to get the actors' autographs.  I did look for them but was feeling relieved when I didn't.  I just texted her to say that I went home already.  I was sleepy... Yes, even now I lack sleep and my body is screaming for it.  But I guess I have to live with the fact that I need to get use to it if I don't want to change my work schedule.  I'm sad.... Because I watched the play last night, I didn't get to watch Formula 1.  Even if I did enjoy the play, I kept wondering what has been happening with the race.  Then I was disappointed... When I asked my sister what happened in the race, I was disappointed.  Both the drivers that I was cheering for didn't even pass the first corner.  It was Ralf Schumacher's fault...to my total disbelief.  And because of that Kimi Raikkonen did not finish the race again, giving Michael Schumacher a nine point lead, making him take the third in the driver's champoinship and letting Montoya get second.  And Kimi was looking forward for a good race.  I was really disappointed that dispite the fact that I didn't get to watch the race, I didn't watch the replay of it when it was shown on TV this morning.  But I really hope and pray that Kimi would eventually get back on his feet and start winning podium again.  And I hope and pray that he wins WC.  It won't be that great if he wins it next year.  I do not want Montoya to win before him as well.  I would rather see Michael Schumacher win it yet again than the Columbian driver.  Oh well, we can't have everything can we?  Maybe I get to be happy tomorrow.  But today, I'm happy and exhuausted as well as sad...  I'm sad today because... I can't play Ragnarok at home...not yet anyway.  There's something wrong with the patch I think and I really don't know why it won't connect to the patch.  I hope they fix it so that I can use the computer here at home to play the game."

A98XKGK,female,24,"Highs, Lows and a Congratulations   Im sorry for not writing something yesterday.  I have been busy with housework, and curing my cold which has become full blown with cough on the side.  Its not as worse as when I had pneumonia but its still awful.  I hate getting the common cold.  Its irritating and its one of those viruses that just doesnt want to leave quickly.  Anyway, to my low points first.  Aside from my cold, I had the misfortune of having friends who doesnt care at all.  Try as I might to understand their situation, they just dont see all the sacrifice that I do for them.  They keep giving you excuses and for the life of me I had enough.  Take for example my friend Rocky.  Last Friday we were suppose to meet to have coffee in Starbucks at Ayala Town Center.  Ive spent two weeks getting people to come.  Ive asked, begged even pleading on my knees for them to just drop by for all time sake.  I even told some of my friends that if they are financially not able to get there, Ill shoulder their expenses.  But still, only four of us came out of the twelve that was suppose to come.  My biggest disappointment was Rocky because he was the reason I spent all those times preparing for the meeting.  A few days before the preparation our friend Lea told me that Rocky was looking forward for our next gimmick together.  I responded by looking for the best date and after confirming from Rocky himself if he will be available on that day, Ive started making phone calls.  Honestly speaking, if Rocky just told me that he would be available that day, I would have just spend the rest of those two weeks thinking of good stories to write to fanfiction.net instead of convincing my friends to come with us to Starbucks.  I honestly would have understand, Im not that kind of person whos narrow minded.  Some of my friends that Ive called really told me that they would try to make it but still not sure whether they can of not.  I just pleaded so that they would say yes to me even if I would have to pay for their orders just to get them to be there on that day.  Rocky on the other hand told me he will be there, no questions asked.  He may be late but he will be there, so he said.  On the day itself, he didnt even try to call or send me an SMS to tell me that he couldnt come (or wont come as I have a feeling that he did).  Lea had to call him just to find out that he couldnt come at all.  We were already in Starbucks that time, waiting who would still be coming when Lea called Rocky and gave me the bad news.  That really pissed me off that night.  First of all, I wasnt feeling well that night.  I lack sleep, I had so many work that morning that I had to cram for the whole day just so that I would be on time to pick up my baby brother Louis from his office to go to Starbucks that night and my cold was becoming worse by the hour Ive spent working.  I already finished a roll of tissue paper from blowing on my nose.  But I still came because I organized the whole thing and I was hoping to see most of my friends that night.  Secondly, I did it for Rocky.  He asked for a night with his friends and I tried so damn hard to give it to him.  I called him up to say when it was okay, I even confirmed it from him if it was an okay date.  All the hard work I did was all for nothing when it concerned him.  Third, this wasnt the first time my friends did this to me.  When we were in high school I had organized my events countless times to be disappointed in the end.  One time, I was the only one who was there and none of my friends even tried to call me to tell me that they cant come.  Fourth, I felt embarrassed to my baby brother who had so many things to do that week and I just begged him to come and being a good baby brother and he really cant say no to me, he still went that night.  I was really embarrassed to face him when only me, him, Lea and our friend Dean were the only four people who came that night.  We were really hoping there would be more of us.  And lastly, Ive wasted good money just to call everyone there.  Ive wasted pre-paid credits so that I could get in touch with my so-called friends to just get them to come last Friday.  At least I know who my real friends are.  That would be the last time, Im going to organize a get together for my friends.  I not only felt I was being used but I also felt like trash that night.  All my efforts had gone to waste when I saw the usual people getting together.  I felt at my utmost low that night.  I was so humiliated and toyed with that I honestly just want to crawl into a hole that night and stay there for the rest of my existence.  It was really a good thing that my real friends were there that night and made the night fun and interesting despite the lack of numbers.  We even get to see and old high school classmate of ours and got some news about our old batch in high school.  The night wore on looking brighter by the hour making me forget that awful feeling.  We even ended up going to Deans house and see the progress that he has done with it.  I applaud my friend Dean for the achievement hes done so far.  To Dean, thank you for being my friend.  I raise my glass high to toast you of your achievements and being there despite your financial situation.  Same goes to Lea and Louis Dean.  I guess my night would really be really low if it wasnt for the two of you there.  You gave me a reason to enjoy the night.  And I thank you for that.  A toast to you my friends!  Youre the best!  Needless to say the next day, I didnt get to play RPG.  Not only I wasnt allowed because of my cold but I had other things to do as well.  And to make matters worse, Card Captor Sakura didnt air because the local network were its being aired was covering the stupid war!  Yes, I still did not change my stand.  The war is still stupid.  There should have been a better way to change this without bombing and bloodshed but still the stupid US president wouldnt listen to reason, his people and the Pope.  And honestly speaking rallies wouldnt help at this stage as well.  Last Friday my aunt was with those rallying people who wants peace.  As much as I myself want peace, I dont think a rally would let the rulers listen to what you have to say.  Youll just end up getting literally soaked with water being hosed at you or you get rained at like what happened to my aunt and boss.   The good thing about last Saturday is that at least I got to rest longer.  I got to catch up on my sleep and I feel better already.  I can breathe better and I think my cold is reduced to the sniffles and Im not coughing that much anymore.  At least theres something good.  Lets just say that its getting better everyday.   Last Friday I also got praised by my boss for the job Ive done encoding some materials she will use for a seminar.  Its really good to hear a praise coming from someone whos not a family member.  At least you know that its not because youre blood related but because youve really done well.  And I have spend the whole day of Thursday just to make that only to repeat it Friday morning because my computer conked up on me.  It was really a refreshing sound to hear a praise instead of scolding from your unbearable aunt.   Lastly, a big congratulations to MR. KIMI RAIKKONEN for winning the first place of the Malaysian Grand Prix.  The ICEMAN did it!!! And Im sure there will be a lot of commotion going in the Official Kimi Raikkonen forum because of it. :D He drove  a good race.  Kept his cool and followed his team.  He wasnt cocky.  Hes really great and I have new admiration for him.  Again, to the ICEMAN congratulations!!! We at the Forum hope and pray that you get to be World Champion this year. :D  I have another week ahead of me.  And I hope that it will be as wacky as last week. :D"

This one is 20"", silver, with speakers on the sides.  It's very cute.  And now I won't have to watch TV on a little, ghetto 13"" TV.  And it's hella cute and silver so it'll match my stereo and DVD player.  :)  Also, my parents told me that they'll fix the muffler on my car for me.  Which rocks, because it definately needs to be fixed, but I really didn't want to spend the money to fix it...  My little brother (David) got a new computer, which is very cool for him because he's still been using my first computer (a pentium 133).  so he's pretty happy :)  The boys got a PS2 which of course they're playing now.  They got the new Bond game and they're downstairs blowing each other up.  I would like to play it eventually, but I don't think I'll get the chance today..."

The convertable was from Ohio, and the driver was this redheaded guy who kept staring at us as well.  They kept pacing us, and the guy with the scream mask on took his mask off and at the next light that we stopped at they were right next to us, staring in my car.  it was a little uncomfortable...  beck noted that apparently guys in Ohio don't know how to be subtle when trying to get a girl's attention.  it was all very odd...  :)"

51XSYIH,female,25,"i woke up late-ish.  i mean, technically it was on time because i woke up at the same time that i wake up every day lately.  but really, it's late, but well, whatever.  anyway, that wasn't the point.  the point was i got up.  yeah, so i got up and everything seemed normal and i took a shower and was rushing around because i was running late and i was in the kitchen trying to get stuff together to bring to work for lunch and i realized i felt weird.  kind of sick.  i walked into the bathroom and i suddenly felt very hot.  really hot and kind of prickly all over.  i looked in the mirror and saw that i had no color in my face and i was glistening with sweat and i understood that i was going to faint.  and since i was alone i really didn't feel like fainting in my bathroom and cracking my head on my toilet and dying there and being found days later with my face half eaten by my cats on the floor of my bathroom so i stumbled out of the bathroom into the living room and layed down on the sofa.  i layed there until i felt a little better and then attempted to get to the kitchen but had to retreat back to the sofa a couple of times before that worked.  i got into the kitchen and looked around for something to eat.  but really, i didn't feel like eating and was pretty irrational and so this took a few minutes before i randomly decided on a can of garbanzo beans.  i opened the can with great difficulty because i was feeling so weak and the damn can opener wouldn't pierce the lid of the can and poured most of the beans into a little rubbermaid container and ate the rest of the beans that wouldn't fit into the container straight out of the can with a fork.  i felt a little better, i mean, i still felt a little weird and out of it but i knew that i was ok enough to drive so i called my supervisor and let her know i was going to be a little late and drove to work."
51XSYIH,female,25,"I've been having attention issues at work today.  Dodi sent me a link to a comic on  urlLink comics.com  and then I started browsing through my two favorite comics: Get Fuzzy and Pearls Before Swine.  I totally fell in love with a few of the strips and so I've decided to include them here to share the good humor.  :)      I was crying hysterical silent laughter tears in my cube when I saw this one...  I need that one frame on a T-shirt!    The cat is so cute and so evil...  just like Molly...    See, but if it was Molly it would be pooping and behind the TV...

51XSYIH,female,25,"i've been trying to find hotels in ireland.  i've been looking mostly at hostels b/c they are cheap and private rooms are possible.  i read a review at  urlLink tripadvisor.com  of mount eccles hostel which said, ""Went to MEC for St.Patricks 2003. We stayed in a 6bed dorm on the second floor. The place was secure with electronic card entry and storage lockers. It also took mastercard which was a plus. The showers sucked, very cold water dribbled out, but it wasnt that big of a deal. The buses to the airport drop off and pick up only 5 minutes away. Its in a slightly sketch part of town, but all in all I would say its a fine place to stay for the price.""  at first i cracked up at the review b/c it said the showers were cold and dribbley but that wasn't a big deal b/c damn, i don't want to take cold showers.  then i realized that the review sounded like something i totally would have written, i mean, the language was very similar to my own (word usage: sucked, slightly sketch).  so i looked up and saw that the review was written by someone from albany.  i was amused."
51XSYIH,female,25,"so friday night i was supposed to go out with dodi and one of her friends in albany.  now, i live in albany, but i really don't enjoy going out here.  there are a few bars i don't mind, but i'm just not into clubs all that much.  dancing really doesn't thrill me and there are always a bunch of college kids running around...  but i figured that going out is going out and it's better than staying in so i wasn't going to complain.  when dodi got a hold of me later though, she said that since the weather was so bad (it was raining and supposed to turn to snow) she didn't feel like going out and would rather just stay in and watch a movie and get drunk.  I was a little disappointed, but i figured that doing that was better than nothing, so i headed up to clifton park.  i figured that maybe i could convince dodi to go to  urlLink the parting glass  because it's my favorite bar and it's up in Saratoga (i just love it up there) and i'd been in the mood to go up there all week.   so i got to Dodi's house and we sat around for a while and her cousin Chris called and said that he was on his way over and then I proposed going up to the Parting Glass.  Dodi was receptive to the idea (it seems that there was more than just the weather that prevented her from wanting to go to Albany) and when her cousin arrived we headed on up.   when we arrived the front of the pub seemed pretty busy, so we decided to go back to the dart room where there was another bar.  we passed through the performance area where a rather shitty band was playing (the ""adirondak rednecks"") and went into the dart room...  which was almost completely empty.  There were two younger guys playing darts and one guy sitting at the bar talking to the bartender and a waiter.  the three of us sat down at the bar and decided that it seemed weird to sit in here when it was nearly empty, so we'd order our drinks and then go into the pub part of the bar.  but then Dodi and I got a look at the bartender who was incredibly good looking, spoke with an irish accent, and was spinning bottles in a ""Cocktail"" way at the other end of the bar and decided that a hot bartender was enough incentive to stay in that room.   we ordered our drinks (a  urlLink guinness  for me, a  urlLink captain and coke  for Dodi and a  urlLink for Chris ) and we started talking and covertly staring at the bartender.  There was a glass full of stirrers in front of me, so I showed Dodi and Chris the trick you do with them that's supposed to tell you if you're going to get laid that night.  You take the stirer in one hand between your thumb and your middle finger and you try and bend it directly in half just using those two fingers.  if you get it directly in half that means your getting laid that night.  well, they were not sucessful at first and so we kept trying it and before long there was a pile of creased red stirrers in front of us.  The bartender (whose name was Keith) came over and asked us what we were doing.  Dodi explained the game and he tried it - and got it right in half the first time.  we said he had to do it again, so he did - and got it right in half again.  he got it like six times in a row.  the waiter that he'd been talking to earlier, Law, came over and asked what we were doing.  then he showed us a trick where you have a glass, a cherry, and an upside down brandy glass and you have to get the cherry inside the glass using the brandy glass but not turning it rightside up at all.  we couldn't figure out how to do it, and when he showed us how, we were all very impressed (i'm not going to tell how to do it, because it's a neat trick and you'd want to be surprised when you're shown how).  we then sat there with Keith and Law and did a bunch of bartricks (can't really remember most of them anymore).   Dodi had her phone out and she was playing with it, then she put in on the bar.  Keith picked it up and started playing with it and Dodi said, you can put your number in if you want to.  he did, then he looked at me and asked me for my phone.  He put his number in mine as well and handed it back to me.  Chris said that it probably wasn't his number, that he probably put different numbers in our phones.  Dodi and I then compared numbers and concluded that it's probably his real number because he put the same number in both.   it was very dead in the bar, and Keith showed us how he could flip ""bar mats"" (which is what he called coasters) and bottles.  then he said that when he was bored he made up shots.  he started preparing a shot that used a lot of green alcohol, some coconut-tasting alcohol, some milk, and some pineapple juice.  then he put out four glasses and poured us each some of his shot, which he called a ""little green monster.""  he did the shot with us (which was very good) and let us have it on the house.   then it was last call, and he asked if i wanted another guinness (i'd just finished my third...  or was it fourth?) and i said no, that's ok, but then Chris said, ""no, she wants another one"" and I said, ""I do, I just don't want to pay for it"" and Keith said, ""I've got it"" and poured me another one.  The bar started to clear out, and Keith and Law finished closing up and came to the other side of the bar to sit with us and have a drink and tell jokes (most of which i can't remember.  i was pretty drunk by then.  Keith told one about a ""little green man"" which involved him saying ""little green"" in his irish accent about a million times and I can't remember at all what the punchline was, but I really enjoyed listening to him speak).  Keith sat next to me and before I knew it he had his hand on my leg.  i responded in kind, and when Dodi and Chris said that they were hungry and wanted to go to Denny's he came with us.  it's ridiculous how not perceptive i am about this type of thing.  i never know when a guy is interested until it's extremely obvious.  i had no idea most of the night and when i told Dodi this the next day she said that it had been obvious.   anyway.  i won't go into detail because i think my parents look at my page every once in a while but i had a  very  good night with the hot irish bartender.  he told me that he has every sunday and monday off and that i should call him.  he told me a bunch of times that i should call him, but i'm not sure that i will.  i mean, i don't really know if he meant it (but he did ask me to an awful lot, and i do have his number) and, what would i say?  hi keith, it's ali, the girl from friday night...  hmm.  i dunno.  and he's divorced with two boys under the age of five.  but he is really hot.  and the accent just kills me.  and we did have a  really  good time...  we'll see..."

3CCBN38,female,27,"If you haven't checked out the comments posted on my April 26 blog, please do so. My Uncle John wrote a beautiful note that day. Also big congratulations to my cousin on the birth of his baby! He is absolutely adorable!!  This week has been rather uneventful around here. Last night I was scrapbooking away (still working on catching up last year's photos) and suddenly I think to myself, ""I bet it's REALLY late!"" I got up to check the clock and it was 3 am!! I decided if I wanted to get anything done the next day I should head to bed! I was surprised when I got up at 10 am today and was awake!!  I made a scrapbooker's resolution at the start of the new year. I decided I wouldn't buy any new paper until I had used up what I already have. For those of you who have seen my paper collection, you know that's quite a feat!! Most scrapbookers have 2 hobbies - scrapbooking and collecting scrapbooking supplies, and for me - paper is my thing. I've always loved paper, which is why I think I took to scrapbooking like a fish to water. Whenever fall came I would go through the stores and smell the school supplies. There's nothing like a fresh notebook - it holds so much potential!! I feel the same way when I sort through my scrapbook paper - there's so much potential!! I've enjoyed using up my supply of paper and have gotten quite creative in using up my scraps as well. I need to buy a new blender (I broke my last one, it fell out of the cabinet) and start making handmade paper out of my scraps.  Well, no 3 am stunts tonight! I have Bible study in the morning! Amelia out!!  (oh, that reminds me, George Huff survived another week on A.I. which I was so excited about since I couldn't get through to vote last night!! whew!!)"
3CCBN38,female,27,"Alright, already! I'm here!   Wow! I miss one day and I get scolded for being lazy! You know who you are, big dog!! =) Just teasin ya. It's nice to know you're reading. Ok, so I'm back. I'm still sniffling and coughing, but I'm on the mend! In fact yesterday I thought I was all better, but this morning I woke up miserable again. It's crazy.  Due to my lovely sniffles I've been taking it fairly easy this week. My current writing assignment is to write vivid observations using each of my five senses. Yesterday after a nice cool rain, I decided to sit on the porch and describe the fresh, after-rain smell. Well, I walked onto the porch and realized, ""what am I thinking? I can't smell anything!!"" I guess that assignment will have to wait until next week!  Sometimes honesty costs. I went in today to get my address corrected on my driver's license. When we first moved here I was getting the numbers in our address all mixed up. By the time I got myself unconfused, I realized the address on my license was wrong. I went in today to get it corrected and when I told the gentleman at the counter the correct address, he asked, ""was this just a typo or did you move?"" I thought for half a second that if I told him it was a typo I could probably save myself the cost of getting it changed ($10!!). But I knew that I had given it to them wrong the first time, but they would never know. But I would know. So I told him ""When we first moved I kept getting the numbers mixed up, and I'm sure I gave it to you wrong."" He just peered at me over his glasses  with funny look and then said ""that will be $10."" I suppose that $10 is worth having a clean conscience and a good night's sleep.  While I've been nursing my sniffles the past couple days, I've indulged myself by scrapbooking. I'm working on finishing up the pictures from our  urlLink Alaska trip  last August. That trip seems like such a long time ago! We came back from that trip, turned in our two weeks notices and moved three weeks later. With all that flurry of activity, we really didn't have time to reflect much on our trip after we returned. It's been so much fun to relive those memories as I've scrapbooked the pictures. It makes me want to go on another adventure!! Ked and I LOVE traveling together. There's nothing like bonding as you end up in all these fun and unusual circumstances together. You just never know what or who you'll encounter, like the time we stood up in 2 complete strangers' wedding in South Dakota. Ahh... I'll save that one for another day...to keep you coming back for more!!! =)  Later!"
3CCBN38,female,27,"As we sat along the roadside for the THIRD time today we both kinda lost it. Well not, kinda, we did for a moment lose it. Two weeks ago as we were headed to Sarasota to help my grandma with some projects around the house the car randomly died! So we coasted along the side of the road from 70 miles an hour to a complete stop. We looked at each other in complete surprise. The car has run great for the year and a half we’ve had it and this was the first sign of any trouble. We called a tow truck and then called my grandma and she and a friend came to meet us at the shop in Bradenton. Fortunately, we weren’t too far from Sarasota. We could definitely see God’s provision in the fact that the car didn’t break down while I was driving it by myself (I’m sure I would be ok, but being in a big city now, I’m not thrilled about breaking down!) and Grandma’s friend was just getting to walk out the door when we called and he knew exactly where we were and was happy to come with her to pick us up. Naturally, as soon as we get to the shop the car starts right up, even though we’d tried to start it for over an hour alongside the road. Two weeks and two shops later, it’s running fine and no one can find anything wrong with it.  So, we head to Sarasota again to help my Grandma with the projects we didn’t get to finish two weeks ago. With two bathroom ventilation fans in our trunk we get almost to Sarasota and boom! The car dies again. Now we can’t believe it. Again, God was with us and we were able to make it off an exit ramp. Ked called the tow truck and I called Grandma. She can’t believe it. So I walk across the street to McDonald’s and Ked stays with the car. Just as the tow truck shows up the car starts! Now we’re getting annoyed. Grandma shows up, we all shake our heads and head to her place for breakfast.  We had a great day with her as Ked and I replaced the fans in her bathroom. Ked was covered in dust and his arms were tired from being above his head, but we successfully replaced the fans in both her bathrooms. Unfortunately, the holes from the old fans are bigger than the hole for the new fans, so Ked will be making some trim and taking it back down to cover the hole. That is, if we can ever make it back down there.  It was a cold and rainy day, but we decided to head back to our place. What should have been an hour trip took us four hours. The car broke down halfway and we sat alongside the road for at least an hour. We called a tow truck, but true to form, it started again before the tow truck arrived. We drive twenty minutes more and it stops again. This time we decide NOT to call a tow truck and wait it out. Obviously, something is overheating and it just needs to cool down and it starts again. By now, we are tired, dirty and frustrated. And we start to doubt God. It’s amazing how something like this can make you question your foundation. And so we talk. Why does this always happen to us? In our seven year marriage we’ve been stranded alongside the road more times than I can count, and it’s not like we drive junker cars. And we start to doubt all kinds of things, like God’s faithfulness to us, why He hasn’t blessed us more in the area of finances, and so on and so on. We’ve been sitting there an hour and the car still won’t start. This time we’re afraid it’s not going to start again. But in that time as we’ve talked we’ve realized where our faith is weak. If something really so silly and stupid as a car breaking down (fact of life, they just aren’t reliable) we need to re-evaluate where we stand in our faith. So we prayed together, not for the car to be healed, but for our faith to be healed. We desire so desperately to be used by God. To do something marvelous for Him, to use all of our potential, and to hear “well done, good and faithful servant!” And so our time in the car gave us time to reflect and ask God not to hide His plan for us, and to help us live our lives to the fullest for Him, even when we’re broken down alongside the road. Finally after an hour, I have to go to the bathroom REALLY bad. Actually, I’ve had to go for quite awhile. So we call for help and arrange for a tow truck to come and get us. And would you believe it? Ked hangs up the phone and tries the car one more time, and it starts right up. We look at each other in amazement.   Was God just trying to tell us to ask for help? I don’t know if He works in ways like that, but it seems to be a good illustration. Just pick up the phone – get on your knees and ask Me for help! If we learned anything by our three hours by the roadside, it’s that we aren’t alone, even when we feel like it, and sometimes we just need to reach out and ask for help.  We finally made it home, exhausted, drained and ready for bed."
3CCBN38,female,27,"When I was a little girl I used to dream about what it would have been like to grow up in the pioneer days. I read Little House on the Prairie and used to daydream about petticoats and wearing dresses all the time and riding horses on the farm. I was also an Anne of Green Gables fanatic and dreamt of meeting my Gilbert and dressing up in frilly dresses with puffy sleeves and going to fancy parties. There was something alluring about those eras. Something that seemed so much simpler.  Today while eating my lunch I turned on PBS and caught the ending of a program that profiled families who gave up the 21st century for five months to homestead in Montana. They left their large homes, fast paced life, and high profile jobs to live together in a small cabin that they built with their own hands. They raised their cows, pigs and chickens and grew their own wheat and corn. At first they all wanted to go home, but at the end of the five months they didn't want to leave. The show caught up with them two months after returning to their normal lives and every single one of them longed for the homestead. One family had moved into a giant new home that felt well...too big. The six of them missed being so close and hated that their new home was so big they didn't even know when someone else was there. The two 13 year old girls said that life in the 21st century was boring and they could only go to the mall so often. The young 10 year old boy commented on how much more he appreciated everything on the homestead. He said when he had fewer toys he valued them more and was so overjoyed when he got something new. Now he has so many things that they don't mean very much. One husband commented that he goes to work and his family doesn't have a clue what he does day in and day out. He missed the homestead days when they all worked together and had common goals. They all longed for the community they developed with their homestead neighbors. Out there you live life together because if you don't, you won't survive the winter.  As I watched them live on the homestead I was whisked back to those childhood daydreams of old. Life was tougher then, and the physical labor was harder, but there was something simpler, purer and uncomplicated about life. Your goals were survival, food, and shelter, and you couldn't accomplish that unless you worked together. How different that is from the two income, multi-directional lives we live. No wonder we have a hard time keeping families together. We don't even have true community or common goals within our own homes, let alone with our neighbors and church community. I think we could learn some things from life in 1883. I think we could unclutter our 21st century lives and learn to get by with less stuff. I think we could spend less time trying to accumulate stuff that doesn't mean anything and spend more time together and working toward common goals. I think we could spend more time doing life, truly doing life not just a barbecue on the weekend, with our neighbors.  It was ironic that I was telling Kedron about this thought over dinner and not long after we finished eating our power went off again, thanks to another storm. (I'm starting to feel like I'm back in West Michigan!) We had both just sat down at our computers to finish up some work when we lost power. It didn't bother us! We spent some time cuddling under the covers instead, looking through catalogs and talking about things to come. Ked commented, ""I'm glad the power went off."" And so was I! So I guess if you want a simpler life, turn off your power for a couple hours. Read a book, have a good discussion, play a game. Enjoy those that you live with."
3CCBN38,female,27,"No wonder we treat them like children!   It seems to be that the majority of young couples our age have either a cat or a dog or both. It appears that pets seem to abate the baby bug, and I know several couples who buy a new dog everytime the baby bug bites! In conversations with our friends, it's quite common for the couple to refer to each other as ""mommy and daddy"" and the pet as their child. Ok, I admit, Ked and I do the same thing! For seven years Sadie has been our pride and joy (and entertainment, especially when Ked puts tape on her paws!)  Interestingly, a 2002 pet survey shows that ""Americans have about 77.7 million cats and 65 million dogs. Compare that with the most recent America's Children study (2001), which reported that there were 72.6 million children 17 or younger in U.S. homes."" We have almost twice as many cats and dogs as we do children!! Instead of the baby boomers, we're the pet boomers...or something.  Anyway, just a bit of useless information for your holiday weekend. We're just hanging out here and Ked gave Sadie a bath today, which was quite amusing! She's all soft and fuzzy now."
3CCBN38,female,27,"A wakeup call that came WAY to early!   Thursdays are always a fun day. I usually have Bible studies with the ladies in the morning, but it's spring break week so we're takin the week off. Then in the evenings we have Life Group, which is always a blast. But this morning began WAY to early!  If you remember I mentioned a couple blogs ago about Sadie and her shiny, fuzzy balls that she kicks around like soccer balls and is ALWAYS losing under the t.v., behind the bookcase, under the couch. Well  very  early this morning she apparently lost one behind the metal filing cabinet in our bedroom. It's 4:45 a.m. and we are rudely awakened by ""thud, thud, thud"" as she begins to paw at the filing cabinet in an attempt to get the ball out. And on and on it went until I dragged myself out of bed and sprayed her with the handy squirt bottle we keep nearby for such occasions. Five minutes later just as I'm drifting off to sleep again ""thud, thud, thud."" I spray her again and this went on several times until we somehow in our sleepy state managed to kick her out of the room and shut the door. Then she pawed at the door to get back in until she realized that wasn't going to happen! I tell ya, she wasn't so cute anymore!  So tonight we had Life Group and we're going through a six week marriage study on conflict. I confess, for a variety of reasons, Ked and I were  really  dragging our feet into this study, (and we were facilitating tonight!) It's not that we're perfect, but conflict has never really been a big issue for us. We both have always put a lot of effort into communicating with each other and over the years we've developed a very transparent relationship. Transparency (our topic for tonight) is something we both value and it flows rather freely in our relationship. We also have trouble with studies (such as this one) that list ""these are the four steps to be transparent!"" That's a discussion for another time. So, although this study isn't where we're at and was kind of a lot of ""blah, blah, blah"" for us, we prayed that we wouldn't let that show and that God might somehow use us. We know that it will most likely meet others in the group where they are and we want to be a helpful part of that process, not a hindrance. As always, the evening was enjoyable, full of stimulating conversation and thoughtful input, and I can honestly say we thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and gained insight from the others in the group. We have a great group of couples who always inject humor and honesty into the discussions. So, despite the dragging of our own feet, I think it turned out well, and we are looking forward to the rest of the study.  Wise, insightful, poetic...not necessarily true, but I like it, oh mighty Falcon!"
3CCBN38,female,27,"As Kerry stood looking stoic before the body of Ronald Reagan what was he thinking?    In 1984 campaign literature John Kerry writes:  “We are continuing a defense buildup that is consuming our resources with weapons systems that we don’t need and can’t use.   “The Reagan Administration has no rational plan for our military. Instead, it acts on misinformed assumptions about the strength of the Soviet military and a presumed ‘window of vulnerability,’ which we now know not to exist.   “And Congress, rather than having the moral courage to challenge the Reagan Administration, has given Ronald Reagan almost every military request he has made, no matter how wasteful, no matter how useless, no matter how dangerous.   “The biggest defense buildup since World War II has not given us a better defense. Americans feel more threatened by the prospect of war, not less so. And our national priorities become more and more distorted as the share of our country’s resources devoted to human needs diminishes.”  As we look at the accomplishments of Ronald Reagan and remember that it was his policies that helped tear down the wall of communism, you have to wonder if Kerry will always be on the wrong side of history.  Mr. Kerry - keep the photo ops coming, but we know how you really feel."
3CCBN38,female,27,"Today was a pretty typical Monday for me full of laundry and vacuuming and general clean up. I wanted to get all of that out of the way today so I could spend a lot of time reading the rest of the week. I'm going to find the Tampa Library later this week. My writing course is starting to catch up with me, and I'm realizing that I need to spend some focused time reading and researching in order to take full advantage of the course.  After dinner Ked checked the mail and brought back a stack of stuff. We mostly get junk mail and bills, so to get an Easter card was a nice change of pace. A dear, precious person sent us the sweetest card. When I opened it, a $20 bill fell out and I was like ""huh?"" Ked and I looked at each other, and I read the enclosed note aloud.   ""I have been thinking a lot about you lately. Then when I read your blog for yesterday (April 1) I knew why. I want to send you this little gift, and do something nice for yourselves with it. I am so proud of you, for what you are doing and standing for your beliefs.""   Ked and I just kind of stared at each other for a minute. It was totally unexpected and was one of the kindest, most thoughtful things anyone has done for us. We're used to being on the giving end of things, and when someone does something for us, it always takes us by surprise and means so much. I still don't know what to say about it. It was a huge encouragement just to know that someone was thinking of us and encouraging us that we are doing the right things. Just before Ked checked the mail we had been discussing a few things, and then we opened this card, and it was like God was using this person to say, ""See, I love you, and you are headed down the right path."""
3CCBN38,female,27,"Welcome another blogger to the world of blogging Mom (Vicky). Check her out at  urlLink www.vicky.ailema.com .  I'm really tired today and should be in bed, but I came home from Life Group and watched the Pistons annihilate the Lakers in the last half of the Finals Game 3. That was awesome!! It's even more awesome the way the media has been drooling over the L.A. team. What cracked me up was to hear that 200 Pistons fans had stood on top of a parking garage across the street from the Laker's hotel last night and screamed for an hour starting at 11 p.m. to rattle the Lakers and keep them from getting sleep. A parade of cars also kept driving around the block and honking, until finally the police came and called it off. And that's why we love Detroit!  Life Group was awesome tonight. Ked stayed home because he wasn't feeling well. He was kind of shaky and weak. I think it may have been something he ate for lunch. He's feeling a little better now. Anyway, we're still going through Romans in Life Group, we will be for awhile, and I just love this study. Romans is such a foundational book of the Bible, and no matter how many times you've heard the salvation story, as Paul walks you through it chapter by chapter it just makes me even more joyful and amazed at the incredible love God had for me when I was still His enemy. I've been trying to wrap my mind around His grace lately, and it just continually blows me away. My mind is too human small to truly get it. That's why I think Heaven is going to be so amazing. It won't be the streets of gold or our crowns, it will be finally, truly seeing God and understanding fully Who He is. I'm shaking just thinking about it."
3CCBN38,female,27,"Unbelievable!! We just witnessed history as the Tampa Bay Lightning just won the Stanley Cup for the first time. Hockey has come a long way when a Florida team wins the cup! It was a nailbiter game, and we decided to stay home and watch rather than join the mayhem downtown. Not only was the arena sold out at over 22,000, but thousands others watched on big screens outside the forum. St Pete Times Forum is just a few blocks from UT where Ked works, but we decided to avoid the craziness and watch the game at home. There is madness in the streets tonight!!"

WARNING I TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN""T SEEN IT STOP READING AND GO TO MY POST BELOW WHICH IS A GOOD POST.  Ok, I didn't think there was a good climax. It was exciting and all that, but just as The Two Towers wasn't as ""cool and new"" this one seemed very similar to the first. and w/ the action climax being anti-climatic (Doc-Ock realizing he needed to stop) and the romantic climax weak - they should have tried to combine the two.

I've been down there twice for the ride, but have never actually done it. It's kinda a Hart thing to go down there. At least one, and up to 15 Harts have been down there every year for 30 years. One interesting story (i'm bored by the way) from the Hilly in '98 (I was down there), Dad had just finished, and as he was walking away he was the only witness to see someone back their car over a cyclist who was laying down. The cyclist was severly injured and sued CIBA - 2 years later Dad got a phone call and had to go to court as a witness for the case. anyways thats the ride Im doing next. Anyone else wanna do it? Cross country practice officialy started today - we ran a 1-mile warmup, a 2-mile sprint, and then a 1-mile cool down. Today was the day we heard the speech from coach (no drinking, drugs, mooning others while running, etc.) - very boring.   urlLink Meant to Live - Switchfoot  - this is a rare exception, I generally don't like Switchfoot at all, and the song is stuck in my head thus becoming the song of the day.  ""It's not me who can't keep a secret, it's the people I tell that can't."" - Abraham Lincoln  ""Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow."" - Genesis 41:2"

7KVE039,male,15,"A change is going into my blog and such after this post so this will be one of my last fun one. I decided to post my 10 favorite things from YG camping trip.  10. Nathan Dart's shirt which said, ""Don't be an a-- (it actually said it, and I would post it, but others mught not appreciate it, hence the two blanks), vote republican"" - he had to turn it inside out though but got away with it for almost the whole day.  9. Staying at Bloomington RPC for the night on Friday cause of the rain.  8. The food. (twas oisome)  7. Seeing Maggie water skiing after one attempt.  6. Going down early to set up tents.  5. My rotation (others complained) I got lucky. 4 ski rotations and 1 1/4 land rotations.  4. The YG sharing time (I tried to share, but I started to stumble on my words and got jittery and then kinda mumbled what I was saying - kinda embaressing, but Kevin, Jenny, Ross, Rory, Katie, and Emily (among others) had great things to share.  3. A great 2-hour game of ultimate frisbee where 13 guys and girls played as hard as possible in the rain and humidity.  2. Getting up on the skis and being able to go until I got tired, instead of going till I wrecked. And I got out of the wake of the boat.  1. Seeing lightening 50ft away from the van on the way down. It blew up a transformer that I had been staring at - very startling! and the thing was it was sunny out so very unexpected."

Shall I suffer more damage to my credit card and pretend that money really  does  grow on trees?   I was so proud of myself for not putting a single dime on my credit card when I went to the islands I would hate to ruin that by charging up a storm at the end of the month.    But what fun I would have.  I've never been to Cali and I'd love to be spontaneous and take a quick weekend getaway, especially since I feel as though I already need another vacation.  Hmmm."

1JRRSCS,female,25,"So I met Matthew J Moede on Thursday night thru my friend Flashdance.  My first thought: He's too short.  My second thought: He's got amazing teeth.  He's 25.  He's an amazing artist.  He's been to jail.  He's been in the military.  He's going back to school for Graphic Design.  He's hot.  He's funny.  He's a really nice guy.  With an edge.  With mystery.  Which of course is completely appealing to me.  We all passed out in Flash's bed that night and he spooned me and rubbed my stomach all night.  The next morning he was gone, and for a moment I was irritated... leave to a guy, can't stick around until the morning.  Then I found The Note.     Nice meeting you Katie, I had fun with you both.  Please call me.   . Redemption, he's still a nice guy.    Then there was Friday night... pretty self explanatory in the entry below.  But I still don't know how he feels about me.  Which is fine, because I'm still not sure how I feel about him.  The fact that his middle name is Jonathan also throws a Red Flag, as I have very poor history with ""Johns"".  He told Flash that ""I'm totally myself and he loves that.  And he loves hanging out with me.  And if it leads to something else than so be it, whatever happens happens"". But I don't know if he was saying that because he's not interested, or because he thinks I'm not interested.    Then there's Butcher Bill.  Genuinely nice guy, no bad ass too him. Which I need but don't necessary think I want.  And Bill's cute. And he's funny.  And he's a smart ass, and I can be dirty and raunchy around him, like I am with my guy friends.  And he doesn't care if I'm dolled up.  And he doesn't care that my abs could use some sculpting.  He's not a puzzle, he's not a friggin scavenger hunt.  I don't have to piece him together and hunt for clues to figure out what he thinks of me.  He thinks I'm amazing.  And I think I can live with that.  But does that mean I'm settling?"

1JRRSCS,female,25,"I got to work at 7:54 this morning.  I grabbed an emergency fed ex and headed out the door (815am) to College and Howell to drop off artwork.  I came back to work (9:30) and headed into a meeting that took an hour.  I headed to another meeting (11:00) that took another hour.  I went to lunch (12:30).  Now here I am having to do some actual work and I can't concentrate.  I think I have adult ADD, I mean seriously.  I get distracted so easily and always feel disorganized.  I wandered the building after lunch for no real reason other than I didn't feel like coming back up to my desk.  Now I've been here about ten minutes (1:40)  and started 4 different tasks...and now look what I'm doing.  Writing here.  I must compile a list of things I need to do before I go away this weekend.  Considering tomorrow is our party, I've got to get it all done tonight.  Argh.  And to think I've been doing little things all week to get prepared but yet I still have a ton to do.  Laundry!!!! Clean bedroom Clean basement Stop at Boz's to pick up volleyball check Make physical therapy appts.  Laundry Paint nails Sally Hansen's for hair product Highlight hair Clean golf clubs in case JB indeed decides he wants to golf this weekend. Go to bank to get cashola since dummy me has seemingly lost my debit card.  So what have I gotten done so far?  Half my room is clean, I cleaned out vacuumed and got my car washed and freshly changed oil.  I've bought the wedding presents and wrapped it all up.  I've got my dress, shoes and jewelry all picked out and ready to go.  The hotel reservations have been made and I printed out directions/maps to get there.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  Speaking of forgetting things, I'm like having an asthma attack and I forgot my inhaler at home today...swift."
1JRRSCS,female,25,"What am I thinking? 1.  I don't want to dump him. 2.  I can't blame him for being a little freaked out.  I even agree with him about things moving fast.   3.  Atleast he talked to me, maybe not right away but he did take the time to sit down and have a conversation about what he was feeling and thinking.  He could have been an asshole and blown me off all together. 4.  I'm glad he told me this now so that I have the chance to step back a little bit and not put so much stock in this relationship, who knows where it will go...now I know to put my guard back up.  Nothing is ever perfect and if I run away from something the second it's not exactly what I want I'll be alone forever.  I waited for S for over 2 years and well the other situation as well, I've got patience."
1JRRSCS,female,25,"Come out to O'Briens, we'll be up there around 8. Come up to Boz's and shoot some pool with us, I'll be there at 9. Come out to dinner with me tonight, we'll have some drinks afterward.  This  was my Friday and do you want to know what I did?  I said, no, no and no!  I stayed home and RELAXED.  Watched a little tv, did some cleaning and got all my laundry done.  Nice job!!  Can't say that about my Saturday though.  What a day/night.    I Started throwing them back around noontime and ended up leaving my pool banquet half in the bag.  I went home at 7:30 to change and took a brief 15 minute snooze at 8:00 then got up and changed into my night attire.  Headed up to Boz's to wait on the girls, had a few there and they snatched me up to go downtown.    Tangerine - stay away.  High prices, pretentious bar goers and a ONE STALL WOMAN'S ROOM!!!  With a smoke glass door!?!?  Who wants to see the silhouette of a woman pulling up her skirt?  Don't answer that.  It was a good time though, I had a nice start to the evening, as soon as I paid for my drinks a man next to me started a conversation, which ended up lasting almost the whole time we were there.  He bought me a drink and birthday shot for my gal Kit Kat, he was very cute but removing his hat revealed quite the receding hair line.  Once our group was assembled at Tangerine we were to go across the street to Eve....unfortunately khaki shorts prevented us from entering so we headed to Water Street.    Water Street - crazy party people.  Not conducive to good dancing nor good conversation.  I followed the crowd to the two M's and decided I don't really like either anymore.  But it was a good time...much of my time was spent dragging Kit Kat around and getting boyz to give her birthday kisses!  We all went to Kit Kat's for an after bar...bad idea on my part.  Should have gone home as planned but I feared for who would drive Kit Kat's car as I had drank myself sober but others were not so lucky.  After some drama and some tears, a very tired Funquita decided to head home.  I stole Kit Kat's drove home at 5 in the morning.  Talk about ready to crash.  Sunday was spent cleaning mama's house for her company coming to town.  Chicken and potatoes on the grill and a showing of ""Kill Bill"" was the topper for the evening.  I'm dead tired today and in desperate need of more relaxation.  Problem is I'm at work here with no relief in sight!"

So, this morning at work, Sharky takes a look at it and discovers it's a bad bushing that should only cost a couple of bucks at the most.  Guess what? It's a Saturn exclusive bushing. No one else makes or sells it.  Saturn won't sell just the gdmf bushing. They will only sell the ENTIRE ASSEMBLY which costs about $137.00.  Saturns are too new and in too good shape to be found in junkyards...  AARRGGHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"
EYVZ1MW,female,37,"*sigh*    Sharky blew a hose in the truck yesterday.  Since all the hoses are probably 30+ years old, he says there's a chance that if he replaces the blown one, the rest will go, one by one - so might as well replace all of them.  I really wanted us to work on the house this weekend.    There's a little black & white cat living on our front porch.  It's quite the talker and probably has ear mites.  It's very scrawny.  I feel terrible for it, but we can't have another animal.  I had a talk with it today and told it that it was ok to kill the rats to eat, but to make sure it actually eats the rat and not just leave it torn apart in the back yard for my children to see.  I hope it understands.  No bird or squirrel killing allowed.    Bug is watching me type.  He thinks it's very cool that I can type without watching my fingers.

EYVZ1MW,female,37,"Well, first thing first, I'm ok. Meds are fine, skin spots are just moles (ick, but relieved), and Doc Tom wants to help me lose weight.  He's a good doc, a DO (which I prefer over MDs), and he listens. He rx'd an appetite suppressant which is affordable, and should work with me without having any bad side effects. We discussed diet and he understands my hesitation regarding the mostly protein diets (kids and sheer high price of meats). We talked about different ways of getting around it.  He found out I was a Marine, so he shared his military experience with me. Long story short, he enlisted in the Army's Special Forces WWII at 17, spent 3 mos. in a German POW camp (had great diet jokes from that experience), battlefield promotion to 2ndLT, went to West Point, then became a doctor, served in Korea, was a field surgeon in Vietnam, got out when HIV hit the military and has been a civilian ever since. (Told you I liked the guy. LOL)  The weird thing, is that I had NO idea he was former military and I had NO idea he was THAT old! Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, Sharky and I watched movies regarding WWII and had very long, drawn out detailed discussions about many things - most of which happened to pop up in Doc Tom's conversation.  I'm taking this all as a good sign. Can't get my rx filled until Friday, but will start trying to eat appropriately until then..."
EYVZ1MW,female,37,"Well I guess I slept ok, except for the nightmares, which were to be expected.  We went to bed after 11 and of course, as soon as all our lights were out and our heads hit the pillow, the fireworks started again.  *sigh*  It quieted down a little after midnight - and I was awoken at 4:30 by someone setting them off AGAIN in front of the Nastys' house.

EYVZ1MW,female,37,"My precious Petunia can see faeries and angels...  She will sit, staring into space and start smiling and laughing at something that we just cannot see. If we move her, she will try her hardest to get back to her original position. The point where she is staring at is always at about the same place a human face would be - if standing or sitting.  My mom thinks it's my grandmother...  As for the faeries... On quite a few occasions, I was holding her in my arms, she was sitting up (with my assistance of course!) and she looked on top of my head and just started cackling! It was the funniest thing she had ever seen. Where I sit, there is nothing behind me but a beige wall. Sometimes, sitting in her swing, she will twist around and smile and laugh at a spot above the t.v. where, again, nothing is.  Bear and Bug were puzzled until I told them that she was seeing faeries - they asked why they couldn't see them. I told them it was because they were her faeries! :-)  Sad - they have forgotten the days when they saw faeries too. I have wonderful memories of a chubby Bear and then Bug, running around a sunspot in our living room, laughing as they tried to catch the ""faewies""..."

Ironically, the part he did the worst on (puzzles) is one of his greater strengths.  Bug, on the other hand, aced it. Which, of course, made Bear feel even worse inside - though he does put on a brave front and brags about his very smart little brother.  It's hard. We keep telling him to do his best because that is what really counts - and even if he doesn't pass, he'll still be kept in the Edge program (like a junior gifted class).  I just don't want to see his spirit crushed by all of this..."
JABWWOZ,female,24,"OK so this thing that I have been struggling with this last week has been a pain but it was all fixed on Wednesday night. I just need to write this down somewhere so I have it and remember how faithful God has been to me in this. I had totally forgot that we were having that concert and I went there expecting another youth night. When I got there and realized what was going on I went outside and I prayed that God would speak to me in whatever way He needed to. I went back in truly expecting to hear HIs voice. So the concert started and things were awesome the band was really really good and the lead singer was very surrendered to God's leading. After standing and worshiping for awhile I sat down to take a break, I looked across the crowd and really felt the spirit moving. I saw Mia and really felt the Lord was doing something and moving on her heart. God kept pushing me and telling me to go and lay hands and pray for her but I was being completely stubborn. So I sat there in my unfauthfulness as usual and did nothing. I was sitting right in front of Robert and Angela and about 10 seconds after I sat down Robert leaned over my shoulder and said ""God is telling me to tell you that if you go pray for Mia she will go over the edge."" I thought OK that is definitely my cue. I got up and walked over and laid my hands on her and I could feel the presence of the Spirit there. Wouldn't know it right at that moment the lead singer (Richie) stopped and said that he wants only the ""red head"" to pray for that girl, obviously not knowing our names. He said that the ""red head"" has the anointing right now and she needs to pray over her. I sobbed right there, I knew that this was how God was talking to me. I continued to pray and finally Mia gave in, she had been fighting it a little, and the spirit just clobbered her. She went down and I prostrated myself and cried and prayed and thanked God for once again being more faithful than anything and anyone. The concert continued on and after the band played the last song they were going to pray over all of us. I hope this doesn't sound like pride but no one else was given a word that night except me. Richie looked at me and told me ""You have an incredible anointing and God wants you to stop building walls out of fear and come into Him, He wants to capture you and give you the peace and joy that you long for."" I was blown away, that was the first time in a long time I had really let myself be open and sure enough God spoke and I listened."
JABWWOZ,female,24,It has been awhile but things have been really busy. I have been quite sick the last week and I am just now starting to get over it. It is really interesting the things that you think about when you are lying in bed and you can't breathe and all you do is cough. It is kind of scary but I actually thought about what would happen if the bronchitis got so bad that I died. Don't ask me why or where it came from but it came. What would Jordan do? What would my family do? What about my friends? I was really curious to see how people would react to my untimely departure. I think the fever was getting to me.
JABWWOZ,female,24,"I watched this movie last night about Rachel Joy Scott. She was one of the girls whose life was claimed at Columbine High School, April 20th, 1999. First of all I just want to say that I can not believe that it has been almost 4 years since that fateful day. I can't believe what those boys did and I find it kind of humorous that this had such an amazing effect in spreading the word of God that the devil never saw coming. This vidoe however was amazing because it was Rachel's dad talking about how he knew and his daughter knew that she was going to die. She didn't know that she was going to die that day or in that way but she knew that her time was short and that God was going to use her through something a year before the event. She wrote about it in her diary, poems and thoughts and hopes and dreams and the ultimate longing and desire to live in God's presence forever. There were also people that knew what was coming, they had been told by God in dreams. Forgotten, months later the dreams came to pass and were lived out here on earth. She sounded like an amazing person someone that I probably would have been honored to meet and have in my life, however I didn't meet her and she wasn't in my life but her mesage was so much louder. I pray that her message can be my message and I can live my life the way she did so if anything were ever to happen people would stand up and say things about me that they said about her."
JABWWOZ,female,24,O.K. so for those of you who read this often if you haven't noticed I can't decide on a template.

JABWWOZ,female,24,"So for those of you that have not heard yet Jordan and I got approved it has actually been while since then but we got approved. We are going to be building our first house. Praise God!!! Something that we own that is ours that we don't have to share with anyone else, just us. Also I got a new job, I am going to be a Distribution Manager for International Marketing. How amazing is that? I have been looking for a job since all the ouse stuff went through and I got one within 3 days and it is a manager position starting at 30,000/year. God is so good and he is always right on time. So things are amazing on this end as far as financially. I just am struggling really bad with something. I have had this feeling that God is trying to separate Jordan and I from the regular group that we normally spend all our time with. I really know that he is trying to tell us that we need more one on one time and we also need a lot more fellowship with other married couples. I also know that he is telling me that my friendship with Hannah is not as healthy for me as I really want it to be because I love her. It hurts because I think she is an incredible person but everytime I have spent time with her in the last 2 weeks it has felt like there has been this dissension. I don't know if it is the enemy because it's not like I am ending our friendship all together I am just having this feeling of sorrow about our relationship. I don't even know how to explain it in a way that makes sense. I just know that I have had a really hard time being around her because we have bickered more, been short and trite with each other, and just are not the way we used to be. It makes sense in my brain but I don't think it is here. If you could just pray for me that God will reveal exactly what it is he wants me to learn from this situation that has risen I would greatly appreciate it."
JABWWOZ,female,24,"Pending Response.  After talking to Praying Mantis this weekend and throwing some ideas around for the ministry that he is wanting to start I am excited for the response that will be received. Reach out to the ""unreachable"" befriend the ""friendless"". I am not quite sure if that is the way it should be worded but maybe that is the way it has translated in my spirit. I am really feeling this. Please pray that this new fresh idea that is being birthed will be successful and fruitful. Pray that it is not a religious thing but a in the world but not of the world thing.  Weekends at Agape. I have been offered the weekend position on Saturday and Sundays 7am-7pm at the Agape House. Pray that I would be given the ability to show grace to the girl's in this home. Pray that my organizational skills would increase and improve ten fold. Pray that my creativity would open wide again as I find activities to do and places to go on Saturdays. Pray that I once again would be a friend first and authority second.  New York City, NY March 2005. I can taste the city on my tongue. Pray those of us being led to the inner city would be beneficial to the Kingdom. Pray that everything would fall into place and there would be a movement.  2014, Jordan's long term goal for possibly being on the mission field full time as a family. Pray now that if it His will he would pave the way and open the door. Pray that he would begin to prepare our hearts now. Pray that He would reveal to us what this seed that has been planted would mean as far as starting a family in the Sates or waiting. Maybe not having a child right now is what this has all been for. Pray for guidance and wisdom.  Pray for me as I have returned full time to Youth Ministry. Pray that my spirit would be in full submission to my leadership. Pray that I would enter back into this more as a friend and mentor rather than an authority.  I thanked God on Friday night that He knows the time and place for everyone. I thank Him again today for taking me through the valley these last 6 months. I pray that he would refuel me with a desire to do His work with more fervor and dedication than ever before. Thank you God for this time and place."
JABWWOZ,female,24,"I have been reading C.S.Lewis' ""The Great Divorce"" and it has been very interesting . The imagery and approach that he takes on and towards certain things. He explains things through his character's in a way that you might not usually look at something. His approaches tend to very random and off the wall but when you really analyze it and try and think about it practically it makes complete sense. Some of the scenes in the book are cut short due to narrator moving on in his own journey but your imagination takes off and you begin to, in you own mind, complete what would have happened. Obviously just like any other piece of literature that I have read quotes, thoughts, and issues stand out.  In one of the scenes the ghost(the people who are in hell given a second chance at heaven) is talking to a spirit(a person who realized the err of their ways before death and made it to heaven the first time) are talking. This particular ghost was in his mortal life a scholar/writer of amazing pieces of work on earth. The spirit is trying to convince the ghost that the land that he will enter if he chooses is one of eternal answers and the ghost is arguing that there is no one definitive answer to anything including who or what God is. The ghost is basically stuck on the idea of status because of who he once was and after a long drawn out conversation the spirit sums it up in one response.  ""No,"" said the spirit. ""I can promise you none of those things. No sphere of usefulness: you are not  needed  at all. No scope for your talents: only the forgiveness for having perverted them. No atmosphere of inquiry, for I will bring you to the land not of questions but of answers, and you shall see the face of God."" To think that God gives us life on earth and fills our life with grace and gifts that we can use to spread them to other's. Once we leave this place however we are of no need. I will not be useful in heaven. I will not be needed in heaven. I will though be wanted and desired by a loving God. The talents that I have been given by only Him alone are His to give and take. Since I have them though, how have I used them? Have I become prideful because I have a voice that can sing? Have I become prideful because I have fingers to play? Have I become prideful because I have legs and arms to use for physical activities? The answer to all of them is most likely whether I admit or accept it, yes. That is an example of the perversion that was spoken of. To think though that in the end when it all comes down to it God forgives me for not using those talents, those gifts for His glory all of the time. When I have fallen into that pridefulness God looks at me and says, ""Don't forget where those came from."" When it comes to questions and answers I think of all the conversations that I have had with people and the discussions that most often have ended in frustration. The hours that have been wasted on discussions about what everyone  thinks  scripture is saying is incredible. I have come to a place, I think, where scripture tends to be extremely black and white in more areas than this world and the church have determined. There is not a whole lot of gray area. I know that the only way to the Father is through the Son. I know that I have been redeemed from death because of the cross. I know that the righteousness that the Son possesses dwells in me. I know that I am cleansed by the blood of the lamb. And I know that I am forgiven of my sins. As far as predestination and pre-trib/post-trib those might very well be gray areas however, what does it matter? There is not atmosphere of inquiry because there will not be a need or persistence for answers because you will know beyond a shadow of doubt what the answers were all along. At that moment you might actually smack yourself in the head, duh. You might even realized that it had been in front of you the entire time but the complexity of man confused and distorted it, and you might just realize how simple it really was. However, none of these things may occur because you will be before the throne of the Almighty and that is really all that will matter.  more to come............................................."

The feeling gets stronger and you start to feel that discomfort low in your gut, and you still don’t move. And now its four am and you are now wide awake and get up to go to the bathroom, and as you softly go down the stairs.    ”THUD”  Tragically, you hear the toilet lid drop, and see the bathroom light is on.

YCRQ5JL,male,16,"urlLink musicmobs  is a great website to go to check musical trends, and people who use itunes are fairly cool, except those windows itunes users who only listen to linkin park all day. anyway, i did want to add my mac's library list to musicmobs, but it's not really necessary, and it'd be boasting. it'd make me the greatest music geek on the website, with 45000 plays and counting. but see my collection on my mother's computer only. the one on my mac laptop is more extensive at about 8000 tracks -- all ripped, since those damned filesharing programmes don't work-- which would probably bring most of my favourite artists into the top 10 easily. but here i only have a cd's full, since i can't do anything else while ripping my cd on this computer, i have to do so *very* selectively.   but the statistics are pretty cool indeed, and with definite evidence of some proper music fans with their own catalogue rollin', instead of someone who keeps listening to something that makes our local airwaves. lemmings, all of them.   anyway, yes, i did break down one day and decide to listen to one of alice's covers. although you may immediately ask if alice is not entitled to sell her versions of songs or to quickly emblazon her own ""copyright"" over them, she has the right to do so under US law, but she has to send mail to the artist in charge with 30 days' notice to invoke a license (which i believe is automatically and unconditionally given to her, unless she cribs the whole recording) to cover the song under US fair use terms. these may be mirrored in singapore law when the FTA takes place in just a few days' time.   we assume that alice is so smart from her english acing activities that she has already sent these artists their fair use letters already, so she is probably legally bound to do so. although people may sue her for deploying guitar, it's so 1966. no cool person ever plays guitar any more. (in case alice does indeed play all the guitar, it's the best strumming since sonic youth! errr heh. maybe not.)  but alice does have a sweet singing voice. really sweet like sugar. even though she sings the one they play EVERY TIME YOU SCORE A GOAL IN THAT WINNING ELEVEN GAME, IT'S NOT FUNNY ANY MORE. honest. i scored so many goals i turned delirious. never mind a more american voice singing it (words pronounced by americans like ""hot"", ""fot"", ""bot"" and ""han solo"" are now pronounced ""hart"", ""fart"", ""bart"" and ""banjo"" respectively). or that she does, admittedly, just slightly trips over the very very high chords, but every good woman has a bit of manliness in her. hence the tendency to spoil for a fight now and then. alice, seriously, well, keep it up. it's good enough.   cy did sing a stereolab song (she MEMORISED the whole of ""lo boob oscillator"" just to tramp on into ""plastic sun"" by sonic's kim gordon)... once. it's almost the most charming song ever, except that they try to spoof sonic youth at the three minute mark."

And we did the English discursive essay on external influences while she was teaching the lesson, which Kenn approached with a timeline, and which I didn't handle well so we went on a tangent. And with a minute to the end of the lesson and with half-marshalled arguments left unshelled, I ended by saying ""burning fags isn't for heresy any longer. Isn't Western culture great?"" - thereby breaking an unsaid rule for formal English. Twice.

The same problem affects jazz - Miles Davis named one of the most brilliant albums ever - never mind just for jazz.

UWJTH0W,female,25,"Day Four    I don't think I've ever made such a big deal about a job change before.  Dunno why this one is different.  Anyways, I think I'm beginning to see the seeds of settling in.  Yesterday, I just about broke down in tears at work, I was so frustrated.  I was still running around in circles, and it seemed like everytime I would try to ask someone for clarification, they were either busy or not in their office.  Finally, shortly after lunch, one guy did pop by and I made him sit down and explain things some more.  I seem to work that way - I need things explained once (preferably the 'big picture' first, then the smaller details of what I'm actually supposed to do), then go away and let me see if I've got it.  I often need two or three rounds of explanation/let-me-do-it-myself cycles before something clicks, and then I'm off and running.  I think yesterday afternoon was the clicking point.  Now all my questions are just about the smaller details, and I'm sure I'll have those for weeks to come.  Now all I need to do is personalize my office a little more, and perhaps things won't seem so bad.  Plus, I'm trying to figure out how I can fit the word ""active"" into my lifestyle now.  By the time I get home, it's often 6pm or later (depending on what errands we have to run), and then there's dinner, and little household things, and a little vegetating, and a shower, and before you know it, it's past 10pm and I'm ready for bed.  So, after a few days of being turned down by someone I thought would be a regular lunching buddy, I've decided that maybe lunchtime would be a good time to do something.  Maybe I'll become one of those ""lunchtime park bunnies"" - one of those women who head out to Prince's Island and the Bow River pathway for a run at lunch.    And I intend to hold Biskette to her word . . . she said that shortly after she started getting paycheques from her new job, she'd buy a bunch of passes to the City pools, and I would have to make sure she used them.  No arguments there.  I would love to go swimming once or twice a week, but motivation is lacking lately.  Having someone to go with would definitely help.  And has anyone else discovered that when they make a personal resolution to eat better, all the ""forbidden"" or ""bad"" foods start to smell twice as appealing?  After discovering that it's fruit season, and almost everything is on sale and finally affordable, I stocked up last night.  The idea being that I would start taking lots of fruit to work with me and try to avoid all the tempting treats and dining options, if only for lunchtime.  I had visited Jugo Juice yesterday, and decided I would go back today.  I'd heard that their smoothies were basically meal equivalents, and that a 1oz shot of their ""wheatgrass juice"" was the same as taking in 2.5lbs of leafy green vegetables.  I figured, heck, if I can get that many veggies in a 1oz shot, it was worth a try.  It's actually not all that bad.  A little bitter and grassy (obviously), a little sweet, and all over in one small gulp.  The jury's still out on the smoothie and it's staying power.  I'll get back to you on that.  But the whole point of that way to say that, on my way to Jugo Juice today, I had to pass a chinese buffet restaurant.  And oh man, did the smells wafting out to the sidewalk ever tempt me.  So yeah, the world's not quite so dark and weepy today."
UWJTH0W,female,25,"A Rant About Animal Treatment      OK, I have this topic on my mind.  I have personally boycotted Petland for this reason, but we stopped off at one on Saturday anyways.  They've recently incorporated an adoption program in addition to their usual animals for sale.  To be honest, the adoptive animals seem to have much better living conditions than the ones you pay big money for.  I just don't think it's right.  Have you ever seen the little cells these puppies and kittens live in?  They're about 3' x 3' x 4', and I may be overestimating.  The floors are wire so the animal just voids itself wherever, whenever, and they can slide out the tray below and clean it.  Logical and efficient, sure, but hardly humane in my opinion.  I saw large-breed puppies that occupied nearly 1/3 of their living space.  One particular puppy caught our attention - a Husky/Malamute cross.  We inquired about her, only to find that they wanted $688 (for a mixed breed??), and this was considered a discount because she'd already been returned once, and diagnosed by a vet as a possible fear biter.  They wanted $700 for an animal that needed extra attention and special training?  I would have been more than willing to consider a ""special needs"" puppy, but not if you want me to pay you $700, and then cough up more to have it fixed.  The poor thing is almost guaranteed to become a fear biter, and will probably end up at one of the rescue foundations.  It makes me sick.  We didn't stay there long, obviously.  There should be laws against places like that."
UWJTH0W,female,25,"I am suffering from a serious lack of enthusiasm considering it's Friday.  Serious lack of creativity, too.  Maybe I'll take a crack at Biskette's taxes so I can get rid of any logical tendencies from my brain.  She's got foreign income this year, so I jumped all over that.  I think she thinks that I have a screw loose somewhere, or that I'm just teasing her when I excitedly offer to do her taxes.  I dunno, I'm just weird that way.  I love the satisfaction I get from making numbers line up  just so , and having it all mean something.  I hope her sister hasn't done hers yet, either. =)  She didn't want them done on the computer, which is more than fine by me, I just have to get in touch with Biskette again to let her know I'm all for it.  Enh, a girl's gotta get her kicks from somewhere, n'est pas?"
UWJTH0W,female,25,"*groan*            That's the last time I ditch swimming for that long without a good excuse.  My strokes felt (and probably were) sloppy and I'm sore today.  That'll teach me to be lazy!         On a much brighter note . . . for the last few months, I've casually mentioned a few times to BF that we should take a real vacation sometime this year, perhaps September or October since that might be the best work lull for the both of us.  At first, I suggested that we just book a week off and cruise last-minute specials.         More recently, I got an email notice about some fanastic deals at SuperClubs all-inclusive resorts - 50% plus off their regular rates if you book by August 31 to travel between September and November.  So I mentioned it to BF again, but didn't get much of an enthusiastic response, so naturally figured it wasn't a top priority for him.         I can bide my time - I'd rather wait and go on a vacation we're both excited about than push for something just because *I* want it.         But then, the other night, he came home and said, ""So have you booked us a vacation yet?""         I just about fell off the couch.  I'd mentally dropped the idea of a vacation for the time being.         See, waaaaaaay back about 2 or more years ago, we first got introduced to the idea of  urlLink Hedonism  resorts.  It became one of those ""we gotta do that someday"" things.    Hedonism is a SuperClubs resort - and among the specials listed in the email.  Someday pretty much translates into ""before we have too much responsibility and/or we're too old.""  Someday could be now.         So I've spent a good chunk of my morning investigating prices.  Started off looking at some of the cheaper destinations, and then became obsessed with Hedonism.  Looked into airfares, and package deals, basically trying to get a fairly accurate idea of what this might cost.           It's not unreasonable, and all-inclusive, if we go sometime in mid-October for an entire week (Sat-Sat).         Unfortunately, we've also been thinking seriously about a second vehicle.  A vacation of this magnitude would mean putting that off until after Christmas.         But we're not getting any younger, still have that childless freedom, what better excuse could we have for such a vacation?  Now I just have to see if BF agrees with my way of thinking . . . =)"
UWJTH0W,female,25,"A Winner!      Sadly, it's not me.  I won a cookie the other day (only my second prize), but that's not what I'm talking about.  A Buick Rendezvous was won from  MY  Tim Hortons!  I tell ya - the girls behind the counter are holding out on me! =)  Naw, they're all great . . . I've gotten a free coffee before, and once been charged for a medium when I had a large . . . little things like that tend to make a customer loyal.   So someday soon, there will be a Buick outside the store on display.  Cool!  As an aside, when this contest first started, and you'd mention a Buick Rendezvous to people, they'd get this confused look on their face.    ""A what?""    And if you followed up with, ""You know, the Tiger Woods car . . . ""  . . . suddenly the light goes on.  Now  there's  effective advertising!"
UWJTH0W,female,25,"Just as a side note . . . because this goes through my mind everytime I complain about something in my life.  It's just complaining.  I don't think I'm particularly hard-done-by, I just want to complain in some form so I can get it out of my system and put it in perspective and move on.  And it works, for me at least. =)  And DaGoddess, if you stop by, I really hope you get some good news about your son!"
UWJTH0W,female,25,"""The FatBoy, The FatBoy!!!""     I'm so disappointed . . .   One of our local radio station (THE only good one! *L*), CJay 92, has this Rock Rewards program whereby you listen to the radio and they'll announce special passwords 4 times a day.  You enter them on their website, and they collect, like Air Miles.  And you can cash them for a variety of prizes - one being an entry into a ""showcases"" draw.  They'll offer these ""showcases"" for a couple of months, and then draw a winner.  The winner gets to choose one prize out of 6.  They did a draw this morning, and the prizes were as follows -   - His and hers fully loaded Cavaliers - $30,000 free rent from Boardwalk (obviously you have to live at one of their properties) - a golf package, including an equity membership at a course and a shopping spree - two mountain bikes and a mountain-biking vacation package - a $30,000 downpayment on a Beattie home -  A 2003 100th ANNIVERSARY HARLEY DAVIDSON FATBOY!   Can you believe the lady who won took the cars over the Harley?  (Oops - ammendment here - I guess she chose the Beattie home prize later).  My bf is going to be so disappointed when I tell him he didn't win, and even more disappointed when I told him the winner didn't even take the Fat Boy. *sigh*"
UWJTH0W,female,25,"Fun With Sitemeters      I love checking those site tracker thingies every now and then.  Wanna know what some people arriving here have been looking for?  Sure you do! =)  ""Six White Boomers"" (duh)  ""lap dance speakeasy calgary"" (sorry, buddy, I'm sure you were disappointed)  ""calgary freak girl"" (to each their own opinion, I guess)  ""peter kitchin"" (wow - I wonder who was looking for my uncle?)  ""people overspend during christmas, bad or good?"" (wow, whoever actually looks up full sentences like that needs to see their shrink a little more often)  OK, so nothing terribly interesting.

DCTFFOV,female,17,"Today has been pretty boring. I woke up around noon, but no complaints there. I read some  Harry Potter  throughout the day, only to be yelled at 1,000 times by my mom, because I wasn't helping her clean. I managed to get out of cleaning pretty much all day. I just cleaned her car, that was my only contribution. My mom and I planned a college visiting trip to see Purdue and DePaul in Chicago. I hope that goes through. But I also want to see Drexel in Philly and University of Maryland- and my mom says if my dad will pay for it, I can just fly there and go by myself! Isn't that crazy?! I would have a nice time by myself.  I went to CVS to use my coupon for 50 digital pictures for $10, it took me like an hour. Some hick in front of me couldn't use the machine, and ooh it was stressful. I developed this old picture of me and Erica in Stratford, and the lady goes, ""Oh are you related?"" I thought she was kidding so I was laughing and saying no. Then she goes, ""But you have the same smile!"" I still thought she was kidding, but then this other woman, who hadn't seen the picture, asked if we looked alike, and the lady goes ""Yeah, they do."" But there was no sarcasm to her voice. I think she was serious- what an idiot! I got really random pictures developed.  Earlier I watched Best Month Ever on VH1- it was just all the best parts of Best Week Ever compiled into one show, but it was still so funny! That's like my favorite show, along with Last Comic Standing, I love to laugh! Did you know there is a Best Week Ever blog? It's great... http://bestweekever.vh1.com/  But eww they're saying that Hillary Duff and Joel from GC are dating! That's so gross, I'm going to find him at Warped Tour and call him out as the white trash perv he is- trust me I have no fear of that piece of ass. It's horrible, but I never plan on using violence against another human being, just the power of my words to show them that they are nothing and stupid and have no purpose on this Earth, and that I am their queen. WHAHAHA. I also watched Stevo 32 from Sum 41 on Cribs. He is really funny. Deryck was there eating a hot dog- my two favorite foods: Deryck Whibley and hot dogs. NUM NUMS! At one point Stevo goes, ""Here's my boy: Bob Barker!"" and it scans to an autographed picture of Bob- I loved that show! Dave Brownsound and Cone were there too- I really miss them/will never see them live. Maybe one day. As I've said, Carrot Top is our link to blink. Now I'm just rambling. But you guys- Lizzie showed me this great interview with Tom DeLonge about his support for Kerry and all that- it was so hot. I'm super attracted to boys who are involved (aka that kid I've talked about, even though he's blonde) and I want to help out too, it's really important! So go out there ladies and be political, that's all I have to say."
DCTFFOV,female,17,"My aunt is in town and is driving me crazy. I got a job. I'm going to be babysitting regularly for these two kids. It's money, but I hate children. I saw Harry Potter for the third time today. He is just so cute. Plus, he's only turning 15 this July. That's just great. I'm 17 and I'm freakishly attracted to a 14 year old. We took my dog on a walk today. He found a package of hot dogs and brought it home. It was this kid's fishing bait...oops. Then I went down to the Ohio Democratic Headquarters to get some tickets for John Kerry tomorrow. This really adorable boy was working, he was COMPLETELY frazzled. This woman asked for like 50 tickets! There was a little brown man in a ""John Kerry for President 2004"" t-shirt and he had all this paperwork which said he was apart of something for John Kerry. Go little man, go! I got some tickets and then we had a little conversation: Me: ""Do you have any volunteer opportunities?"" Him: ""Well, no not me personally."" I don't know if he was being friendly or evil. He had good emo-boy hair. Nice nice."
DCTFFOV,female,17,"Happy Monday! School was some good times today. Liz brought me my copy of the Mest/FOB concert pictures! They were great! I returned a video and needed to renew a book about Elvis. The one librarian (copy nazi) renewed it until April 30, so I can stop coming back every two weeks. I walked into English... AND TRIPPED IN FRONT OF DR. DODEN! I got really feisty about feminist issues. Dr. Doden was like, ""Rush Limbaugh calls feminists 'feminazis' but do you see feminists rounding up 6 million men and burning them?!"" It was great! We had shorter classes again, thankfully! I didn't understand my lab AT ALL! Before chapel we played some ""Crocadilla"" that old school game. I was the ""Grand Croc Master"". Then we had to do flags... usually Lauren Smiley messes up, but alas it was my turn. Right before I was gonna go, Dr. Doden was like ""Don't trip!"" (since I already had today). I didn't trip, but the actual flag slipped out of my hand and was dragging on the ground. I laughed. Later he came up to me and said, ""Well, you didn't trip, but you giggled!"" It was true.  I have a Spanish test tomorrow, and I really don't understand. Wish me luck!"
DCTFFOV,female,17,"So, I'm kind of in a bad mood. I don't know why. I think it's cause I didn't get much sleep and had to babysit this morning at 9 am. I shudder. Anyways, I was mean to the kids. Well, just the boy. He kept touching me, I mean I know he's three and he is just a kid, but keep your disgusting paws off of me! Then he started rubbing my thigh, I grabbed his hand and knocked it off of me. We were watching that fucker Dora, by the way I really think there is something wrong with her eyes, anyways he was lying on the couch and putting his dirty feet on me- IT WAS SO OBNOXIOUS. And the little girl was screaming and constantly eating cheerios, which everyone knows I hate because that's what I think kids smell like - crusty old cheerios. They're gross. But I got $50 for yesterday and today. That's not too bad. Doug is working in the house. I came home and the garage and gate were shut. So I assumed he did it, even though his car wasn't around. I walked into the house and he had left all the lights on and the radio on. Doug, turn that stuff off! The radio, by the way, was from MY bedroom! Doug there is one sitting in the kitchen! Oh well. I saw he left a big beer can sitting on the table, I'm surprised he didn't take it with him when he went to go get whatever he was going to get. I'm really mean. Don't know why. I leave you with this odd moment from Texas, I don't believe I shared. When we were driving in Tennessee I saw a man in the next truck drinking from a bottle in a brown bag. Yes, he was drinking and driving. We tried to get around and past him, you know, cause we didn't want to die. Anyways, we were listening to Taking Back Sunday and it was on the part when he goes, ""You're a lush"" and we were pulling right alongside the car and I look over at the man drinking, and then the CD skips and it's going, ""You're a lush-lush-lush-lush"" It was classic!"
DCTFFOV,female,17,"HEY HEY! Well some crazy stuff has happend in the past two days, so here goes. Yesterday was pretty average and then I had kickboxing. Man, it was rough. I've done the Billy Blanks tapes. And you know, this is a really buff guy, but he's so nice and always saying ""if it's too difficult, just modify it. You'll be okay"" Well Ms. Standley, is quite different than our good friend Billy Blanks. She made us sprint, do jumping jacks, and so on. That's all fine and dandy, but we hardly did the kickboxing part. And she was all ""PUSH IT YOU LARD ASSES!"" Well she didn't say that, but man she wanted us to move. It was really funny.  After school, I went to Meghan's, cause as I said before, we were going to go see Junior Revolution. When we got inside, I had like 15 bags, and I ran into a chair, that was funny. Then we were doing some homework, and while she was walking her dog, I tried to print my spanish homework, but the pages never came out and I thought I broke the printer. Turns out, you have to pull out the tray so the paper can come out. OOPS! As we were leaving, Meghan completely wipes out on the steps in the garage, I mean wipes out! She had to be in so much pain, but I couldn't stop from laughing.  We headed to Cosi before the conert. Okay, don't go to the Polaris Cosi, it's messed up. We had a really bad waitress and there was this guy and girl humping in front of one of their families, it was gross. And you know how there are paintings on the wall? Well, this one lady comes over and is standing right in front of our table looking at the paintings. Then she was talking to her daughter, and she thought I was the artist, because I was the one sitting by it and she goes, ""Oh look, she's shy!"" WHAT THE HELL LADY?! Chelsea from Westerville South does NOT live by the painting, therefore there is a chance that I might not be the artist! The food was really greasy too, and I had a stain on my shirt that looked like poop. It was gross. Then we headed towards Midgard. I was singing to ""Hey Mickey"" or whatever and having some fun. So we enter, and there are literally five people there. We stood against the wall as the first band finished, and then we spotted the guys from J Rev! It was really exciting. Meghan kept telling me to go over there, but I couldn't. This girl went and tried to talk to them, and they completely shut her down, so I was worried that they would do the same to me. When she finally got the hint and left, we walked over there, and my heart was racing. I don't know why, I just get really nervous. But we did, and they were really nice. We only really talked to Chris (the drummer) and Brian (the bassist), oh yeah and the merch guy. They were really nice and we talked about their show with Something Corporate, and where they were from, and of course we talked about CSG, cause that's basically my entire life's purpose. I told them I was the girl that had been e-mailing them like 7,000 times, in reality twice, and they remembered. We also talked about my two difficult tests the next morning. That was exciting. They signed my concert shirt, and I let the merch guy as well, but the guy who looks like Bob the Bachelor was kind of mean. But I still got the autograph. So Chris says he's from Akron, and oh god I don't know why, but... I asked if he had heard of the Oliver Ocasek building!!! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH no I know! Oliver Ocasek is my late great uncle and he used to be President of the Ohio Senate. I  couldn't think of anything to say so that's what I said! He looked at me, said no, and the conversation pretty much ended. So after another band we thought and hoped that J Rev would be next. I asked Brian, and he said that there was still another band to go. Well I'm sorry, but I had two tests the next day and we had to be home by 10! It was like 9 and there was no way in hell we'd see them. Brian was really nice and he kept coming over and apologizing that we wouldn't be able to see them and that they didn't know all the other bands were going to take so long. So then we talked a lot more, and I made a fool of myself some more times. We talked about having them play at Senior Day, hem hem class 05, this is a really good idea. Even Meghan likes them, so they'll play, okay that's settled. While we were talking, I was really pissed that the band setting up wouldn't go faster, and Brian goes, ""Geez you're ready to just kick them off stage"" and I was like ""Well, sometimes I get a little aggressive!"" It's true, I have about as much patience as I don't know, somebody without patience. He kept trying to talk about what they were doing, but apparently I kept going back to hanging out with Something Corporate. I'm sorry, I just love them. So the band Soma begins to play. Oh dear, they're weird. The lead singer is about 35, with a full beard and bald spot. The guitarist looks like he's been ripped out of the Darkness video, and the keyboardist is either wearing the best bell-bottoms ever created, or a long denim skirt. Either way, I just don't know. The singer was really annoying and looked out into space and couldn't concentrate. Then he went outside, with the mic, and was like ""What the fuck are you doing outside? Don't you know Soma's playing!?"" Then he came in and entertained us all with his magical flying middle fingers and his constant badgering of us all by calling us ""maggots"". Thanks, I really support you Soma. Actually, it was really funny.  Half way through their performance, we had to leave. It was really awkward, cause I didn't know if I was supposed to say goodbye to Brian, since he was standing next to us, or not. So we did. He apologized to us and gave us a hug and then we left. Oh and he told us to get home safely. It was nice. And Meghan was like ""he likes the brown flava"" but I thought she said ""he likes the brown Frida"". You know that Spanish woman Frida something, who looks like  man? I thought she was saying I looked like a man, but she wasn't and it was just funny.  So we didn't get to see them play, but it was neat to talk to the band, and I told them I would be there Columbus spokesperson, and they were weirded out but whatever! P.S. Brian told me that Will left Something Corporate, so I promptly called Elizabeth.  When we got back to Meg's, I noticed a nice couple of skid marks she left on the stairs from her fall and I laughed, a lot. Then we watched this horrible Primetime about Colorado City and theif ass prophet who makes 15 year olds marry like 40 year olds. It was foul. Then we laughed in bed for a long time. And the next morning I kept hovering over Meghan to get her up.  Today was pretty boring, people were mean to me, and p.s. SENORA pryor, stop being a bastard to me, cause we all know that you want to have sex with all your students you perv. I hate you. And your kids are ugly. So just never speak again, thanks bye.  Well I will be attending the school play tonight. Hope my friends do a great job, I know they will!"
DCTFFOV,female,17,"I'm tired as shit. I don't even know what's going on. I don't know what I've done lately or what the last thing I wrote about was. All I remember is that the Incubus concert was on Saturday. They probably are the best performers I've seen. They put on a real show, and it's sad that I only say that because they actually played longer than an hour! GO THEM! Brandon Boyd took off his shirt. Every boy that plays guitar must do it without his shirt on! There was this horrible man shouting out rude things. He was so ugly and evil, he should just go to Iraq. He had the haircut. All I do is babysit. And every time I babysit, it is always bad and weird, why is that? Yesterday I babysat, well first I went to let out the pets I'm watching at like 8 AM, then babysat from 8:30-12. Then I went back to let the pets out and stayed with them. Then I babysat from 2:30-9:30. Then I went back and let the pets out again. But let's just talk about that second babysitting gig. It was for Sophia, but her mom's friend was in town with her two kids. Anyways, they have no sidewalk at the moment, so I had to cross the flower bed. I see one of the new kids, but I went inside. They tell me that the one inside is named Emma. I was about to ask about the one outside, ""What is his name?"" But they told me the other one's name is Sarah. Okay- first problem, I thought that kid was a boy. When they were eating dinner: Sarah: ""Do you think I'm a boy or a girl?"" Me  nervously : ""A girl."" Emma: ""Well, people at school thinks she's a boy!"" Sarah: ""Emma, everybody here knows I'm a girl, but it's complicated..."" COmplicated.. I do NOT have the emotional capacity to help you figure out your gender issues kid. Seriously, don't mess with me. Then we walked to Dairy Queen, yeah the one at Indianola and Arcadia, the one where if you walk two feet you are in the road. I thought I was going to have a heart attack with these three kids running around. This really dirty man riding a bike kept laughing at how I was freaking out and muttering under my breath. Actually, he was kind of hot, in that dirty, you ride-around-town-all-day-long-where-are-you-really-going kind of way. Sophia's cone was dripping EVERYWHERE, and I had to hold it, of course. I kept wrapping napkins around it, but they were all dirty. I was like, ""God damn this turnicate!"" I thought it was funny. YOu had to be there. Anyways, Sarah got like five different ice creams cause she didn't like anything- fucker. She asked me about the sports I play, when I promptly told her that I'm more of an ""activist than an athlete"" but I told her I used to play field hockey, which she scowled at. She went on about cricket (or something), and lacrosse, and rugby- WHO THE HELL PLAYS RUGBY IN THE U.S., LET ALONE AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL?! When we were watching TV, and by ""we"" I mean ""them"" because I am Anti-Hillary Duff, so I DO NOT watch her show. Sarah seemed to like her. I said that she was rumored to be dating a 25-year-old and she was like, ""NO, YOU'RE WRONG!"" Okay, sorry to burst someone's bubble. Actually, you know, that kid seemed to be going through a lot, and that's rough at 8 years old, poor thing. Nobody went to bed, I told Sarah and Emma to NOT go into Sophia's room, but they did. I hate them, go back to Connecticut, the land of evil. BYE. BUT THEN: dog sitting, that can't be bad, can it? YES IT CAN!I get there and notice that the basement lights are on. I let the dog out then go inside to feed them. I grab her bowl, but it's full of dog food. It was empty when I was there in the afternoon. I look over and the front door is open. I hear this man talking. I'm thinking, okay maybe it's Jenny's boyfriend. So I called out but nobody answered. It seemed like it was coming from a bedroom, but everything was so dark, I was too scared to turn on a light and find a man, possibly dead, lying there. So, I freaked out and left. Why can't anything be normal for me?  FUnny story: We've been taking stuff to this resale store. I was carrying this heavy lamp and here's how it goes down: Lady 1: ""You may want to take that to the furniture store. It'll sell faster there."" Lady 2: ""Oh no, it's so cluttered, nobody would ever see it!"" Lady 1: ""Well Sarah said that it was really nice."" Lady 2: ""Are you sure?"" My mom: ""So should we take it there? Or do you think we should try and sell it here."" Lady 1: ""I don't know."" ME: ""Well, can you make up your mind, cause this thing is HEAVY!"" AHH I'M SUCH A BITCH!  I feel like going on a walk. I think I'll walk up to the Library with a canvas bag to fill with books. Can I be any more pathetic?"
DCTFFOV,female,17,"Hello world! How's it going? I have been busy as a beaver lately. Who out there remembers Megan Mann (Keeny) and all her many stuffed beavers? Her favorite was that old one, Edgar. I liked Candlesticks. Bus 25 home from school=the best time of my life. Anywho... I went to the dentist the other day, it was FANTASTIC. Dr. Christ and I go wayyyy back. His hygienist, Phyllis, was a total beeyatch. He asked me what I was going to study in college, and I said business, and he said ""Ohhh you could be on ""The Apprentice"" ahahhaha!"" Then he was talking about my orthodontic treatment and he said, ""Well it looks great. I mean could her teeth be any whiter Phyllis?"" Phyllis was... absolutely silent. THANKS PHIL.  I took the ACT on Saturday, it was very hard. I took it at UA and I got really scared, cause they're attractive there. I walked in and saw Ann, we weren't in the same room but I told her I'd take her home. My room was boring. Kids were funny and it was crazy. Afterwards, Ann told me we had to find her friend Carrie. Turns out she was going to lunch with Carrie.. .and I don't know what my purpose was. But Ann said I could go with them. But then they ran into a third friend, and they kind of fought, and I wasn't sure if I should have left or stayed. But we ended up going to Panera, and we ran into EVERYBODY. It was exciting, as I've said, Unies can sniff each other out. So we ate lunch, and then we went back to Carrie's and she made me and Ann listen to this blue grass music. And she forced us to say we liked it. IT WAS REALLY FUNNY. Then I took Ann home and we were listening to this screaming song, and it was so different from the blue grass.  I babysat that night. I was a really good babysitter. But towards midnight, I could not stay awake, it was bad. I would nod off and then my head would fall. I came home and watched some Donald Trump on SNL. It wasn't that funny, so I went to bed. And then babysat again in the morning. Then I cleaned my room all day, and now I am not doing homework. Some other funny stuff has happened, but I don't want to write it, so you will all have to personally question me and my strange life. bye."
DCTFFOV,female,17,"Am I typing in color? Blogger has got some new shit.         Lots to share, let's begin.         Thursday I babysat in the morning, and then I drove to Anna's, where I could not park my car properly, and had to have her do it for me. We stopped at Wal-Mart, like we always do before a trip, and when we were leaving she goes, ""I think I'll take out the Starting Line CD"" and then what do we hear? ""THE REASON"" DAMNIT I'M SO SICK OF THAT SONG. We drove up to Cleveland to see Never Heard Of It. I named all the counties along the way. We headed towards The Phantasy Nite Club, which was crappy and old. We walked around, cause nobody was there. Well, we did see this kid walking with his parents wearing pants that said ""Fuck"" all over them. We went into the drug store to go pee. We had to go to the courtesy counter and ask through the bullet-proof glass for the key. Anna saw a bunch of Hostess products, Ohio never fails us! We went back to wait in line/by the door. The band still hadn't arrived. But then, I saw the RV. They drove by and DJ was looking out the window and we waved. So attractive. Their RV is PIMPING! It has their name all over it and they have a trailer with good stickers. DJ walked around and gave us hugs and we talked about Anna's upcoming interview. We had to talk to their tour manager or something, Nosh (don't know how to spell, sounds like ""No-shhhh""). Rick walked around, but he ignored us and looked really bad. I hate to say it, but bring back the California surfer-dude hair, and lose the nose ring. It looked like he always had a booger, but it was the ball on his nose ring. We sat with Jeff for literally two hours. He kept having Anna massage his back. She tried standing up, but he thought that was weird, so he asked to sit between her legs- WHOA! He was so needy. Every five minutes he'd be like ""Higher... no lower. Now scratch it."" EWW I glared at him and he goes, ""You must think I'm a dick."" He was really nice the first night, but more on that later. We learned that since Greg's departure, they brought on this 17-year-old named Dan. I was quite excited to see this kid. They weren't playing until 10:45, so we didn't go inside until about 9. We were actually on the list, SURPRISE! The first two bands we saw were okay. The club had all these black lights, which revealed several embarrassing stains on my jeans. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT THERE! We met NHOI's new merch guy, but I can't remember his name. I want to say Kevin, maybe that's right. He shook our hands and winked, it was quite cute. Anna bought the tequila shirt of theirs, and I read the Spanish part. Finally, they went on. Dan was really cute! He had a semi-mullet, but he had a lip ring- ON THE GOOD SIDE! Anna told me that when DJ sings he gets right in your face. I told her he better not, cause that will scare me. And scare me it did, cause he gets right up in your grill. Then he'd shake his head and his sweat would go everywhere! They were very good live. Lots of energy. But they didn't play ""Veronica"" like Jeff said they would. After, we went back to the merch table. DJ apologized that they didn't play ""Veronica"" but said that they would the next night. We met Dan, who was just as cute in person. On their message boards, people say he can guess your birthday. We tried to play the game, but he didn't do so well. The guys seemed to like my ""Real Men Love Unicorns"" t-shirt. Dan said he loves unicorns, the beach, marshmallows, and the color pink. Good boy. There was this girl there with these tattoos. One on her arm was of a naked woman. Dan kept going over and pinching the boobs, and Anna goes, ""Look! You got some action!"". Then the girl pulls down her pants and shows this weird tattoo on her thigh. I saw some stuff of hers, I don't think she wanted to share. She should probably keep her pants buckled, I mean, just a thought. When we were driving home, Anna called her friend, Karly, and told her about the massage thing and him being between her legs. Karly was on spearkerphone, and I heard her ask, ""Did you get wet?"" I STARTED LAUGHING SO HARD- WHO IS THIS KID?!    We went to my aunt's house, where she had labeled everything we would use, and then watched some Blind Date and went to bed. The next morning we went to my aunt Sue's to burn a copy of the Lola Ray CD for Jeff, he had asked for it. Then we got ready and drove to Toledo for the show. Anna saw a sign for ""Fangboner Road"". It made us remember Texas and how we giggled at ""Harry Hines Boulevard"" or as I called it, ""Harry Hinds Boulevard!"" The place was called ""Missi's Blues"" or something like that.  But it was spelled M-I-S-S-I... that's HORRIBLE! They didn't show up for a while. Finally, the huge NHOI RV pulled up. We gave Jeff his CD and Dan some beads to put on his shoelaces, Anna's newest creation. The guys were pretty nice and everything. Nosh said we'd do the interview around 5:30. Jeff took these two girls into the RV. Finally NOSH was like, ""Yeah, Jeff will come get you when he's finished getting his 'massage'!"" WHAT?! Anna gives him massages, not those two ho's. What was THAT about? That began the dislike for Jeff. Around 6 or so, once it started to pour rain (of course), Nosh calls out from the RV ""Allie, come on in!"" Who's Allie? Well, he meant us. He got confused. Anna was like, ""Her name is Allison..."" and he's like ""Yeah yeah."" Okay, whatever. We walk in the RV and those skanks with Jeff were there. One was adjusting her boobs. Right.... a back massage? Try lower. Nosh kicked them out, thankfully. Jeff and DJ were doing the interview. I turned my head and saw Rick without his shirt on. I was very embarrassed. The interview went pretty well. Then we left and talked to Dan outside a little. He's from Mexico and speaks Spanish, very nice. We went inside and talked to him a lot more there.  He is a funny kid. Let me remember some good stuff: at one point he was talking about something (I can't remember what) and then he goes, ""That'll be my thing."" And Anna goes ""And putting beads on your shoelaces can be my thing."" And I asked, ""Well what can be my thing?"" And Dan goes, ""We can put our things together."" MY EYES GOT SO BIG AND I JUST STARTED LAUGHING. He forgot our birthdays, but kept trying to guess. He was staring at me trying to remember, and I got nervous and was biting my lip and scrunching my face, and he goes, ""I love that face!"" I'm so scared of eye contact! Then we were talking and he's like, ""You wanna go on a date?"" HELL YEAH. He says ""Fuck yeah, dude"" all the time. He wants to tattoo it across his stomach. That's hot. He gave us guitar picks, but then borrowed mine for the show. He promised to give it back, and after the show he he did as he said ""Sorry it's so gross and wet"". No problem, I don't mind. We talked a little more to some of the guys and these kids from Michigan. We were saying bye to Nosh, and DJ walked over and just put his arm around me. My god, that man smells like angels, it's amazing. And his back, talk about definition. SO hot. Rick was a lot nicer the second night, but Jeff became a dick. Overall, it was a pretty good time! We drove home and then I went back to mi casa to go to sleep and prepare for Saturday.       So let's begin with Saturday. It was a good day. I was going to volunteer for the Young Voters Project. I went there at 11 to have a training session with Stephen. This annoying 20-something-year-old guy, Jeremy, joined us and kept trying to be better than me. After our session, some of the workers started to come in for the day. This kid, Luke, was leaning against the wall reading the newspaper. He had a hat on and his headphones around his neck, he was kind of cute. RJ drove myself, Luke, Becca, and the funniest kid I've ever met, James, down to the Jazz and Rib Festival where we'd be trying to get people to sign our petition to vote this November. James was like ""Are you excited?"" and I said yes, and he goes, ""You sure don't look it!"" And I was like ""NOO... I am just really tired, I was out of town yesterday."" They were talking about going out that night and James asked me what I was doing and he goes, ""You're 18 right?"" And I said no, and nobody believed me that I was 17. RJ dropped us off and then we set off for the festival. James kept freaking out about jay walking (is it like that or is it just ""j walking"", I don't really know) and he goes, ""When I was a kid, I thought it was just walking in a 'J'"". Then he started doing it in the middle of the road. We got up to the festival and James was going on about how he had to pee. We stopped at a Port-a-Potty, but he goes, ""I won't go in those, just find me a tree!"" Then Luke goes, ""Okay James and Becca you stay at this entrance. Allison and I will go down to the other."" Great, I have to spend 4 hours with some relatively cute guy, I wonder how I will embarrass myself today. So we walk down and he was telling me that he's from NYC and is just here for 6 weeks to work on this project. He was like, ""Yeah, I'm going to do my part to take Bush down!"" So now you're 10 times cuter. Actually, he really wasn't that cute, but he does oddly resemble Jason Mraz.  Something in the eyes. So I watched him talk to people in the beginning. A bunch of people were jerks and wouldn't listen, then we get one. The first guy is some hick, but he was a good guy.  He was like ""At first, I thought Bush was a good idea. But now, this is horrible..."" and he went on and on and he was swearing like none other! Luke was like, ""Yeah man, that anger is understandable."" I was biting my lip trying to not laugh. This kid is from NYC and here he is talking to this hick guy with no teeth. Welcome to Ohio. Then I went off to talk to this couple. This guy comes over and starts talking to me when they are finished:     Guy: ""What are you doing?""       I explain the petition and ask if he wants to sign    Guy: ""No, I don't want to sign that, I want to know what you are doing. I think you are really cute. Maybe we could hang out some time.""    Me:  completely perplexed  ""Uhhh... I don't think that's such a good idea.""    Guy: ""Why?""    Me:  so nervous I lie : ""Well, I just got out of something, and I think I need some time to work on myself.""    Guy: ""What did this guy do to you? I mean we can be friends, you know. You can have friends. I don't even live here, but I'll drive here for you.""    Me: ""Yeah I just don't think it's a good idea.""    Guy: ""Can't I just call you?""    It kept going on and I didn't know what to do! My head was in my hands and I was like ""Fine take my fucking number"" and gave it to him. I was going to make one up, but I felt so bad. Then he was like ""I can feed you and that dude."" NO, live me alone! So I walked back over to Luke looking down, cause that guy kept staring and motioning for him to get us food or something, and Luke asked what was wrong, but I said nothing. So then we started to get people to sign the petition. Four hours later... it was so god damn hot. We started to head back to get picked up and James joined us. That kid is so funny. Luke was pissed cause he was 3 signatures less than 50. James asked me how many I got and I told him 40. He was really impressed and Luke asked how many I got and when I told him his eyes got so big. They were like, ""That's really good for your first day!"" I was pretty proud of myself. So as we were walking back, James kept going on about how he hates Ohio and how black people don't take care of each other here the way they do in Georgia. Then he was saying he's never lived in a more racist place, and I was like, ""You're from the South!"" I told him I went to CSG and he goes, ""My mom tried to sign me up there. No, I'm not kidding. I don't do well around guys."" Then he started freaking out about jay walking again and started to walk in the crosswalk when it said ""Don't Walk"". I told him, ""I really don't think it's jay walking if you are in the crosswalk."" Then we started talking about girls in NYC. James was like, ""They have the finest lookin Dominican women there. Every girl's got a J. Lo booty!"" Luke asked me if I was Dominican, no no I'm not anything but English, Czech, and Indian DAMNIT! James goes, ""My baby's mama is a beautiful Dominican girl."" Then he talked about how his father and brother were in the Crips and how he NEVER wears red and all that. James is a funny, funny guy. There were all these Pro-Life people, so in the car Luke goes, ""There's pro-choice and pro-life, why don't they make a category where they kill all the babies?!"" I thought that was funny, actually. Then we went back to the headquarters and did these time sheets thing. They were long and hard. Stephen gave me a huge hug when I got back. As I've told Anna, my three rules are: 1. Don't touch me. 2. Don't talk to me. and 3. Get the FUCK away from me. But all of these people were nice, so it was okay. Everyone was impressed with my 40 people. Stephen has the worst laugh I've ever heard, it's 350 times worse than mine. Yep, that bad. I signed up to work during the Working Title concert, since I'm going anyways, and I get in for FREE! Since Luke was my coach guy, he kept trying to give me advise: ""You just gotta keep your head held high. I mean, people are jerks, but don't worry, okay?"" I was like, ""I'm really okay."" So I finally left and I was like, ""Thanks for all the help, Luke."" And he starts waving and is like, ""No problem, bye! Have a good day!"" Dude, it's 5:30, the day is over.     I babysat this morning. I don't know if anything else is going on. Oh, Anna got an interview with Patrick from Limbeck when we go to see Maxeen in Cleveland. That's super exciting- she loves that kid. I just really love Tom Bailey- he's beautiful. That's about it. BYE!"

Anyways, I went to work at the homeless shelter to help serve food tonight. We met at the Spaghetti Warehouse. Then Dr. Leahy is like ""Get in my car, I'll drive you over there"". There were 6 of us. Olivia and Rebey (Rebecca) get in and Libby and I were going to, and Leahy starts to drive away! AHH STOP COME BACK! So Lib sits in my lap (LIBBY I AM MENTIONING YOU, THEREFORE,  YOU READ MY BLOG !) and we start driving to the shelter. Leahy wants to turn around, and literally starts to make a U-y (u-turn) in the middle of the road WITH A CAR COMING! She sees it and yells, ""CHRIST!"" ooh it was so funny! Did you know Naus has a son who looks just like Harry Potter, well she does! And he came and they were both wearing khakis and a white polo. It was adorable! I love that woman! So then we served up some grub and it was a good time. Libs, Rebey, and I worked the milk table. But then this guy came over and was like, ""What's the milk"" I was really confused, he kept yelling it, and so I grabbed the milk and showed him. He didn't like it, cause it was Giant Eagle brand. Then we started talking about Big Bear and their good milk, I miss the bear. Anyways, I'm LITERALLY not studying. I just can't. I am emotionally DRAAAAAAAAAINED. I'll probably go read random people's blogs, cause I just don't care anymore. BYE!"

NW1YTWH,female,17,"So, uh, basically, my life is really boring and so I don't have all that much to blog about anymore.  So, I will try right now...hmm...  All I did this week was study...and climb a tree...oh! and on Tuesday me and Naomi made some snowflakes to add to our festive doorway.  Rebecca taped a Christmas tree on her door.  It was pretty hardcore, let me tell you.  But, we had to remove all of our personal items from our door because it is December break.  One whole month.  Woo!  I can't wait.  For Naomi's mom to pick us up, that is.  I think she just left like ten minutes ago.  *Sigh* oh well.  So, I took my last two finals today.  Bio and chem.  There were two for biology, the cumulative was optional, for if you wanted to replace your lowest exam grade with it..the first one was a little bit hard, pretty sure I got an A though, and the cumulative was simple.  So, that went well.  Chemistry is what killed me.  Our professor is a psycho and so much of what was on the exam we never learned or went over.  It was freeking craazy.  Half of our exam was multiple choice, 50 of them, and I made an ""educated guess"" on ohhh about 20 or so.  The other section was a little easier but I am still not sure AT ALL that I did all of them right.  I had to make a 77 to keep an A in there...not sure I did it...aw shucks.  Oh well!    Dr. Allen emailed me and told me I got an A in Pre Cal with a 95 on my final.  Yay! :) I studied hard for that.  I made a 90 flat in the class.  Next semester I will definitely pick it up in Cal.  Oh and I turned in my book for that class.  Ha Ha.  I don't think the old lady noticed that chapter 7 was all loose-leaf paper stuck in there.  Tee hee.  You make me dizzy runnin circles in my head.  One of these days I'll chase you down....  YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME BREAK OUT...MAKE ME BREAK OUT....  I've always wondered what they meant by that.  Does the person that is running circles in their mind made them get acne?  Break out of what?  Maybe I should read the lyrics...hmm  So, it is my first Christmas break from TAMS.  I only get two of these.  It is weird thinking how I won't see any of these people for a month.  Kind of how it was weird thinking I was moving away at the end of the summer.  Everyone was going crazy moving all their stuff today.  I have a lot of stuff to move too.  Well, I suppose that is it.  Hopefully, I will have a 4.0.  That would rule like...something unbelievably cool.  BYEEEEeee Lisa"
NW1YTWH,female,17,"Gah controlling Asian parents make me so upset.  Our Senior Mentor, Bestsy Liu, is the most awesome person you will ever meet.  She is outgoing, friendly, nice, nonjudgemental, scarily smart, and she's just...awesome...I don't even know how to describe how awesome of a person she is.  So, her dream school is Stanford, right?  So she spent hours upon hours, days upon days, and weeks upon weeks preparing her application.  I mean, she has prepared for longer than that, obviously, because she has been working her ass of her entire high school career so that she could go there.  And she can.  She has a 1530 on the SAT, her SAT IIs were amazingly high.  Her GPA (at TAMS) is like a 3.98, at high school, she was number one in her class, she is president of the astronomy club, the head editor person of yearbook, she did cancer research this summer at a hospital in Dallas, she was National Merit commended, on the Dean's list, on the President's list...everything you can think of, she's it.  The perfect applicant.  And she doesn't just half-ass it and do things just so she can have it on her application, she goes all out and gets involved because she wants to and she enjoys being around and helping other people.    However, one thing about Betsy is she is always comparing herself to her older brother, who she sees as the perfect kid.  He had a 4.0 and is going to Johns Hopkins and was president of a lot of stuff too, but to their parents, he is the better kid or something, probably just because Betsy is more free-spirited than he is.  She has this thing where she thinks that she will never live up to him, that she can never be as good as him.  She thinks she will always be just second best, never the top pick.  Her parents don't see how amazing she is.  So, she works so hard on this application to Stanford, and the day she has it ready to send off, her dad comes to the school because he says it is not good enough and he has to make some changes.  Ok, well, not so bad, right?  Today her parents told her to forget about going to Stanford, or Cal Tech, or any of the other amazingly good schools that she could get into, because she is just not good enough, she is going to go to UT and that is it and she is going to become a doctor and everything is going to go their way.  Except Betsy doesn't deserve that.  She came in and told us and you could see in her eyes that she didn't want to accept what they had told her, but she has to, because it is apparently the way that Asian families work.  I told her to screw that, she was going to apply to wherever she wanted to and go to college some place excellent and good.  But...she is just like, ""No, they know what is best for me.""    What is best for her is not to be in some public school, studying something she doesn't even want to be studying.  UT is fine for my brothers, heck it's fine for me, but it is NOT fine for Betsy.  She deserves to go to Stanford and pursue her own dreams of majoring in mathematics, working for Pixar, and opening her own restaurant.  But, because of the way that Asian families work, she may never get to do any of the things she really wants to.  Sorry, but this really makes me sad.  It makes me sad and it pisses me off.  I just..can't explain my frustration right now.  I am so frustrated.  I want Betsy to go to Stanford and have the best possible life.  I don't want her parents dictating what she can do with her life.  It is NOT RIGHT.  Life isn't fair.  She can't do much, because her parents were supplying the money for her to buy her applications, but we want to help.  Naomi, Rebecca, and I want to buy applications for her, and encourage her to just fill them out.  I don't know how this will end up, but I know that I want Betsy to be happy, and going to UT (which is like every TAMS kid's back up school) is not going to make her happy.  Ahhh  -Lisa"

NW1YTWH,female,17,"So I took this test today on this website designed to find you other people that share the same personality type as you or whatnot.  It was called the aeananasumthingram...i don't even remember what it was called.  Anyway, it told me I was extroverted, decisive, and organized.  So I tried again.  I only changed like three answers but all of a sudden I was not so extroverted and not necessarily organized.  So then I used that information to search for the livejournals and blogs of people like me.  Apparently people like me are depressed and alcoholic.  Interesting I think, since I suffer from neither depression or alcoholism :).  Today all I did was work, help out with tennis camp, and volunteer at the horse place.  It was a very busy and full day, if only routine.  I had fun at the equestrian center.  I was talking to Aimee (girl from Summit that volunteers there) and she was telling me how next week she is gonna go on like a four day long trip with the newspaper staff cuz she will be a staff writer next year and so of course, Ryan is going.  And I was just thinking about how if it weren't for tams, i'd be going to that thing....*sigh* oh well :).  TAMS is like a two-year-long camp, right?  :) :).  Work was soooooo boring.  I just wanted to come home the whole time.  Tomorrow is payday.  Yay.  So today I was thinking about why do I think the things I think?  Like when I eat homemade blue bell vanilla ice cream, why does my brain tell my tongue that it is deliciously creamy and...delicious?  And why does my brain tell my tongue that whipped cream is the devil when in reality it is not that far from vanilla ice cream?  And whoever decided that pain was a bad thing?  Pain is merely what your brain tells your nerves to feel, so why does your brain think it has to be bad?  Why are our perceptions on these matters the way that they are?  Why does it bother me when the two stacks of hand held baskets at work are uneven?  Why does it bother me when one bag is fuller than the other?  Do I think that the emptier bag is more lonely?  In the end, I end up using the same amount of bags anyway, so why does it matter to me so much that the bags have equal amounts of groceries in them???  Or like when you hurt one leg, you feel that the other leg is jealous of the other leg so you have to hurt your other leg too so that they are equal.  And it REALLY bothers me that my eyes have different seeing abilities.  One is at like -5 and one is like at a -4.5 (this is contact prescription talk here if you don't understand it).  WHY ARE MY EYES UNEVEN???  IS MY LEFT EYE JEALOUS OF MY RIGHT EYE?  DOES IT SIT IN THE DARK AT NIGHT PONDERING SUICIDE BECAUSE MY RIGHT EYE WAS BORN WITH BETTER VISION??????  Why the hell should an eye have to live with a burden like that?  Now, I feel sorry for my left eye.  And it sucks for my left eye more than it does the emptier bag of groceries because I can even out the grocery bags but I can't do diddly squat for my left eye.  Except for maybe stab my right eye out with a stick.  But that would make my right eye worse than my left eye so I would feel sorry for it.  AND it would cause pain, which my brain perceives to be bad, much to my dismay and bewilderment.  You know what, I do not understand relationships.  Say in a hypothetical situation you have an awesome relationship with a guy at school, just a friend or whatnot but you can have awesome conversations with him.  Deep, philosophical, but also funny and easygoing.  Then summer comes and you do not talk to this guy for like a month.  Then, when you finally talk to him again it is like the magic is gone.  You just don't get along with him like you used to.  And this saddens you. Why did the relationship go sour?  Can a month really change people that much?  Well, I guess just look at me and how I have changed so much this past six or so months.  A year ago, I was a completely different person.  I rather prefer the person I am now.  Much more open-minded I am.  Change is an interesting thing.  We dread it, and yet, without it, life would be terribly dull.  I mean, I love summer and wish it would last forever, but if summer lasted forever it would lose its appeal, its ability to seem magical and free.  Infinite....  Ever since I brought up that word with Fifer I have been thinking about it a lot, what it means to be infinite.  It is the feeling you get listening to an acoustic guitar while driving into the sunset....it is sitting in a group of your favorite friends talking under the stars...it is laying down in the middle of a field and looking up at the sky for an hour...its hanging out with people and listening to music...its laughing while completely forgetting that a grim reality awaits you when the laughter is over.  It's everything that the good stuff in life is made out of.  That is what feeling infinite really means.  Our childhood is infinite....our teenagerhood is infinite.  While we may grow older and die, it will never fade away.  It will live in our minds as the best years of our lives.  And that is what it truly is.    It is time for bed now.  I downloaded much good music today.  I am only to the fs though.  Tomorrow I will get further.   Goodnight, goodnight.  Sleep well and when you dream, dream of me. (West Side Story)  -Lisa"
NW1YTWH,female,17,"My head is...aching... from laughing for like four hours straight.  Aw man.  Fifer and Abby never fail to make me laugh...and it is like...just amazing, the things we talk about...I think I am going to hell.  tee hee.  oh well.  So yeah, earlier was....ok.  Olivia is a great friend, so it was cool hanging out with her, but I had just imagined more people and stuff, and then we ended up just driving her friends around because they had been drinking and needed a ride so they wouldn't drink and drive and die.  Then we went some places with them, and I saw some pretty crazy stuff...like people on some pretty hardcore stuff...but we didn't stay there for long.  Then she dropped me off and it was like 1 and then I was talking to Fifer and then I went over there to hang with her and Abby in the after hours and wow I had so much fun, it was just unbelievable...I would put some of our jokes, but then people might think that I was like obsessed with sex, or completely stupid or something, and we all know that I am nothing of the sort!  Hahaha...haha...ha... ....  Um, so, this isn't what I imagined my new years eve to be like, but it was a good way to start out the year, with a lot of my closest friends.  Especially since I went over to Amy's earlier in the day and played Risk and this other game with her and all the ppl that hang over there and then me and Jenn went to the mall and did some shopping, and that all was very deck and fun.  So that is like, all of my closest friends.  Except for like Naomi and Rebecca and JoAnn and Ashley...but eh, Jo and Ash had their own thing...and Naomi told me she wasn't having a party anymore (but ohhh she had something of the sort I hear :p I see how it is)...and Rebecca lives in Granbury.  Sooooooooooo as you can see, it was not possible for me to see them today.  Ok, well, I go now.  Rest in peace.  Lisa"
NW1YTWH,female,17,"SLC Punk really is a great, great movie.  I was looking through all my old pictures and scrapbooks and ""common place"" books today.  It was pretty interesting.  Nostalgia is...bittersweet.  Tomorrow I am supposed to work 16 hours.  I think I may die.  I hope I can get out of the last few hours."
NW1YTWH,female,17,"Fishboy is hardcore.  I am amazed at his musical genius.  And his drummer's  Psycho -esque antics for Mother's Day.  The TaDas were really good too.  We were talking to the guy afterwards and he was talking about how one time people were playing scrabble during his show.  It was pretty funny.  The show was at this little bar in Denton Square and there were maybe 20 or 25 people there to see it.  I have decided that small shows are my favorite.  But, anyway, yeterday was so crazy.  I had to write two essays and put together my portfolio before 1:00, which took like three hours, and then Naomi and I had to clean our room spotlessly.  We used so many chemicals and spilled Goop-Off (or turpentine, as David likes to call it) all over our floor to mop with it and people could smell it all the way from the staircase.  We didn't get checked out until around 4:00 and it took an hour and a half to get home.  So we didn't leave to go back to Denton until around 6:40 and we were about thirty minutes late for graduation.  I am sad that I missed Zahir's speech.  But it was cool.  All of the colleges they are going to amaze me.  The Prom King and Queen are going to MIT and Harvard, respectively.  What other high school can say that?  Anyway, after that we went to the place Fishboy was playing, only to find that the first band didn't go on until 10:30 or so, so Vanessa and I went and got food and then came back to see the last two bands.  Great show.  Afterwards, Naomi wanted to go watch a movie with David, Bruce Hall President and her pseduo-""We really like each other and hang out 24/7 but aren't together""-boyfriend.  We were with two other people so it was ok, but then they both left, and so it was really awkward.  Well, I take that back.  It was awkward before they left, because the only person I knew was Naomi and she was laying on David's top bunk with him the whole time.  But I did get to see When Harry Met Sally, which I had been wanting to see for a long time.  Very interesting...really does get me thinking...  Anyway, Naomi and I drove back around 3:00, and I had to keep her from falling asleep at the wheel, but there was no way I was going to stay the night in David's room.    Ok, now it is off to my grandmother's house for the weekend.  Have fun at Summit's Prom!!  Lisa"
NW1YTWH,female,17,"Today I woke up to the sound of Naomi screaming, ""OH MY GOSH IT'S 8:15!!!""    We both jump out of bed, break some kind of record for getting ready in the shortest amount of time, and run to biology, but it was too late, they had already taken attendance.  So, we will be docked for missing class, but only like 5 points, so it is really not that big of a deal...but still....it ruins my clean slate since they never docked me for my first bio lab.  Oh well.  I guess now is the time I back up and explain why we woke up so late.  Around 10:00 Thursday night, Rebecca, Naomi, Sarah, Jennifer, and I all went to the rec center to play indoor soccer, but the court was already being used by a lot of people so Rebecca was like, ""Well.....we could always play outside.""  Mua hahahaha.  So we all went outside, took off our shoes, and played soccer...excuse me...TACKLE soccer...in the mud.  How many times can a person say the word fun in a sentence?  I could answer that question if I felt like describing that experience.  Eventually, we ended up just chasing and tackling each other in the mud...forget the soccer lol.  We left at like 10:45 COVERED in mud, from head to toe.  It was kinda embarrassing, so we all ran as fast as we could up the stairs and jumped into the shower....er...separate showers, mind you.  So, ANYWAY, due to the irresponsibility on my (and Naomi's) part of ditching homework for funness, I did not start my Pre Cal homework until around midnight...and I had sooo much.  I didn't finish until around 2:00, and then I couldn't get to sleep until around 3:00.  I promised myself that I would fight the insomnia and go to sleep earlier but ahh!  It is so impossible.  *Sigh* is this a mental thing or what?  Yeah, so, missing biology put me in a kind of bad mood, even though I did laugh at myself to keep from being annoyed with myself.  And then I got a crappy homework grade in Pre Cal, so that kinda made me feel more crappy.  AND then I had a test in Chemistry that I had not adequately prepared for.  But in the end, that turned out alright, since I have taken it before.  I remembered more than I thought I remembered.  I'm pretty sure I got an A on that one, so that is good.  After my last class, Writing about Lit, Naomi and I went to Maple to eat and ran into Jaison (yeah, there is an i in his name, isn't that weird?).  We hung out with him for a while, saw his dorm room and such, and then we went to these little soundproof piano booths, and listened to Jaison play the piano/sing in really ridiculous keys lol.  He was really good.  When he did play and sing seriously (instead of singing Enrique's Hero in a really high voice), it was so beautiful.  I could sit here and try to explain how much I am in love with music, but I don't think I could adequately describe it.  Piano, guitar....it all conveys messages that words or thoughts never can.  Naomi thinks Jaison has a thing for me, and then the Jennifers said that they thought so too, but I don't think so.  I think he is just a friendly guy and he is like that with a lot of girls, but whatever... :)  Jennifer picked us up around 5:45 to go to the concert.  I showed her and Fifer my room, and introduced them to some of my friends, including the girl that has my name, and then we all left.  My friend and chem lab partner, Laura, went with us too.  She is really cool.  The concert was AmAzInG.  I think that is some of the best moshing I have ever been in.  It was fun, crazy, awesome, crazy, loud, rough, crazy, fun, and a little crazy, too.  I was feeling particularly crazy today, and so I acted particularly crazy.  And it wasn't just one band, it was all of them.  They were all so extremely awesome...mm....so awesome...This concert vies with Warped Tour for being the best concert experience of my life.  The only thing that may have ruined the perfect concert experience was when a guy passed out at the end of the starting line's set.  He literally fell on Naomi and I, as we were jumping up and down.  We thought he had just fallen down, so we grabbed his arms to help him up, and then I realized that he wasn't conscious.  So, a bunch of us made a big circle around him and waited for the management people to come and get him.  It made me really sad.  After that, I wasn't into it as much, even when tsl did their encore.  I just watched.  It seemed....wrong...somehow to watch someone look like they are dead on the ground (he wasn't dead though) and then go back and act like nothing happened.  So I sat the last couple of songs out.  They were the only ones I sat out on though :).  The Starting Line did this thing with confetti that was Soooooooooo cool (hardcore).  During their last song, at the climax I guess of the song, when the entire audience was singing along, and it was an emotional moment, confetti went everywhere.  It was so awesome.  Unfortunately, that was during when I was protecting the guy on the floor, so I didn't get to enjoy it that much :( oh well.  So, anyway, I got another free cd, and then we went back to Arlington, and my mother gave Laura, Naomi, and I a ride back to UNT.  She was less than thrilled, that is how I will put it.  We made it back with ten minutes to spare until curfew.  But it was so worth it, because it was so extremely fun.  I think that Naomi now understands why I have concert withdrawal sometimes.  Haha.  I also think that Laura thinks I am some crazy, hardcore moshpitter.  Oh wait, I am!  LoL.  No, I am not completely hardcore.  I mean, I haven't even crowd-surfed yet!!!  (Note to self:  Update List of Things to do Before I DIE).  Sooooo, that is that.  I was drenched in sweat.  Literally.  My hair, my clothes...and I smelled so bad, but it's all for the cause.  That's what I told Naomi and Laura when they had to take off their shoes and go barefoot in the moshpit (ouch) because they kept falling off.  It's all for the cause.  Which cause, I don't know, but that is what it is all for.  Ate some food, and am about to go take a shower.  I am so detailed in these things, it is amazing.  -Lisa  (I am waiting for an explanation from a certain someone on why my name is so cool. :) )"
NW1YTWH,female,17,"I just got back from hanging out with Ashley and JoAnn (my drill team buddies).  I went to Six Flags with Ashley around 4:30 or so and then went back to hang out with JoAnn but then JoAnn had gone to some guy's house so we went to Ashley's house and then JoAnn gets home so we go back over there but then my mom calls and says that I have to pick my brother and his friend up from Hurricane Harbor now and so I go and do that and they want to go to some place to get applications and all they know about how to get there is ""it's off I-30"" so I try to go down that for a while and we don't spot anything so we go down the other way for a while and still don't spot anything so we ask for firections and the freakin thing is at Hurricane Harbor but THEN HH is closed for the day.  So I spent two hours on the road.  Accompanied with good music, of course, thanks to my adapter :) :).    Spending the day with Ashley was fun, but kinda weird.  We've been friends since the 3rd grade and were best friends in 5th/6th grade, but then started not talking to each other so much.  The only reason we started talking this year was because we had history class together.  So at first, it was awkward trying to make conversation with her but after a while, it was cool.  We talked about many things...and brought up our...interesting...past a couple of times.  I was like, ""Ok, remember that time that I spent the night at your house the day I started going out with AJ?"" and then she'd think for a couple of seconds and come to a realization of what I was talking about and go ""Ohhh yeah....heh.  We were pretty stupid.  Can't believe we did that.""  It is nice to have someone that you have history with.  It gives you a sense of your past and where you came from.  Hmm...  Well, that is all I really have to type about.  Maybe I would have more, but I am just soo extremely tired and I have a lot to do this week.  I work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  I am helping out with tennis camp those days also and Friday I have another tennis tournament.  And then Saturday is....WARPED TOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am just a bit excited.  I wish I could get online at earlier hours though.  I miss talking to certain people whose parents make him....i mean, him or her...get off at like 10:30.  I didn't get home tonight until like 12:30 cuz we were talking and laughing and whatnot at JoAnn's house.  She is so crazy.  I read Fifer's blog and then she said something about me missing my precious ryan-san....and it is true, I rarely get to talk to him on the internet because I wait so freakin late to get on. :(.  Oh well.  Well, I guess I should email her now...Fifer I mean, because apparently, she has been trying to get ahold of me all day.  heh.    -Lisa"

BOUNE7G,male,25,"I think we should introduce another character: The Untreatable.  He's some sort of celebrity who has become known for the show's inability to treat him.  Every time anyone has tried, he has foiled them.  Until... the villain uses the ""ultimate treat"" (which he stole from our characters) to treat the Untreatable.  Eventually, when our characters are trying to get back on their feet, they receive a phone call from the Untreatable, who wants to meet them in secret.  The Untreatable suggests a way to get back at the villain.  When asked how he became such an expert on treats, the Untreatable offers up a story (perfect for a montage) of how, when he was young, he was a master of treats.  The movie could then show clips of him treating his classmates/teachers/neighbors/friends as a kid throughout the 60s and 70s.  Until... the treat that went to far.  A treat of his went awry (we could think of something funny), and now he has sworn off treats.  He will not participate in this revenge treat to get back at the villain, but he will suggest a means to do it."

BOUNE7G,male,25,"I’ve decided to forego sleep for but a few more moments this evening to jot a few notes on things I’ve been thinking about recently with regard to this screenwriting project of ours.  Justin, I like your ideas so far.  Too build on a couple of them…   I would like to have characters that say “dude” a lot, but I think that might be a bit too much dude, where’s my car-ish… I do however think there's something in characters who say something annoying all the time that think it's cool.  I think thats the way the MTV type of person strikes the average person, and it'd be fun to exaggerate that for our purposes.    I think there’s an idea with the “can you watch this for me”… in fact, it could provide a good start for our movie.  How about an idea where there are 4 or 5 dudes are doing this show like Jackass or whatever, and then they choose this stunt you’re talking about to do… the only thing is, the guy who is doing the initial “will you watch this for me” knows that their show is going to be cancelled, and is setting up all the other guys to go to jail so he can have his own show… The other guys go and steal whatever the 3rd party is “watching” and then some overzealous cops bust in.  Meanwhile, the 3 or 4 who are really getting arrested think they’re on punk’d (or shall we call it “treated”?) and they keep yelling, “aww hell yeah, where’s ashton?  We got treat’d!”)  But then they go to jail, xtv won’t bail them out and tell the cops it was just a show, and they have to call their girlfriends, who dump them on the way home because their show got dropped, they’re out of the limelight, and their ex-friend gets the spotlight, all their girlfriends, and a bunch of cash.  They get off but have to spend lots of cash on lawyers maybe?  Then we could have a revenge plot, get back to being famous plot, and fuck these corporate dudes who only care about money plot.  We could also work the punk band aspect as well… It’d also be fun, because as an intro we could definitely write some good shit making fun of those jackass shows, but enough so that it was original and not just satire.    Justin, I don’t know if you saw, but I left a comment on your thing about the dude with the watch dressed up as a Monopoly guy playing board games at the bar.  That really reminded me of that show on Comedy Central, trigger Happy TV, where the people dressed up in dog suits get in fights in the bar… I love that shit, and I think it goes far.  We should definitely include a few things in that vein.  In fact, I think it would be funny if these guys were such extreme stunt dudes that they found that they became unable to relate to people in their everyday lives.  Like they had to do variations on stunts just in going to the grocery store… and they realize that they are probably making asses out of themselves, but they just laugh at each other and know there’s nothing they can do about it… or they’re oblivious to their annoying nature.    I also think it would be cool if one of their side-friends (not a main character) was this totally rational, level-headed guy (different from a straight-man character, who could be a main char.) who was always saying things like, “Oh my God, are you serious?  You could seriously injure your knee doing that and there would be no way to repair it, I’ve seen it 100 times in physical therapy.”    Random idea I don’t want to forget (Characters represented as A, B, C, etc…): “A” climbs out of ridiculously tall SUV with the license plate “xtreme” and the letters “UHEV” visible next to his beer belly. A: It’s a new Ultra High Emissions Vehicle.  I also think we should write character bio’s per that book… I might try my hand at one over the next few days… make sure to buy it.    Jack, where are you!?  Get the fuck on here!"

Honey, that’s like seconds in Michael Time! I’ve been getting on people’s nerves for years! It’s part of my incendiary charm. –Michael] I don't want to be negative, [Little Late for that, don’t you think? –Michael] but I hope you realize he is taking over your blog and I would like to know just who the hell he thinks he is. [Sultan of Neptune! –Michael]  Well, I'm not sure if I was the only one who actually wrote angry letters or not. [Yeah, You really were –Michael] I don't think you would rat me out, [Rat me out? Are we in Sixth Grade? –Michael]  but if you want to, let me do it. Let me turn myself in. [Guilty concience, huh? –Michael] In a public exhibition [I believe you mean ‘forum’, the phrase is ‘in a public forum’ –Michael] where I can at least tell him where he is welcome to go. [Chicago? The Ivory Coast?–Michael] He might enjoy his arrogance [Yeah…I really do –Michael], but others don't. [Actually, they kind of do too…Once again part of my incendiary charm. --Michael] Maybe it would help if I knew him in person, but I don't and he doesn't know me. [See below… -Michael] No matter how much he thinks he does and assumes he is welcome to be an ass to me. [I’m an ass to everybody. –Michael] I've had about enough of that for today. [Aww…Sad… --Michael] And he knows it was me anyhow. I know he knows. [Yep, absolutely correct –Michael] Perhaps it was the Huttese that gave me away. [Nope you were the only one who doesn’t know me and it’s common knowledge that to know me is to love me. Just ask Sophia. –Michael] It might as well be out in the open if he's going to ask you to reveal that information—not something a nice person would ask you to do, if you ask me— and if he's going to stay and wants to be hostile to somebody. [ 	 Erin if you were truly offended by my conversations, then well, I think you are as dumb as most of the kids in my Biology class. Convorsations are meant to be taken lightly, and are not a real indication of a persons true being. My convorsations implied that you were bitchy and had a secret thing for Rob Lowe. I don’t actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Marten’s message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that I’m obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times I’m as cute as a little bug’s ear. You just need to realize that I have the maturity of a first grader, and that being sarcastic and mean to you, It just means I like you."
GT920CV,male,16,"We have a fansite! That's so cool! In other things, since there are like a dozen new schemes, in the spirit of ""Change is Good"", we should redesign Compendium. It'll be like that episode of The Simpsons with the Flaming Moe, and they change the bar style. We'll have a understated yet elegant monogram at the top of the page! Ha! Yeah, right. If we revamp with this crowd it's going to look like  urlLink Circus Circus . But it might eliminate the Italicization of Mass Destruction. Just an idea...  I'm extending an invitation to anyone at Compendium who is free on the 22nd of May (and who are not Erin or Thomas) and wants to go to a TWoPcon in Lafayette. It'll be fun!  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies."
GT920CV,male,16,"Michael and Erin--I really hope you guys are finished because this fighting is getting very tiresome.    So anyways, HAPPY THANKSGIVING everyone!  OOOH!! AND GUESS WHAT!!!  I have a refrigerator box in my bedroom now!  I'm so excited!!! :D!  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!"

GT920CV,male,16,"I feel sad, and I don't know why... This has been going on for awhile now, and if anyone can inform me why I am sad, it would be greatly appreciated. In other news, section leaders, drum majors, band council members, and the concept/music of next years show were announced tonight. Jack McCarthy is now a drum major, which is a complete shock and joy. The trumpets will now be able to run the band through a puppet regime! The tyrannical reign of John Trippy is now officially over with the crowning of Natalie Perry, Becky Boruff, and Georgia Kuss as our new section leaders. Alice is also now a flute section leader. No one else knows the other section leaders. Our show next year will be completely awesome, but apparently I am not allowed to share with you what its concept is. I shall tell you all at a later time. On further note, school is almost over huzzah!! Congratulations to Marten, Jonah, and Nathan for all making Jeckyll and Hyde! By the time you read this, I will be 16! Finally.... I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it."
GT920CV,male,16,"Math sucks.  I've just figured out that if it weren't for math, my GPa would be a 3.6 something.  I'm getting a D in Allgebra II now.  I've never gotten a D on a report card and all be damned if I'm gonna start now. Well, the play is over.  Sasha and I broke up, and I don't really care.  It's hard to say which one of us ended it.   I don't know what Randall's problem is.  He was cast as Lord Montague and Lord Capulets understudy, but Capulet quit.  We worked with him on his diction, but when he got out there it all disappeared.  Jazz show Friday.  Come see it.  I have a duet with Heather Haywood.  It will be fun.  Hip street's performing too, and so is the Jazz band.  Oh, and there's swing dancing.  And jazz.  Lot's of Jazz.  Have I mentioned Jazz?  Unfortunately, I already used All That Jazz. One of my IYC/Speech friends(Amanda, Soph, if you want to know) saw Levi's duo and asked me about the ""cute guy with the goatee"".  That cracks me up. That last post had a title.  I don't know what happened to it.  Plus my title scheme is way harder than any of yours, so cut me some slack. Michael, as much as I enjoy your posts, you're making way too many.  Try not to post three in a row. Marten, even if we'd had a tech crew, we wouldn't have had backdrops.  Mrs. Means thinks they're tacky. Jonah, I think more profession's should do that.  I'm going to make a movie about Janitors who fight evil blobs of Dirt. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?   No it's not. it's Larry."
GT920CV,male,16,"The new format's cool, but the links and cruft is all down at the bottom.... how'd that happen? oh, and when Im too lazy to find a web comic quote, Im using the random advertising slogan generator to come up with a title  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies."
GT920CV,male,16,"OMG...it's so freaky that you want to see The Producers.  I totally just got that CD from my friend...he burned it for me and told me it was REALLY good.  lol and it is...it's superb.  It's hilarious!!!  SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER!!!  omg, you soooo need to see it.  Anyway...Alice Laramore LOVES Pippin...so that's obviously a pretty good one. Anyway anyway, you thought I was hotter with long hair?  Really?  You're not the first guy to say that, actually...I just don't see it.  I thought I was kinda too normal-looking back then.  Sorry...we can stop talking about me and my hotness.  I just realized a few hours ago that I was simply irrisistable (lol just kidding) and wanted to share it with the world!!!   SQEE!"
GT920CV,male,16,Ya i forgot my to actually put the title in my first post. See above title for it... Scheme is name of books. SQEE!

SNQI72O,female,16,"oh dear.... sneezing my head off today... it's all thanks to some person who decided to cook lots of curry (im not against any of that, really) and in doing so triggered off my ultra-sensitive nose which caused me to start sneezing as violently as  *achoo* I-*achoo* Wh-*achoo* - at *achoo*, (smth like that) for around 15 minutes. I couldnt even say hello or wave to my aunt and uncle who stepped through the door. ah well. and now, i have a very blocked runny nose and i can STILL smell the curry tho its a much lighter scent now. My aunt didnt even smell it just now! =(. ah well. just got to make do with whatever nose god gives me. lol.   went roller-blading with the odac ppl today.. it was an un-official thing, so like only 5 people turned up... but it was very fun. =). I had insisted on bringing my own blades to east coast, and my mom was trying to persuade me not to, since like i had to go back to school and all after that. but i didnt really care... so i dragged my blades all the way there, to school and all the way home... now, the thing is right, my blades are the older version... you cant clip them nicely with that clip-strap thingy and sling it around or on your shoulders or something. so my mom, being ultimately worried about my back and carrying my blades in a bag or something, made me carry them in my hiking haversack, which resulted in me looking as if i was going hitchhiking or something. quite amusing. everyone at dk were asking me if i was about to fall over backward with my bag strapped to skinny old me. lol. yep.. anw blading wasfun, apart from me falling over twice because i just cant get the hang of going down slopes. *blush*"
SNQI72O,female,16,"[ Rockin' to: ""Jangan Lafazkanlah"" by KRU ]  (yes I actually listen to malay music. =P)  Got the lyrics from bai's lifejournal.

It's really funny how checking out one person's lj leads you onto so many other ppl's ljs and lives. hehe. Going around reading up ppl's ljs without them knowing. hehehe. Sneaky, sneaky.   Okay, notice the blog change in colours and layout. Blogger for revamped, so I thought I might as well make full use of it. lol   Okay, I know I havent updated in quite a while. Shall tell you what happened.   Friday over to Sat was ODAC farewell. Had to rush over to harbourfront after the ks2 meeting at ri. Then found out that I didnt miss much and that the sec 3s were sending us up for a cable car ride! Damn sweet. Took a lot of crappy photos, but the sunset was really beautiful. And we promised we'll take the superstar virgo together someday. haha. Then got changed and went down for dinner at labrador park. Watched the lights twinkle from the ports, and watched superstart virgo leave the harbour. It was so bright and sparkly. Poor haslina wanted to take a photo, but she couldnt get a camera in time. Poor thing. Sec 1s did an awesome job with the decor, I still have my tissue flower which i dipped in scented wax. Very pretty. My most artistic creation yet. haha. Walked back to Labrador Adventure Center, then we showered and went up to their seminar room for presents and skit play thingy. They didnt get our play at all, but the sec 3s caught some of the com positions. haha. Ms chew (yay!) and ms chia (not so yay) came along. Really didnt expect them to be there, and I totally did not expect ms chia to get us presents. Quite sweet of her actually. I really like the earrings and the little firecracker. Exchanged presents, sang a few songs, went outside and did some games thingy, and by the time we went to bed it was about 1 plus in the morning. Then got up at 6.30 and geared up for ropes course. THE SUN WAS SO HOT!! and we were in the sun from 8 to 2. It was horrible. No shade, and the sun didnt let up at all. Belaying people is lots of fun. haha. I really like it. Much more fun than doing the course yourself. I think rapelling is so cool. Ropes course wasn't very spectacular, I think the one at Sing poly was a lot cooler. Still, first time I did the zipline, and I think unhooking people from the zipline after their turn is very fun. haha. Instructor said that she had never cleared 24 people for the zipline in 1 and a half hours. We were THAT good. =P hahaha. But still cuold have improved. They were joking around lots, which wasnt bad actually, just that when it was ms cheryl's turn we messed up somehow. Maybe it was subconcious. hehehe. K bell rang. I shall continue later.   Okay. Back. Now at home, after dinner. Let's see... after ODAC camp, I offered to pay for Siti and my ride back to school for dikir cos I was feeling damn good and hyper. Christl tagged along, and by the time we hailed one, ms cheryl decided to follow so she could take a shower in school. I think we stank up the poor taxi. haha. Had dikir, instructor brought a lot of cool instruments for us to play with. He's very cute in a very little kiddish sort of way.   Okay, KS2 in the next post when I've built up my stamina for another looong post. lol."

OCW41MD,male,15,"So lets talk about the art expo. In a word, you can say it was... lame. It was a glass-fusion, wood carving, sculpture, painting expo. O.o yeah. It was three artists, dont remember their names but who cares, i mean, they sucked! ok lets rate the painings:  Annoying. The guy just grabbed a brush, dipped it in his six color staedler kids paint, splotched a bit on the paper and ""there you have it, its a volcano!"" bleh. and then he folded the paper to make a ""visual effect"" on the art. on the volcano. i mean, come on,  the paintings sucked .     ok now the wooden things. its basically a piece of wood that has een shined out. then you make three little holes: the boobs, and the stomach. then in the holes put a stone in them and it looks like a pregnant person. you know what the worst part is? that  every single wooden carving had the exact same shape !  Then there was this piece of wood that had like writen ""ove, love, lo ve, lo ve?"" written on it. then there was a dick right below it. this was probably the worst thing in the WHOLE exhibition. i mean, i think the guy who wrote this crap really wins the prize.     urlLink http://www.funfreepages.com/prize/yourock.jpg    So what the heck, i realy wrote that on the guest book.     uhm now there comes the glass things. ok its pieces of pearlescent crushed between two glassplateswith different colors. it was generally a triforce with different colors inside a circle. if thats art, well good riddance.     some of the sculptures were cool, but they  were all the typical ""girl coming out of a rock"" thing . there were about 5 of these. if i was gonna make a scuplture, id make batman climbing out of a stone with a hotdog in his hands and name it ""scotch tape"" and it will have a better name than evryone else's art. and i will become leader of the world and paralize you with my lazer beams.     but thats just me."

""um... no ive got an entry card"" (and  i showed a white cardboard paper, with lots of things written on it) ""good... good... take care kid..."" and then he walked on.... so i stayed there looking around (specially at the policemen who were working on a crash, they had been there for around two hours) and then a face popped out of nowhere so i was really scared and.. ""hey, is your uncle in?"" ""yes mom."" and then we walked in to the hospital, while we both saw the drunken cop on the entrancee of the hospital. what an amazing experience. and i talked to him more ""hi im back"" ""hi! hows things outside?"" ""um... the same as it has always been. grandma woke up with a cold today"" ""really?"" ""yea"" and then we both looked at the monitor and then stared outside the room, and didnt talk for a long while.  ""and.. um.."" ""hmm?"" ""sigh"" ""......"" ""......."" ""....................................................................................................................................."" and then my uncle went into the room: ""ok lets go, good bye dad"" ""bye grandpa"" ""bye"" and then i looked at him. I dont think he'll survive the operation thats why im going there on friday.  ARGH where are my hedphones?!? i lended them"
OCW41MD,male,15,"how was my day?  It was sort of... uhm... dissapointing >.  Upon arrival, our graphic design tests were checked. We were supposed to do an animation using whatever method we preferred (frame-by-frame or motion tweening) and so I chose to use frame-by-frame because it was the most suitable one for that type of movie (a jumping robot, which moves every part of its ""body"" [composed by a tin head, a tube and some sort of plate in which it stands]) and what did I get for a grade? 25! (out of one-hundred) YAAAY!  I hate Mr. Escalante he's like the most retarded cripple ever created. And why did i get a 25? because I used the most appropiate way for a particular movie. That what happens when you look too smart for [a cripple] someone. WHAT A FUCKING CRIPPLE... I wish I could just steal his earphone or something [which would be really funny, BTW]  and then, in drawing, the teacher checked out sketch-books. Oh man. you wouldnt believe my grades, they were so bad, and my art teacher thinks im retarded or something... ""This isnt switzerland... how should I know it's not switzerland? I could say this is in africa, the US, costa rica, anywhere!"" ""but there arent any.. alps in those countries?"" ""SHUT UP DONT DISCUSS WITH ME YOUVE GOT 27!!!"" so basically a 27 is a very low low low low low (...) low low low low low grade. >.  Stupid pothead.  Anyways, then I went to french, which was ok, then to lunch, when Max[XD] made me follow him around because he has no friends, and his popularity [his what?] comes from playing paintball [and smelling real bad] Because i had no other choice as to follow him or not, i went and read about fascism. Now I really know what fascism is, and learned that its pretty bad. Oo;.  Then in spanish, um... nothing special, boring as always. I drew a bad face and then listened to more music.

OCW41MD,male,15,"These last months I had being watching the news about the the situation between Mexico and the United States. Like most of you may know the U.S. don't wants to allow people to pass through the border between these to countries. I really comprehend this action made by de U.S. since, among the average foreign Mexican in the U.S., there are drug dealers and people you wouldn't like in you country if you are a straight president with a high and strong moral. The problem I have with them is that they generalize making everyone look like a drug dealer. They complain about us being the ones that sell the cocaine, marijuana, and so on, but I wander who are the stupid that buy it? Where ever you go in California or Texas or any of those states that are close to Mexico, they see you as just another Mexican that came here because, either we cross the border to see what the land of the free is all about or ether because they are so merciful that saw you and saw the misery you were living in your tree house with a roof made out of palm trees' leaves. Mexicans went there because the U.S. crashed Mexican economy with their NAFTA starve-to-death-agreement in the early 90's. Whether you are Brazilian, Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, or Nicaraguan they see you just as another pathetic-ignorant-country-music-lover-Mexican with no right to look at their pair of omnipotent eyes. These discrimination and indifference to latinos irritates us creating a situation just like the one you have with the black people. I wander why is it. Your politicians, they are making a fascist country out of yours and that's because you discriminate, you are afraid of everything that is different from you, black, Latino, Chinese, Indian, all those so called ""minorities"" are just what you are afraid of because they aren't minorities and you know that."

EBOOYY9,male,26,"For a company that prides itself on an intuitive interface, placing the setting that switches between a standard and a military 24 hour clock under ""International"" is pretty unintuitive. Especially when that option was under Date & Time in Classic. Grr.  But I quibble. My transition has been rather smooth. Or rather, forced migration. I'm starting to see support and development drop for Classic applications. (Opera's recent release of the  final  version for Classic sounds pretty ominous).  And I'd be all right switching over, except stinky things like this keep popping up: I can't watch my Rushmore DVD on my  urlLink Lombard  because the OS X DVD player doesn't like my old, creaky machine.

This is a pain in the ass for me, as I'm all the time taking selective screenshots of bits of webpages that I want to include on Boing Boing, then resizing them and converting them to JPEG with ToyViewer, the excellent free NextStep lightweight image-editor. However, ToyViewer can't resize PDFs, and what's more, if I set the default app for opening PDFs to ToyViewer, I won't be able to view actual PDFs properly (and if I don't, I'll have to drag-and-drop every screenshot file onto ToyViewer). I need a lightweight image-editor (resize, crop, convert to JPG or PNG) that can read PDFs. The GIMP is definitely overkill, and Photoslop is hundreds of dollars. Anyone got a reccomendation for a magic image-editor that suits my needs? urlLink Discuss"

Given that the WAP11 passed some packets just fine and only showed problems on some TCP streams, I can easily believe that adding router functionality would change things. Also note that Cory uses a WAP11 with OS X just fine, which indicates that the problem I'm having (and that he is not having) could be network-related, although that is incredibly hard to diagnose. The packet dumps I did showed that WAP11 wasn't receiving some TCP packets in a stream, FWIW."

KCX707Y,female,33,"Planes Trains and Automobiles and Trucks and Subways  Should be the title of my trip. I started off flying to Chicago EARLY Saturday morning and thank you again AFP for driving me to the airport and caring for the Magster. I got into Midway at about 9 AM Central and got picked up by my Ex and Hannah. Went straight to the house and thankfully the truck was already loaded and ready to go. Jumped in and started heading East. Got to my Mom's house in Ohio at about 5:30 PM. Barely had time to have dinner and talk to my brother before I was ready to climb into my old bed for some much needed ZZZzzzzs. Left Mom's Sunday morning at about 9:30. and headed East again. Let me tell you.... PA is a LOOOOOOOONG mo-fo state. It seemed like we were never going to get through it. Somewhere along the way I found out on the cell phone from my Ex that not only had I signed on to drive... she was also expecting me to help unload the stuff at my ex-house on the cape on Monday. So I had THAT to look forward to. So anyway... I never thought I would be so happy to finally see New Jersey. Actually, unlike most of NJ, the part that you enter on RT 80 from PA is quite beautiful. The area is called the Delaware Water Gap. So... after that it was over the Tappan Zee Bridge and through CT on Rt 95 and then the long trek from Providence to the Cape on 195. Actually that's not that far, but because it was the last leg of the trip it seemed like forever. It's really hard to drive a big truck so far. It's not like a car where you can put it in cruise control and kinda zone out. You have to be paying attention every second. I found myself wondering how guys that do long hauls for a living can do it? Anyway... got into Harwich at 12:30 AM and went to sleep as soon as possible. Unfortunately I had to sleep on an air mattress because all the furniture was still in the truck. I could not BELIEVE when my Ex sent the kids to wake me up at 7:30 in the fricken AM! I wanted to cry. I got up and went to work unloading, with one other guy and the kids. I sweated my whatever off until about noon and then I had enough. I could have gotten a ride home from her friend if I had stayed until the night time, but I REALLY wanted to get back to KA and I knew she had some other people coming over later to help bring the boxes and small stuff in from the lawn. So... I drove the truck to where it needed to be dropped off in Hyannis and had her drop me off at the bus station. I ran into my old roommate from right after I got separated at the restaraunt near the bus station and it was very cool to see him. The bus ride to South station was nice. Very comfy and I took a nap. Then the Red line to the Green Line to North Station and the train home. I keep thinking... if only I had taken a boat and rode a camel, I would have covered all bases this weekend. Respectfully submitted, Butterchunk"

I'm sure you remember Dan and Nancy and Kathy and Steve that used to hang out at the pool all the time... They were all convinced that KA is definitely haunted. Kathy said the elevator used to always open whenever she would walk out into the hallway and the others said their cats used to freak out all of a sudden for no apparent reason. My girlfriend at the time was there and it freaked her out so much that she didn't want to sleep over for a couple of days.   Oh by the way... thanks for turning me on to the band Soulive.

FNQHN2Y,female,17,"Well, screw the normal, good shit. It all just got ruined.  Oh blah blah, I'm being dramatic...right.  You can not imagine you FREAKIN' ANGRY I AM.  God...but, this time, I have no one to be angry at but myself. I did this to myself, because I freaking suck and now I get to deal with the consequences. GOD, WHY?!?  I hate it...I'm in this infallible good mood, and I walk in the door, and bam. It's like...couldn't the news wait for when things sucked?  65. That's all I have to say. 65. SIXTY FREAKIN' FIVE!!  Screw it screw it. That's life, and it's my fault.  Well, now that I'm on this whole ranting thing...I'll just let it out.  You know what I hate? When people feel the need to announce to the world that THEY DON'T LIKE YOU. Guess what? No one gives a shit. I don't care who doesn't like me, unless they have a valid reason. But the truth...no one ever has a truly valid reason for hating anyone. Because the only people that give them reason to hate, they cling to. People are so weak. You hate the people you hardly know, that you never will know. Then what is this desire to announce it? My god, if I don't like someone, I don't go telling everyone. Stupid, childish little games people play. Oh well, only little people play little games, so that says alot for anyone who this so consequently refers to. No one in particular...everyone. Because every fool does it. I think it's pretty obvious when someone doesn't like me, but I prefer the demeanor of acting completely oblivious to it. ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.""  Some people have no strategy in life. No account of their actions, not a whim as to how what they do will affect who they will become- where their successes (or lack thereof) will unveil. For most of you, I wish nothing but failure. Note that most people I wish such failure upon are probably too ignorant to read this anyway, so I suppose chances are, if you're reading this, then no harm done, all the more power to you. But to those of you who show no regard for your actions...please. Get a head on your fucking shoulders, grow up just a little bit quicker, and lose your ego/attitude/demeanor or whatever it is that makes you such a fucking dumbass.  Ughh, now I'm stressed. This is overwhelming. God, I want to throw up.  Well on to more ranting, since, well...Oh, I suppose I'll get over it. Pick up my pride and all the pieces that have shattered, and I'll get it over with. But for now, I just need to be really really pissed off.  You know what else I hate?  People who only come and go with your emotions. Not all...just the ones who are only there when you are at your lowest. I don't understand why people see those people as such blessings. Why do we feel so damn grateful for people who are there to support us when we fall down? That come to our side (though never in any other occasion) and guide us through our dark moments. They offer an ear, their advice, their support, when we are in trouble/trauma/drama...  God, I hate those people. No one sees it...they just feed off of your weaknesses. Something inside them enjoys lifting you up, like they're some sort of hero. Everyone just wants to be important, and heroic. Please. Go save a fucking whale. They're like crutches. People who make it seem as though you NEED their words, their support and commitment to you, to make it through. But as soon as you're alright (sooner than later, people have such shifty moods...and drama is a facade that drifts in and out on a whim of attention), they disappear. Leave you to your lives as normal...they basically don't give a shit unless you're miserable. Stand on your own two feet, believe me, you'll need them if you ever want to walk alone.  Then again, how few people can actually perform such a feat. To walk on one's own is..unimaginable. Because everyone has a crutch. Most people enjoy the comfort and support of a crowd, of their drama-heroes.  Stand on your own. Don't praise the people who wipe your tears, but never share in your laughter. They're dark, mental, twisted fools who will never make much of themselves, but rather, feed off of the sadness of other.  I suppose, all in all, my only complaint, really, besides (65) is that people are weak, foolish, blind, oblivious....oh and really blatantly stupid.  It's all people. People people people. Ughh. Okay, it's not all people...it's just the ones who get in my way. And not all who I cross paths with...just the ones who can't think on their own or grow up or something.  Yarghh. whyyyyy???  Okay okay okay...I'm sorry, I'm not so cheerful, not like I was this morning or this afternoon or this evening or right before I walked in the door.  Alright I work tomorrow.

Life will seem to you, later, not a lesser, but a greater thing.  D. H. Lawrence   Hmm...it's like all my thoughts on religion put quite simply into words.   If you can't have faith in what is held up to you for faith, you must find things to believe in yourself, for a life without faith in something is too narrow a space to live.  George E. Woodberry   How true.   People ask for criticism, but they only want praise.  W. Somerset Maugham   And will I EVER agree to that statement.   I can remember when the air was clean and sex was dirty.  George Burns   BAH HAH. Quite humorous.   Assert your right to make a few mistakes. If people can't accept your imperfections, that's their fault.  Dr. David M. Burns   I am careful not to confuse excellence with perfection. Excellence, I can reach for; perfection is God's business.  Michael J.

I've gotten a T-shirt, some golf balls, stickers, coupons for free food, ect.   I had signed up for a free Bavaria Beer T-shirt that was posted there - just got an email from them that ""we've been spammed or hacked"" - that they expected 200-300 requests, but got 27000.  First 500 to reply to the email would get a t-shirt.  I was too late, despite the fact that I got the email 15 minutes before I clicked the link.  I had a similar experience with Nike two years ago with a free golf ball offer that was supposed to be opened only to people who got mailers - but had a sign up form on the net.  They, too, sent an angry letter out to people who signed up and basically accused them of hacking.  Companies need to realize that once something gets posted on the net, it spreads fast.  Witness chain letters, news on blogs, the ""slashdot effect"" (websites posted on the popular tech site Slashdot frequenly get so much traffic that the servers crash).  This is the internet, where word of free stuff spreads fast, and when all that someone has to do is fill out a web form, people will, because they are cheap and like free stuff. If you don't want to get pretty much every person with a computer to sing up for your promotion, find a way to restrict people - require a one-time code, first x number, password protect it, ect.  But don't accuse me of hacking because I signed up for something that was publically accessible.  It makes you sound stupid and non-net-savy.

CQTO34O,male,23,"I got a letter from the John Kerry/Democratic National committee today.  It starts out in the second paragraph that they ""know how hard you have already worked to prepare our Party for victory in 2004"".   WTF?  I've never given to any political campaigns (yet - I keep saying I'll kick in a few bucks for Bush eventually) and I'm a registered Republican.  And I write a blog with a giant ""days until the election Bush/Cheney"" counter on the side, but I can't expect the DNC to know that.  The funny thing is this is the second Democrat fundraising letter I've gotten.  The first was a far more left-wing one - I think it was written by Barbara Boxer - and it was filled with some pretty strong ""Bush is the worst president ever and is destroying America"" drivel.  If you are a die-hard dem, it may be exactly what you want to hear, but if you are a die-hard Republican it makes you dislike them more, and I can't imagine swing voters like it either.  The DNC letter is pretty calm - it's got the usual stuff about evil HMO's, destroying ANWAR, and defending civil liberties, but that's to be expected, and it's politics.  I did get one letter from the Republicans a while ago, none since.    I can't help wonder how I got on the DNC's list - it seems like they would get it from voter rolls, and a guy who is a registered Republican in a city that's 90% democrat doesn't seem like a candidate for donating.   I've always disliked untargeted marketing.  It always strikes me as odd that companies supposedly know everything about everyone, but their marketing is always untargeted - ie all the credit card ads I get in the mail stress low interest rates and balance transfers, even though I have never carried a balance.  You think with all the info out there, the Dems could at least figure out who their party faithful is - and if they aren't sure who is who, they might want to send out a middle-of-the road, swing-voter-oriented plea to those who they aren't sure, and keep the party faithful stuff for the people who definitly are party faithful."

I'm not sure I really count as a young person anymore, although I was not too long ago, and I'm not sure about his analysis - the college kids I know still do a ton of binge drinking.  But there are some interesting stats, one of the most interesting being that half of college students now consider themselves conservative, twice as many as in the 70's.  I wonder if part of this has less to do with cultural shifts and more to do with the fact that people are going to college in larger numbers to study useful stuff like accounting and computer science, and actually hope to get good jobs instead of becoming poor grad students.

CQTO34O,male,23,"I don't watch a lot of news-based programs on TV.  I used to be glued to FOX news, and I used to be a huge O'Reilly fan.  I kind of grew out of it.  O'Reilly is entertaining, but he tends to bend facts to suit him and be mean to his guests, and I kind of got tired of it.  I also bought a  urlLink RePlay TV , and thus my days of flipping through channels for something to watch and settling on FOX News are over - if I want to watch something, I usually have about 20 hours of Law and Order reruns waiting for me.  I've also tended to get more of my news from the internet, and most of my analysis from blogs.  There is one exception - a news analysis show that I make a point of recording - the Dennis Miller Show on CNBC.  It's funny, I like Dennis' politics - hard on terrorism, softer on social issues - and it frequently has guests who are bloggers or writers for online magazines (Cathy Siepp, Hugh Hewitt, writers from NRO, Manhattan institute, the weekly standard, ect).  Every now and then, though, I will hear someone say something that is totally incorrect, and I wish the show was like a blog, where when someone makes a wrong statement, you can email them, or post in the comments with a link.  One I remember from a while ago was someone describing the no-fly list as ""obviously it's a list of people who are not permitted to fly"".  But it's not - it's a list of people  urlLink subject to additional scruitiny before flying .  Another one was on Thursday's show, where Bill Press was on the Varsity Panel.  He said that the 9/11 report reflected badly on Bush because ""he got this memo on August 6 that the terrorists were going to crash planes into buildings in New York and didn't do anything to it"". This was unrebutted by Miller, who made a comment about Clinton not doing anything either.  But it seems like a pretty glaring error since the memo  urlLink said nothing of that sort .  It did say in two places that New York was a potential target, and it also talks about a plot to hijack airliners  in 1998 . That plot was to release hostages, which is a very different thing than what actually happened.  During a hijacking, people act exactly how the pilots on 9/11 act - like the target is the plane, not that the plane is a weapon.  Yes, there is stuff about planes and buildings, but nothing about flying the former into the latter.  How was Bush supposed to connect a 3 year old plot and some people in NY taking pictures (which turned out to be  urlLink Yemini Tourists )to what actually happened.  Anyway, that's what I like about blogs - it's easy to point out and refute lies or truth-twisting - something that is much harder in movies and TV.

CQTO34O,male,23,"urlLink Unconventional Wisdom  links to  urlLink this article on the possibility of the Amish becoming a large voting block. .  The article is interesting, but even more interesting is this money quote from a Democratic spokesman:   If I know Republicans and their grass-roots operations, they'll spend most of their time trying to phone bank the Amish,"" said Kerry spokesman Mark Nevins.   I'm going to give Mark Nevins the benfit of the doubt and assume he's intellegent enought to realize that the Amish don't use phones. So I'm guessing what he is saying is that the Republicans are too dumb to figure that out.  Gee, thanks Mark.  Very nuanced."
CQTO34O,male,23,"I've been at my parent's house in New Jersey the last couple days for the 4th of July holiday.  Lots of firecrackers going off, which is amasing since fireworks are highly illegal in New Jersey.  Of course, all the people setting them off will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, right?  Of course not.  Which begs the question: if you are going to have something that is illegal, but pretty much tollerated with a wink and a nod, why make it illegal at all?  All you do is turn law abiding people into criminals and prevent some people from doing something they want to because it's illegal.  There are two reasons to ban fireworks - public safety and annoyance.  On the first, I think people should be responsible enough to decide for themselves if they want to take the risk.  I find fireworks going off at 4 in the morn rather annoying, but there are usually zoning/noise ordinances to deal with that.'  Of course, this wink and nod illegallity exists in a ton of places - underage drinking, drugs, guns, and speeding.  All areas I wish there was a little more public freedom and a lot less half-assed government control.  Half-assed policing of things lots of people engage in means that a few people get punished for things that most people do."
CQTO34O,male,23,"OpinionJournal has a brief mention of  urlLink Formula one racing in Nascar country  that includes the quote  When you're selling tickets or trying to get ratings, your whole life depends on the guy who lives on the south side of St. Louis who's sitting there drinking a beer on a Sunday afternoon,"" Mr. Wheeler told the Virginian-Pilot. ""He's run a backhoe all week. He wants people he can associate with. . . . Guys with big heads and big hands and big feet .  So now Americans aren't just inferior to Europeans for the rest of our cultural gaffes - supporting democracy over tyranny, not traveling to enough foreign countries, not having a socialist government that mandates 2 months of vacation or free health care - but also for prefering NASCAR to Formula 1.  I admit, I don't understand the appeal of NASCAR.  I don't really watch much racing at all, and cars making only right turns for several hours isn't exactly my idea of fun. But except for occasionally making left turns, and having drivers with names that are hard to pronouce, I don't really see anything superior about F1/IRL/et al.  If I'm going to watch any motorsports, give me rally or LeMans style endurance - those are people with true driving skill, and they are exciting and entertaining to watch.  Rally drivers will get all kinds of sideways and do things you didn't know a car could do, and 24-hour racing requires huge amounts of human and mechanical stamina. - plus cars frequently blow up in spectacular ways.  However, I take issue with the Bubba stereotype of the NASCAR fan.  I know a handful of NASCAR fans, and most of them are educated professionals - engineers, accountants, insurance reps, ect.  If  urlLink this chart  is correct, the average NASCAR fan makes more than the average American.  This would seem to suggest that most NASCAR fans are not backhoe driving Bubbas, but it seems people can't resist the urge to paint Americans - especially Americans who live in the South and like racin' - as ignorant."

JOOKQHC,female,23,"urlLink Miss. L  has come up with a brilliant idea to avoid post-breakup phone calls:  “I got an idea for a website. Two, actually: ""dontcallhim.com"" and ""dontcallher.com"" You go there, and read a manifesto on why you should not call the person you want to call but shouldn't (like your ex). The original idea came when my friend Jeremy got three calls in one night from a girl he'd JUST started dating and I said ""Dude, she shouldn't call you, she should call me, and I'll tell her why she shouldn't call you."" (The original idea was for operators to be standing by to tell people how to play their current romantic situation. 1-900-LUVADVICE.) But back to the website: maybe there would be little tabs you could click on that corresponded to your situation. ""Because he's an asshole"", ""Because of that restraining order"", ""Because it's only been twenty minutes"", ""Because you already left her three messages."" Etc.”"
